"So that's a bit tricky that, doing it that way, you've got one over one hundredth ."
"The, the easy way, do you like fractions on the bottom of fractions?"
No.
"Oh, times by  ah."
What are you going to times it by?
Times that by ten over one.
"No, times that by a thousand over one."

Well they've had long enough to do it!
And this recession that we've been coming out of for so many years now it's  I mean it's just turned into a bit of a joke!

And he was obviously  really furious that  I'd said that .
"And I thought, yeah well I know I'd be cross if  someone said to that me but I don't give a toss actually ."
You should suggest that he join
Dateline and  he sounds awful
"We'll, we'll put him on Blind Date."

"If you just say  erm  a group of parcels  er er, in one load that's not enough  cos it can be"
Yeah I know.
part of a load.
I missed out the from address to address.

"That you're not just in isolation, looking at one little thing, because you can miss a lot."
"Erm you might think that all graphs always look like that, or bits of graphs are always like that, or where does it all tie in?"

Like I do.
That's a quite nice little  place there.
And you don't pay over the odds prices because it's not an expensive place to  have your shop.
Oh.
That's good.
You go to these big stores and they pay so much in heating and lighting and staff .
This er pavement's quite nice  .
Isn't it attractively done?
Done like parquet.
Don't know who's paying for it all  whether  council is  or what?
So do you want to go over there first?
It's up to you.
What do you want to do?
I don't mind a bit.
"Well we've got fifteen minutes, well thirteen minutes."
Beautiful cakes.
Fruit crumble.
Yeah.
The first book on the left there Dave by the big fat volume that's called
"To, to the left of your, your omnibus."
That's it.
Ta.
Where?
Wha what do we want a project engineer to do?
I want him to do an M S two or three .
What do we want him to do?
Come on.
.
Manage that project.
Through from conception to completion.
Un unfortunately it raises the question of the project coordinator whose role
Mm.
Mm.
talk to you about you know ne next week
Mm.
because it's all rolled into the same thing.
Right.
I say it's
Shall we leave it till then?
responsibility.
Right.
"Let, let us leave it till then because I mean otherwise we're gonna get bogged down in this and whe when we really are briefing procedures."
Yeah.
But you've raised a very valid point and it's one that we need to see through to the end.
I can s I can see
The role o of
I can see what you're driving at.
the role of a project engineer is defined in Q S P six.
Which Roger hasn't seen yet
The speed is increasing.
Sort of
Stop.
"sort of actually stops, and then it's going very slowly again for a bit, and then what happens here?"
"very, it just goes very fast"
Right.
"in a very short space of time then, but then carries on."
Very short space of time it's gone quite a distance.
"So that was a, that is at, that constant speed there is much faster than, than this one."
"And then, it's stationary"
It's
for a while.
And then
Just goes down there.
What's happening here?
Deceleration.
"Well let's make, let's make this bit a straight line, from there to about there."
That's a straight line.
"So, well let's go back to the physics."
We've just been going on timing it for one minute or something.
"And we time it again, one minute and one second"
It's reversed.
It's reversed.
How far away was it when I started the watch?
Thirty metres away.
"How, how far is it after another one second?"
Twenty metres away.
Ah.
Ah!
It's coming back.
Okay.
So that's going backwards.
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
says he .
`` This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk ; and I hae nae trokings * wi ' night-hawks .
What brings ye here ?
I have a blunderbush . ''
* Dealings .
"`` Is that yoursel ' , Mr. Balfour ? ''"
"returned Alan , stepping back and looking up into the darkness ."
`` Have a care of that blunderbuss ; they 're nasty things to burst . ''
`` What brings ye here ?
and whae are ye ? ''
"says my uncle , angrily ."
"`` I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side , '' said Alan ; `` but what brings me here is another story , being more of your affair than mine ; and if ye 're sure it 's what ye would like , I 'll set it to a tune and sing it to you . ''"
`` And what is ` t ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` David , '' says Alan ."
`` What was that ? ''
"cried my uncle , in a mighty changed voice ."
"`` Shall I give ye the rest of the name , then ? ''"
said Alan .
"There was a pause ; and then , `` I 'm thinking I 'll better let ye in , '' says my uncle , doubtfully ."
"`` I dare say that , '' said Alan ; `` but the point is , Would I go ?"
Now I will tell you what I am thinking .
"I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business ; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever ; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel ' , and a gentleman of better family . ''"
"This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer ; he was a little while digesting it , and then says he , `` Weel , weel , what must be must , '' and shut the window ."
"But it took him a long time to get down-stairs , and a still longer to undo the fastenings , repenting -LRB- I dare say -RRB- and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar ."
"At last , however , we heard the creak of the hinges , and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and -LRB- seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two -RRB- sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands ."
"`` And , now '' says he , `` mind I have my blunderbush , and if ye take a step nearer ye 're as good as deid . ''"
"`` And a very civil speech , '' says Alan , `` to be sure . ''"
"`` Na , '' says my uncle , `` but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding , and I 'm bound to be prepared ."
"And now that we understand each other , ye 'll can name your business . ''"
"`` Why , '' says Alan , `` you that are a man of so much understanding , will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman ."
"My name has nae business in my story ; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull , of which ye will have heard ."
"I should think you ought to be able to , with that imagination you 're always talking of . ''"
"`` But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things , '' said Anne , cuddling Davy ."
`` There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more . ''
"In the end Davy was sent to bed , as usual , there to remain until noon next day ."
"He evidently did some thinking , for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly ."
"Going in , she found him sitting up in bed , with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands ."
"`` Anne , '' he said solemnly , `` is it wrong for everybody to tell whop ... falsehoods ?"
I want to know ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed . ''"
`` Is it wrong for a grown-up person ? ''
`` Yes . ''
"`` Then , '' said Davy decidedly , `` Marilla is bad , for SHE tells them ."
"And she 's worse 'n me , for I did n't know it was wrong but she does . ''"
"`` Davy Keith , Marilla never told a story in her life , '' said Anne indignantly ."
`` She did so .
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I did n't say my prayers every night .
"And I have n't said them for over a week , just to see what would happen ... and nothing has , '' concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone ."
"Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal , and then earnestly set about saving Marilla 's reputation ."
"`` Why , Davy Keith , '' she said solemnly , `` something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day . ''"
Davy looked sceptical .
"`` I s ` pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper , '' he said scornfully , `` but THAT is n't dreadful ."
"Course , I do n't like it , but I 've been sent to bed so much since I come here that I 'm getting used to it ."
"And you do n't save anything by making me go without supper either , for I always eat twice as much for breakfast . ''"
`` I do n't mean your being sent to bed .
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today .
"And , Davy , '' ... Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit ... `` for a boy to tell what is n't true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him ... almost the very worst ."
So you see Marilla told you the truth . ''
"`` But I thought the something bad would be exciting , '' protested Davy in an injured tone ."
`` Marilla is n't to blame for what you thought .
Bad things are n't always exciting .
They 're very often just nasty and stupid . ''
"`` It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well , though , '' said Davy , hugging his knees ."
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"He rushed to Anne , hurled himself into her lap , flung his arms around her neck , and burst into tears ."
"`` I did n't know it was wrong to tell whoppers , '' he sobbed ."
`` How did you expect me to know it was wrong ?
"All Mr. Sprott 's children told them REGULAR every day , and cross their hearts too ."
"I s ` pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I 've been trying awful hard to be as good as him , but now I s ` pose you 'll never love me again ."
But I think you might have told me it was wrong .
"I 'm awful sorry I 've made you cry , Anne , and I 'll never tell a whopper again . ''"
Davy buried his face in Anne 's shoulder and cried stormily .
"Anne , in a sudden glad flash of understanding , held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla ."
"`` He did n't know it was wrong to tell falsehoods , Marilla ."
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what is n't true again . ''
"`` I never will , now that I know it 's bad , '' asseverated Davy between sobs ."
"`` If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can ... '' Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance ... `` you can skin me alive , Anne . ''"
"`` Do n't say ` whopper , ' Davy ... say ` falsehood , ' '' said the schoolma'am ."
`` Why ? ''
"queried Davy , settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained , investigating face ."
`` Why ai n't whopper as good as falsehood ?
I want to know .
It 's just as big a word . ''
`` It 's slang ; and it 's wrong for little boys to use slang . ''
"`` There 's an awful lot of things it 's wrong to do , '' said Davy with a sigh ."
`` I never s ` posed there was so many .
"I 'm sorry it 's wrong to tell whop ... falsehoods , 'cause it 's awful handy , but since it is I 'm never going to tell any more ."
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time ?
I want to know . ''
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla .
"`` I do n't want to be too hard on the child , '' said Marilla ."
"`` I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies , and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him ."
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you could n't expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct .
I suppose we 'll just have to assume he does n't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning .
"But he 'll have to be punished for shutting Dora up , and I ca n't think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we 've done that so often ."
"Ca n't you suggest something else , Anne ?"
"Some of them quite costly , too ; that is , they will cost me something , but I know I 'll be better off and richer after I 've paid the price ."
"That is what Mr. Grierson would call a paradox , is n't it ?"
I 'll explain all about it to you on Christmas Day . ''
"On Christmas Day , Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy 's ."
"It was a faded brown Christmas after all , for the snow had not come ."
But Clorinda did not mind ; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned .
She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor before she went into the sitting room .
"Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire , and Clorinda sat down beside her ."
"`` I 've come to tell you all about it , '' she said ."
Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own .
"`` From your face , dear girl , it will be pleasant hearing and telling , '' she said ."
Clorinda nodded .
"`` Aunt Emmy , I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy ."
"And then one evening it just came to me , without any thinking at all , and I knew that I could give some gifts after all ."
I thought of something new every day for a week .
"At first I did n't think I could give some of them , and then I thought how selfish I was ."
"I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it , but I was n't willing to pay what I had ."
"I got over that , though , Aunt Emmy ."
Now I 'm going to tell you what I did give .
"`` First , there was my teacher , Miss Mitchell ."
I gave her one of father 's books .
"I have so many of his , you know , so that I would n't miss one ; but still it was one I loved very much , and so I felt that that love made it worth while ."
"That is , I felt that on second thought ."
"At first , Aunt Emmy , I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book , worn with much reading and all marked over with father 's notes and pencillings ."
I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present .
And yet somehow it seemed to me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed -- that old book which father had loved and which I loved .
"So I gave it to her , and she understood ."
"I think it pleased her so much , the real meaning in it ."
She said it was like being given something out of another 's heart and life .
"`` Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope , my dear Sunday School teacher ."
"She married a home missionary , and they are in a lonely part of the west ."
"Well , I wrote her a letter ."
"`` I take care of myself and Boo , and she looks after you ."
The house goes any way . ''
`` I should think so !
I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall to-night .
What is it there for ? ''
Molly laughed .
"`` That 's the joke , sir , Miss Bat is cleaning house , and I 'm sure it needs cleaning , for it is years since it was properly done ."
I thought you might have told her to . ''
`` I 've said nothing .
Do n't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it .
I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint .
Is she going to upset the whole place ? ''
"asked Mr. Bemis , looking alarmed at the prospect ."
"`` I hope so , for I really am ashamed when people come , to have them see the dust and cobwebs , and old carpets and dirty windows , '' said Molly , with a sigh , though she never had cared a bit till lately ."
"`` Why do n't you dust round a little , then ?"
No time to spare from the books and play ? ''
"`` I tried , father , but Miss Bat did n't like it , and it was too hard for me alone ."
"If things were once in nice order , I think I could keep them so ; for I do want to be neat , and I 'm learning as fast as I can . ''"
"`` It is high time someone took hold , if matters are left as you say ."
"I 've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was , to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town , and wondering what I could give the old lady ."
"Now I find you are the one to be thanked , and it is a very pleasant surprise to me . ''"
"`` Give her the present , please ; I 'm satisfied , if you like what I 've done ."
"It is n't much , and I did n't know as you would ever observe any difference ."
"But I did try , and now I guess I 'm really getting on , '' said Molly , sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks , for she , too , found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes ."
"`` You certainly are , my dear ."
"I 'll wait till the house-cleaning is over , and then , if we are all alive , I 'll see about Miss Bat 's reward ."
"Meantime , you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need , and send the bills to me ; '' and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar , as if that matter was settled ."
"`` Oh , thank you , sir !"
That will be splendid .
"Merry always has pretty things , and I know you will like me when I get fixed , '' said Molly , smoothing down her apron , with a little air ."
`` Seems to me you look very well as you are .
Is n't that a pretty enough frock ? ''
"`` It is the ruin of this kind land , '' a woman said ."
"`` If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . ''"
"`` If they live , '' returned the woman , `` that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? ''"
"`` They can not better die than for their natural lord , '' said Dick ."
"`` No natural lord of mine , '' said the man in the smock ."
"`` I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas ."
And now I must side with Brackley !
It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ?
"But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver -- that knows more of law than honesty -- I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him !"
-- the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . ''
"`` Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , '' answered Dick , `` to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel ."
But King Harry -- praised be the saints !
"-- has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained ."
"And as for Sir Daniel , y ' are very brave behind his back ."
But I will be no tale-bearer ; and let that suffice . ''
"`` I say no harm of you , Master Richard , '' returned the peasant ."
"`` Y ' are a lad ; but when ye come to a man 's inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket ."
"I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel 's neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! ''"
"`` Clipsby , '' said Richard , `` you speak what I can not hear with honour ."
"Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . ''"
"`` Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? ''"
returned Clipsby .
`` On whose side is Sir Daniel ? ''
"`` I know not , '' said Dick , colouring a little ; for his guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of that period , and every change had brought him some increase of fortune ."
"`` Ay , '' returned Clipsby , `` you , nor no man ."
"For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . ''"
"Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron , and the party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping -- a brown-faced , grizzled fellow , heavy of hand and grim of mien , armed with sword and spear , a steel salet on his head , a leather jack upon his body ."
"He was a great man in these parts ; Sir Daniel 's right hand in peace and war , and at that time , by his master 's interest , bailiff of the hundred ."
"`` Clipsby , '' he shouted , `` off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate ."
Bowyer will give you jack and salet .
We must ride before curfew .
"cried I. `` Rum , '' he repeated ."
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
"I ran to fetch it , but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and I broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while I was still getting in my own way , I heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor ."
"At the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me ."
Between us we raised his head .
"He was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour ."
"`` Dear , deary me , '' cried my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !"
And your poor father sick ! ''
"In the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger ."
"I got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron ."
"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in , on his visit to my father ."
"`` Oh , doctor , '' we cried , `` what shall we do ?"
Where is he wounded ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
said the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
"The man has had a stroke , as I warned him ."
"Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it ."
"For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''"
"When I got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain 's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm ."
It was tattooed in several places .
"`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it -- done , as I thought , with great spirit ."
"`` Prophetic , '' said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger ."
"`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood ."
"Jim , '' he said , `` are you afraid of blood ? ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein ."
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
"First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved ."
"But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''"
`` Never mind .
Please push up my table .
"I must write a letter , and I want you to post it for me to-night , and never say a word till I give you leave . ''"
"`` Oh , now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious , and get into a mess , are you ? ''"
"and Frank looked down at her with a suspicious air , though he was intensely curious to know what she was about ."
`` Go away till I 'm done .
"You will have to see the outside , but you ca n't know the inside till the answer comes ; '' and propping herself up , Jill wrote the following note , with some hesitation at the beginning and end , for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing , except by sight , and it was rather awkward : -- `` Robert Walker ."
"`` Dear Sir , I want to ask if Jack Minot came to see you last Friday afternoon ."
He got into trouble being seen with Jerry Shannon .
He paid him some money .
"Jack wo n't tell , and Mr. Acton talked to him about it before all the school ."
"We feel bad , because we think Jack did not do wrong ."
"I do n't know as you have anything to do with it , but I thought I 'd ask ."
Please answer quick .
"Respectfully yours , `` Jane Pecq '' To make sure that her despatch was not tampered with , Jill put a great splash of red sealing-wax on it , which gave it a very official look , and much impressed Bob when he received it ."
`` There !
"Go and post it , and do n't let any one see or know about it , '' she said , handing it over to Frank , who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand ."
"When his eye fell on the address , he laughed , and said in a teasing way , -- `` Are you and Bob such good friends that you correspond ?"
What will Jack say ? ''
"`` Do n't know , and do n't care !"
"Be good , now , and let 's have a little secret as well as other folks ."
"I 'll tell you all about it when he answers , '' said Jill in her most coaxing tone ."
`` Suppose he does n't ? ''
`` Then I shall send you up to see him .
"I must know something , and I want to do it myself , if I can . ''"
`` Look here ; what are you after ?
"I do believe you think -- '' Frank got no farther , for Jill gave a little scream , and stopped him by crying eagerly , `` Do n't say it out loud !"
"I really do believe it may be , and I 'm going to find out . ''"
`` What made you think of him ? ''
"and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter , as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that Jill 's quick wits had jumped at ."
`` Come here and I 'll tell you . ''
"Holding him by one button , she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim , with a look at the rug , -- `` No !"
"She could run faster than Anne , who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt , and soon overtook her ."
Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison 's heart when he should see it .
"`` Anne , for mercy 's sake , stop , '' panted poor Diana ."
`` I 'm right out of breath and you are wet to the skin . ''
"`` I must ... get ... that cow ... out ... before ... Mr. Harrison ... sees her , '' gasped Anne ."
`` I do n't ... care ... if I 'm ... drowned ... if we ... can ... only ... do that . ''
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground .
No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field .
"`` Head her off , '' screamed Anne ."
"`` Run , Diana , run . ''"
Diana did run .
"Anne tried to , and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed ."
"Privately , Diana thought she was ."
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane .
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment .
"Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane , wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody and his son , both of whom wore a broad smile ."
"`` I guess you 'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week , Anne , '' chuckled Mr. Shearer ."
"`` I 'll sell her to you now , if you want her , '' said her flushed and disheveled owner ."
`` You may have her this very minute . ''
`` Done .
"I 'll give you twenty for her as I offered before , and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody ."
She 'll go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening .
Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow . ''
"Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road , and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars ."
`` What will Marilla say ? ''
asked Diana .
"`` Oh , she wo n't care ."
Dolly was my own cow and it is n't likely she 'd bring more than twenty dollars at the auction .
"But oh dear , if Mr. Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again , and after my giving him my word of honor that I 'd never let it happen !"
"Well , it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows ."
A cow that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence could n't be trusted anywhere . ''
"Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde 's , and when she returned knew all about Dolly 's sale and transfer , for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest ."
"Finally Mr. Barry shook his head , with a relieved air ."
`` She ca n't be down there .
"It 's a mighty curious thing where she could have got to , though ."
"Look here , young man , are you sure you 've no idea where your sister is ? ''"
"`` I 've told you a dozen times that I have n't , '' said Davy , with an injured air ."
`` Maybe a tramp come and stole her . ''
"`` Nonsense , '' said Marilla sharply , relieved from her horrible fear of the well ."
"`` Anne , do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr. Harrison 's ?"
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over . ''
"`` I ca n't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I 'll go over and see , '' said Anne ."
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face .
"He quietly slipped off the gate and ran , as fast as his fat legs could carry him , to the barn ."
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind .
"The house was locked , the window shades were down , and there was no sign of anything living about the place ."
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly .
"Ginger , in the kitchen behind her , shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness ; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a toolhouse ."
"Anne flew to the door , unhasped it , and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg ."
"`` Oh , Dora , Dora , what a fright you have given us !"
How came you to be here ? ''
"`` Davy and I came over to see Ginger , '' sobbed Dora , `` but we could n't see him after all , only Davy made him swear by kicking the door ."
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door ; and I could n't get out .
"I cried and cried , I was frightened , and oh , I 'm so hungry and cold ; and I thought you 'd never come , Anne . ''"
`` Davy ? ''
But Anne could say no more .
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart .
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy 's behavior .
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned .
But Davy had told falsehoods ... downright coldblooded falsehoods about it .
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it .
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment .
She had grown to love Davy dearly ... how dearly she had not known until this minute ... and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood .
Marilla listened to Anne 's tale in a silence that boded no good Davy-ward ; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with .
"I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island ."
"`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters ."
"Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself ."
"But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet ."
"You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?"
No ?
"Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . ''"
"`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . ''"
"All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature ."
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
"`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? ''"
he repeated .
"`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? ''"
"`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply ."
"`` And right you was , '' he cried ."
"`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? ''"
"`` Jim , '' I told him ."
"`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently ."
"`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of ."
"Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered ."
"`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious ."
"And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another ."
"And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones !"
"That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !"
But it were Providence that put me here .
"I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety ."
"You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have ."
"I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to ."
"And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . ''"
"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich !"
`` The first week in June was another dreadful one .
"The Austrians seemed just on the point of overrunning Italy : and then came the first awful news of the Battle of Jutland , which the Germans claimed as a great victory ."
Susan was the only one who carried on .
"` You need never tell me that the Kaiser has defeated the British Navy , ' she said , with a contemptuous sniff ."
` It is all a German lie and that you may tie to . '
"And when a couple of days later we found out that she was right and that it had been a British victory instead of a British defeat , we had to put up with a great many ' I told you so 's , ' but we endured them very comfortably ."
`` It took Kitchener 's death to finish Susan .
For the first time I saw her down and out .
We all felt the shock of it but Susan plumbed the depths of despair .
The news came at night by ` phone but Susan would n't believe it until she saw the Enterprise headline the next day .
"She did not cry or faint or go into hysterics ; but she forgot to put salt in the soup , and that is something Susan never did in my recollection ."
"Mother and Miss Oliver and I cried but Susan looked at us in stony sarcasm and said , ` The Kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving ."
So the world is not left wholly desolate .
"Why cry , Mrs. Dr. dear ? '"
"Susan continued in this stony , hopeless condition for twenty-four hours , and then Cousin Sophia appeared and began to condole with her . ''"
"` This is terrible news , ai n't it , Susan ?"
We might as well prepare for the worst for it is bound to come .
"You said once -- and well do I remember the words , Susan Baker -- that you had complete confidence in God and Kitchener ."
"Ah well , Susan Baker , there is only God left now . '"
`` Whereat Cousin Sophia put her handkerchief to her eyes pathetically as if the world were indeed in terrible straits .
"As for Susan , Cousin Sophia was the salvation of her ."
She came to life with a jerk . ''
"` Sophia Crawford , hold your peace ! '"
she said sternly .
` You may be an idiot but you need not be an irreverent idiot .
It is no more than decent to be weeping and wailing because the Almighty is the sole stay of the Allies now .
"As for Kitchener , his death is a great loss and I do not dispute it ."
But the outcome of this war does not depend on one man 's life and now that the Russians are coming on again you will soon see a change for the better . '
`` Susan said this so energetically that she convinced herself and cheered up immediately .
But Cousin Sophia shook her head . ''
"` Albert 's wife wants to call the baby after Brusiloff , ' she said , ` but I told her to wait and see what becomes of him first ."
Them Russians has such a habit of petering out . '
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
"`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . ''"
"`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying ."
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? ''
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure ."
"Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands ."
I keep her under the white rock .
"If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark ."
Hi ! ''
he broke out .
`` What 's that ? ''
"For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon ."
`` They have begun to fight ! ''
I cried .
`` Follow me . ''
"And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly ."
"`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim !"
Under the trees with you !
Theer 's where I killed my first goat .
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn .
Ah !
"And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant ."
`` You see the mounds ?
"I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo ."
"It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . ''"
"So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer ."
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
"Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood ."
PART FOUR -- The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA .
"The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin ."
"Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea ."
"But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest ."
"He gave his hat to Liza , who took it scornfully ; for she had no imagination , and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man ."
"Outside , the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering , and he was naturally not unmoved ."
"`` Listen to them , '' he said ; `` it is very gratifying . ''"
"`` Lots of little boys , '' sneered Liza ."
"`` There were several adults to-day , '' he assured her with a faint flush ; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her ."
Social success had not spoilt him ; it had made him sweeter .
"For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel , talking with Mrs. Darling of this success , and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it ."
"`` But if I had been a weak man , '' he said ."
"`` Good heavens , if I had been a weak man ! ''"
"`` And , George , '' she said timidly , `` you are as full of remorse as ever , are n't you ? ''"
"`` Full of remorse as ever , dearest !"
See my punishment : living in a kennel . ''
"`` But it is punishment , is n't it , George ?"
You are sure you are not enjoying it ? ''
`` My love ! ''
"You may be sure she begged his pardon ; and then , feeling drowsy , he curled round in the kennel ."
"`` Wo n't you play me to sleep , '' he asked , `` on the nursery piano ? ''"
"and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly , `` And shut that window ."
I feel a draught . ''
"`` O George , never ask me to do that ."
"The window must always be left open for them , always , always . ''"
"Now it was his turn to beg her pardon ; and she went into the day-nursery and played , and soon he was asleep ; and while he slept , Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room ."
Oh no .
"We have written it so , because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship ; but something must have happened since then , for it is not they who have flown in , it is Peter and Tinker Bell ."
Peter 's first words tell all .
"`` Quick Tink , '' he whispered , `` close the window ; bar it !"
That 's right .
Now you and I must get away by the door ; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out ; and she will have to go back with me . ''
"Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me , why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland ."
This trick had been in his head all the time .
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee ; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing .
"He whispered to Tink , `` It 's Wendy 's mother !"
`` Why do n't you go ? ''
the old one asked politely .
"`` I suppose , '' said Peter huskily , `` I suppose I can still fly ? ''"
"You see , he had lost faith ."
"`` Poor little half-and-half , '' said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , `` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . ''
`` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? ''
Peter asked tragically .
`` How could you get across ? ''
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
`` Then I sha 'n' t be exactly a human ? ''
Peter asked .
`` No . ''
`` Nor exactly a bird ? ''
`` No . ''
`` What shall I be ? ''
"`` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , '' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once , then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs , and so it went on forever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , `` Greedy !"
Greedy ! ''
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
Peter wore no night-gown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
And there was a wind that came dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful silence with a music more beautiful still .
The rest of the folks were just coming downstairs when I got back to breakfast .
"They were all yawny , and some were grumpy , but I had washed my being in the sunrise and felt as blithesome as the day ."
"Oh , life is so good to live !"
"Tomorrow Uncle James 's new vessel , the White Lady , is to be launched ."
"We are going to make a festive occasion of it , and I am to christen her with a bottle of cobwebby old wine ."
"But I hear the carriage , and Aunt Jane is calling me ."
"I had a great deal more to say -- about your letter , your big `` round-up '' and your tribulations with your Chinese cook -- but I 've only time now to say goodbye ."
"You wish me a lovely time at the dance and a full programme , do n't you ?"
"Yours sincerely , Sidney Richmond ."
Aunt Jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby .
"Sidney said her prayers , went to bed , and slept soundly and serenely ."
"She mailed her letter the next day , and a month later an answer came ."
"Sidney read it as soon as she left the post office , and walked the rest of the way home as in a nightmare , staring straight ahead of her with wide-open , unseeing brown eyes ."
"John Lincoln 's letter was short , but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into Sidney 's brain ."
He wrote : I am going east for a visit .
"It is six years since I was home , and it seems like three times six ."
"I shall go by the C.P.R. , which passes through Plainfield , and I mean to stop off for a day ."
"You will let me call and see you , wo n't you ?"
"I shall have to take your permission for granted , as I shall be gone before a letter from you can reach the Bar N. I leave for the east in five days , and shall look forward to our meeting with all possible interest and pleasure ."
"Sidney did not sleep that night , but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow ."
"She was so pallid and hollow-eyed the next morning that Aunt Jane noticed it , and asked her what the matter was ."
"`` Nothing , '' said Sidney sharply ."
Sidney had never spoken sharply to her aunt before .
The good woman shook her head .
She was afraid the child was `` taking something . ''
"`` Do n't do much today , Siddy , '' she said kindly ."
`` Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up .
I 'll fix you a dose of quinine . ''
Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy .
"She swallowed the quinine meekly enough , but she worked fiercely all day , hunting out superfluous tasks to do ."
"That night she slept the sleep of exhaustion , but her dreams were unenviable and the awakening was terrible ."
"Often crushed by so many passing feet it gave out its essence freely , and the spicy odour hung round them like a soundless , invisible benediction ."
"Ken looked up at Rilla , whose hair was shining in the moonlight and whose eyes were pools of allurement ."
All at once he felt sure there was nothing in that gossip about Fred Arnold .
"`` Rilla , '' he said in a sudden , intense whisper , `` you are the sweetest thing . ''"
Rilla flushed and looked at Susan .
"Ken looked , too , and saw that Susan 's back was turned ."
He put his arm about Rilla and kissed her .
It was the first time Rilla had ever been kissed .
She thought perhaps she ought to resent it but she did n't .
"Instead , she glanced timidly into Kenneth 's seeking eyes and her glance was a kiss ."
"`` Rilla-my-Rilla , '' said Ken , `` will you promise that you wo n't let anyone else kiss you until I come back ? ''"
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla , trembling and thrilling ."
Susan was turning round .
Ken loosened his hold and stepped to the walk .
"`` Good-bye , '' he said casually ."
Rilla heard herself saying it just as casually .
"She stood and watched him down the walk , out of the gate , and down the road ."
"When the fir wood hid him from her sight she suddenly said `` Oh , '' in a choked way and ran down to the gate , sweet blossomy things catching at her skirts as she ran ."
"Leaning over the gate she saw Kenneth walking briskly down the road , over the bars of tree shadows and moonlight , his tall , erect figure grey in the white radiance ."
As he reached the turn he stopped and looked back and saw her standing amid the tall white lilies by the gate .
He waved his hand -- she waved hers -- he was gone around the turn .
"Rilla stood there for a little while , gazing across the fields of mist and silver ."
She had heard her mother say that she loved turns in roads -- they were so provocative and alluring .
Rilla thought she hated them .
She had seen Jem and Jerry vanish from her around a bend in the road -- then Walter -- and now Ken .
"Brothers and playmate and sweetheart -- they were all gone , never , it might be , to return ."
Yet still the Piper piped and the dance of death went on .
When Rilla walked slowly back to the house Susan was still sitting by the veranda table and Susan was sniffing suspiciously .
"`` I have been thinking , Rilla dear , of the old days in the House of Dreams , when Kenneth 's mother and father were courting and Jem was a little baby and you were not born or thought of ."
It was a very romantic affair and she and your mother were such chums .
To think I should have lived to see her son going to the front .
As if she had not had enough trouble in her early life without this coming upon her !
That is a pill for the Turks .
I wish I had a chance to tell the Czar just what a mistake he made when he turned Nicholas down . ''
"Susan disappeared downstairs to the kitchen , whence a dreadful thud and a piercing shriek presently sounded ."
"Everybody rushed to the kitchen -- the doctor and Miss Oliver , Mrs. Blythe , Rilla , Miranda in her wedding-veil ."
"Susan was sitting flatly in the middle of the kitchen floor with a dazed , bewildered look on her face , while Doc , evidently in his Hyde incarnation , was standing on the dresser , with his back up , his eyes blazing , and his tail the size of three tails ."
"`` Susan , what has happened ? ''"
cried Mrs. Blythe in alarm .
`` Did you fall ?
Are you hurt ? ''
Susan picked herself up .
"`` No , '' she said grimly , `` I am not hurt , though I am jarred all over ."
Do not be alarmed .
"As for what has happened -- I tried to kick that darned cat with both feet , that is what happened . ''"
Everybody shrieked with laughter .
The doctor was quite helpless .
"`` Oh , Susan , Susan , '' he gasped ."
`` That I should live to hear you swear . ''
"`` I am sorry , '' said Susan in real distress , `` that I used such an expression before two young girls ."
"But I said that beast was darned , and darned it is ."
It belongs to Old Nick . ''
"`` Do you expect it will vanish some of these days with a bang and the odour of brimstone , Susan ? ''"
"`` It will go to its own place in due time and that you may tie to , '' said Susan dourly , shaking out her raddled bones and going to her oven ."
`` I suppose my plunking down like that has shaken my cake so that it will be as heavy as lead . ''
But the cake was not heavy .
"It was all a bride 's cake should be , and Susan iced it beautifully ."
"Next day she and Rilla worked all the forenoon , making delicacies for the wedding-feast , and as soon as Miranda phoned up that her father was safely off everything was packed in a big hamper and taken down to the Pryor house ."
"Joe soon arrived in his uniform and a state of violent excitement , accompanied by his best man , Sergeant Malcolm Crawford ."
"There were quite a few guests , for all the Manse and Ingleside folk were there , and a dozen or so of Joe 's relatives , including his mother , `` Mrs. Dead Angus Milgrave , '' so called , cheerfully , to distinguish her from another lady whose Angus was living ."
"Mrs. Dead Angus wore a rather disapproving expression , not caring over-much for this alliance with the house of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
So Miranda Pryor was married to Private Joseph Milgrave on his last leave .
It should have been a romantic wedding but it was not .
"There were too many factors working against romance , as even Rilla had to admit ."
It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation .
"Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor , which certainly were not there when the children went to bed , and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile : ' I do believe it is that Peter again ! '"
"` Whatever do you mean , Wendy ? '"
"` It is so naughty of him not to wipe , ' Wendy said , sighing ."
She was a tidy child .
She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her .
"Unfortunately she never woke , so she did n't know how she knew , she just knew ."
"` What nonsense you talk , precious ."
No one can get into the house without knocking . ' '
"I think he comes in by the window , ' she said ."
"` My love , it is three floors up . '"
"` Were not the leaves at the foot of the window , mother ? '"
It was quite true ; the leaves had been found very near the window .
"Mrs. Darling did not know what to think , for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming ."
"` My child , ' the mother cried , ` why did you not tell me of this before ? ' '"
"I forgot , ' said Wendy lightly ."
She was in a hurry to get her breakfast .
"Oh , surely she must have been dreaming ."
"But , on the other hand , there were the leaves ."
"Mrs. Darling examined them carefully ; they were skeleton leaves , but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England ."
"She crawled about the floor , peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot ."
She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls .
"She let down a tape from the window to the pavement , and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet , without so much as a spout to climb up by ."
Certainly Wendy had been dreaming .
"But Wendy had not been dreaming , as the very next night showed , the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun ."
On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed .
"It happened to be Nana 's evening off , and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep ."
All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew .
"It was something for Michael , who on his birthday was getting into shirts ."
"The fire was warm , however , and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights , and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling 's lap ."
"Then her head nodded , oh , so gracefully ."
She was asleep .
"An ye were the devil , ye might go where ye will for me ."
Seek God 's forgiveness ; mine ye have freely .
But to go on to Holywood is different .
"I carry arms for York , and I will suffer no spy within their lines ."
"Hold it , then , for certain , if ye set one foot before another , I will uplift my voice and call the nearest post to seize you . ''"
"`` Ye mock me , '' said Sir Daniel ."
`` I have no safety out of Holywood . ''
"`` I care no more , '' returned Richard ."
"`` I let you go east , west , or south ; north I will not ."
Holywood is shut against you .
"Go , and seek not to return ."
"For , once ye are gone , I will warn every post about this army , and there will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrims that , once again , were ye the very devil , ye would find it ruin to make the essay . ''"
"`` Ye doom me , '' said Sir Daniel , gloomily ."
"`` I doom you not , '' returned Richard ."
"`` If it so please you to set your valour against mine , come on ; and though I fear it be disloyal to my party , I will take the challenge openly and fully , fight you with mine own single strength , and call for none to help me ."
"So shall I avenge my father , with a perfect conscience . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Sir Daniel , `` y ' have a long sword against my dagger . ''"
"`` I rely upon Heaven only , '' answered Dick , casting his sword some way behind him on the snow ."
"`` Now , if your ill-fate bids you , come ; and , under the pleasure of the Almighty , I make myself bold to feed your bones to foxes . ''"
"`` I did but try you , Dickon , '' returned the knight , with an uneasy semblance of a laugh ."
`` I would not spill your blood . ''
"`` Go , then , ere it be too late , '' replied Shelton ."
`` In five minutes I will call the post .
I do perceive that I am too long-suffering .
"Had but our places been reversed , I should have been bound hand and foot some minutes past . ''"
"`` Well , Dickon , I will go , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` When we next meet , it shall repent you that ye were so harsh . ''"
"And with these words , the knight turned and began to move off under the trees ."
"Dick watched him with strangely-mingled feelings , as he went , swiftly and warily , and ever and again turning a wicked eye upon the lad who had spared him , and whom he still suspected ."
"There was upon one side of where he went a thicket , strongly matted with green ivy , and , even in its winter state , impervious to the eye ."
"Herein , all of a sudden , a bow sounded like a note of music ."
"An arrow flew , and with a great , choked cry of agony and anger , the Knight of Tunstall threw up his hands and fell forward in the snow ."
`` I 'm going straight to Lorenzo White 's . ''
"`` But he lives on the White Sands road and it 's quite a distance out of our way , '' protested Diana ."
`` Gilbert and Fred will canvass him . ''
"`` They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late by then , '' said Anne firmly ."
`` The novelty will be worn off .
Lorenzo White is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now .
"We must n't let such a golden opportunity slip , Diana . ''"
The result justified Anne 's foresight .
"Mr. White met them in the yard , beaming like the sun upon an Easter day ."
When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically .
"`` Certain , certain ."
Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription you 've got . ''
"`` That will be five dollars ... Mr. Daniel Blair put down four , '' said Anne , half afraid ."
But Lorenzo did not flinch .
`` Five it is ... and here 's the money on the spot .
"Now , I want you to come into the house ."
There 's something in there worth seeing ... something very few people have seen as yet .
Just come in and pass YOUR opinion . ''
`` What will we say if the baby is n't pretty ? ''
whispered Diana in trepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house .
"`` Oh , there will certainly be something else nice to say about it , '' said Anne easily ."
`` There always is about a baby . ''
"The baby WAS pretty , however , and Mr. White felt that he got his five dollars ' worth of the girls ' honest delight over the plump little newcomer ."
"But that was the first , last , and only time that Lorenzo White ever subscribed to anything ."
"Anne , tired as she was , made one more effort for the public weal that night , slipping over the fields to interview Mr. Harrison , who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him ."
"Strickly speaking he was on the Carmody road ; but Jane and Gertie , who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report , had nervously begged Anne to canvass him ."
"Mr. Harrison , however , flatly refused to subscribe a cent , and all Anne 's wiles were in vain ."
"`` But I thought you approved of our society , Mr. Harrison , '' she mourned ."
"`` So I do ... so I do ... but my approval does n't go as deep as my pocket , Anne . ''"
"`` A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews , '' Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime ."
VII The Pointing of Duty Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed .
"She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises , but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work ."
"When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde 's loud , decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window ."
"`` Mrs. Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow , '' thought Anne with a grimace , `` but I do n't believe I 'll go in ."
"Her advice is much like pepper , I think ... excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses ."
I 'll run over and have a chat with Mr. Harrison instead . ''
This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr. Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow .
"She had been there several evenings and Mr. Harrison and she were very good friends , although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying ."
"Ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion , and never failed to greet her sarcastically as `` redheaded snippet . ''"
"Mr. Harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and exclaiming , `` Bless my soul , here 's that pretty little girl again , '' or something equally flattering ."
But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it .
Anne was never to know how many compliments Mr. Harrison paid her behind her back .
He certainly never paid her any to her face .
"`` Well , I suppose you 've been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow ? ''"
was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda steps .
"`` No , indeed , '' said Anne indignantly ."
She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously .
"`` I shall never have a switch in my school , Mr. Harrison ."
"Of course , I shall have to have a pointer , but I shall use it for pointing ONLY . ''"
`` So you mean to strap them instead ?
"Well , I do n't know but you 're right ."
"A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer , that 's a fact . ''"
`` I shall not use anything of the sort .
I 'm not going to whip my pupils . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment , `` how do you lay out to keep order then ? ''"
"`` I shall govern by affection , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"`` It wo n't do , '' said Mr. Harrison , `` wo n't do at all , Anne ."
` Spare the rod and spoil the child . '
When I went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if I was n't in mischief just then I was plotting it . ''
"`` Methods have changed since your schooldays , Mr. Harrison . ''"
`` But human nature has n't .
"Mark my words , you 'll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them ."
The thing is impossible . ''
"`` Well , I 'm going to try my way first , '' said Anne , who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories ."
It did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him .
If he had hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her .
He preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity .
`` Are you the young minister up at Rexton ? ''
she asked bluntly .
`` Yes . ''
`` I thought so .
Lynde said she had seen you on the shore once .
Well '' -- she cast an uncertain glance over her shoulder at the house -- `` I 'm much obliged to you . ''
"Alan had an idea that that was not what she had thought of saying , but as she had turned aside and was busying herself with the pails , there seemed nothing for him to do but to go ."
`` Wait a moment . ''
"She faced him again , and if Alan had been a vain man he might have thought that admiration looked from her piercing eyes ."
`` What do you think of us ?
I suppose they 've told you tales of us up there ? ''
-- with a scornful gesture of her hand in the direction of Rexton .
`` Do you believe them ? ''
"`` I believe no ill of anyone until I have absolute proof of it , '' said Alan , smiling -- he was quite unconscious what a winning smile he had , which was the best of it -- `` and I never put faith in gossip ."
Of course you are gossipped about -- you know that . ''
"`` Yes , I know it '' -- grimly -- `` and I do n't care what they say about the Captain and me ."
We are a queer pair -- just as queer as they make us out .
"You can believe what you like about us , but do n't you believe a word they say against Lynde ."
She 's sweet and good and beautiful .
It 's not her fault that she never went to church -- it 's her father 's .
Do n't you hold that against her . ''
The fierce yet repressed energy of her tone prevented Alan from feeling any amusement over her simple defence of Lynde .
"Moreover , it sounded unreasonably sweet in his ears ."
"`` I wo n't , '' he promised , `` but I do n't suppose it would matter much to Miss Oliver if I did ."
She did not strike me as a young lady who would worry very much about other people 's opinions . ''
"If his object were to prolong the conversation about Lynde , he was disappointed , for the old woman had turned abruptly to her work again and , though Alan lingered for a few moments longer , she took no further notice of him ."
But when he had gone she peered stealthily after him from the door until he was lost to sight among the pines .
"`` A well-looking man , '' she muttered ."
`` I wish Lynde had been home .
The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out .
"They drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward , calling first on the `` Andrew girls . ''"
"`` If Catherine is alone we may get something , '' said Diana , `` but if Eliza is there we wo n't . ''"
Eliza was there ... very much so ... and looked even grimmer than usual .
"Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears , and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible ."
The Andrew girls had been `` girls '' for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage .
"Catherine , it was said , had not entirely given up hope , but Eliza , who was born a pessimist , had never had any ."
They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of Mark Andrew 's beech woods .
"Eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer , but Catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter ."
"Eliza was sewing patchwork , not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting ."
"Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile , as the girls explained their errand ."
"To be sure , whenever Catherine caught Eliza 's eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion ; but it crept back the next moment ."
"`` If I had money to waste , '' said Eliza grimly , `` I 'd burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe ; but I would n't give it to that hall , not a cent ."
It 's no benefit to the settlement ... just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when they 's better be home in their beds . ''
"`` Oh , Eliza , young folks must have some amusement , '' protested Catherine ."
`` I do n't see the necessity .
"We did n't gad about to halls and places when we were young , Catherine Andrews ."
This world is getting worse every day . ''
"`` I think it 's getting better , '' said Catherine firmly ."
`` YOU think ! ''
Miss Eliza 's voice expressed the utmost contempt .
"`` It does n't signify what you THINK , Catherine Andrews ."
Facts is facts . ''
"`` Well , I always like to look on the bright side , Eliza . ''"
`` There is n't any bright side . ''
"`` Oh , indeed there is , '' cried Anne , who could n't endure such heresy in silence ."
"`` Why , there are ever so many bright sides , Miss Andrews ."
It 's really a beautiful world . ''
"`` You wo n't have such a high opinion of it when you 've lived as long in it as I have , '' retorted Miss Eliza sourly , `` and you wo n't be so enthusiastic about improving it either ."
"How is your mother , Diana ?"
"Dear me , but she has failed of late ."
She looks terrible run down .
`` My name is Maxwell Seeley .
"My father died when I was seven years old , and my mother a year later ."
"My little sister , Bertha , then three years old , and I were left quite alone and very poor ."
We had no relatives .
"I was adopted by a well-to-do old bachelor , who had known my father ."
My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away .
I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting .
My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education .
"I did not forget my sister , and as soon as I could I went to the asylum ."
"I found that she had been taken away long before , and I could not even discover who had adopted her , for the original building , with all its records , had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit ."
"I never could find any clue to her whereabouts , and long since gave up all hope of finding her ."
But I have found her at last .
"You are Bertha Seeley , my little sister ! ''"
`` Oh -- can it be possible ! ''
`` More than possible -- it is certain .
"You are the image of my mother , as I remember her , and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her ."
"And this is her watch -- see , I scratched my own initials on the case one day ."
There is no doubt in the world .
"Oh , Bertha , are you half as glad as I am ? ''"
`` Glad ! ''
Bertha 's eyes were shining like stars .
"She tried to smile , but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother 's shoulder ."
"By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau , and Ernest , coming through the hall , gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings ."
"`` I have n't suddenly gone crazy , Ernest , old fellow , '' smiled Max ."
"`` Ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ` am was introduced to you as Miss Price , but that was a mistake ."
"Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister . ''"
"Well they had an amazing time then , of course ."
They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on the dining-room table .
"Luckily , Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time , and they all got out , somehow , and into their places ."
"It was a splendid dinner , but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley did n't know what they were eating , any more than if it had been sawdust ."
"However , the rest of the guests made up for that , and did full justice to the girls ' cookery ."
"In the afternoon they all went to church , and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day ."
"But I have been going to see Madge Oliver for some time , and we are engaged ."
"We are thinking of being married this fall , and we hope you will not object . ''"
Burton 's frankness nearly took away his father 's breath .
Old John fairly choked with rage .
"`` You young fool , '' he spluttered , bringing down his hoe with such energy that he sliced off half a dozen of his finest young turnip plants , `` have you gone clean crazy ?"
"No , sir , I 'll never consent to your marrying an Oliver , and you need n't have any idea that I will . ''"
"`` Then I 'll marry her without your consent , '' retorted Burton angrily , losing the temper he had been trying to keep ."
"`` Oh , will you indeed !"
"Well , if you do , out you go , and not a cent of my money or a rod of my land do you ever get . ''"
`` What have you got against Madge ? ''
"asked Burton , forcing himself to speak calmly , for he knew his father too well to doubt for a minute that he meant and would do just what he said ."
"`` She 's an Oliver , '' said old John crustily , `` and that 's enough . ''"
"And considering that he had settled the matter , John Ellis threw down his hoe and left the field in a towering rage ."
Burton hoed away savagely until his anger had spent itself on the weeds .
"Give up Madge -- dear , sweet little Madge ?"
Not he !
"Yet if his father remained of the same mind , their marriage was out of the question at present ."
And Burton knew quite well that his father would remain of the same mind .
Old John Ellis had the reputation of being the most contrary man in Greenwood .
When Burton had finished his row he left the turnip field and went straight across lots to see Madge and tell her his dismal story .
"An hour later Miss Susan Oliver went up the stairs of her little brown house to Madge 's room and found her niece lying on the bed , her pretty curls tumbled , her soft cheeks flushed crimson , crying as if her heart would break ."
"Miss Susan was a tall , grim , angular spinster who looked like the last person in the world to whom a love affair might be confided ."
But never were appearances more deceptive than in this case .
"Behind her unprepossessing exterior Miss Susan had a warm , sympathetic heart filled to the brim with kindly affection for her pretty niece ."
She had seen Burton Ellis going moodily across the fields homeward and guessed that something had gone wrong .
"`` Now , dearie , what is the matter ? ''"
"she said , tenderly patting the brown head ."
Madge sobbed out the whole story disconsolately .
Burton 's father would not let him marry her because she was an Oliver .
"And , oh , what would she do ?"
"`` Do n't worry , Madge , '' said Miss Susan comfortingly ."
`` I 'll soon settle old John Ellis . ''
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory .
"However , to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way , and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found they could sleep thus with security ."
"Indeed they would have slept longer , but Peter tired quickly of sleeping , and soon he would cry in his captain voice , ` We get off here . '"
"So with occasional tiffs , but on the whole rollicking , they drew near the Neverland ; for after many moons they did reach it , and , what is more , they had been going pretty straight all the time , not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was out looking for them ."
It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores .
"` There it is , ' said Peter calmly ."
"` Where , where ? '"
` Where all the arrows are pointing . '
"Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing out the island to the children , all directed by their friend the sun , who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night ."
-LSB- Illustration : `` LET HIM KEEP WHO CAN '' -RSB- Wendy and John and Michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their first sight of the island .
"Strange to say , they all recognised it at once , and until fear fell upon them they hailed it , not as something long dreamt of and seen at last , but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays ."
"` John , there 's the lagoon . '"
"` Wendy , look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand . ' '"
"I say , John , I see your flamingo with the broken leg . '"
"` Look , Michael , there 's your cave . '"
"` John , what 's that in the brushwood ? '"
` It 's a wolf with her whelps .
"Wendy , I do believe that 's your little whelp . '"
"` There 's my boat , John , with her sides stove in . '"
"` No , it is n't ."
"Why , we burned your boat . '"
"` That 's her , at any rate ."
"I say , John , I see the smoke of the redskin camp . '"
` Where ?
"Show me , and I 'll tell you by the way the smoke curls whether they are on the war-path . '"
"` There , just across the Mysterious River . ' '"
I see now .
"Yes , they are on the war-path right enough . '"
"Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much ; but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand , for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them ?"
"It came as the arrows went , leaving the island in gloom ."
In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime .
"Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread ; black shadows moved about in them ; the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now , and above all , you lost the certainty that you would win ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her nightgown were !
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round . '"
O mother ! '
"said Peter to himself , ` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . '"
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say ` Mother ' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh !"
how exquisitely delicious it would be to her .
"That , I am afraid , is how Peter regarded it ."
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
How proud of him they are !
"and very right and proper , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The fairies sit round on mushrooms , and at first they are well behaved -RSB- But why does Peter sit so long on the rail ; why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he should enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say ` Peter , ' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"Laddie was a handsome and intelligent black-and-white Newfoundland , with a magnificent coat ."
He and Ernest were great chums .
I felt sorry for the boy who was to lose his pet .
"`` Do n't take it so hard , Ern , '' I said , trying to comfort him ."
`` Uncle will likely get another pup . ''
`` I do n't want any other pup ! ''
Ernest blurted out .
"`` Oh , Ned , wo n't you try and coax your uncle not to sell him ?"
Perhaps he 'd listen to you . ''
I shook my head .
I knew Uncle Richard too well to hope that .
"`` Not in this case , Ern , '' I said ."
"`` He would say it did not concern me , and you know nothing moves him when he determines on a thing ."
"You 'll have to reconcile yourself to losing Laddie , I 'm afraid . ''"
"Ernest 's tow-coloured head went down on Laddie 's neck again , and I , deciding that there was no use in saying anything more , proceeded towards the shore , which was about a mile from Uncle Richard 's house ."
"The beach along his farm and for several farms along shore was a lonely , untenanted one , for the fisher-folk all lived two miles further down , at Rowley 's Cove ."
About three hundred yards from the shore was the peculiar formation known as Island Rock .
This was a large rock that stood abruptly up out of the water .
"Below , about the usual water-line , it was seamed and fissured , but its summit rose up in a narrow , flat-topped peak ."
"At low tide twenty feet of it was above water , but at high tide it was six feet and often more under water ."
I pushed Uncle Richard 's small flat down the rough path and rowed out to Island Rock .
"Arriving there , I thrust the painter deep into a narrow cleft ."
"This was the usual way of mooring it , and no doubt of its safety occurred to me ."
"I scrambled up the rock and around to the eastern end , where there was a broader space for standing and from which some capital views could be obtained ."
"The sea about the rock was calm , but there was quite a swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing ."
There were no boats visible .
"The tide was low , leaving bare the curious caves and headlands along shore , and I secured a number of excellent snapshots ."
It was now three o'clock .
"I must wait another hour yet before I could get the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall '' -- a huge , arch-like opening through a jutting headland to the west of me ."
"I went around to look at it , when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay ."
"This was nothing less than the flat , drifting outward around the point ."
The swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her loose -- and I was a prisoner !
"Any day , any hour , might bring John Lincoln to Plainfield ."
What should she do ?
Hide from him ?
Refuse to see him ?
But he would find out the truth just the same ; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely .
"Sidney trod the way of the transgressor , and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow ."
Everything had come to an end -- nothing was left to her !
In the untried recklessness of twenty untempered years she wished she could die before John Lincoln came to Plainfield .
The eyes of youth could not see how she could possibly live afterward .
* * * * * Some days later a young man stepped from the C.P.R. train at Plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place boasted .
After getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could direct him to `` The Evergreens . ''
Caleb Williams looked at his guest in bewilderment .
"`` Never heerd o ' such a place , '' he said ."
"`` It is the name of Mr. Conway 's estate -- Mr. James Conway , '' explained John Lincoln ."
"`` Oh , Jim Conway 's place ! ''"
said Caleb .
`` Did n't know that was what he called it .
Sartin I kin tell you whar ' to find it .
You see that road out thar ' ?
"Well , just follow it straight along for a mile and a half till you come to a blacksmith 's forge ."
Jim Conway 's house is just this side of it on the right -- back from the road a smart piece and no other handy .
You ca n't mistake it . ''
"John Lincoln did not expect to mistake it , once he found it ; he knew by heart what it appeared like from Sidney 's description : an old stately mansion of mellowed brick , covered with ivy and set back from the highway amid fine ancestral trees , with a pine-grove behind it , a river to the left , and a harbour beyond ."
"He strode along the road in the warm , ruddy sunshine of early evening ."
It was not a bad-looking road at all ; the farmsteads sprinkled along it were for the most part snug and wholesome enough ; yet somehow it was different from what he had expected it to be .
And there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible .
Had the hotel-keeper made a mistake ?
Perhaps he had meant some other James Conway .
Presently he found himself before the blacksmith 's forge .
"Beside it was a rickety , unpainted gate opening into a snake-fenced lane feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces ."
"It ran down a bare hill , crossed a little ravine full of young white-stemmed birches , and up another bare hill to an equally bare crest where a farmhouse was perched -- a farmhouse painted a stark , staring yellow and the ugliest thing in farmhouses that John Lincoln had ever seen , even among the log shacks of the west ."
"He knew now that he had been misdirected , but as there seemed to be nobody about the forge he concluded that he had better go to the yellow house and inquire within ."
At first my only feeling was one of annoyance .
Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear .
The tide would be high that night .
If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned .
I sat down limply on a ledge and tried to look matters fairly in the face .
I could not swim ; calls for help could not reach anybody ; my only hope lay in the chance of somebody passing down the shore or of some boat appearing .
I looked at my watch .
It was a quarter past three .
"The tide would begin to turn about five , but it would be at least ten before the rock would be covered ."
"I had , then , little more than six hours to live unless rescued ."
The flat was by this time out of sight around the point .
I hoped that the sight of an empty flat drifting down shore might attract someone 's attention and lead to investigation .
That seemed to be my only hope .
No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard 's because of my non-appearance .
They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam 's .
"I have heard of time seeming long to a person in my predicament , but to me it seemed fairly to fly , for every moment decreased my chance of rescue ."
"I determined I would not give way to cowardly fear , so , with a murmured prayer for help , I set myself to the task of waiting for death as bravely as possible ."
"At intervals I shouted as loudly as I could and , when the sun came to the proper angle for the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall , '' I took the picture ."
"It afterwards turned out to be a great success , but I have never been able to look at it without a shudder ."
At five the tide began to come in .
"Very , very slowly the water rose around Island Rock ."
"Up , up , up it came , while I watched it with fascinated eyes , feeling like a rat in a trap ."
"The sun fell lower and lower ; at eight o'clock the moon rose large and bright ; at nine it was a lovely night , dear , calm , bright as day , and the water was swishing over the highest ledge of the rock ."
With some difficulty I climbed to the top and sat there to await the end .
"I had no longer any hope of rescue but , by a great effort , I preserved self-control ."
"If I had to die , I would at least face death staunchly ."
"But when I thought of my mother at home , it tasked all my energies to keep from breaking down utterly ."
Suddenly I heard a whistle .
Never was sound so sweet .
I stood up and peered eagerly shoreward .
"Coming around the `` Hole in the Wall '' headland , on top of the cliffs , I saw a boy and a dog ."
I sent a wild halloo ringing shoreward .
"Most disquieting reflection of all , was it not bad form to think about good form ?"
His vitals were tortured by this problem .
"It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one ; and as it tore him , the perspiration dripped down his tallow -LSB- waxy -RSB- countenance and streaked his doublet ."
"Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face , but there was no damming that trickle ."
"Ah , envy not Hook ."
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution -LSB- death -RSB- .
It was as if Peter 's terrible oath had boarded the ship .
"Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech , lest presently there should be no time for it ."
"`` Better for Hook , '' he cried , `` if he had had less ambition ! ''"
It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person .
`` No little children to love me ! ''
"Strange that he should think of this , which had never troubled him before ; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind ."
"For long he muttered to himself , staring at Smee , who was hemming placidly , under the conviction that all children feared him ."
Feared him !
Feared Smee !
There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him .
"He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand , because he could not hit with his fist , but they had only clung to him the more ."
Michael had tried on his spectacles .
To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable !
"Hook itched to do it , but it seemed too brutal ."
"Instead , he revolved this mystery in his mind : why do they find Smee lovable ?"
He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was .
"If Smee was lovable , what was it that made him so ?"
A terrible answer suddenly presented itself -- `` Good form ? ''
"Had the bo ` sun good form without knowing it , which is the best form of all ?"
He remembered that you have to prove you do n't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop -LSB- an elite social club at Eton -RSB- .
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee 's head ; but he did not tear .
"What arrested him was this reflection : `` To claw a man because he is good form , what would that be ? ''"
`` Bad form ! ''
"The unhappy Hook was as impotent -LSB- powerless -RSB- as he was damp , and he fell forward like a cut flower ."
"His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time , discipline instantly relaxed ; and they broke into a bacchanalian -LSB- drunken -RSB- dance , which brought him to his feet at once , all traces of human weakness gone , as if a bucket of water had passed over him ."
"`` Quiet , you scugs , '' he cried , `` or I 'll cast anchor in you ; '' and at once the din was hushed ."
He would have elected to bear any suffering if by so doing he could have freed her from the nightmare dread of Harmon 's returning to claim her .
That dread had always hung over her and now it must be intensified to agony by her love for another man .
And he could do nothing -- nothing .
He groaned aloud in his helplessness .
One evening in late November Alan flung aside his pen and yielded to the impulse that urged him to the lake shore .
He did not mean to seek Lynde -- he would go to a part of the shore where there would be no likelihood of meeting her .
But get away by himself he must .
A November storm was raging and there would be a certain satisfaction in breasting its buffets and fighting his way through it .
"Besides , he knew that Isabel King was in the house and he dreaded meeting her ."
"Since his conviction that she had written that letter to Lynde , he could not tolerate the girl and it tasked his self-control to keep from showing his contempt openly ."
Perhaps Isabel felt it beneath all his outward courtesy .
At least she did not seek his society as she had formerly done .
It was the second day of the storm ; a wild northeast gale was blowing and cold rain and freezing sleet fell in frequent showers .
Alan shivered as he came out into its full fury on the lake shore .
At first he could not see the water through the driving mist .
"Then it cleared away for a moment and he stopped short , aghast at the sight which met his eyes ."
"Opposite him was a long low island known as Philip 's Point , dwindling down at its northeastern side to two long narrow bars of quicksand ."
Alan 's horrified eyes saw a small schooner sunk between the bars ; her hull was entirely under water and in the rigging clung one solitary figure .
So much he saw before the Point was blotted out in a renewed downpour of sleet .
"Without a moment 's hesitation Alan turned and ran for Four Winds , which was only about a quarter of a mile away around a headland ."
"With the Captain 's assistance , something might be done ."
Other help could not be obtained before darkness would fall and then it would be impossible to do anything .
"He dashed up the steps of Four Winds and met Emily , who had flung the door open ."
Behind her was Lynde 's pale face with its alarmed questioning eyes .
`` Where is the Captain ? ''
gasped Alan .
`` There 's a vessel on Philip 's Point and one man at least on her . ''
"`` The Captain 's away on a cruise , '' said Emily blankly ."
`` He went three days ago . ''
"`` Then nothing can be done , '' said Alan despairingly ."
`` It will be dark long before I can get to the village . ''
"Lynde stepped out , tying a shawl around her head ."
"I never shall forget it , and I 'll do anything for you ."
Yes !
I 'll write and ask Mrs. Piper to lend us her ermine cloak for the king .
See if I do n't ! ''
"Shrieks of delight hailed this noble offer , for no one had dared to borrow the much-coveted mantle , but all agreed that the old lady would not refuse Jill ."
"It was astonishing how smoothly everything went after this , for each was eager to help , admire , and suggest , in the friendliest way ; and when all were dressed , the boys found a party of very gay ladies waiting for them round the couch , where lay the brightest little Princess ever seen ."
"`` Oh , Jack , I 'm to act !"
Was n't it dear of the girls to choose me ?
Do n't they look lovely ?
Are n't you glad ? ''
"cried Jill , as the lads stared and the lasses blushed and smiled , well pleased at the frank admiration the boyish faces showed ."
`` I guess I am !
"You are a set of trumps , and we 'll give you a first-class spread after the play to pay for it ."
"Wo n't we , fellows ? ''"
"answered Jack , much gratified , and feeling that now he could act his own part capitally ."
`` We will .
"It was a handsome thing to do , and we think well of you for it ."
"Hey , Gus ? ''"
"and Frank nodded approvingly at all , though he looked only at Annette ."
"`` As king of this crowd , I call it to order , '' said Gus , retiring to the throne , where Juliet sat laughing in her red table-cloth ."
"`` We 'll have ` The Fair One with Golden Locks ' next time ; I promise you that , '' whispered Ed to Mabel , whose shining hair streamed over her blue dress like a mantle of gold-colored silk ."
"`` Girls are pretty nice things , are n't they ?"
Kind of 'em to take Jill in .
"Do n't Molly look fine , though ? ''"
and Grif 's black eyes twinkled as he planned to pin her skirts to Merry 's at the first opportunity .
`` Susy looks as gay as a feather-duster .
I like her .
"She never snubs a fellow , '' said Joe , much impressed with the splendor of the court ladies ."
"The boys ' costumes were not yet ready , but they posed well , and all had a merry time , ending with a game of blind-man 's - buff , in which every one caught the right person in the most singular way , and all agreed as they went home in the moonlight that it had been an unusually jolly meeting ."
"So the fairy play woke the sleeping beauty that lies in all of us , and makes us lovely when we rouse it with a kiss of unselfish good-will , for , though the girls did not know it then , they had adorned themselves with pearls more precious than the waxen ones they decked their Princess in ."
Chapter XI .
"`` Down Brakes '' The greatest people have their weak points , and the best-behaved boys now and then yield to temptation and get into trouble , as everybody knows ."
"`` Fool , he had more in his sandal , or stitched into his tippet ."
"Y ' are but a child , Tom Cuckow ; ye have lost the fish . ''"
"But , for all that , Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance ."
"He stood leaning on his boar-spear , and looked round upon the rest ."
"They , in various attitudes , took greedily of the venison pottage , and liberally washed it down with ale ."
"This was a good day ; they were in luck ; but business pressed , and they were speedy in their eating ."
The first-comers had by this time even despatched their dinner .
"Some lay down upon the grass and fell instantly asleep , like boa-constrictors ; others talked together , or overhauled their weapons : and one , whose humour was particularly gay , holding forth an ale-horn , began to sing : `` Here is no law in good green shaw , Here is no lack of meat ; 'T is merry and quiet , with deer for our diet , In summer , when all is sweet ."
"Come winter again , with wind and rain -- Come winter , with snow and sleet , Get home to your places , with hoods on your faces , And sit by the fire and eat . ''"
"All this while the two lads had listened and lain close ; only Richard had unslung his cross-bow , and held ready in one hand the windac , or grappling-iron that he used to bend it ."
Otherwise they had not dared to stir ; and this scene of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a scene upon a theatre .
But now there came a strange interruption .
The tall chimney which over-topped the remainder of the ruins rose right above their hiding-place .
"There came a whistle in the air , and then a sounding smack , and the fragments of a broken arrow fell about their ears ."
"Some one from the upper quarters of the wood , perhaps the very sentinel they saw posted in the fir , had shot an arrow at the chimney-top ."
"Matcham could not restrain a little cry , which he instantly stifled , and even Dick started with surprise , and dropped the windac from his fingers ."
"But to the fellows on the lawn , this shaft was an expected signal ."
"They were all afoot together , tightening their belts , testing their bow-strings , loosening sword and dagger in the sheath ."
Ellis held up his hand ; his face had suddenly assumed a look of savage energy ; the white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown face .
"`` Lads , '' he said , `` ye know your places ."
Let not one man 's soul escape you .
Appleyard was a whet before a meal ; but now we go to table .
"I have three men whom I will bitterly avenge -- Harry Shelton , Simon Malmesbury , and '' -- striking his broad bosom -- `` and Ellis Duckworth , by the mass ! ''"
"Another man came , red with hurry , through the thorns . ''"
'T is not Sir Daniel ! ''
he panted .
`` They are but seven .
Is the arrow gone ? ''
"`` It struck but now , '' replied Ellis ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried the messenger .
`` Methought I heard it whistle .
"`` Oh , that is the postmaster 's son , '' said Alan disappointedly ."
`` That puts us further off the scent than ever .
The letter was probably dropped in the box at the office and there will consequently be no way of tracing the writer . ''
"`` Well , I ca n't tell you anything more , '' said Emily ."
`` You 'll have to ask Lynde for the truth . ''
This Alan was determined to do whenever he should meet her .
"He did not go to the house with Emily but wandered about the shore , watching for Lynde and not seeing her ."
"At length he went home , a prey to stormy emotions ."
He realized at last that he loved Lynde Oliver .
He wondered how he could have been so long blind to it .
He knew that he must have loved her ever since he had first seen her .
The discovery amazed but did not shock him .
There was no reason why he should not love her -- should not woo and win her for his wife if she cared for him .
She was good and sweet and true .
Anything of doubt in her antecedents could not touch her .
"Probably the world would look upon Captain Anthony as a somewhat undesirable father-in-law for a minister , but that aspect of the question did not disturb Alan ."
"As for the trouble of the letter , he felt sure he would easily be able to clear it away ."
Probably some malicious busybody had become aware of his frequent calls at Four Winds and chose to interfere in his private affairs thus .
For the first time it occurred to him that there had been a certain lack of cordiality among his people of late .
"If it were really so , doubtless this was the reason ."
At any other time this would have been of moment to him .
But now his thoughts were too wholly taken up with Lynde and the estrangement on her part to attach much importance to anything else .
What she thought mattered incalculably more to Alan than what all the people in Rexton put together thought .
"He had the right , like any other man , to woo the woman of his choice and he would certainly brook no outside interference in the matter ."
After a sleepless night he went back to Four Winds in the morning .
Lynde would not expect him at that time and he would have more chance of finding her .
"The result justified his idea , for he met her by the spring ."
Alan felt shocked at the change in her appearance .
She looked as if years of suffering had passed over her .
"Her lips were pallid , and hollow circles under her eyes made them appear unnaturally large ."
He had last left the girl in the bloom of her youth ; he found her again a woman on whom life had laid its heavy hand .
"A burning flood of colour swept over her face as they met , then receded as quickly , leaving her whiter than before ."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"said the stranger, in his sweetest way; ""but who is the Moth who is punishing him that queer-looking one with a crooked feeler?"""
"""Sir,"" said she, moving farther from him, ""he is a friend of mine, and I do not think it matters to you if he is queer-looking."""
"""Oh!"" said the stranger. ""Oh! oh! oh! You have a bad temper, haven't you? But you are very good-looking in spite of that."" There is no telling what he would have said next, for at this minute Miss Cecropia's friend heard the mean things he was saying, and flew against him."
"It was not long before this stranger also was punished, and then the Moth with the crooked feeler turned to the others. ""Do any of you want to try it?"" he said. ""You must understand that you cannot be rude before her."" And he pointed his right fore leg at Miss Cecropia as she sat trembling on the branch."
"""Her!"" they cried mockingly, as they flew away. ""There are prettier Moths than she. We don't care anything for her."""
"Miss Cecropia's friend would have gone after them to punish them for this impoliteness, but she clung to him and begged him not to. ""You will be killed, I know you will,"" she sobbed. ""And then what will become of me?"""
"""Would you miss me?"" he asked, as he felt of one of his wings, now broken and bare."
"""Yes,"" she cried. ""You are the best friend I have. Please don't go."""
"""But I am such a homely fellow,"" he said. ""I don't see how you can like me since I broke my wing."""
"""Well, I do like you,"" she said. ""Your wing isn't much broken after all, and I like your crooked feeler. It is so different from anybody else's."" Miss Cecropia looked very happy as she spoke, and she quite forgot how she once decided to go away from him. There are some people, you know, who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. One certainly could love Miss Cecropia for this, because it showed that she had learned to care more for a warm heart and courage than for whole wings and straight feelers."
"Mr. Cecropia did not live long after this, unfortunately, but they were very, very happy together, and she often said to her friends, as she laid her eggs in the best places, ""I only hope that when my Caterpillar babies are grown and have come out of their chrysalides, they may be as good and as brave as their father was."""
THE BEES AND THE KINGBIRD
"There was in the forest a great hollow tree where for years a swarm of Bees had made their home. To look at it in winter, one would never guess what a store of honey was sealed up within, but in summer the Bees were always passing in and out, and it was indeed a busy place. Then the Workers had to gather honey and build the cells and look out for the Queen-Mother's many babies. The Queen-Mother had so much care of her eggs that she could really do nothing but attend to them. After they were ready in their cells, the Workers took care of them, and tucked in a lot of bread for the babies to eat when they were hatched. Then there was the bread-making to be done also, and all the Workers helped bring the pollen, or flower-dust, out of which it was made."
"The Drones didn't do anything, not a thing, not a single thing, unless it were taking care of the Queen when she flew away from the tree. They had done that once, but it was long ago, before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. They were handsome great fellows, all black and gold, and if you didn't know about them, you might have thought them the pleasantest Bees in the tree. Of course you would not care for them after finding how lazy they were, for people are never liked just because they are fine-looking."
"The Drones always found some excuse for being idle, and like many other lazy people they wanted the busy ones to stop and visit with them. ""What is the hurry?"" they would say. ""There will be more honey that you can get to-morrow. Stop a while now."""
"But the Workers would shake their brown heads and buzz impatiently as they answered, ""We can get to-morrow's honey when to-morrow comes, but to-day's honey must be gathered to-day."""
"Then the Drones would grumble and say that they didn't see the sense of storing up so much honey anyway. That also was like lazy people the world over, for however much they scold about getting the food, they are sure to eat just as much as anybody else. Sometimes lazy people eat even more than others, and pick for the best too."
"On cloudy days, the Workers did stay at home in the tree, but not to play. They clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. It took much patience to make wax. When they were gathering honey there was so much that was interesting to be seen, and so many friends to meet, that it was really quite exciting; but when they made wax they had to hang for a long, long time, until the wax gathered in flakes over their bodies. Then it was ready to scrape off and shape into six-sided cells to hold honey or to be homes for the babies."
One sunshiny morning the Queen-Mother stopped laying her eggs and cried:
"""Listen! did you hear that?"""
"""What?"" asked the Workers, crowding around her."
"""Why, that noise,"" she said. ""It sounded like a bird calling 'Kyrie!"
"K-y-rie!' and I thought I heard a Worker buzzing outside a minute ago, but no one has come in. I am afraid "" and here she stopped."
"""Of what are you afraid!"" asked the Drones, who, having nothing to do but eat and sleep, were always ready to talk about anything and everything. The great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work."
"""Why,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I don't want to alarm you, but I thought it was a Kingbird."""
"""Well, what if it was?"" said a big Drone. ""There is only one of him and there are a great many of us."""
"""Yes,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""but there may not be so many of us very long if he begins to watch the tree. I have lived much longer than you and I know how Kingbirds act."""
"This was true, for Queens live to be very old, and Drones never live long because they are so lazy."
"""Well,"" said the big Drone, ""we must find out about this. Just fly around and see if it is a Kingbird,"" he said to a Worker. ""We must know about things before we act."""
"""Suppose you should go,"" she replied. ""I have my leg-pockets full of pollen, and it ought to be made into bread at once. I never saw Larvæ so hungry as these last ones are."""
"""I only wish that I could go,"" said the big Drone, limping as he got out of her way; ""but my fifth foot just stepped on my third foot, and I can hardly move."""
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! don't take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Very well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
But just then up came the big billy-goat Gruff.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him."
"""WHO'S THAT tramping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""IT'S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF,"" said the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the Troll."
"""Well, come along! I've got two spears,             And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;             I've got besides two curling-stones,             And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones."""
"That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew at the Troll and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side. There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again; and if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why they're still fat; and so:"
"Snip, snap, snout,                         This tale's told out."
THE THREE PRINCESSES IN THE BLUE MOUNTAIN
"There were once upon a time a King and Queen who had no children, and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. One day the King stood in the portico and looked out over the big meadows and all that was his. But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since he did not know what would become of it after his time. As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven's name. She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the King, since he looked so sad."
"""You can't do anything to help me, my good woman,"" said the King; ""it's no use telling you."""
"""I am not so sure about that,"" said the beggar woman. ""Very little is wanted when luck is in the way. The King is thinking that he has no heir to his crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that account,"""
"she said. ""The Queen shall have three daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not come out under the open heavens before they are all fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and carry them away."""
"When the time came the Queen had a beautiful baby girl; the year after she had another, and the third year she also had a girl."
"The King and Queen were glad beyond all measure; but although the King was very happy, he did not forget to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the Princesses should not get out."
"As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful, and all went well with them in every way. Their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. For all they begged and prayed their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it was of no avail; go out they must not before they were fifteen years old, all of them."
"So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of the youngest Princess, the King and the Queen were out driving, and the Princesses were standing at the window and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out, happen what might. So they begged and entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that he should let them down into the garden. ""He could see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy weather could come on such a day."" Well, he didn't think it looked much like it either, and if they must go they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be for a minute, and he himself would go with them and look after them."
"When they got down into the garden they ran up and down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves, the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they must have that also. But just as they bent down to take the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away."
"There was great mourning over the whole country, and the King made known from all the churches that any one who could save the Princesses should have half the kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess he liked to choose."
"You can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain; so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no one who could find the Princesses, or even get any tidings of them."
"When all the grand and rich people in the country had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The King fitted them out both with silver and gold, and wished them success on their journey."
"Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt one night that he also was trying to find the Princesses. When the morning came he still remembered what he had dreamt, and told his mother about it."
"""Some witchery must have got hold of you,"" said the woman, ""but you must dream the same thing three nights running, else there is nothing in it."" And the next two nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream, and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace. It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had set out."
"""You had better go home again,"" said the King, ""the Princesses are beyond your reach, I should say; and besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I have nothing left to-day. You had better come back another time."""
"""If I go, I must go to-day,"" said the soldier. ""Money I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some food in my wallet,"" he said; ""but it must be a good walletful as much meat and bacon as I can carry."""
"Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted."
"So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before he overtook the captain and the lieutenant."
"""Where are you going?"" asked the captain, when he saw the man in uniform."
"What tangles they did get into! Each little Rabbit had four legs, two short ones in front, and two long ones behind to help him take long jumps from one place to another. So, you see, there were twenty-eight legs there, pushing, catching in the hay, kicking, and sometimes just waving in the air when their tiny owners chanced to roll over on their backs and couldn't get right side up again. Then Mamma Rabbit would come and poke them this way and that, never hurting any of them, but getting the nest in order."
"""It is a great deal of work to pick up after children,"" she would say with a tired little sigh, ""but it will not be long before they have homes of their own and are doing the same thing."""
"Mamma Rabbit was quite right when she said that, for all of their people set up housekeeping when very young, and then the cares of life begin."
"One fine morning when the children were alone in their burrow, the biggest little Rabbit had a queer feeling in his face, below and in front of his long ears, and above his eager little nose. It almost scared him at first, for he had never before felt anything at all like it. Then he guessed what it meant. There were two bunchy places on his face, that Mamma Rabbit had told him were eyes. ""When you are older,"""
"she had said to him, ""these eyes will open, and then you will see."" For the Rabbit children are always blind when they are babies."
"When his mother told him that, the biggest little Rabbit had said, ""What do you mean when you say I shall 'see'? Is it anything like eating?"""
"And Mamma Rabbit said, ""No, you cannot taste things until you touch them, but you can see them when they are far away."""
"""Then it is like smelling,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""No, it is not like smelling, either, for there are many things, like stones, which one cannot smell and yet can see."""
"""Then it surely is like hearing,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed his mother, who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. ""It is not a bit like hearing. You could never hear a black cloud coming across the sky, but you could see it if you were outside your burrow. Nobody can make you understand what seeing is until your eyes are open, and then you will find out for yourself without asking."""
"This made the biggest little Rabbit lie still for a while, and then he said: ""What is a black cloud, and why does it come across the sky? And what is the sky, and why does it let the cloud come? And what is "" But he did not get any answer, for his mother ran out of the burrow as fast as she could."
"And now his eyes were surely opening and he should see! His tiny heart thumped hard with excitement, and he rubbed his face with his forepaws to make his eyes open faster. Ah! There it was; something round and bright at the other end of the burrow, and some queer, slender things were waving across it. He wondered if it were good to eat, but he dared not crawl toward it to see. He did not know that the round, bright thing was just a bit of sky which he saw through the end of the burrow, and that the slender, waving ones were the branches of a dead tree tossing in the wind. Then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. He would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time."
"""I can see!"" he cried. ""I can see everything that there is to see! I'm ahead of you! Don't you wish that you could see, too?"""
"That was not a very kind thing to say, but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldn't see. Even while he was speaking and looking toward the light, he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him, and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. How frightened he was then! He pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. He thought something dreadful was about to happen."
"""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come,"" he squeaked, shutting his eyes as closely as he could. ""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come."""
"""Why, here I am,"" she answered. ""What are you afraid of?"""
"The biggest little Rabbit opened his eyes, and there was the creature who had frightened him so, and it was his own mother! You can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open."
"""I will call in some of my Rabbit friends,"" she said, ""and let you see them, if you will promise not to be afraid."""
"The next day four of the other little Rabbits had their eyes open, and the day after that they all could see each other and the shining piece of sky at the end of the burrow. It was not so very long afterward that the Rabbit family went out to dine in the forest, and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. Often when their mother left them alone in the burrow she had pulled grass and leaves over the opening to hide it from him, for Rabbit fathers do not love their children until they are old enough to go out into the great world, and it would never do for them to know where their babies are kept. Then their father taught them how to gnaw tough bark to wear their teeth down, for Rabbits' teeth grow all the time, and if they were to eat only soft food, their teeth would get too long. He taught them, too, how to move their ears in the right way for keen hearing, and told them that when chased they must run for the burrow or the nearest thicket. ""Then crouch down on some leaves that are the color of your fur,"" he said, ""and you may not be seen at all."""
"""Why should we run?"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Because you might be caught if you didn't."""
"""What might catch us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh, a Hawk, perhaps, or a Weasel."""
"""What does a Hawk look like?"""
"""Like a great bird floating in the sky,"" said Papa Rabbit. ""Now, don't ask me a single question more."""
"""Does a Hawk look like that bird above us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"His father gave one look upward. ""Yes!"" he said. ""Run!"""
"And just as the Hawk swooped down toward the ground, he saw nine white-tipped tails disappear into a burrow near by."
THE LITTLE BAT WHO WOULDN'T GO TO BED
"""Come,"" said Mamma Bat, flying toward her home in the cave, ""it is time that you children went to bed. The eastern sky is growing bright, and I can see the fleecy clouds blush rosy red as the sun looks at them."""
"So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he took, he still spilt one drop on the horse's flank. So it became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop, the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam safe to land. But when the Trolls came to the lake, they lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled till they burst."
"""Now we're rid of them,"" said the Horse."
"So when they had gone a long, long while, they came to a green patch in a wood."
"""Now, strip off all your arms,"" said the Horse, ""and only put on your ragged clothes, and take the saddle off me, and let me loose, and hang all my clothing and your arms up inside that great hollow lime-tree yonder. Then make yourself a wig of fir-moss, and go up to the king's palace, which lies close here, and ask for a place."
"Whenever you need me, only come here and shake the bridle, and I'll come to you."""
"Yes! the lad did all his Horse told him, and as soon as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly, and pale, and miserable to look at, no one would have known him again. Then he went up to the king's palace and begged first for leave to be in the kitchen, and bring in wood and water for the cook, but then the kitchen-maid asked him:"
"""Why do you wear that ugly wig? Off with it. I won't have such a fright in here."""
"""No, I can't do that,"" said the lad; ""for I'm not quite right in my head."""
"""Do you think then I'll have you in here about the food,"" cried the cook. ""Away with you to the coachman; you're best fit to go and clean the stable."""
"But when the coachman begged him to take his wig off, he got the same answer, and he wouldn't have him either."
"""You'd best go down to the gardener,"" said he; ""you're best fit to go about and dig in the garden."""
"So he got leave to be with the gardener, but none of the other servants would sleep with him, and so he had to sleep by himself under the steps of the summer-house. It stood upon beams, and had a high staircase. Under that he got some turf for his bed, and there he lay as well as he could."
"So, when he had been some time at the palace, it happened one morning, just as the sun rose, that the lad had taken off his wig, and stood and washed himself, and then he was so handsome, it was a joy to look at him."
"So the Princess saw from her window the lovely gardener's boy, and thought she had never seen any one so handsome. Then she asked the gardener why he lay out there under the steps."
"""Oh,"" said the gardener, ""none of his fellow-servants will sleep with him; that's why."""
"""Let him come up to-night, and lie at the door inside my bedroom, and then they'll not refuse to sleep with him any more,"" said the Princess."
So the gardener told that to the lad.
"""Do you think I'll do any such thing?"" said the lad. ""Why they'd say next there was something between me and the Princess."""
"""Yes,"" said the gardener, ""you've good reason to fear any such thing, you who are so handsome."""
"""Well, well,"" said the lad, ""since it's her will, I suppose I must go."""
"So, when he was to go up the steps in the evening, he tramped and stamped so on the way, that they had to beg him to tread softly lest the King should come to know it. So he came into the Princess' bedroom, lay down, and began to snore at once. Then the Princess said to her maid:"
"""Go gently, and just pull his wig off;"" and she went up to him."
"But just as she was going to whisk it off, he caught hold of it with both hands, and said she should never have it. After that he lay down again, and began to snore. Then the Princess gave her maid a wink, and this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad so lovely, and white and red, just as the Princess had seen him in the morning sun."
After that the lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom.
"But it wasn't long before the King came to hear how the gardener's lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom; and he got so wroth he almost took the lad's life. He didn't do that, however, but he threw him into the prison tower; and as for his daughter, he shut her up in her own room, whence she never got leave to stir day or night."
"All that she begged, and all that she prayed, for the lad and herself, was no good. The King was only more wroth than ever."
"Some time after came a war and uproar in the land, and the King had to take up arms against another king who wished to take the kingdom from him. So when the lad heard that, he begged the gaoler to go to the King and ask for a coat of mail and a sword, and for leave to go to the war. All the rest laughed when the gaoler told his errand, and begged the King to let him have an old worn-out suit, that they might have the fun of seeing such a wretch in battle. So he got that, and an old broken-down hack besides, which went upon three legs, and dragged the fourth after it."
"Then they went out to meet the foe; but they hadn't got far from the palace before the lad got stuck fast in a bog with his hack. There he sat and dug his spurs in, and cried, ""Gee up! gee up!"" to his hack."
"And all the rest had their fun out of this, and laughed, and made game of the lad as they rode past him. But they were scarcely gone, before he ran to the lime-tree, threw on his coat of mail, and shook the bridle, and there came the Horse in a trice, and said: ""Do now your best, and I'll do mine."""
"But when the lad came up the battle had begun, and the King was in a sad pinch; but no sooner had the lad rushed into the thick of it than the foe was beaten back, and put to flight. The King and his men wondered and wondered who it could be who had come to help them, but none of them got so near him as to be able to talk to him, and as soon as the fight was over he was gone. When they went back, there sat the lad still in the bog, and dug his spurs into his three-legged hack, and they all laughed again."
"Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then your prince dies under my feet."""
"""Very well, we agree,"" said they all. ""Nay, if we do not get the ring for you, devour us all."""
"This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat; whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to the cat and released its son."
"As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything would go on as happily as before. ""How glad master will be!"" they thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once dropped it, and a fish swallowed it."
"""Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?"" said the dog."
"""What is done is done,"" replied the cat. ""We must try to recover it, and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream."
"I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me."""
"""All right,"" said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet."
"Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring."
"This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found and carried back to the cat."
"""Come along now; I have got the ring,"" said the cat to the dog."
"""No, I will not,"" said the dog, ""unless you let me have the ring. I can carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you."" So the cat was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite."
"""See, see, there it goes away to that big tree,"" the cat exclaimed."
"""Oh! oh! what have I done?"" cried the dog."
"""You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,"" said the cat. ""But stop your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not be able to trace it."""
"The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree, killed the kite, and recovered the ring. ""Come along,"" it said to the dog when it reached the ground. ""We must make haste now. We have been delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on."""
"The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be."
The Talkative Tortoise
"The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual."
"Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing so."
"At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with him, they said to the tortoise:"
"""Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come there with us?"""
"""But how can I get there?"""
"""We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say nothing to anybody."""
"""Oh! that I can do. Take me with you."""
"""That's right,"" said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up into the air."
"Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, ""Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!"" Whereupon the tortoise wanted to say, ""If my friends choose to carry me, what is that to you, you wretched slaves!"" So just as the swift flight of the wild ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, ""A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!"""
"The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat, ""Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?"""
"The future Buddha thought to himself, ""Long expecting, wishing to admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his life."" And saying, ""Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes people whose words have no end come to grief like this,"" he uttered these Verses:"
"""Verily the tortoise killed himself     Whilst uttering his voice;     Though he was holding tight the stick,     By a word himself he slew."
"It looked odd to the English, of course, to see him come into the royal presence, and, leaning his wet umbrella up against the throne, ask the king, ""How's trade?"""
"Franklin never put on any frills, but he was not afraid of a crowned head. He used to say, frequently, that a king to him was no more than a seven-spot."
"He did his best to prevent the Revolutionary War, but he couldn't do it."
"Patrick Henry had said that the war was inevitable, and had given it permission to come, and it came."
"He also went to Paris, and got acquainted with a few crowned heads there. They thought a good deal of him in Paris, and offered him a corner lot if he would build there and start a paper. They also promised him the county printing; but he said, No, he would have to go back to America or his wife might get uneasy about him. Franklin wrote ""Poor Richard's Almanac"" in 1732 to 1757, and it was republished in England."
"Franklin little thought, when he went to the throne-room in his leather riding-clothes and hung his hat on the throne, that he was inaugurating a custom of wearing groom clothes which would in these days be so popular among the English."
"Dr. Franklin entered Philadelphia eating a loaf of bread and carrying a loaf under each arm, passing beneath the window of the girl to whom he afterwards gave his hand in marriage."
"Nearly everybody in America, except Dr. Mary Walker, was once a poor boy."
CHAPTER XVI.
THE CRITICAL PERIOD.
"Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold on the 10th of May led two small companies to Ticonderoga, a strong fortress tremendously fortified, and with its name also across the front door. Ethan Allen, a brave Vermonter born in Connecticut, entered the sally-port, and was shot at by a guard whose musket failed to report. Allen entered and demanded the surrender of the fortress."
"""By whose authority?"" asked the commandant."
"""By the authority of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress,"""
"said Allen, brandishing his naked sword at a great rate."
"""Very well,"" said the officer: ""if you put it on those grounds, all right, if you will excuse the appearance of things. We were just cleaning up, and everything is by the heels here."""
"""Never mind,"" said Allen, who was the soul of politeness. ""We put on no frills at home, and so we are ready to take things as we find them."""
"The Americans therefore got a large amount of munitions of war, both here and at Crown Point."
"General Washington was now appointed commander-in-chief of all the troops at the second session of the Continental Congress. On his arrival at Boston there were only fourteen thousand men. He took command under the historic elm at Cambridge. He was dressed in a blue broadcloth coat with flaps and revers of same, trimmed with large beautiful buttons. He also wore buff small-clothes, with openings at the sides where pockets are now put in, but at that time given up to space. They were made in such a way as to prevent the naked eye from discovering at once whether he was in advance or retreat. He also wore silk stockings and a cocked hat."
"The lines of Dryden starting off ""Mark his majestic fabric"" were suggested by his appearance and general style. He always dressed well and rode a good horse, but at Valley Forge frosted his feet severely, and could have drawn a pension, ""but no,"" said he, ""I can still work at light employment, like being President, and so I will not ask for a pension."""
"Each soldier had less than nine cartridges, but Washington managed to keep General Gage penned up in Boston, and, as Gage knew very few people there, it was a dull winter for him."
"The boys of Boston had built snow hills on the Common, and used to slide down them to the ice below, but the British soldiers tore down their coasting-places and broke up the ice on the pond."
"They stood it a long time, rebuilding their playground as often as it was torn down, until the spirit of American freedom could endure it no longer. They then organized a committee consisting of eight boys who were noted for their great philosophical research, and with Charles Sumner Muzzy, the eloquent savant from Milk Street, as chairman, the committee started for General Gage's head-quarters, to confer with him regarding the matter."
"In the picture Mr. Muzzy is seen addressing General Gage. The boy in the centre with the colored glasses is Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who discovered and first brought into use the idea of putting New Orleans molasses into Boston brown bread. To the left of Mr. Cobb is Mr. Jehoab Nye, who afterwards became the Rev. Jehoab Nye and worked with heart and voice for over eight of the best years of his life against the immorality of the codfish-ball, before he learned of its true relations towards society."
"Above and between these two stands Whomsoever J. Opper, who wrote ""How to make the Garden Pay"" and ""What Responsible Person will see that my Grave is kept green?"" In the background we see the tall form of Wherewithal G. Lumpy, who introduced the Pompadour hair-cut into Massachusetts and grew up to be a great man with enlarged joints but restricted ideas."
"Charles Sumner Muzzy addressed General Gage at some length, somewhat to the surprise of Gage, who admitted in a few well-chosen words that the committee was right, and that if he had his way about it there should be no more trouble."
"Charles was followed by Marco Bozzaris Cobb, who spoke briefly of the boon of liberty, closing as follows: ""We point with pride, sir, to the love of freedom, which is about the only excitement we have. We love our country, sir, whether we love anything else much or not. The distant wanderer of American birth, sir, pines for his country. 'Oh, give me back,' he goes on to say, 'my own fair land across the bright blue sea, the land of beauty and of worth, the bright land of the free, where tyrant foot hath never trod, nor bigot forged a chain. Oh, would that I were safely back in that bright land again!'"""
"Mr. Wherewithal G. Lumpy said he had hardly expected to be called upon, and so had not prepared himself, but this occasion forcibly brought to his mind the words also of the poet, ""Our country stands,"" said he, ""with outstretched hands appealing to her boys; from them must flow her weal or woe, her anguish or her joys. A ship she rides on human tides which rise and sink anon: each giant wave may prove her grave, or bear her nobly on. The friends of right, with armor bright, a valiant Christian band, through God her aid may yet be made, a blessing to our land."""
"General Gage was completely overcome, and asked for a moment to go apart and think it over, which he did, returning with an air which reminded one of ""Ten Nights in a Bar-Room."""
"""You may go, my brave boys; and be assured that if my troops molest you in the future, or anywhere else, I will overpower them and strew the Common with their corses."
"Jackson was unfriendly to the Bank of the United States, and the bank retaliated by contracting its loans, thus making money-matters hard to get hold of by the masses."
"""When the public money,"" says the historian, ""which had been withdrawn from the Bank of the United States was deposited in local banks, money was easy and speculation extended to every branch of trade. New cities were laid out; fabulous prices were charged for building-lots which existed only on paper"" etc. And in Van Buren's time the people paid the violinist, as they have in 1893, with ruin and remorse."
Speculation which is unprofitable should never be encouraged.
"Unprofitable speculation is only another term for idiocy. But, on the other hand, profitable speculation leads to prosperity, public esteem, and the ability to keep a team. We may distinguish the one from the other by means of ascertaining the difference between them. If one finds on waking up in the morning that he experiences a sensation of being in the poor-house, he may almost at once jump to the conclusion that the kind of speculation he selected was the wrong one."
The Black Hawk War occurred in the Northwest Territory in 1832. It grew out of the fact that the Sacs and Foxes sold their lands to the United States and afterwards regretted that they had not asked more for them:
"so they refused to vacate, until several of them had been used up on the asparagus-beds of the husbandman."
"The Florida War (1835) grew out of the fact that the Seminoles regretted having made a dicker with the government at too low a price for land. Osceola, the chief, regretted the matter so much that he scalped General Thompson while the latter was at dinner, which shows that the Indian is not susceptible to cultivation or the acquisition of any knowledge of table etiquette whatever. What could be in poorer taste than scalping a man between the soup and the remove? The same day Major Dade with one hundred men was waylaid, and all but four of the party killed."
Seven years later the Indians were subdued.
"Phrenologically the Indian allows his alimentiveness to overbalance his group of organs which show veneration, benevolence, fondness for society, fêtes champêtres, etc., hope, love of study, fondness for agriculture, an unbridled passion for toil, etc."
"France owed five million dollars for damages to our commerce in Napoleon's wars, and, Napoleon himself being entirely worthless, having said every time that the bill was presented that he would settle it as soon as he got back from St. Helena, Jackson ordered reprisals to be made, but England acted as a peacemaker, and the bill was paid. On receiving the money a trunk attached by our government and belonging to Napoleon was released."
"Space here, and the nature of this work, forbid an extended opinion regarding the course pursued by Napoleon in this matter. His tomb is in the basement of the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, and you are requested not to fumer while you are there."
CHAPTER XXII.
MORE DIFFICULTIES STRAIGHTENED OUT.
"Van Buren, the eighth President, was unfortunate in taking the helm as the financial cyclone struck the country. This was brought about by scarcity of funds more than anything else. Business-men would not pay their debts, and, though New York was not then so large as at present, one hundred million dollars were lost in sixty days in this way."
"The government had required the payments for public lands to be made in coin, and so the Treasury had plenty of gold and silver, while business had nothing to work with. Speculation also had made a good many snobs who had sent their gold and silver abroad for foreign luxuries, also some paupers who could not do so. When a man made some money from the sale of rural lots he had his hats made abroad, and his wife had her dresses fitted in Paris at great expense. Confidence was destroyed, and the air was heavy with failures and apprehension of more failures to come."
"The Canadians rebelled against England, and many of our people wanted to unite with Canada against the mother-country, but the police would not permit them to do so. General Scott was sent to the frontier to keep our people from aiding the Canadians."
"There was trouble in the Northeast over the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, but it was settled by the commissioners, Daniel Webster and Lord Ashburton. Webster was a smart man and a good extemporaneous speaker."
"Van Buren failed of a re-election, as the people did not fully endorse his administration. Administrations are not generally endorsed where the people are unable to get over six pounds of sugar for a dollar."
"General Harrison, who followed in 1841, died soon after choosing his Cabinet, and his Vice-President, John Tyler, elected as a Whig, proceeded to act as President, but not as a Whig President should. His party passed a bill establishing the United States Bank, but Tyler vetoed it, and the men who elected him wished they had been as dead as Rameses was at the time."
"Dorr's justly celebrated rebellion in Rhode Island was an outbreak resulting from restricting the right of suffrage to those who owned property. A new Constitution was adopted, and Dorr chosen as Governor."
"He was not recognized, and so tried to capture the seat while the regular governor was at tea. He got into jail for life, but was afterwards pardoned out and embraced the Christian religion."
"In 1844 the Anti-Rent War in the State of New York broke out among those who were tenants of the old ""Patroon Estates."" These men, disguised as Indians, tarred and feathered those who paid rent, and killed the collectors who were sent to them. In 1846 the matter was settled by the military."
"In 1840 the Mormons had settled at Nauvoo, Illinois. They were led by Joseph Smith, and not only proposed to run a new kind of religion, but introduced polygamy into it. The people who lived near them attacked them, killed Smith, and drove the Mormons to Iowa, opposite Omaha."
"In 1844 occurred the building of the magnetic telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B. Morse. The line was from Baltimore to Washington, or vice versa, authorities failing to agree on this matter. It cost thirty thousand dollars, and the boys who delivered the messages made more out of it then than the stockholders did."
"Fulton having invented and perfected the steamboat in 1805 and started the Clermont on the North River at the dizzy rate of five miles per hour, and George Stephenson having in 1814 made the first locomotive to run on a track, the people began to feel that theosophy was about all they needed to place them on a level with the seraphim and other astral bodies."
"Texas had, under the guidance of Sam Houston, obtained her independence from Mexico, and asked for admission to the Union. Congress at first rejected her, fearing that the Texas people lacked cultivation, being so far away from the thought-ganglia of the East, also fearing a war with Mexico; but she was at last admitted, and now every one is glad of it."
"The Whigs were not in favor of the admission of Texas, and made that the issue of the following campaign, Henry Clay leading his party to a hospitable grave in the fall. James K. Polk, a Democrat, was elected."

"house, she had heard the men summoning him. She had lost no time in"
getting to Sunset Lane.
"""Who went with me? Where? What's happened?"""
Now Aunt Achsa let her whole weight drop against Mr. Dugald.
"""Didn't Sidney go 'long to Truro with you?"" she asked falteringly."
"""I didn't go to Truro. Knew this storm was comin'. Where--"""
"""Oh--h!"" Aunt Achsa moaned Mr. Dugald motioned to Miss Vine."
"""Take care of things--here. I'm off--"""
"""Cap'n Davies and Jim Saunders and Pete Cady's gone out in the"
"_Sally_,"" cried one of the men who had brought Lavender home. But"
Dugald Allan had plunged into the darkness without hearing him. The men
rushed after him.
Miss Vine pushed Aunt Achsa into a chair.
"""You're not going to cross any bridges 'til you come to them, Achsy"
Green. Doctor Blackwell brought Lav into this world and he isn't going
to let him quit it without putting up a pretty good fight. Jeremiah
Berry's in with him and he's as good as two women. You wrap that shawl
'round you 'til I can light a lamp and get you some clothes. You're
"shivering like it was December. I'll put the kettle over, too--"""
"Oddly huge and gaunt in the shadowy room, Miss Vine moved and talked"
briskly to keep up Aunt Achsa's nerve and her own against the black
fear that held them.
"In a few cases, chiefly of artists, a universally-used sobriquet"
"is to be taken in place of the family or forename, as _Tintoretto_"
(whose real name was Giacomo _Robusti_). Similar cases are _Canaletto_
"(Antonio _Canale_ and also B. _Belotto_), _Correggio_ (Ant. _Allegri_),"
"_Garofalo_ (Benvenuto Piero _Tisi_), Il _Sodoma_ (Giov. Ant. _Bazzi_),"
"_Spagnoletto_ (Jusepe _Ribera_, now however oftener called _Ribera_),"
_Uccello_ (Paolo _Doni_). Always cross-reference from the family name.
"(_b_) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g., _Kaye_, John,"
"Bishop of Lincoln. _Lincoln_, John, Bishop of. See _Kaye_."
"Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their forename: e.g.,"
"_Canon Liddon_, _Bishop of Ripon, Henry Edward_, _Archbishop of"
"Westminster_, i.e., _H. E. Manning_. Care must be taken not to treat"
Canon as a forename or Edward as a family name.
"(_c_) Married women, using the known form:"
"Wives often continue writing, and are known in literature only under"
"their maiden names (as _Miss Freer_ or _Fanny Lewald_), or after a"
second marriage retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
"Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., _Ward, Mrs. Elizabeth"
"(Phelps)_. Use the form _White, Mrs. Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C._,"
"when the husband's name is used: e.g., _Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake)"
"Garretson_. _Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)_. _Soyaux, Frau Frieda"
"(Schanz)_. _Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier) Comtesse de_."
Women known under their husbands' names are to be entered as follows:
"_Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan), Mrs. H. A. Hinkson_. Cross-reference"
to be made from the latter form.
"MRS. FULLARTON, taken aback, cannot refrain from her glance at"
FULLARTON automatically gazing at CLARE while he talks with
HUNTINGDON.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course--the only thing is that----
"CLARE.  [With a faint smile]  It's all right, Dolly.  I'm not coming."
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Oh!  don't do anything desperate, Clare--you are so"
desperate sometimes.  You ought to make terms--not tracks.
CLARE.  Haggle?  [She shakes her head]  What have I got to make terms
with?  What he still wants is just what I hate giving.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  But, Clare----"
"CLARE.  No, Dolly; even you don't understand.  All day and every day"
"--just as far apart as we can be--and still--Jolly, isn't it?  If"
you've got a soul at all.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  It's awful, really."
"CLARE.  I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on"
"with it; only, you see, I happen to have something in me that--comes"
"to an end.  Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever."
"She has taken a flower from her dress, and suddenly tears it to"
bits.  It is the only sign of emotion she has given.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Watching]  Look here, my child; this won't do.  You"

"Denmark, Norway, and Sweden from 1513 to 1900_ (Camb. Univ. Press,"

"""If we don't take it off tonight Lav Green may find it--or that girl--"""
"At that someone laughed, horribly. ""Huh--_him_! Why we could twist"
"every crooked bone in his body until he wouldn't know 'em. Him--ha,"
"that's a joke! Why, a look 'ud scare him to a pulp. The girl, too."""
"Sidney, reaching her hand out instinctively, caught Lavender's and held"
it tight. She felt the writhing of his body.
"A new voice broke in above them. ""I got a better scheme. Listen."
"We'll--"" But the voices suddenly died to silence; the footsteps moved"
away.
"The four, huddled in the darkness of the cabin, drew long trembling"
breaths.
"""Lav, those diamonds are on this boat!"""

"With the howling of the wind, the slap-slap of the water, it was"
"""No. In his way, I suppose he was fond of her. But--she didn't like his"
"way. She was very beautiful, and I fell in love with her, and she with"
"me. And we ran away."""
"""Is--is that all? Is there no----?"""
"""No excuse? No, I suppose, none. And I lived with her till she died four"
"years ago. And--Daisy is our daughter."""
"""And he--the husband?"""
"""He did not divorce her. I don't know why not, perhaps because she asked"
him to--anyhow he didn't. And he outlived her: so she died--as she had
"lived."""
"""And is he still alive?"""
"""No; he is dead now."" He was about to go on, but checked himself. Why"
add that horror? How the man died was nothing between her and him.
"""Have you no--nothing to say?"" she burst out, almost angrily. ""You just"
"tell me that and stop!"""
"""What is there to say? I have told you all there is to tell. I loved her"
"very much. I did what I could to make her happy, and I try to make up"
"for it to Daisy. But there is nothing more to say."""
"She was angry that he would not defend himself. She was ready--ah, so"
ready!--to listen to his pleading. But he would not say a word for
"himself. Instead, he went on,"
"""She didn't want to come, but I made her. She repented, poor girl, all"
"Suddenly he flung in upon us with a great noise, his colour high, his"
eyes glittering. His first action was to throw his feathered hat on
"one chair, and himself into another."
'I've seen him!' he said. 'Himmel! he is a clever fellow. He will
"worst you, cousin, yet--see if he does not. Oh, he is a clever one!'"
"'Who?' my lady said, looking at him in some displeasure."
"'Who? Tzerclas, to be sure!' he answered, chuckling."
"'You have seen him!' she exclaimed, rising."
"'Of course I have!' he answered. 'And you will see him too, one of"
these days.'
"My lady looked at me, frowning. But I shook my head. He was not drunk."
"'Where?' she asked, after a pause. 'Where did you see him, Rupert?'"
"'In the street--where you see other men,' he answered, chuckling"
"again. 'He should not be there, but who is to keep him out? He is too"
"clever. He will get his way in the end, see if he does not!'"
"'Rupert!' my lady cried in wrathful amazement, 'to hear you, one would"
suppose you admired him.'
"'So I do,' he replied coolly. 'Why not? He has all the wits of the"
"family. He is as cunning as the devil. Take a hint, cousin; put"
yourself on the right side. He will win in the end!' And the Waldgrave
"rose restlessly from his chair, and, going to the window, began to"
whistle.
"over it, and charging on and on and on through the darkness."
"To the foot of the hill and across the bottom, and up the opposite"
"slope. I do not know how far we had sped, when Steve's voice was"
"heard, calling on us to halt."
"'Pull up! pull up!' he cried, with an angry oath. 'It is a false"
alarm! What fool set it going? There is no one behind us. Donner und
Blitzen! where is Martin?'
"The horses were beginning to flag, and gladly came to a trot, and then"
to a walk.
'Here! I panted.
"'Himmel! I thought we had ridden you down!' he said, leaving my lady's"
side. His voice shook with passion and loss of breath. 'Who was it? We
"might all have broken our necks, and for nothing!'"
The Waldgrave--it was his stirrup I had caught--turned his horse
round. 'I heard them--close behind us!' he panted. There was a note of
"wildness in his voice. My elbow was against his knee, and I felt him"
tremble.
"'A bird in the hedge,' Steve said rudely. 'It has cost some one dear."
Whose horse was it struck him?'
No one answered. I left the Waldgrave's side and went back a few
"paces. The women were sobbing. Ernst and Jacob stood by them,"
breathing hard after their run. I thought the men's silence strange. I
looked again. There was a figure missing; a horse missing.
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his
"room, I know."""
"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""

Index under the highest title:

"Dormer Stanhope)_. _Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)_."
"Cross-reference from _Stanhope_. _Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroi, Duc"

Authors should be put under their names. The definition of a name is
"""that by which a person or thing is known."" Noblemen are known by their"
"titles, not by their family names."
In the few cases in which the family name[50] or a lower title is
"decidedly better known, index under that and cross-reference from"
"the title: e.g., _Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam_; _Robert Curzon,"
"14th Baron Zouche_; _John Napier, Baron of Merchiston_; _Horace"

"princes of the French Empire: e.g., _Lucien Bonaparte, Prince de"
"Canino_; _McMahon, Duc de Magenta_."
Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be treated by the following
rules. In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries above her
"own rank she takes her husband's title in exchange for her own,"
if below her own rank she keeps her own title.
(_a_) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.

"""Sid, I haven't played square,"" Lavender suddenly blurted out,"
"flushing. ""We promised to tell one another if any one of us found out"

Lavender's admission faded beside the fact that he knew something.

"the pirates any more. And the laugh's sort o' on me, anyway, because I"
"thought we were all crazy to suspect Jed Starrow."""

Lav leaned against the rail. To tell his story meant confessing his
state of mind.

"""It's morning--daylight. See--there--"""
"""Oh--h!"" Pola whimpered. ""Is that all?"" She clung to Sidney in fresh"
"terror. ""If we're going to die--I'd rather not _see_--"""
"""Hark,"" cried Mart, suddenly leaning forward. ""Don't you hear"
"something? Girls, that's a motor boat! I _know_! Quick. Let's signal!"
"Yell! Wave something! _Anything!_"" She sprang to her feet, leaning her"
body against the rail for support as the boat rolled in the heavy sea.
"She cupped her hands to her lips and shouted lustily. ""Come on, girls!"""
she commanded.
"""Maybe it's the pirates,"" wailed Pola."
"""I don't care if it is! I don't care _what_ it is!"" And Mart and Sidney"
lifted their chorus.
"Out of the mist that lay over the surging water a small, gray object"
gradually shaped. The chug-chug of an engine now came distinctly to
their ears. After a little they could make out the forms of two men
standing. And then someone shouted faintly.
"Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face, clung to Sidney."
"""Girls,"" she whispered, ""We're going to be saved! And I'll never forget"
this night--never. Or you two. Or what you've done! Or what you _are_.
"And I'm never going to get over being ashamed of myself!"""
Sidney had some solemn resolutions of her own shaping in her heart but
the moment gave her no time to pronounce them.
"“_Allons d’ici_,” she whispered, turning a terrified glance around."
The man raised his hat to his companions and signed to her to come. He
"was a handsome, careless, dissipated-looking fellow, with curly hair and"
a twirled black moustache; short and slightly made. He wore a Tyrolese
hat and a very low turned-down collar and a great silk bow outside
his waistcoat. There was a devil-may-care charm in his swagger as
he walked--also an indefinable touch of vulgarity; the type of the
_cabotin_ in easy circumstances.
"Yvonne, more dead than alive, followed him through the deserted _salle"
"des jeux_ on to the quiet bit of verandah, and sank into a chair that he"
"offered. She looked at him, still white to the lips."
“You?”
"“Yes,” he said laughingly, “why not? It is not astonishing.”"
"“But I thought you dead!” gasped Yvonne, trembling."
"“_A la bonne heure!_ And I seem a ghost. Oh, I am solid. Pinch me. But"
how did you come to learn? Ah! I remember it was given out in Paris. A
"_canard_. It was in the hospital--paralysis, _ma chère_. See, I can only"
"just move my arm now. _Cétait la verte, cette sacrée verte--_”"
"“Absinthe?” asked Yvonne, almost mechanically."
"He nodded, went through the motions of preparing the drink, and laughed."
"“I had a touch lately,” he went on. “That was the second. The third I"
shall be _prrrt--flambé!_ They tell me to give it up. Never in life.”
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my
"family--never!  It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!"""
Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"
and the sound of her words:
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I was dead!  I DO!"""

"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily

Blotte laughed:

waking life. It may be worth while to bring forward a few dreams which
incidentally illustrate the moral attitude of the dreamer.
A lady narrated the following dream immediately on awakening: 'I had
murdered a woman from some moral or political motive--I forget what--and
had come in great agony to my husband with her shoes and watch-chain. He
"promised to help me, and while I was wondering what could be done for"
"the benefit of the woman's family, some one came in and announced that a"
"lecture was about to be given on the beauty of nakedness. I then went,"
with several prim and respectable ladies of my acquaintance [the names
"were given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who--so far as appearance"
"is concerned--was a well-known Member of Parliament, then entered and"
"gave a most eloquent address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc."
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason people are shocked at
nakedness is that they usually only see unbeautiful bodies which repel
"them because they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand, and"
"Andrews said scornfully, ""Without a doubt, a man of your age and build"
"could wipe up the lifeship with me."""
"Norton chuckled. ""Don't count on your age being good protection,"
Andrews. You may push me far enough to make me forget that you're a
"decrepit old man who has to buy what your physique can't get you."""
"""Now see here!"" roared Andrews."
*       *       *       *       *
He was stopped short by Norton who took one long step forward to grasp
"him by the coat lapels. Andrews' face went white, because he was"
looking into the face of dark anger. Norton's other hand was clenched
"in a large, tight fist. He eyed the older man sourly for a minute, then"
shoved him backward to collapse in a chair.
"""What are you trying to do?"" sneered Norton. ""Make me mad enough to"
clip you so you can yell 'Foul!'? I know as well as you do that the law
doesn't even recognize taunts and tongue-lashings as contributory to
"assault."""
"Alice got up from her couch and stood between them. ""Stop it, both of"
"you!"" she cried. ""Stop it!"""
"Norton's anger subsided. ""All right,"" he said to Andrews. ""Now that"
"we've all had our lungs exercised, I'll go below and pedal that"
"generator. Alice, you can have the bathroom first. Andrews, you take it"
"with what she leaves. Is that okay?"""

_were_ my mother.”
"“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I shall believe that you are a tyrant.”"
"“A tyrant? I? Horri—no, I wish I was. What a model of propriety you"
are! I never should have thought it—I mean—darling! you were always
"such a coquette, you know. Not that I ever thought so. You know I never"
"did—oh, hang it all—but if I let you have your own way in this"
unreasonable—I mean this perfectly natural whim—you might at least
"promise to marry me in a month. And, indeed, I think that if you are an"
"angel, I am a saint.”"
"“Well, on one condition.”"
“Any! Any!”
“It must be an absolute secret until the wedding is over. I hate
"congratulations, and if we are going to have a sensation we might as"
well have a good concentrated one.”
"“I agree with you, and I’ll never find fault with you again. You—”"
Miss Decker almost ran into the room.
"“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr. Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother"
"has one of her terrible attacks, and I must ask you to stay with her"
while I go for the doctor myself. I cannot trust servants.”
“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy. “I’ll bring him back in a quarter
of an hour. Who shall—”

"""Yes.  A child is coming.  They have made her tell.  It means the"
"cancelling of her engagements, of course--and other things."""
Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
"""Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.--Wagge can do?"""
Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""He is rabid--a rabid man of his class is dangerous.  A lot of money will"
"be wanted, I should think--some blood, perhaps."""
"He moved swiftly to her, and said very low:"
"""Gyp, it is a year since I told you of this.  You did not believe me"
"then.  I told you, too, that I loved you.  I love you more, now, a"
"hundred times!  Don't move!  I am going up to Gustav."""
"He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came"
back past the line of the window.  The expression of his face was quite
"changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him.  And that"
"must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to"
"kiss her lips; she wrenched back, and he could only reach her throat, but"
"that he kissed furiously.  Letting her go as suddenly, he bent his head"
and went out without a look.
"Gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand,"
"dumbly, mechanically thinking: ""What have I done to be treated like this?"
Her face was pale and drawn; her smile was as abstract as the mystery on
the lips of the Mona Lisa. She laid a hand on the suitcase.
"""We had our first quarrel over it, remember? We went to Puerto Rico for"
"that week and I wanted to use mine but you said, 'Goddamn it, if you're"
"ashamed of my suitcase you're ashamed of me, so the hell with it.'"""
"""I remember."""
"He sat down beside her, lit a cigarette, and then dropped it on the"
floor and stepped on it. They both looked straight ahead.

"""That's impossible."""
"""I know, but take me with you."""
"""There will be no money. I'll live in a stuffy room somewhere."""
"""What difference does that make? Take me."""

"""I don't have any job. I quit. I was halfway through a piece of"

appreciate all you've done but I'm leaving now. The pencils are all
sharpened on my desk and the next girl can have the new leather-bound

"we'll have to stay."""

"Pola waved her hand toward her mother. ""Yes, mamma!"" Then, to Sidney,"
"""Isn't it simply rare our meeting like this? It shows how small the"
"world is. I must run now! By-by!"" She gave the slightest flip of her"
"hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning, ran lightly up the wharf"
toward her mother.
"Sidney's eyes followed her, devouring her dainty clothes, the"
"tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled pumps. Pola--the Pola she had"
"carried enshrined in her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She"
"had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere, had planned just what it"
would be like and what she'd say and what Pola would say. And now Pola
had turned a shoulder upon it.
Mart's laugh behind her roused her.
"""Who's Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her just in time--we might a"
"hurt the doll-baby!"""
"Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. ""She's a friend of mine,"" she cried, in"
"a voice she made rough to keep the tears from it. ""And she's _not_ a"
"doll-baby."""
"""All right--go and play with her then--she's crazy about you, I guess."""
"And with that Mart swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in the"

Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide her humiliation and her

"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.

"""Here, sir,"" said the ambassador."
"""Who told you to start a row?"" demanded the skipper.  ""Don't you know"
your duty?  You was to give 'em the hultimatum and retire dignified.
"Do you call it retirin' dignified to run and beller like a bull-calf?"""
Simcox looked sulky and injured.
"""How was I to look dignified with six of 'em after me--and two with"
"knives and one with a meat-chopper?"" he asked.  ""And as for startin'"
"a rough house, 'twas Hart as done it."""
"""Where's Hart?"" yelled the Guffin."
"""'Ere, 'Art, where are you?"" said the crowd."
"""I believe he's a prisoner,"" said Lampert."
"""Oh, Lord,"" said the crowd, ""but Jack never 'ad no discretion."""
"""We must 'ave him liberated,"" said the skipper firmly.  ""No man of"
with uneasy feet on the lopsided deck.
"""They're standin' upon the 'ill as thick as pea-sticks,"" said one of"
the boys.
"""Speak hup,"" roared the skipper."
The crew shoved old Mac in front.
"""We've revolved the notion up and over,"" said Mac, ""and we've come to"
"the conclusion, sir, there ain't nothin' to be got by sendin'"
"ignorant men like we on such errands."""
The skipper hiccupped angrily.
"""Who asted you to think?  But I ain't the man to press unwilling"
"lubbers into goin' aloft, _I_ can lead the way.  Go into the"
"fo'castle, you dogs, and consider yourselves under arrest.  Go!"""
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, ""but we're all in our own custody, so we"
"are.  Now what's the old man goin' to do?"""
They watched him from the fo'castle as he staggered into his own part
of the ship.
"""I'll be my own hambassador,"" said Jones.  ""I'll show 'em 'ow to work"
things with dignity; I'll show that ass Lampert what's o'clock.  What
"you wants in such cases made and provided is tact, and go, and"
innerds.  Innerds is the chief need.  Why fight if palaver'll do?
Where I was wrong was to send a galoot like Simcox.  But what could I

"'ave made peace afore there was a row."""
"her life; she was never quite happy. It was all my doing. Still, I think"
"she was happier with me, in spite of it."""
"A movement of impatience escaped from Alicia. Seeing it he added,"
"""I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think hardly of her."""
"""I don't want to think of her at all. Was she--was she like Daisy?"""
"""Yes; but prettier."""
"""I don't know what you expect me to say,"" she exclaimed. ""I know--I"
suppose some men don't think much of--of a thing like that. To me it is
"horrible. You simply followed your-- Ah, I can't speak of it!"" and she"
seemed to put him from her with a gesture of disgust.
"He walked beside her in silence, his face set in the bitter smile it"
always wore when fate dealt hardly with him.
"""I think I'll go straight home,"" she said, stopping suddenly. ""You can"
"join the others."""
"""Yes, that will be best. I'm not due at the Council just yet."""
"""I suppose I ought to thank you for telling me the truth. I--"" Her false"
composure suddenly gave way. With a sob she stretched out her hands
"towards him, crying, ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and before he"
"could answer her she turned and walked swiftly away, leaving him"
standing still on the pathway.
She was hardly inside the gates of Government House when she saw Eleanor
"Scaife, who hurried to meet her."
"Spriggs's part, for as he was sailing off the west end of Cuba he again"
met the man-of-war which had so nearly caught him before in the bay.
"Spriggs clapped on all sail, but ran his ship on Rattan Island, where she"
"was burnt by the _Spence_, while Captain Spriggs and his crew escaped to"
the woods.
"SPRINGER, CAPTAIN."
He fought gallantly with Sawkins and Ringrose in the Battle of Perico off
"Panama on St. George's Day in 1680. He gave his name to Springer's Cay,"
one of the Samballoes Islands. This was the rendezvous chosen by the
"pirates, where Dampier and his party found the French pirate ship that"
rescued them after their famous trudge across the Isthmus of Darien.
"STANLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
With a few other buccaneers in their stronghold at New Providence Island
"in 1660, withstood an attack by a Spanish fleet for five days. The three"
"English captains, Stanley, Sir Thomas Whetstone, and Major Smith, were"
carried to Panama and there cast into a dungeon and bound in irons for
seventeen months.
"STEDMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"In 1666, with Captain Searle and a party of only eighty men, he took and"
"plundered the Dutch island of Tobago. Later on, after the outbreak of war"
"with France, he was captured by a French frigate off the Island of"
"Guadeloupe. Stedman had a small vessel and a crew of only 100 men, and"
"found himself becalmed and unable to escape, so he boldly boarded the"
"""What is your name, Girl--your real name?"""
"""Min--Minnie; my father's name was Smith,"" she told him, her eyes cast"
down under delicately tremulous lids.
"""Oh, Minnie Sm--"""
"""But 'twa'n't his right name,"" quickly corrected the Girl, and"
"unconsciously both rose to their feet. ""His right name was Falconer."""
"""Minnie Falconer--well, that is a pretty name,"" commented Johnson; and"
raising her hand to his lips he pressed them against it.
"""I ain't sure that's what he said it was--I ain't sure o' anythin' only"
"jest you,"" she said coyly, burying her face in his neck."
"""You may well be sure of me since I've loved--"" Johnson's sentence was"
"cut short, a wave of remorse sweeping over him. ""Turn your head away,"
"Girl, and don't listen to me,"" he went on, gently putting her away from"
"him. ""I'm not worthy of you. Don't listen but just say no, no, no, no."""
"The Girl, puzzled, was even more so when Johnson began to pace the"
floor.
"""Oh, I know--I ain't good enough for you !"" she cried with a little"
"tremour in her voice. ""But I'll try hard, hard . . . If you see"
"anythin' better in me, why don't you bring it out, 'cause I've loved you"
"ever since I saw you first, 'cause I knowed that you--that you were the"
"right man."""
"""The right man,"" repeated Johnson, dismally, for his conscience was"
"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?"
Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”
"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell"
over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his
youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was
"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not"
for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone
rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of
"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"
I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”
"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."
"“Oh, dear! I wish they would not fight at your school, Tom. Didn't it"
hurt you?”
"“Hurt me? No,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large"
"pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at"
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added:
“I gave Spooner a black eye--that's what he got for wanting to leather
me. I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered me.”
"“Oh! how brave you are, Tom. I think you are like Samson. If there came"
"a lion roaring at me, I think you'd fight him, wouldn't you, Tom?”"
"“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no lions"
only in the shows.”
"“No, but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa where it's"
"very hot, the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book"
where I read it.”
"“Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”"
"“But if you hadn't got a gun?--we might have gone out, you know, not"
"thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might come"
"towards us roaring, and we could not get away from him. What should you"
"do, Tom?”"
"Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying: “But the"
lion _isn't_ coming. What's the use of talking?”
This passage illustrates also the difference between the
sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York.
It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.”
The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.
“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to
call time on him sharp?”
“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at
"least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long,"
officer.”
"“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat,"
trying doors as he went.
"There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from"
its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir
in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars
turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store
"the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain"
"almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and"
waited.
"About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,"
"with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite"
side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.
"“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."
"“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s"
"“What very stupid and false ideas,” exclaimed Laura. “Really I"
appreciate having a brother who talks in such a vulgar way.”
“You are an aristocrat and the truth doesn’t please you. But such are
the facts. I can see the chief of the bureau of Papal titles. What fun
he must have thinking up the most appropriate title for a magnate of
Yankee tinned beef or for an illustrious Andean general! How magnificent
it would be to gather all the Bishops _in partibus infidelium_ and all
the people with Papal titles in one drawing-room! The Bishop of Nicaea
discussing with the Marquis of the Holy Roman Empire; the Marchioness of
"Easter Sunday flirting with the Bishop of Sion, while the Patriarchs"
"of Thebes, Damascus, and Trebizond played bridge with the sausage"
"manufacturer, Mr. Smiles, the pork king, or with the illustrious General"
"Pérez, the hero of Guachinanguito. What a moving spectacle it would be!”"
“You are a clown!” said Laura.
"“He is a finished satirist,” added Kennedy."
_CÆSAR’S PLAN_
"After lunch, Laura, Kennedy, and Cæsar went into the salon, and Laura"
introduced the Englishman to the San Martino girls and the Countess
"Brenda. They stayed there chatting until four o’clock, at which time the"
"San Martinos got ready to go out in a motor car, and Laura, with the"
"Countess and her daughter, in a carriage."
Cæsar and Kennedy went into the street together.
"“You are awfully well fixed here,” said Kennedy, “with no Americans, no"
"""Thank you, sir."""
"After Frank Corson left, Superintendent Maynard sorted a memo out of the"
pile on his desk. The memo concerned Frank Corson. Superintendent
Maynard reread it and thought how well things usually worked out. Now it
wouldn't be necessary to have that talk with Corson about sloppy work.
Obviously there had been something on the young intern's mind for weeks
"now. Too bad. But let the Minnesota hospital, wherever it was, worry"
about the trouble and perhaps put Corson on the right track again.
He was their baby now.
Maynard took Corson's card from the files and wrote across it: _Transfer
approved with regret._

Brent Taber stood in the shelter of a doorway on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan and watched an entrance across the street. He had been there
for over an hour.
Another hour passed and Taber shifted from one aching foot to the other
as a man in a blue suit emerged from the entrance and moved off down the
street.
"When the man had turned a corner, Taber crossed over and looked up at"
the brownstone. It was a perfect place to hide--one of the many rooming
"houses in the city where, if you paid your rent and kept your peace, no"
one cared who you were or where you came from.
"Not even, Taber reflected, if you had been born in a laboratory and had"
“Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger boy with the intention of
"getting us out to look for you. He believed, of course, that we would"
regard the call for help as coming from you and rush away from camp.”
"“Don’t be too sure of that,” warned Ned. “There’s something about that"
"boy I rather like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf Patrol,"
New York.”
“My own patrol?” exclaimed Jimmie. “I never saw him at the club room. He
"told me that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I didn’t believe it. I"
think he’s a fake.”
"“Time alone will tell,” answered Ned. “I’m going to believe in the boy"
until I get some positive proof that he really is crooked.”
Jimmie was about to continue the argument when a succession of shrieks
and calls for help came from the forest on the slope below.
"“Now, what’s that?” demanded Jimmie. “That isn’t any of our boys!”"
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the voice.
"“No,” Ned agreed, “our boys don’t make a racket like that.”"
"“Say!” Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet. “I bet you the next dollar"
"I don’t find that that’s the fat clerk, Gilroy!”"
"“The voice sounds like that of a fat man,” Ned laughed."
“Gilroy’s fat all right!” Jimmie exclaimed. “He’s got one of those pink
baby faces that make you hungry to look at. He makes me think of a roast
"""When do you propose to make the start, Colonel?"" Nicholson asked."
"""Within an hour. The night favors us. The women must be kept in the"
center as much as possible. I have given Geoffries special charge over
them. They will be told at the last moment. There is no use in
"spoiling what little rest they have had."" He drew out a pencil and"
"began to scribble a despatch on the back of an old letter. ""I advise"
"you gentlemen to do likewise,"" he said. ""Very often a piece of paper"
"gets through where a man can not, and it is our bounden duty to supply"
"the morning periodicals with as much news as possible."""
For some minutes there was no sound save that of the pencils scrawling
the last messages of men with the seal of death already stamped upon
"their foreheads. All three had forgotten Travers, and yet from the"
moment they had begun to speak he had been awake and listening. He sat
"up now, leaning upon his elbow."
"""Nicholson!"" he said faintly."
Nicholson turned and came to his side.
"""Hullo!"" he said. ""Awake, are you? How are you?"""
Travers made no immediate answer; he took Nicholson's hand in a
feverish clasp and drew him nearer.
"""I am in great pain,"" he said. ""You don't need to pretend. I know. The"
fear of death has been on me all day. Just now I am not afraid. Is
"there no hope?"""
"""You mean--for us? None."""
"what's the use of jaw?  I say get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"""
"""Don't ask me,"" said old Mac.  ""I was thinkin' that mighty soon we'd"
"be able to settle that question about the buildin' of the _Potluck_."""
And as by this time Jones was calming down and was rather inclined to
"cry, Lampert came up to the restive crowd."
"""You dry up, Hart,"" he said roughly.  ""Until the ship's broken up,"
"you're on the articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."""
"""Yes, sir,"" said Hart respectfully."
"Until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and foc'sle,"
"discussing whether they were on one of the Crozets or what, and"
"whether they would stay long there, and if so what, and so on."
And just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful
surprise.  They saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level
with the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where it had gone short
in the cap.
"""The bloomin' hisland's in'abited,"" cried a foremast hand, and every"
one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
"""Wod's the bloke say?"" asked the crowd.  ""Oh, say it again!""  And the"
stranger said it again.
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.
"""I believe the silly galoot don't talk English,"" cried Hart; ""'ere,"
"where's Dutchy?"""
"instant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables"
and sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship
"commenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was"
still aboard her.
"In the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,"
"but nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and"
landing and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by
a Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight
"Rackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal."
"On November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,"
convicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed
"as men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate"
"fashion, to Rackam."
"On the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,"
"to visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was ""that she was"
"sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have"
"been hanged like a Dog."""
"Rackam was hanged on November 17th, 1720, at Gallows Point, at Port Royal,"
Jamaica.

Much dreaded by the merchant sailors navigating the South Atlantic. In
1822 he controlled a fleet of pirate vessels in the vicinity of Cape
Antonio.
"""Looks like too little, too late."" He stretched beside her."
"""What did she mean just now? About our 'contribution'?"""
"""Probably the protocol. My guess is she wants to see it destroyed."
Let's hope that'll be the end of it. The godfather's got his money. And
"Alex's problem is solved permanently."""
"Now Kenji Nogami was entering the room, an island of Zen-like calm"
amidst all the bedlam.
"""Michael, I'm so sorry."" He stepped over. ""When the money didn't show"
"up as scheduled, they called Jiro Sato and he suggested they try here."
"There was nothing I could do."""
"Vance nodded. ""That's how I figured it'd be played. We didn't move fast"
"enough on this end. It was my fault."""
"""Too bad. We came close."" He sighed. ""But I'm not going to underwrite"
"the rest of those bogus debentures. He'll have to kill me."""
"""And he'll probably do just that. The hell with it. You tried, we all"
tried. Now it looks like Tanzan Mino's scam is going to go through
whether we play or not. You might as well save your own skin. With any
"luck, we can still sort out our end, but you--you're going to have to be"
"dealing with that bastard for years to come. Think about it."""
"""I'm still deciding,"" he said finally. ""Let's wait and see how things"
"go."""
"""Alex opted for suicide. You shouldn't follow his lead."""
"'Then now go! Go out, do you hear?' she cried, stamping her foot with"
passion. 'I want nothing. Go!'
I turned and crept towards the door like a beaten hound. But I was not
"to go; when my hand was on the latch, her mood changed."
"'No, stay,' she said in a different tone. 'You may come back. After"
"all, Martin, I had rather it was you than any one else.'"
"She dried her tears as she spoke, standing up very straight and proud,"
and hiding nothing. I felt a pang as I looked at her. I had neglected
her of late. I had been thinking more of others.
"'It is nothing, Martin,' she said after a pause, and when she had"
quite composed her face. 'You need not be frightened. All women cry a
"little sometimes, as men swear,' she added, smiling."
"'You have been looking at that thing outside,' I said, grumbling."
"'Perhaps it did upset me,' she replied. 'But I think it was that I"
felt--a little lonely.'
"That sounded so strange a complaint on her lips, seeing that the echo"
"of the young sparks' laughter was barely dead in the room, that I"
"stared. But I took it, on second thoughts, to refer to Fraulein Max,"
"whom she had kept at a distance since our escape, never sitting down"
"with her, or speaking to her except on formal occasions; and I said"
bluntly--
"'You need a woman friend, my lady.'"
"Well, it was not much to go away with, but perhaps that doesn't matter. As"
long as one has a reason to go away.

"Later in the forenoon Eilert returned home. He was alone, but he came up"
the path carrying one of the knapsacks--the larger one. He was in a
"furious temper, and kept saying they'd better not try it on him--no,"
they'd just better not.
Of course it was the bill again.
"""She'll probably have a good deal of this sort of trouble,"" I thought to"
"myself, ""but no doubt she'll get used to it, and take it as nonchalantly"
"as it should be taken. There are worse things."""
"But the fact remains that it was I that upset them, I that had driven them"
away without their clothes; perhaps they had really expected some money to
be sent here--who knows?
"I got hold of Eilert. How big was the bill? What, was that all? ""Good"
"heavens! Here you are, here's your money; now row across to them at once"
"with their clothes!"""
"But it all proved in vain, for the strangers had gone; they had arrived"
"just in time for the boat, and were aboard it at that very moment."
"Well, there was no help for it."
"""Here's their address,"" says Eilert. ""We can send the clothes next"
"Thursday; that's the next trip the boat goes south again."""

The character of his relations towards them was confirmed by the
"appearance of his clothes, which, as a rule, were tidy, and cleaner"
"than those of his companions.  And now, sitting at the door of the"
"dosshouse, he boastingly related that for a long time past Redka had"
"been asking him to go and live with her, but he had not gone because he"
did not want to part with the company.  They heard this with jealous
"interest.  They all knew Redka.  She lived very near the town, almost"
"below the mountain.  Not long ago, she had been in prison for theft."
"She was a retired nurse; a tall, stout peasant woman, with a face"
"marked by smallpox, but with very pretty, though always drunken, eyes."

dull laugh.
"""Upon whom?"" asked Abyedok, edging away from him."
"""It's all the same to me ... Petunikoff ... Egorka ... or even you!"""
"""And why?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"she asked in a low, intense voice.  ""You have forgotten me for three"
"whole years until now."""
"""I know--I know!""  I cried.  ""Forgive me."""
"""I have already forgiven,"" she said, allowing her hand still to remain"
"in mine.  ""But I have been thinking to-day--thinking ever so much."""
"Her voice was weak and faltering, and I saw that she was not herself."
"""Thinking of what?"""
"""Of you.  I have been wondering whether, if I had died, you would have"
"sometimes remembered me?"""
"""Remembered you?""  I said earnestly.  ""Why, of course, dearest.  Why do"
"you speak in such a melancholy tone?"""
"""Because--well, because I am unhappy, Gerald!"" she cried, bursting into"
"sudden tears.  ""Ah! you do not know how I suffer--you can never know!"""
"I bent and stroked her hair, that beautiful red-gold hair that I had so"
often heard admired in the great salons in Brussels.  It had been bound
"but lightly by her maid, and was secured by a blue ribbon.  She had"
"apologised for receiving me thus, but declared that her head ached, and"
"it was easier so.  Doctor Deane had called twice that morning, and had"
pronounced her entirely out of danger.
"""But why are you suffering?""  I asked, caressing her and striving to"
"charm away her tears.  ""Cannot you confide in me?"""
"She shook her head in despair, and her body was shaken by a convulsive"
"""Yolande--Yolande!""  I called, touching her cheek in an effort to awaken"
"her, for I could not believe that she was actually dead."
But there was no response.  Those blanched lips and the coldness of
those cheeks told their own tale.  She had passed to that land which
lies beyond the range of human vision.
How long I stood there I cannot tell.  My thoughts were inexpressibly
"sad ones, and the discovery had utterly upset me, so that I scarcely"
knew what I said or did.  The blow of thus finding her lifeless crushed
"me.  The affair was mysterious, to say the least of it.  Of a sudden,"
"however, the sobs of the grief-stricken Countess aroused me to a sense"
"of my responsibility, and taking her hand I led her from the bedside"
into an adjoining room.
"""How has this terrible catastrophe occurred?""  I demanded of her"
"breathlessly.  ""Only two hours ago she was well and happy."""
"""You mean when you saw her?"" she said.  ""What was the object of your"
"call?"""
"""To see her,"" I responded."
"""And yet you parted ill friends in Brussels?"" she observed in a tone of"

I hesitated.  I could not tell her that I suspected her daughter to be a

"While walking from the Bridge to the Old Swan, I remarked to Frances, ""My"
"engagement with Mary Hamilton is likely to be broken by her family."""
"""Why, Baron Ned?"" she asked in surprise."
"""Count Hamilton has challenged me to a duel, to be fought when he"
"returns, and you see, if I kill him or if he kills me, well--"" I"
"answered, shrugging my shoulders."
"She was much alarmed at my disclosure, but was reassured when I made"
"light of the affair, probably because there was no danger in it to George"
"Hamilton, and, perhaps, because if I should kill Count Hamilton, George"
would inherit the title and estates.
"""But poor Mary! She will grieve,"" said Frances."
"""I think you need waste no tears for her sake,"" I answered. ""She is a"
"fine, pretty little creature, who will take what comes her way without"
excess of pain or joy. She is incapable of feeling keenly. God has been
"good to her in giving her numbness."""
"""No, no, cousin Ned, you are wrong!"" she returned. ""Life without pain"
"is not worth living. I have heard that the Arabs have a saying, 'All"
sunshine makes the desert.' God is good to us when he darkens the sun
"now and then and gives us the sunshine afterwards."""
"""Perhaps you are right, Frances,"" I returned. ""But you and I are in the"
"cloud now, and a little sunshine would be most welcome."""
"""Not enough sunshine to make a desert,"" she answered."

"understand."""
"""But I thought,"" said El Sarria, astonished for the first time, ""that"
both you and Don Rollo understood the crabbed gipsy tongue! Have I not
"heard you speak it together?"""
"""As it is commonly spoken--yes,"" she replied, ""we have talked many a"
time for sport. But this which is spoken by the Sergeant and La Giralda
"is deep Romany, the like of which not half a dozen in Spain understand."
"It is the old-world speech of the Rom, before it became contaminated by"
"the jargon of fairs and the slang of the travelling horse-clipper."""
"""Then,"" said El Sarria, slowly, ""it comes to this--'tis you and not I"
"who mistrust these two?"""
"""No, that I do not,"" cried Concha, emphatically; ""I have tried La"
"Giralda for many years and at all times found her faithful, so that her"
bread be well buttered and a draught of good wine placed alongside it.
"But the Sergeant is a strong man and a secret man----"""
"""Well worth the watching, then?"" said El Sarria, looking her full in the"
face.
Concha nodded.
"""Carlist or no, he works for his own hand,"" she said simply."
"""Shall ye mention the matter to Don Rollo?"" asked El Sarria."
"""Nay--what good?"" said Concha, quickly; ""Don Rollo is brave as a bull of"
"Jaen, but as rash. You and I will keep our eyes open and say nothing."
"""Waynsford, by Jove!"" ejaculated Terence. ""Bless you, Dick, I never"
"expected to see you here and in this rig. What has happened?"""
"""Oh, I chucked the Motor Boat Reserve,"" declared Waynsford. ""It was a"
"bit too dull. They sent me to Southampton, and that was the limit. A"
"superannuated postman could have done my job, which was delivering"
letters to transports. So I applied for the Naval Air Service. It's
"more in my line."""
"""Been across yet?"" asked Terence, indicating the twenty odd mile"
strip of water that separated Great Britain from the scene of land
hostilities.
"""Dunkirk twice,"" replied Waynsford. ""Was there when the Germans"
started shelling the place. But we're off again early to-morrow
"morning."""
"""Yes, I heard,"" said Aubyn. ""Big operations. We are to engage the"
Zeebrugge and Ostend batteries while the Allied airmen play with the
"German lines of communication. So I may see something of you."""
"""I hope so--after the fun is over,"" replied the young airman. ""Well,"
I must be moving. Early hours and a good night's rest are essential
"to this sort of work."""
"The two friends parted, Terence making for the hotel, while Waynsford"
"walked off in the direction of the castle, in which the airmen"
detailed for the great raid were temporarily quartered.
Precisely at one hour before sunrise the first British waterplane
rose from the surface of Dover Harbour. Almost simultaneously an Army

Vivie then went on to read with eyes that could hardly take in the
words a list of other names of men and women condemned to long terms
of hard labour for the same offence--assisting young Belgians to
"leave the Belgium that was under German occupation. And further,"
"the information that of the five condemned to death, _Philip Bauck_"
and _Edith Cavell_ had already been _executed_.

The monsters! Oh that von Bissing. How gladly she would die if she
might first have the pleasure of killing him! That pompous old man
"of seventy-one with the blotched face, who had issued orders that"
wherever he passed in his magnificent motor he was to be saluted
"with Eastern servility, who boasted of his ""tender heart,"" so that"
he issued placards about this time punishing severely all who split
the tongues of finches to make them sing better. Edith Cavell--she
did not pause to consider the fate of patriotic Belgian women--but
"Edith Cavell, directress of a nursing home in Brussels, known far"
"and wide for her goodness of heart. She had held aloof from Vivie,"
but was that to be wondered at when there was so much to make her
"suspect--living, seemingly, under the protection of a German"
"week...!"""
"""Das macht nichts. The rooms are wanted and I won't have you on the"
"premises. Off you go, or these soldiers shall take you both round to"
"the Kommandantur."""
"""But our luggage? _Surely_ you will let me go up to our room and"
"pack it--and take it away? We..."""
"""Your luggage has been packed and is in the corridor. If you send"
"round for it, it shall be delivered to your messenger. But you are"
"not to stop on the premises another minute. You understand?"" he"
almost shrieked.
"""But--"""
"For answer, the soldiers took them by the shoulders and whirled"
"them through the revolving door on to the pavement, where a crowd"
"began to collect, as it does in peace or war if you cough twice or"
"sneeze three times in Brussels. ""Englische Hure! Englische"
"Küpplerin,"" shouted the soldiers as they retreated and locked the"
revolving door. Mrs. Warren turned purple and swayed. Vivie caught
her round the waist with her strong arm.... Thus was Mrs. Warren
ejected from the once homely inn which she had converted by her
"energy, management and capital into the second most magnificent"
hostelry of Brussels; thus was Vivie expelled from the place of her
birth....
Hearing the shouting and seeing the crowd a Belgian gendarme came
"up. To him Vivie said, ""Si vous êtes Chrétien et pas Allemand--"""
"""Prenez garde, Madame,"" he said warningly--""Vous m'aiderez à porter"
"ma mère à quelqu' endroit ou elle peut se remettre..."""
"""You need not assure me of that,"" I answered, taking Betty's hand. ""I"
"already know it. I am glad you--"""
"But here I was interrupted by a soft cry from Bettina, and by a"
"half-smothered scream from Frances, both of whom deserted me suddenly"
"and ran toward the door I had just entered. Turning, I saw Frances with"
"her arms about the Abbé's neck, and Bettina clasping one of his hands."
"I thought the two had gone mad, but when Bettina saw my look of surprise"
"and inquiry, she dropped his hand, came to me, and asked:--"
"""Did you want us to pretend that we did not know him? If so, you should"
"have told us."""
"""But you don't know him,"" I declared."
"""Perhaps I don't,"" she returned, laughing softly and shrugging her"
"shoulders, ""but evidently your cousin does. If not, she should take her"
"arms from around his neck."""
"""But she is mistaken,"" I insisted."
"""She seems to be convinced,"" answered Bettina, with a curious little"
"glance up to me, half laughing, half inquiring. Evidently she was"
doubtful whether I spoke in jest or in earnest.
"Frances still clung to the Abbé, her head resting on his shoulder, so I"
"started toward her, intending to correct her mistake. Bettina, seeing my"
"purpose, caught me by the arm, saying:--"
"""Don't you really know?"""
"The Abbé turned his face toward me, and when I caught a glimpse of his"
"Yes, they were all satisfied. The Lieutenant pronounced it ""blendend"""
(dazzling). They had not eaten so much and such good food for months and
"months. Oh it was good to be out of the fighting. Yes, their treatment"
was perfect--except for the thieving. Why were British soldiers allowed
"to steal the buttons, caps, rings, and watches belonging to their"
prisoners?
"A German private, a tall thin man with bushy eyebrows, who had not"
"spoken hitherto, said he didn't mind losing a few buttons--but to rob a"
"man of his marriage ring, that was very mean--eine Gemeinheit--his"
marriage ring had been taken from him: he would have lost anything
"rather than that, for it always reminded him of home."
The boy from East Prussia said he didn't care what they took from him as
long as they didn't take his life. He was safe now and nothing else
mattered. He spoke with a Polish accent.
I asked him what town he came from.
"""Allenstein."""
"""Did you see anything of the Russians in 1914?"""
"""Jawohl""--he had seen plenty of Russian troops. They behaved very well."
"""Die sind besser als die Deutschen--They're better than the Germans...."""
"But the theatre orderly interrupted us and asked us to ""send two or"
"three across."""
I went to the Prep. to see if there were any new arrivals. It was full
once again and the wounded were streaming into the station.
"“Phoebe,” she said, when the angular and jilted maid appeared, “we are"
"going to keep house for my nephew, Mr. Risca, and a young lady whom"
he has adopted. Will you tell me one thing? Is the lady of the house
supposed to clean the gentlemen's pipes?”
"“My father is a non-smoker, as well as a teetotaler, miss,” replied"
Phoebe.
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Lindon. “It's going to be a great puzzle.”
CHAPTER VII
"IT was a puzzle to John as much as to the palpitating lady, and in the"
maze of his puzzledom the gleam of humour that visited him during
"their interview lost its way. Walter Herold's eyes, however, twinkled"
maliciously when he heard John's account at once rueful and pig-headed.
Then he grew serious.
“It will be comic opera all the time. It can't be done.”
"“It 's going to be done,” said John, obstinately. “There's nothing else"
"to do. If I were a rich man, I could work wonders with a scratch in my"
cheque-book. I could hire an unexceptionable colonel's or clergyman's
widow to do the business. But I'm not. How I'm going to get the house
"together, as it is, I don't know. Besides,” he added, turning with some"
"savageness on his friend, “if you think it a comic-opera idea, kindly"
remember it was you who started it.”
"Though Herold was silenced for the moment, to the back of his mind still"
on his chin.
The butler touched him upon his shirt-sleeve in dignified despair:
"“Gentlemen,” said he--“this is not decent. I repeat--it is not honest.”"
"“Go hon!” said Rippley, punching the old man in the ribs with his"
"elbow, and working away at the fixing of his throat-beard. “Look here,"
"Fluffy,” he called hurriedly--“you and Doome _must_ run this pompous"
old dolt downstairs and shoot him into the cellar--and lock him in.
Quick! or the people will be arriving.... I hear carriage-wheels.”
Robbins and Doome seized the shocked old man and hurried his protesting
stiff being out of the room and down the stairs.
"Rippley followed them to the top of the stairs, making up his disguise"
as he went:
"“Look here, boys,” he called down in a hoarse whisper--“if the old"
fool will swear not to move away from the hall door until we release
him you needn’t put him in the cellar.... What?... Eh?... He says he
surrenders? That’s all right then. Now back with you--quick! or the
guests will be here--or Pangbutt himself.”
There was a loud ring at the door-bell.
Rippley skipped back to the cabinet: and from the cabinet he ran to
Andrew Blotte:
"“Blotte, old boy,” said he, pulling a red wig over the gloomy man’s"
head and combing the lank red hair down the sides of his pale
face--“you must look after the cloak-room and change the tickets and
"""I'll do anything you say,"" promised Pola. ""I'm so curious that I'm"
"fairly bursting."""
"""I don't care, but you'll have to take off your shoes and stockings,"""
"muttered Lav, scarcely looking at Pola."
"""Oh, I'll do that! I'll do _anything_!"" Pola flopped upon the beach and"
"commenced removing her sport shoes. ""And I won't even ask any questions"
"until you're ready to tell me."" Rising, her small feet pink against the"
"sand, she saluted Lav with mock solemnity."
"""There, Captain Lavender Green, I'm at your command."""
Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If any doubt assailed
"them as to the prudence of letting Pola go, their admiration for Pola's"
gameness stilled it. Sidney rolled Pola's shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs. Then the little party
waded out to the dory and embarked.
"""We're going to the _Arabella_,"" Sidney whispered to Pola. She felt"
"Pola shiver, but the girl made no protest. ""We have to go 'round this"
"way so's no one can see us from the harbor. Sh--h!"""
"Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last. With the line from"
the dory in his hand the boy considered.
"""If anyone comes up and sees the dory they'll know someone's aboard."""
"""That's true. What'll we do?"" whispered Sidney, anxiously."
"""We can set her adrift. It's an old tub anyway."""
"""No, by God, you'll not introduce her to the king! I'll explode the whole"
"affair, and Dunkirk may go to the devil before you shall introduce Betty"
"to the king,"" I answered."
"""Yet you are willing that I should meddle in the dangerous affair?"
"Evidently you love her more than you love me?"""
"""Only a few hundred million times more,"" I answered sullenly."
"""Is it that way with you, my dear brother?"" she asked, coming to me as I"
"stood gazing out the window, seeing nothing save Bettina's face. Frances"
"put her hand on my shoulder and said coaxingly: ""Forgive me. No harm"
"shall come to her through me."""
"Of course I was sorry that I had allowed myself to become angry, and at"
once made my apology as well as I could.
"""Let us go to see Betty, anyway,"" said Frances. And I assenting, she went"
"to fetch her cloak, hat, and vizard."
"But when she returned, I had changed my mind and declined to go, telling"
Frances that I must see Bettina no more.
"""Why?"" asked Frances."
"""Because I would not win a love from her which I cannot accept."""
"""Baron Ned, there are few men who would be so considerate."""
"But I required little coaxing, and when Frances had made ready for the"
"journey, I buckled on my sword, which I had left standing in the corner,"
"took my hat from the floor, and started out with her."
the human world or the world of nature.
When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the
uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and
"memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging"
"in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the"
beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the
waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering—perhaps a lost—odour—a
"delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment"
"immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own, and"
hers only.
"The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of"
finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next
room—twenty steps away.
"“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her"
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to
cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.
"She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,"
and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk.
He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was
above his ear.
"“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I"
"""You say that all I must do in the meantime is to sign some papers,"" she"
"interrupted. ""You say you won't ask me to marry you right away. Will you"
"wait--a year?"""
"""A year! I couldn't, Sallie!"" he cried, and her pale lips drooped"
piteously again.
"""How long, then?"" she asked in a whisper. ""Six months?"""
"He had made up his mind to be generous, and he felt that he had not"
"failed in his intention as he answered, ""Three months, and not a day"
"longer, Sallie."""
"She sat still and silent for a while, considering that, and then, ""All"
"right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""Take me safe home, and I'll marry you three"
months from the day we get there--if we're both alive when the time
"comes."""
He turned away from her for a moment. He had won all he wanted in the
"meantime, and he could scarcely contain himself. When he presently held"
"out a hand to her, she took it, to bind that bargain."
"""And you won't have any cause to regret it, Sallie,"" he assured her, his"
voice somewhat hoarse in spite of his effort to speak quite naturally.
"""So now, as soon as you're ready, we'll all go ashore together, and--"""
"""I'll be ready in twenty minutes,"" she told him, clasping her hands at"
"her heart, her eyes very eager. ""And, Jasper--you must let me take"
"Ambrizette with me."""
The general shrugged his shoulders and laughed grimly. 'Why not?' he
"said. 'What are waiting-women and the like made for, if not to be"
bribed--or slapped?'
She hated him for that sly hit--if never before; but she controlled
herself. She would throw the burden on him.
"He read the thought, and it led him to change his tone. There was a"
"gloomy fire in his eyes, and smouldering passion in his voice, when he"
spoke again.
"'Well, Countess,' he said, 'I am here for your answer.'"
'To what?'
"'To the question I asked you some time ago,' he rejoined, dwelling on"
her with sullen eyes. 'I asked you to be my wife. Your answer?'
"'Prythee!' she said proudly, 'this is a strange way of wooing.'"
"'It is not of my choice that I woo in company,' he answered, shrugging"
his shoulders. 'My answer; that is all I want--and you.'
"'Then you shall have the first, and not the last,' she exclaimed on a"
"sudden impulse. 'No, no--a hundred times no! If you do not see that by"
"pressing me now,' she continued impetuously, 'when I am alone,"
"friendless, and unprotected, you insult me, you should see it, and I"
do.'
"For a moment there was silence. Then he laughed; but his voice,"
"notwithstanding his mastery over it and in spite of that laugh, shook"
"with rage and resentment. 'As I expected,' he said. 'I knew last night"
and said to the eating-house keeper:
"""Egor Terentievitch Vaviloff?  Are you he?"""
"""I am,"" answered the sergeant, leaning on the bar with both arms as if"
intending to jump over it.
"""I have some business with you,"" said Petunikoff."
"""Delighted.  Please come this way to my private room."""
"They went in and sat down, the guest on the couch and his host on the"
chair opposite to him.  In one corner a lamp was burning before a
"gigantic icon, and on the wall at the other side there were several oil"
"lamps.  They were well kept and shone as if they were new.  The room,"
"which contained a number of boxes and a variety of furniture, smelt of"
"tobacco, sour cabbage, and olive oil.  Petunikoff looked around him and"
"made a face.  Vaviloff looked at the icon, and then they looked"
"simultaneously at one another, and both seemed to be favourably"
"impressed.  Petunikoff liked Vaviloff's frankly thievish eyes, and"
"Vaviloff was pleased with the open, cold, determined face of"
"Petunikoff, with its large cheeks and white teeth."
"""Of course you already know me, and I presume you guess what I am going"
"to say to you,"" began Petunikoff."
"""About the lawsuit? ... I presume?"" remarked the ex-sergeant,"
respectfully.
"""Exactly!  I am glad to see that you are not beating about the bush,"
"but going straight to the point like a business man,"" said Petunikoff,"
encouragingly.

He recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see Nikolai
"Vasilevich Grishkov, the portly Soviet chief mechanic, just emerging"
from the West Quadrant. His bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of Siberian
musk-ox horns above his gleaming dark eyes.
"""Have you seen her?"" Grishkov was shuffling toward him."
"""Seen who?"" He examined the mechanic's spotless white coveralls. Jesus!"
"Even the support crews on this project were all sanitized, high-tech."

For the space of the few minutes while the water closed about her with
delicious coolness Sidney forgot everything in an intoxication of
delight. Presently she came back to the _Arabella_ and climbed aboard
"with a sigh of utter content. ""Thank goodness _I_ haven't any"
"complexes,"" she laughed, shaking the salt drops from her bobbed head."
"""And now what?"""
Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn over his bathing suit.
"""I do not speak of these men, I am thinking of Judas Petunikoff, who is"
"one of them...."""
"""And you say you have nothing to do with them?"" asks the teacher,"
quietly.
"""But do you think that I do not live?  Aha!  I do live, but I suppose I"
ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of
"all freedom by these men."""
"""And they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the Captain, a man"
"living in retirement?"" says Abyedok, teasingly."
"""Very well!  I agree with you that I am foolish.  Being a creature who"
"was once a man, I ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings"
"that once were mine.  You may be right, but then how could I or any of"
"you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings?"""
"""Now then, you are talking sense,"" says the teacher, encouragingly."
"""We want other feelings and other views on life.... We want something"
"new ... because we ourselves are a novelty in this life...."""
"""Doubtless this is most important for us,"" remarks the teacher."
"""Why?"" asks Kanets.  ""Is it not all the same whatever we say or think?"
"We have not got long to live ...  I am forty, you are fifty ... there"
"is no one among us younger than thirty, and even at twenty one cannot"
"live such a life long."""
"""And what kind of novelty are we?"" asked Abyedok, mockingly."
"shot."""
The patrolman wanted to believe. He most pathetically wanted to believe.
"""Honest?"""
"""It's the God's honest truth. No man could have stood in front of that"
killer and pulled a trigger. He's a master hypnotist. You're all right.
We won't say a word about what happened in here. And you'll have no
"trouble in the future."""
"The patrolman shook his head. ""Still, I gotta do something about it."""
"""Talk to your psychiatrist,"" Taber said. ""In the meantime, keep that"
"crowd out there from spilling in here."""
Taber pushed out through the choked entrance to the areaway and went
back up the street. It was alive with activity now and he passed
unnoticed. No one recognized him as the man who had given chase in the
bloody business that would make headlines that evening in every New York
newspaper.
And yet the radio and TV news commentators gave it no special attention.
It went in along with other items of the day's news as a more or less
routine big-city happening.
"One national-hookup headliner stated: ""In New York City today, a man"
"identified as John Dennis, address unknown, went berserk in a"
"fashionable Upper East Side apartment. Dennis, wielding a knife, killed"
"a man and a woman, and seriously wounded another man before he was cut"
down by police bullets.
"""A jet airliner, down in the North Atlantic today, imperiled the lives"
He showed me his thumbnail; there was no mark on it.
"The newspaper reporters wrote articles and sent telegrams, not only about"
"the Blue Peak and the dreadful death, but about the locality, and about"
"the Tore Peak resort, that haven for the weary, with its wonderful"
buildings set like jewels in the mountains. What a surprise to come here:
"gargoyles, living room, piano, all the latest books, timber outside ready"
"for new jewels in their setting, altogether a magnificent picture of"
Norway's modern farming.
"Yes, indeed, the newspapermen appreciated it. And they did their"
advertising.
The English arrived.
"""Where is Solem?"" they asked, and ""Where is the Blue Peak?"" they asked."
"""We ought to get the hay in,"" said Josephine and the wife at the farm."
"""There'll be rain, and fifty cartloads are still out!"""
"That was all very well, but ""Where is Solem?"" asked the English. So Solem"
"had to go with them. The two casual laborers began to cart away the hay,"
but then the women had no one to help them rake. Confusion was rife.
Everyone rushed wildly hither and thither because there was no one to lead
them.
"The weather stayed fine overnight; it was patient, slow-moving weather. As"
"soon as the dew dried up, more hay would be brought in, perhaps all the"
"hay. Oh, we should manage all right."
"More English appeared; and ""Solem--the Blue Peak?"" they said. Their"
murmured.
"The Mater turned her gentle eyes to the fire, and Dad, clearing his"
throat in a blustering way--though he was not at all a blustering
man--replied:
"""Perhaps it's rather decent of us to have a son who--er, I mean,"
"who--well, er----"""
"""A cruise hits me right,"" I exclaimed, hurriedly coming to his rescue,"
"for neither of us wanted a scene. ""And I'll wire Tommy Davis, Mater--the"
chap you mentioned. He's a corking fellow! I didn't write you how the
battalion started calling him 'Rebel' till he closed up half a dozen
"eyes, did I? You see, in the beginning, when we were rookies, the"
"sergeant had us up in formation to get our names, and when he came to"
"Tommy that innocent drawled: 'Mr. Thomas Jefferson Davis, suh, of"
"Loui'ville, Jefferson county, Kentucky, suh.' You could have heard a pin"
"drop. The sergeant, as hard-boiled as they come, stood perfectly still"
"and let a cold eye bore into him for half a minute, then gasped: 'Gawd!"
"What a wicked little rebel!'"""
They laughed.
"""Why didn't you bring him home with you?"""
"""Same reason he couldn't take me home with him. There were people"
"waiting, and turkey, and--but he won't want to go,"" I added. ""He's crazy"
"about a girl down there!"""
"""Fiddlesticks,"" my father chuckled. ""Any normal fellow'll want to"
"cruise! I'll wire him myself--this very night!"""
"your employ."""
"""What!"""
"""I hear you have bought them."""
"""Do you mean to insinuate--"""
"""I don't mean to insinuate anything. Listen! We are where we can talk"
"plainly, Marsh, and I am tired of all this subterfuge. You did what you"
"could to stop me, you even tried to have me killed--"""
"""You dare to--"""
"""But I guess it never occurred to you that I may be just as desperate"
"as you are."""
"The men stared at each other with hostile eyes, but the accusation had"
come so suddenly and with such boldness as to rob Marsh of words.
"Emerson went on in the same level voice: ""I broke through in spite of"
"you, and I'm on the job. If you want to cry quits, I'm willing; but, by"
"God! I won't be balked, and if any of your hired marshals try to take"
"me before I put up my catch I'll put you away. Understand?"""
Willis Marsh recoiled involuntarily before the sudden ferocity that
"blazed up in the speaker's face. ""You are insane,"" he cried."
"""Am I?"" Emerson laughed, harshly. ""Well, I'm just crazy enough to do"
what I say. I don't think you're the kind that wants hand-to-hand
"trouble, so let's each attend to his own affair. I'm doing well, thank"
"you, and I think I can get along better if yon don't come back here"
"until I send for you. Something might fall on you."""
raining. He was a proud and comical sight. But why speak harsh words about
"a raincoat? It was not he, the owner, that had abused it, and it hung from"
his shoulders as innocently as a bridal veil.
"Why speak harsh words about anyone? Life is good, but life is stern."
"Perhaps when she comes out, I think to myself, the following scene will"
take place: I stand here waiting only for this departure. So she gives me
her hand and says good-bye.
"""Why don't you say something?"" she asks in order to seem bright and easy"
in her mind.
"""Because I don't want to hurt you in the great error of your ways."""
"""Ha, ha, ha,"" she laughs, too loudly and in a forced tone; ""the great"
"error of my ways! Well, really!"""
"And her anger grows, while I am assured and fatherly, standing on the firm"
ground of conscious virtue. Yet I say an unworthy thing like this:
"""Don't throw yourself away, Miss Torsen!"""
"She raises her head then; yes, the Torsen type would raise her head and"
"reply, pale and offended:"
"""Throw myself away?--I don't understand you."""
"But it is possible, too, that Miss Torsen, at heart a fine, proud girl,"
would have a lucid moment and see things in their true light:
"""Why not, why shouldn't I throw myself away? What is there to keep? I am"
"thrown away, wasted ever since my school days, and now I am seven and"
rallied a little.
"""Who has told you this lie?"" he exclaimed, with a kind of indignation."
"""A man who does not make mistakes--or tell lies--Sergeant Cardono!"" said"
"Rollo. ""He has both seen and spoken to her! She has sworn to attack the"
"palace to-night."""
"""Then I am as good as dead already. I must go directly to my wife!"""
answered Muñoz.
But Rollo stepped before him.
"""Not without carrying an armful of these to where they will be of use,"""
"he said, pointing to the guns. And the Duke of Rianzares, without any"
"further demur, did his will. Rollo in turn took as many as he could"
"carry, and the Sergeant brought up the rear carrying a wooden box of"
"cartridges, which had evidently been packed ready for transportation."
"They returned to the large lighted room, where Mortimer, Etienne, and El"
Sarria had been left on guard. Concha and the waiting-maid seconded
their efforts by bringing store of pistols and ammunition.
"On their way they passed through a hall, which by day seemed to be"
"lighted only from the roof. Rollo bade them deposit the arms there, and"
bring the other candles and lamps to that place.
"""Every moment that a light is to be seen at an outside window adds to"
"our danger,"" he said, and Concha ran at his bidding."
"Before she had time to return, however, the Queen-Regent came in with"
"her usual dignity, the three serving-men following her. Rollo saw at"
"""He isn't even thinking of coming, the wretch! ..."""
"""That means that he does not love me!"" sang Deacon Taras, leaning his"
chin on his hand and casting a humorous glance towards the mountain.
At last Petunikoff appeared.  He came in a respectable cart with his
"son playing the role of groom.  The latter was a red-checked,"
"nice-looking youngster, in a long square-cut overcoat.  He wore smoked"
"eyeglasses.  They tied the horse to an adjoining tree, the son took the"
"measuring instrument out of his pocket and gave it to his father, and"
they began to measure the ground.  Both were silent and worried.
"""Aha!"" shouted the Captain, gleefully."
All those who were in the dosshouse at the moment came out to look at
them and expressed themselves loudly and freely in reference to the
matter.
"""What does the habit of thieving mean?  A man may sometimes make a big"
"mistake when he steals, standing to lose more than he gets,"" said the"
"Captain, causing much laughter among his staff and eliciting various"
murmurs of assent.
"""Take care, you devil!"" shouted Petunikoff, ""lest I have you in the"
"police court for your words!"""
"""You can do nothing to me without witnesses ...  Your son cannot give"
"evidence on your side"" ... the Captain warned him."
"""Look out all the same, you old wretch, you may be found guilty too!"""
"And Petunikoff shook his fist at him. His son, deeply engrossed in his"
"""Ay! But enough to make a garden,"" I returned, as we climbed the narrow"
flight of steps leading to the private entrance to the Old Swan.
"When we paused at the door, Frances said, ""Your garden is at hand."" And"
"when she opened the door, there stood Betty, and I was in Eden. The moist"
"glow of her eyes, the faint blush of her cheeks, the nervous fluttering"
"of her voice, spoke more eloquently than all the tongues of Babel could"
"have spoken, and I could not help comparing her welcome with that which"
Maxy Hamilton had given me at the queen's ball.
"Bettina led us to the parlor, and while we were drinking a cup of tea,"
we had the great pleasure of asking and answering questions of which we
always had a large supply in reserve.
"When it was time to go, Bettina walked down to the Bridge with us. As it"
"was growing dark, Frances suggested that I walk back to the Old Swan with"
"Betty, which I did, she taking my arm of her own accord, and both of us"
"very happy, though we spoke not a word, for fear of saying too much, save"
"""good night"" at the door."
"""Good night at the door!"" God gave its sweetness to youth right out of"
the core of His infinite love.
CHAPTER XII
A PERILOUS EMBASSY
"Four or five days after our visit to Bettina, I met De Grammont at"
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox, the weapons of the ruler will prevail"
over the weapons of the enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox that has _ganni_[87], the ruler will"
weaken the land of his enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox with two tails, omen of Ishbi-Ura[88],"
who was without a rival.
"If an ewe gives birth to a cow, the king will die, another king will"
draw nigh and divide the country.
One might have supposed that such omens represent a purely imaginative
"theoretical factor, but the introduction of the historical reference"
proves conclusively that the Babylonians and Assyrians attached an
"was--different,' she whispered."
'How?' my lady muttered.
"'He swore at me,' Marie answered in the same tone. 'And he spoke of"
you--somehow differently.'
"The Countess laughed, but far from joyously. 'I suppose to-night--I"
must see him?' she said. She tried as she spoke to press herself more
"deeply into the pillows, as if she might escape that way. Her flesh"
"crept, and she shivered though she was as hot as fire."
Once or twice in the hours which followed she was almost beside
herself. Sometimes she prayed. More often she walked up and down the
"room like one in a fever. She did not know on what she was trusting,"
"and she could have struck Marie when the girl, appealed to again and"
"If there is no such Marshal, then the Ship shall be in like Manner"
delivered up to the Principal Officer of Customs at the Port.
"The Ship shall remain in the Custody of the Marshal, or of such Officer,"
subject to the Orders of the Court.
[Sidenote: Bringing in of Ship Papers.]
"17. The Captors shall, with all practicable Speed after the Ship is"
"brought into Port, bring the Ship Papers into the Registry of the Court."
"The Officer in Command, or One of the Chief Officers of the Capturing"
"Ship, or some other Person who was present at the Capture, and saw the"
"Ship Papers delivered up or found on board, shall make Oath that they"
"are brought in as they were taken, without Fraud, Addition, Subduction,"
"or Alteration, or else shall account on Oath to the Satisfaction of the"
Court for the Absence or altered Condition of the Ship Papers or any of
them.
Where no Ship Papers are delivered up or found on board the captured
"Ship, the Officer in Command, or One of the Chief Officers of the"
"capturing Ship, or some other Person who was present at the Capture,"
shall make Oath to that Effect.
[Sidenote: Issue of Monition.]
"18. As soon as the Affidavit as to Ship Papers is filed, a Monition"
"shall issue, returnable within Twenty Days from the Service thereof,"
citing all Persons in general to show Cause why the captured Ship should
not be condemned.
[Sidenote: Examinations on Standing Interrogatories.]
and those of the German patriotic historians the Hansa is seen in a
rather delusive abstract. The useful monograph of Miss Zimmern (_The
Hansa Towns_: Story of the Nations Series) gives a good idea of the
"reality. See in particular pp. 82-147. It should be noted, however, that"
Lübeck is credited with being the first northern town to adopt the
"Oriental usage of water-pipes (Macpherson, _Annals of Commerce_, 1802,"
"i, 381).]"
Chapter IV
HOLLAND
NOTE ON LITERATURE
The special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led
in past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was
given to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low
"Countries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,"
"folio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;"
"in Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of"
the kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon
the United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers
further foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions
of the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century
many English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An
English translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously
"known as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,"
"""We are all here,"" she answered. ""None of us has fled. Did you not"
"know that?"""
He looked about him. A flash of scorn rekindled in his somber eyes.
"""You are alone. Have they deserted you?"""
"""They do not know that I am here. I crept back of my own free will--to"
"speak with you, Nehal."""
"Both hands clasped upon his sword-hilt, erect, a proud figure of"
"misfortune, he stood there and studied her, half-wonderingly,"
half-contemptuously. The restless forces at his back were forgotten.
They were no more to him than the pawns with which his will played
life and death. He was their god and their faith. They waited for his
word to sweep out of his path the white-faced Englishwoman who held
him checked in the full course of his victory. But he did not speak to
"them, but to her, in a low voice in which scorn still trembled."
"""You are here, no doubt, to intercede for those others--or for"
"yourself. You see, I have learned something in these two years. It is"
"useless. No one can stop me now."""
"""No one?"""
"He smiled, and for the first time she saw a sneer disfigure his lips."
"""Not even you, Miss Cary. You have done a great deal with me--enough"
perhaps to justify your wildest hopes--but you have touched the limits
of your powers and of my gullibility. Or did you think there were no
"limits?"""
Already they could hear the footsteps of the officers.
"""I'll take a chance. Good-bye."""
There was no time even for a hand-shake; Fraser stepped swiftly to the
"door, then strolled quietly out into the view of the two men, who an"
instant later accosted him.
"""Are you Mr. Boyd Emerson?"""
"The adventurer answered brusquely, ""Yes, but I can't talk to you now."""
"""You are under arrest, Mr. Emerson."""
Boyd waited to hear no more. The glass door swung open noiselessly
"under his hand, and he stepped out just as the bill-clerk looked up"
"from his work, staring out through the other entrance."
"""Fingerless"" Fraser's voice was louder now, as if for a signal. ""Arrest"
"me? What do you mean? Get out of my way."""
"""You'd better come peaceably."""
"Boyd heard a sharp exclamation--""Get him, Bill!"" And then the sound of"
"men struggling. He ran, followed by a roar from the strikers, in whose"
full view Fraser's encounter with the plain-clothes men was taking
place. A backward glance showed him that Fraser had drawn his pursuers
"to the street. He had broken away and dodged out into the open, where"
the other officers responded at a call and seized him as he apparently
undertook to break through the cordon. This diversion served an
unexpected purpose. Not only did it draw attention from Emerson's
"retreat, but it also gave the mob its long-awaited opportunity."
"""Maybe he dropped the knife,"" said the watchman, and began to search"
"about the floor, followed by the others."
"""It may have been the woman herself who stabbed Mr. Marsh,"" offered"
"Emerson. ""He was strangling her when I arrived."""
"Roused by this statement to a fresh denial, Marsh cried out:"
"""I tell you there wasn't any woman."""
"""And there isn't any knife either,"" Emerson sneered."
The men paused uncertainly. Seeing that they were undecided whether to
"believe him or his assailant, Marsh went on:"
"""If he hasn't a knife, then he must have had a friend with him--"""
"""Then tell your men what we were doing in here and how you came to be"
"alone with us in the dark."" Emerson stared at his accuser curiously,"
"but the Trust's manager seemed at a loss. ""See here, Marsh, if you will"
"tell us whom you were choking, maybe we can get at the truth of this"
"affair."""
"Without answering, Marsh rose, and, leaning upon the watchman's arm,"
said:
"""Help me up to the house. I'm hurt. Send the launch to the upper plant"
"for John; he knows something about medicine."" With no further word, he"
"made his way out of the building, followed by the mystified fishermen."
"No one undertook to detain Emerson, and he went his way, wondering what"
lay back of the night's adventure. He racked his brain for a hint as to
the wardrobe top.
"In that same moment Johnson was standing in the parting of the curtains,"
his hand raised warningly. In another moment he was over to the door
"where, after taking his pistols from his overcoat pockets, he stood in a"
"cool, determined attitude, fingering his weapons."
"""But some one's ben callin',"" the Girl was saying, at the very moment"
when above the loud roaring of the wind another knock was heard on the
"cabin door. ""Who can it be?"" she asked as if to herself, and calmly went"
"over to the table, where she took up the candle and lit it."
"Springing to her side, Johnson whispered tensely:"
"""Don't answer--you can't let anyone in--they wouldn't understand."""
The Girl eyed him quizzically.
"""Understand what?"" And before he had time to explain, much less to check"
"her, she was standing at the window, candle in hand, peering out into"
the night.
"""Why, it's the posse!"" she cried, wheeling round suddenly. ""How did they"
"ever risk it in this storm?"""
At these words a crushed expression appeared on Johnson's countenance;
"an uncanny sense of insecurity seized him. Once more the loud, insistent"
"pounding was repeated, and as before, the outlaw, his hands on his guns,"
commanded her not to answer.
"""But what on earth do the boys want?"" inquired the Girl, seemingly"
"oblivious to what he was saying. Indeed, so much so that as the voice of"
"door. Stripped down for action, they were quickly and professionally"
"tallying the certificates, one handling the open cashiers checks and"
the other the bearer bonds.
"Guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details, Vance thought."
"Well, screw them. We've still got the protocol. We've got some leverage"
left.
But he was having trouble focusing on the future. He was still in shock
from the sight of Novosty being gunned down in cold blood. Alex's
"abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional, if sometimes dubious,"
career. He'd really wanted Novosty to make this one last score. The man
"deserved it. He was an operator who lived at the edge, and Vance had"
"always admired players who put everything on the table, no matter which"
side.
"Well, he told himself, the scenario had come close, damned close. But"
maybe it was doomed from the start. You only get so many chances to
"tempt the fates. Today everybody's number came up, Alex's for the last"
time.
"Rest in peace, Aleksei Ilyich."
"Then Vera turned back to them. ""Now, I want the computer. We know it"
"was moved to the house in Kensington, but our search this morning did"
"not locate it."""
"So they were on to us from the start, Vance realized."
"""Looks like you've got a problem."" He strolled over and plopped down in"
"one of the straight-backed chairs along the opposite wall. ""Too bad."""
the bottom a la log.
“Here we go!” shouted Frank.
The boys raced along the slope until they came to a point of timber
"which, following a more fertile spot, thrust itself up the ascent. Here"
"they disappeared, considering themselves reasonably safe in the"
seclusion of the forest. Frank examined his gun and found it empty.
“Good thing that dub didn’t know it was empty!” he laughed.
“Don’t stop now to throw bouquets at yourself!” grinned Harry.
“That’s right!” Jack declared. “We want to be getting back to the camp.
Gilroy’ll have a fit if he wakes up and finds us gone.”
"“Don’t you ever think those half-breeds will give up the chase here,”"
"Frank suggested. “Do you know what they’ll do?” he asked, “They’ll"
circle around and get between us and the camp! That’s what they’ll do.”
"“I sometimes think,” Harry snorted, turning to Jack, “that Frank is"
getting so intelligent that he may have the gift of speech conferred
upon him. He certainly has that proposition right.”
"“Well, if we can’t go back to camp,” Jack asked, “where can we go?”"
“We’ll have to glide into some gentle dell in the bosom of a friendly
"hill!” laughed Harry, “and send a scout out to watch those fellows spy"
upon the camp.”
“If they’ve got a detachment of half-breeds guarding every squad of Boy
"Scouts that have strayed away from the camp today,” Jack laughed, “they"
chuckled ecstatically. His own eyes were shining.
"""That settles it, Lady Josceline,"" said he triumphantly, turning to"
"Sallie. ""I'll stake my professional reputation on your identity now. You"
"need have no further doubt--"""
"""And just to clinch the matter,"" growled Captain Dove, ""you'd better add"
this to your affidavy:--The clothes the kid was wearing when I fetched
her off that dhow were all marked with the moniker 'J. J.' and some sort
of crest. But--they were all lost when the ship I commanded then
"was--went down at sea."""
"Mr. Jobling groaned. ""How _very_ unfortunate!"" he remarked before he"
resumed his writing. And Slyne stared fixedly at the old man until the
lawyer had finished.
"""Now,"" said Mr. Jobling, adjusting his pince-nez and beaming about him"
"again, ""we can call in a couple of witnesses and--"""
"""We'll witness each other's signatures."" Slyne disagreed. ""Better not"
"bring in any outsiders."""
"The stout solicitor frowned over that, but finally nodded concurrence."
"And Captain Dove took the pen from him, only to hand it to Slyne."
"""Gimme my thousand dollars and your joint note for the balance first,"""
he requested unamiably.
"Slyne signed the new note Mr. Jobling pushed across the table, and Mr."
Jobling endorsed it. Captain Dove read it over carefully before he
"pocketed it, and also counted with great caution the bills Slyne tossed"
"to him. Then he in his turn signed, without reading it, the statement"
sob.
"""Surely there is confidence between us?""  I urged.  ""Do you not remember"
"that day long ago when we walked one evening in the sunset hand-in-hand,"
"as was our wont, along the river-path towards La Roche?  Do you not"
remember how you told me that in future you would have no single secret
"from me?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered hoarsely, with an effort, ""I recollect."""
"""Then you intend to break your promise to me?""  I whispered earnestly."
"""Surely you will not do this, Yolande?  You will not hide from me the"
"cause of all this bitterness of yours?""  She was silent.  Her breast,"
"beneath its lace, rose quickly and fell again.  Her tear-filled eyes"
were fixed upon the carpet.
"""I would not break my promise,"" she said at last, clasping my hand"
"convulsively and lifting her eyes to mine; ""but, alas! it is now"
"imperative."""
"""Why imperative?"""
"""I must suffer alone,"" she responded gloomily, shaking her head.  Her"
"countenance was as pale as her gown, and she shivered as though she were"
"cold, although the noonday heat was suffocating."
"""Because you refuse to tell me anything or allow me to assist you?""  I"
"said.  ""This is not in accordance with the promise made and sealed by"
"your lips on that evening long ago."""
"""Nor have your actions been in accordance with your own promise,"" she"
said slowly and distinctly.
Rippley slapped him on the shoulder:
"“Then,” said he, “we ought to give Pangbutt’s house an air. There"
is a lack of the grand manner here. One man-servant is ridiculously
inadequate. At least three of us ought to assist to wait on the guests.
"Doome and Fluffy and I and--and you, Blotte--would make a ripping lot"
"of waiters, and it wouldn’t be half so slow as talking art and rot"
to people who don’t know.... Genius shall serve the mob. This night
"must never be forgotten. By Macready, yes--Pangbutt used to play at"
play-acting! But where are his properties?”
Blotte was striding the room; he laughed:
"“Ay, ay--the gala-night of life should be gay and joyous,” cried"
"he--“all the candles lit, as for a bridal.” He came to a halt, scowled"
"at the dark hollow of the great doorway, and strode thither."
The old butler was lurking suspiciously outside.
"Blotte grabbed him by his coat lapel, and drew him into the light:"
"“Hireling fellow,” said he, “bring more lights. This place is like a"
damned omnibus.”
The old butler held out an expostulant palm in dignified remonstrance:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen--the guests will be arriving in a few minutes----”"
"Rippley went up to him, and gripping his fingers in the old servant’s"
"waistcoat, pulled him into the room."
"“Don’t talk like an unfrocked bishop, Dukes--it’s most irreligious,”"
The man swelled with determination and pride. He had no thought of
"failure, and drew inspiration and joy from the heaviness of the bet"
which he had made with Fortune. He took the born gambler's delight in
a big risk.
"""Then you think that the _Antinous_ and the _Antigone_ were both"
"damaged by the same man, and that he may have designs upon the"
"_Malplaquet_?"" said I."
"""I don't propose to tell you what I think,"" replied Dawson stiffly."
"""Still,"" I persisted, passing over the snub, ""you have a theory?"""
"""No, thanks,"" said Dawson contemptuously. ""I have no use for theories."
"When they are wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are"
no help. I believe in facts--facts brought out by constant vigilance.
"Unsleeping watchfulness and universal suspicion, those are the"
"principles I work on. The theory business makes pretty story books,"
"but the Force does not waste good time over them."""
"""What are you going to do?"""
"""This is Thursday afternoon. I am going to join the _Malplaquet_"
"presently, and I'm not going to sleep till she is safely down the"
"river. I'm going to be my own watchman this time."""
"""How? In what capacity?"""
"Dawson gave a shrug of impatience, for his nerves were on edge. For a"
"moment he hesitated, and then, recollecting the high post to which I"
"had tacitly been appointed in his household, he replied:"
road.
"Eilert was going out in his boat to fish haddock, and I went with him."
Actually he should have been getting some meat for us; but he had promised
"the gentry from the city some fish, and fish was one of the gifts of God."
"Besides, if he lacked meat, he could always slaughter one of the pigs."
"There was a slight wind; but then we wanted some wind, Eilert said, as"
long as there was not too much of it.
"""Not reliable tonight though,"" he said, looking up into the sky; ""the"
"bigger the wind, the stronger the current."""
"At first I was very brave, and sat on the thwart thinking of Eilert's"
"French words: _travali, prekevary, sutinary, mankémang_, and many"
"others. They've had a long way to travel, coming here by ancient routes"
"via Bergen, and now they're common property."
"And then suddenly I lost all interest in French words, and felt extremely"
"ill. It was much too windy, and we got no haddock."
"""Pity she's come up so quick,"" said Eilert; ""let's try inshore for a"
"while."""
"But we got nothing there either, and as the wind increased and the sea"
"rose, ""We'd better go home,"" said Eilert."
"The sea had been just right before, remarkably so, but now there was"
entirely too much of it. Why on earth did I feel so bad? An inner
"exhaustion, some emotional excitement, would have explained it. But I had"
experienced no emotional excitement.
"he had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were"
pushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he
"faced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its"
"tulle curtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the"
broad sills. On either side of the carriage porch their
"hydrangeas—famous in the town—were coming into flower; the pinkish,"
bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading leaves. And
"somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and"
"even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, “There is young life"
here. There are girls—”
"The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on"
"the oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and"
impatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.
"“And were there ices?” came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of"
her rocker.
"“Ices!” cried Ethel. “My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two"
"kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet"
frill.”
"“The food altogether was too appalling,” came from Marion."
"“Still, it’s rather early for ices,” said Charlotte easily."
"“But why, if one has them at all....” began Ethel."
"“Oh, quite so, darling,” crooned Charlotte."
"Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,"
"she nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave."
"no reply. Rance made no movement to follow her, but instead drew a pack"
of cards from his pocket and began to shuffle them with practiced
carelessness. But when a minute had passed and the girl had not
"returned, he called once more, with growing impatience, to know what was"
keeping her.
"""I'm jest gettin' the cards an' kind o' steadyin' my nerves,"" she"
answered somewhat queerly through the doorway. The next moment she had
"returned, quickly closing the closet door behind her, blew out her"
"candle, and laying a pack of cards upon the table, said significantly:"
"""We'll use a fresh deck. There's a good deal depends on this, Jack."" She"
seated herself opposite the Sheriff and so close to the unconscious form
of the man she loved that from time to time her left arm brushed his
shoulder.
"Rance, without protest other than a shrug, took up his own deck of"
"cards, wrapped them in a handkerchief, and stowed them away in his"
pocket. It was the Girl who spoke first:
"""Are you ready?"""
"""Ready? Yes. I'm ready. Cut for deal."""
"With unfaltering fingers, the Girl cut. Of the man beside her, dead or"
"dying, she must not, dared not think. For the moment she had become one"
"incarnate purpose: to win, to win at any cost,--nothing else mattered."
"Rance won the deal; and taking up the pack he asked, as he shuffled:"
"""A case of show-down?"""
The Further Adventures of Peggy of Spinster Farm
_By Helen M. Winslow_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated, net $1.25; postpaid $ 1.40_"
Miss Winslow calls us again away from the strenuous and noisy
"confusion of modern cities to the charm and contentment of life ""under"
"the greenwood tree."" Peggy's adventures had only just begun in the"
"first book. In this new record of life at Spinster Farm and ""Elysium,"""
"""At the Sign of the Town Pump,"" there is plenty of romantic adventure"
of the kind that proves truth to be stranger sometimes than fiction.
"There is humor, too, in even greater quantities than in the preceding"
"book, sparkling humor that places the author well up in the list of"
"our New England humorists. ""At the Sign of the Town Pump"" will be"
welcomed not only by those who enjoyed making the acquaintance of
"Spinster Farm, but by thousands of new readers who appreciate a clever"
story and a fascinating heroine.
"_On ""Peggy at Spinster Farm"" the Press opinions are as follows_:"
"""Very alluring are the pictures she draws of the old-fashioned"
"house, the splendid old trees, the pleasant walks, the gorgeous"
"sunsets, and--or it would not be Helen Winslow--the"
"cats.""--_The Boston Transcript._"
"""'Peggy at Spinster Farm' is a rewarding volume, original and"
"personal in its point of view, redolent of unfeigned love for"

"""It is an alluring, wholesome tale.""--_Schenectady Star._"
breakwater.
"The skipper, who had been lying flat when the others jumped for the"
"main deck, got up and crawled forward to the break of the poop.  He"
was half-paralysed with a mixture of funk and rage.  He addressed
"himself and his remarks to the sky, the sea, and the island, but"
above all to Lampert.
"""You man-drowning, slop-built caricature of a sailorman, what 'ave"
"you bin and done with my ship?"" he bellowed.  ""Oh, Lord, I'm a ruined"
"man; by gosh, I'll murder you!"""
"He tumbled down on the main deck and made for Lampert, who easily"
dodged him.
"""Shut up, you old idiot!"" said the mate contemptuously.  ""Who but me"
"told you that if you drove her in thick weather, and no sun seen for"
"a week, you'd pile her up?"""
Simcox caught Jones and held him.
"""Good lord, sir,"" said the second greaser, ""it's no time to fight."""
"""No, it ain't,"" said Jack Hart boldly."
"That a foremast hand should dare to shove his oar in, almost cowed"
the poor old Guffin.  It was something out of nature.
"""It ain't no time for jawbation,"" insisted Hart, about whom the"
"others had gathered.  ""It's time for thinkin' out the politics of the"
"situation, and if I'm not mistaken we shall be able to walk ashore by"
"the morning, and there won't be no ship for any one to command--so"
"""So you're here at last----!"" then with a little gasp drew back, facing"
me in the most entrancing attitude of bewilderment.
It was the girl who had left that ball of paper!
"The sea, always my friend, at this moment did a rather decent thing; it"
gave the yacht a firm but gentle lurch and sent us into each other's
arms. Perhaps nothing else in all the world of chances could so
"effectively have broken the ice between us, for we were laughing as I"
"helped her back to the couch; and, as our eyes met, again we laughed."
"""I didn't know,"" she said, ""that Father brought a guest aboard last"
"night!"""
"""Awkward of him, wasn't it?"" I stammered, sparring for time."
"""One is apt to be awkward in weather like this,"" she graciously"
admitted.
"""You don't know how profoundly aware I am of--of how terribly true that"
"is,"" I stumbled along. ""Is he on deck?"" For, oh, if I could only get to"
see him five minutes alone!
"""No, he's unusually lazy this morning; but I've called, him, the old"
"dear!"""
"A chill crept up my spine--crept up, crept down, and then criss-crossed."
But she must know of her mistake before we had gone so far that putting
me ashore would be a serious inconvenience--for I knew he would put me
"ashore at the nearest point, if not, indeed, set me adrift in an open"
boat. Therefore I suggested:
"A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally"
"conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the"
"worshiper’s attitude toward God, or God’s purposes, in human life."
"L. F. Benson, America’s foremost hymnologist, defines a hymn in these"
simple words:
The Christian hymn ... is a form of words appropriate to be sung or
chanted in public devotions.
"A hymn is to be sung _by a congregation_. Its message must be simple,"
"not subtle. It must read well and sing well. In modern usage, the hymn"
is not limited to the praise of God but includes other moods of worship
such as resignation and consecration.
2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
Hymn singing has always been associated with Christian worship. Jesus
"and the Twelve sang a hymn, presumably a portion of the _Hallel_ (Ps."
"115-118), after the Supper was ended. Paul and Silas sang hymns, “songs"
"of the night,” during the midnight hours of their imprisonment in"
Philippi. The great Apostle recognized the value of song when he
exhorted the churches thus:
Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns
"and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the"
"Lord. Eph. 5:18, 19."
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
"admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,"
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. Col. 3:16.
XXVII
"A large house, with and upper story of planks built on later, displayed a"
"new signboard on the wall: Room and Board. The barn, as usual, was a peat"
hut.
"As I did not know which was Eilert and which Olaus, and had stopped to"
"consider which road to take, a man came hurrying toward me. Ah, well, the"
world is a small place; we meet friends and acquaintances everywhere. Here
"am I, meeting an old acquaintance, the thief of last winter, the pork"
"thief. What luck, what a satisfaction!"
This was Eilert. He took in paying guests now.
"At first he pretended not to recognize me, but he soon gave that up. Once"
"he had done so, however, he carried the thing off in style:"
"""Well, well,"" he said, ""what a nice surprise! You are most welcome under"
"my humble roof, and such it is!"""
"My own response was rather less jaunty, and I stood still collecting my"
"thoughts. When I had asked a few questions, he explained that since the"
"motor traffic had started in Stordalen, many visitors came through this"
"way, and sometimes they wanted to stop over at his house before being"
"rowed across to the steamer. They always came down in the evenings, and it"
"might be fine, or it might not, and at night the fjord was often wild. He"
"had therefore had to arrange to house them, because after all, you can't"
"neither she nor I cared to go, we should take the letters to Dover, cross"
"to Calais, and post them in France."
"I sprang at the idea, but immediately sprang back, saying: ""But it is not"
"entirely proper for us to travel to Calais together, even though you are"
"my sister-cousin."""
"""We may take father,"" she suggested. ""Sarah wants to visit Lady St."
"Albans, and she can go if we take father with us. And, Baron Ned; I have"
"another suggestion to offer. Let us take Bettina."""
I sprang at that proposal and did not spring back. So we went first to my
"uncle, who said he would go with us, and then we went to see Bettina. She"
"had recovered from her sprains and bruises, although she was still pale"
and not quite strong.
"When Frances asked her to go with us, she answered, ""Ay, gladly, if"
"father consents."""
"Pickering, who was sitting with us at the time in Bettina's cozy parlor,"
"turned to me, laughing, and said:--"
"""You would suppose, from Betty's remark, that I am master here, but the"
"truth is my soul is not my own, and now her modest request for permission"
"is made for effect on the company."""
"Betty ran to her father, sat on his knee, twined her arm about his neck,"
and kissed him as a protest against the unjust insinuation.
"""You see how she does it,"" said Pickering. ""No hammer and tongs for"
"Betty; just oil and honey."""
"""A man named Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf."""
The next instant I saw that the mention of that name affected the mother
no less markedly than it had affected the daughter.  Her face blanched;
"her eyes opened wide in fear, and her glance became in a moment"
"suspicious.  With marvellous self-possession she, however, pretended"
ignorance.
"""Wolf?"" she repeated.  ""I do not remember the name.  Possibly he is some"
"person we have met while travelling."""
"""Yolande knew him, I believe, in Brussels,"" I remarked.  ""He appeared to"
"be acquainted with you."""
"""My daughter's friends are not always mine,"" she remarked coldly, with"
"that cleverness which only a woman of the world can possess, and at once"
returned to the discussion of Yolande and the probability of her
recovery.
This puzzled me.  I felt somehow convinced that she knew the truth.  She
"had some distinct object in endeavouring to seal my lips.  What it was,"
"however, I could not determine."
"She was expressing a fervent hope that her daughter would recover, and"
"pacing the room, impatient to go to her bedside, when, of a sudden, Dick"
"opened the door, and, putting his head inside, addressed me, saying:"
"""Can I speak with you a moment, Ingram?""  She dashed to the door in"
"eagerness, but after a word of introduction from myself, he informed her"
that Yolande had not sufficiently recovered to be disturbed.
"""Perfect quiet is absolutely necessary, madame,"" he urged.  ""Your"
hands. Everything living had been slain. Astura was a castle of the
dead.
"""God! What work!"" exclaimed the Pisan. It was the testimony wrung from"
him by the stress of sheer hard fighting.
"""One of the viper-brood still lives,"" the duke turned to his"
"companion, kicking with the tip of his steel boot the lifeless form of"
Giovanni Frangipani.
The Pisan turned to a man-at-arms.
"""Take twenty men! Scour the lair from vault to pinnacle! We must have"
"that other,--dead or alive!"""
The rain had ceased for the time. New thunder-clouds came rolling out
of the west. Flambeaux flared in the court. Black shadows danced along
the ghostly walls. The wind moaned about the crenelated turrets;
"sentinels of the Pisans stood everywhere, alert for ambush."
The duke and his companions approached the door leading into the great
hall. It lay in splinters. Stygian darkness held sway within.
"Suddenly the duke paused, as if turned to stone, at the same time"
plucking his companion back by the sleeve of his surcoat.
Noiselessly as a ghost out of the door came the form of a woman. She
"was tall, exquisitely proportioned, and young. For a moment she paused"
on the threshold and looked out into the night. Almost immediately a
"second form followed, and paused near the first: that of a man. The"
"woman seemed to stare blindly at the duke, with wide, unseeing eyes,"
as one who walks in a sleep.
"bowed deferentially. ""You are about to receive a great honor. The CEO"
"has asked for a private conference with you."""
Yuri stared over Ikeda's shoulder at the Man-in-Charge. All this right-
wing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing. He was
the one calling the shots. Who was everybody kidding?
"Now the CEO looked his way, sizing him up with a quick glance. Yuri"
"Androv assessed him in turn. It was one look, but they both knew there"
was trouble ahead.
Then Tanzan Mino patted a colonel-general on the shoulder and headed
"over. ""Yuri Andreevich Androv, I presume,"" he said in flawless Russian,"
"bowing lightly. ""A genuine pleasure to meet you at last. There's a most"
"urgent matter we have to discuss."""
Thursday 4:00 P.M.
"At the precise hour, the _tokonoma _alcove off Vance's bedroom rotated"
"ninety degrees, as though moved by an unseen hand, and what awaited"
"beyond was a traditional Japanese sand-and-stone garden. It was, of"
"course, lit artificially, but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be"
thriving on the fluorescents. Through the garden's grassy center was a
curving pathway of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular
"curves, and situated on either side of the walkway were towering rocks"
nestled in glistening sand that had been raked to represent ocean
waves. The rocks were reminiscent of the soaring mountains in Chinese
Sung landscape paintings.
He shook his head.
"""Well, there was a certain shrewd old cannery-man in Washington State"
"whose catch consisted almost wholly of pink fish. As you know, that"
"variety does not bring as high a price as red salmon, like these. Well,"
"finding that he could not sell his catch, owing to the popular"
"prejudice about color, this man printed a lot of striking can-labels,"
"which read, 'Best Grade Pink Salmon, Warranted not to Turn Red in the"
"Can.' They tell me it worked like a charm."""
"""No wonder!"" Boyd laughed, beginning to feel the tension of his nerves"
"relax at the restfulness of her influence. As usual, he fell at once"
into the mood she desired for him. He saw that her brows were furrowed
"and her rosy lips drawn into an unconscious pout as she said, more to"
herself than to him:
"""I wish I were a man. I'd like to engage in a business of this sort,"
something that would require ingenuity and daring. I'd like to handle
"big affairs."""
"""It seems to me that you are in a business of that sort. You are one of"
"us."""
"""Oh, but you and George are doing it all."""
"""There is your copper-mine. You surely handled that very cleverly."""
"Cherry's expression altered, and she shot a quick glance at him as he"
went on:
"""How is it coming along, by-the-way? I haven't heard you mention it"
"But Johnson was not in a laughing mood. Indeed, he looked very grave and"
serious when presently he said:
"""But people coming up here and finding me might--"""
The Girl looked up at him in blank amazement.
"""Might what?"" And then, while she waited for his answer, two shots in"
close succession rang out in the night with great distinctness.
There was no mistaking the nearness of the sound. Instantly scenting
"trouble and alert at the possibility of danger, Johnson inquired:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
"""Wait! Wait!"" came back from the Girl, unconsciously in the same tone,"
while she strained her ears for other sounds. She did not have long to
"wait, however, before other shots followed, the last ones coming from"
"further away, so it seemed, and at greater intervals."
"""They've got a road agent--it's the posse--p'r'aps they've got Ramerrez"
"or one o' his band!"" suddenly declared the Girl, at the same time"
"rushing over to the window for some verification of her words. But, as"
"before, the wind was beating with great force against the frosted panes,"
and only a vast stretch of snow met her gaze. Turning away from the
"window she now came towards him with: ""You see, whoever it is, they're"
"snowed in--they can't get away."""
Johnson knitted his brows and muttered something under his breath which
the Girl did not catch.
Again a shot was fired.
"Taken prisoner by the pirate Captain Teach on November 21st, 1718, and on"
the very next day retaken by Lieutenant Maynard. Odell received no less
"than seventy wounds in the fight, but recovered, and was carried to"
"Virginia to stand his trial for piracy, and was acquitted."
"OUGHTERLAUNEY, THOMAS."
Acted as pilot in the _Royal Fortune_. Took an active part in taking and
plundering the _King Solomon_ on the West Coast of Africa in 1721.
"Was tried for piracy with the rest of Roberts's crew, when one witness,"
"Captain Trahern, deposed that the prisoner dressed himself up in the"
"captain's best suit of clothes, his new tye wig, and called loudly for a"
"bottle of wine, and then, very arrogantly, gave orders as to the steering"
of the captured ship.
Hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722.
"PAIN, CAPTAIN."
A Bahaman privateer who in 1683 turned pirate and attacked St. Augustine
"in Florida under French colours. Being driven off by the Spaniards, he had"
to content himself with looting some neighbouring settlements. On
"returning to New Providence, the Governor attempted, but without success,"
"to arrest Pain and his crew. Pain afterwards appeared in Rhode Island, and"
"when the authorities tried to seize him and his ship, he got off by"
exhibiting an old commission to hunt for pirates given him a long while
"before by Sir Thomas Lynch. When the West Indies became too hot for him,"
Pain made the coast of Carolina his headquarters.
"his grotesque body, spoke for him."
"""That,"" he was certainly saying, ""is what will happen to any on your"
"helpless planet who dare oppose the Rogan will!"""
He whipped out a command to the terror-stricken girl. She rose from
her crouching position on the floor; and at length formulated the
Rogan's last order:
"""You will explain the working of the engine that drove your space ship"
"here."""
"Dex laughed. It was a short bark of sound, totally devoid of humor,"
but very full of defiance. Brand thrust his hands into the pockets of
"his tunic, spread his legs apart, and began to whistle."
*       *       *       *       *
A quiver that might have been of anger touched the Rogan leader's
repulsive little mouth. He glared balefully at the uncowed Earthmen
"and spoke again, evidently repeating his command. The two turned their"
backs to him to indicate their refusal to obey.
"At that, the tall leader pointed to Dex. In an instant three of the"
guards had wound their double pairs of arms around his struggling
"body. Brand sprang to help him, but a touch of the mysterious"
discharge from the leader's tube sent him writhing to the floor.
"""It's no use, Brand,"" said Dex steadily. He too had stopped"
"struggling, and now stood quietly in the slimy coils of his captors'"
"arms. ""I might as well go along with them and get it over with. I"
"probably won't see you again. Good luck!"""
and awful death. Montagu Askew was in the business. He was one of the
few that came out alive.
"In the rush of the distraught ladies, princesses, duchesses, maids, to"
"the sole outlet of the seething hell, Montagu Askew got caught near the"
door--frantic hands of terrified women clutched at him for help--he was
almost within reach of the free air--could see the sunlight a few paces
"before him--a frightened girl clung to his arm in the awful crush, then"
"another--women’s skirts got under foot as they made for the door, and"
"they went down. He tried to shake himself clear of the two girls, he"
was a little slender man.... The heat was hellish.... One of the girls
"tripped on her skirt and fell, clinging to him. He beat her down with"
the jade-handled cane--fought his way blindly through the rush of women
for the door--stood at last out in the sunlight.
"Some coachmen were dashing into the fiery furnace, lifting up and"
"bringing out fainting women, whose muslin skirts were in flames."
But Monty Askew was frightened.
He smoothed his ruffled dress and went home.
"Montagu Askew, entering a café with Rupert Greppel one evening, saluted"
"Noll Baddlesmere, where he stood amongst a group of students; and a"
silence fell upon the place.
Noll nodded:
"“That’s a handsome cane, Askew,” said he--“though they tell me the"
women have a poor opinion of it.”
"""Take this lady and her maid straight up to the suite next mine,"""
"ordered Slyne as Sallie alighted, while Captain Dove listened, all ears."
"""And ask Mr. Jobling to join me in my sitting-room. He's still here, I"
"suppose?"""
"He gave vent to a heartfelt sigh of relief as the man, already preceding"
"his charges indoors, paused to answer in the affirmative."
"""I needn't book a room for you,"" he told Captain Dove, with calculated"
"indifference. ""But Sallie must have somewhere to leave Ambrizette."
"""Hey! you. Call my chauffeur to take the car round to the garage."""
"Captain Dove followed him toward the bureau, attracting not a few"
glances of mingled surprise and amusement from the elaborate idlers in
its neighbourhood. Slyne was furious.
"""I can't have him tagging about after me in that ghastly get-up!"" he"
told himself on the way to the elevator; and cuffed the elevator-boy's
ears at the sound of a mirthful sneeze with which that unfortunate youth
"had become afflicted. ""Though how the deuce I'm to help myself I don't"
"know."""
In the corridor at which they got out he caught sight of Mr. Jobling
"approaching, and hurried Captain Dove into the sitting-room of his"
suite.
"""Give me five minutes to change my clothes,"" he requested of the old"
"man. ""And don't get straying about, or you'll lose yourself."""
Mr. Jobling met him on the threshold as he shut the door. That gentleman
"""No,"" she answered in that hard voice, by which I knew that mention of"
"Yolande's name had displeased her.  ""Remember that we are friends, and"
"that sometimes we have interests in common.  Therefore, take this piece"
"of advice from an old woman who knows."""
"""Knows what?"""
"""Knows that your friendship with the pretty Yolande is dangerous--"
"extremely dangerous."""
CHAPTER TEN.
CONFESSION.
"Next day, when the manservant asked me into the tiny boudoir in the Rue"
"de Courcelles, I found Yolande, in a pretty tea-gown of cream silk"
"adorned with lace and ribbons, seated in an armchair in an attitude of"
"weariness.  The sun-shutters were closed, as on the previous day, for"
"the heat in Paris that July was insufferable, and in the dim light her"
wan figure looked very fair and fragile.  The qualities which imparted
to her a distinct individuality were the beautiful combination of the
pastoral with the elegant--of simplicity with elevation--of spirit with
sweetness.
"She gave vent to a cry of gladness as I entered, rose, and stretching"
"out her hands in welcome, drew a seat for me close to her.  I looked at"
"her standing before me in her warm, breathing, human loveliness."
"""You are better, Yolande?  Ah! how glad I am!""  I commenced.  ""Last"
"night I believed that you were dead."""
"""And if I had died would it really have mattered so very much to you?"""
revolver rang out at precisely the same moment. There was a yell of
"fury, followed by a crash. Then almost oppressive silence."
"Bob was on his feet like a cat, fingers gripping the automatic he had"
"snatched from the owner’s nerveless hand. His jaw was hard, and there"
was a glint of more than anger in the eyes he bent upon Joyce’s
supporters hurrying up to the aid of their chief.
"“Hands up!” he cried out harshly, “Quick!”"
"He did not have to speak twice. There was something in his voice,"
"coupled with an emphatic gesture with the automatic, which made those"
"six men, big and powerful as they were, obey him with remarkable"
unanimity.
"“Take their guns, Jack,” continued Bainbridge, in that same commanding"
voice.
"Peters stepped forward to obey. The first man drew back instinctively,"
and started to pull down the hand which held a revolver. Without an
instant’s hesitation Bob fired. The bullet struck the upraised weapon on
"its blued-steel barrel, wringing a cry of surprise and pain from the"
fellow’s lips as he dropped the gun.
"There was no more trouble after that, Peters collected four revolvers"
and two Remingtons. Then he glanced questioningly at Bainbridge.
"“Throw ’em in the river,” the latter commander curtly. “’Way out in the"
"middle, where they can’t be recovered.”"
"The riverman walked a few steps toward the bank; then, pausing, he"
glanced back at the straight young figure standing behind him.
half a score of games were in progress at different points of the
quarry-like cauldron which formed the outlaws' rendezvous.
At once the humour of the child changed.
"""They obeyed you,"" she said; ""I like you for that. I mean to have many"
men obey me when I grow up. Then I will kill many--thousands and
"thousands. Now I can do nothing--only I have it in my head--here!"""
The elf tapped her forehead immediately underneath the red sash which
"was tied about it. The Sergeant, though eager to hear her story and"
"marvelling at such sentiments from the lips of a child, successfully"
"concealed his curiosity, and said gently, ""Tell me how you came to think"
"of to-night----"""
"""Of what to-night?"" asked the girl quickly and suspiciously."
"""The deed which is to be done to-night,"" replied the Sergeant simply, as"
though he were acquainted with the whole.
She leaped forward and caught him by the arm.
"""You will stay and go with us? You will lead us?"" she hissed, her blue"
"eyes aflame and with trembling accents, ""then indeed will I be sure of"
my revenge. Then the Italian woman and her devil's brat shall not
"escape. Then I shall be sure--sure!"""
"She repeated the last words with concentrated fury, apparently"
impossible to one of her age. The Sergeant smoked quietly and observed
her. She seemed absolutely transfigured.
"""Tell me that you will,"" she cried, low and fierce, so that her voice"
A Dominican.
"Commanded in 1831 a small gaff-topsail schooner, the _General Morazan_,"
armed with a brass eight-pounder and carrying a mixed crew of forty-four
"men, French, Italian, English, and Creoles of St. Domingo."
"VANCLEIN, CAPTAIN MOSES. Dutch filibuster."
Was serving with L'Ollonais's fleet off the coast of Yucatan when a mutiny
"broke out, of which Vanclein was the ringleader. He persuaded the"
malcontents to sail with him along the coast till they came to Costa Rica.
"There they landed and marched to the town of Veraguas, which they seized"
"and pillaged. The pirates got little booty, only eight pounds of gold, it"
proving to be a poor place.
"VANE, CAPTAIN CHARLES."
"Famous for his piratical activities off the coast of North America,"
specially the Carolinas.
"In 1718, when Woodes Rogers was sent by the English Government to break up"
"the pirate stronghold in the Bahama Islands, all the pirates at New"
Providence Island surrendered to Rogers and received the King's pardon
"except Vane, who, after setting fire to a prize he had, slipped out of the"
bay as Rogers with his two men-of-war entered. Vane sailed to the coast of
"Carolina, as did other West Indian pirates who found their old haunts too"
warm for them.
Vane is first heard of as being actively engaged in stealing from the
Spaniards the silver which they were salving from a wrecked galleon in the
prepared paper flat on the forehead of the dead man.
"When he withdrew it, I could see that it bore marks of the lines on his"
"head. Without a word, Kennedy drew from his pocket a print of the"
photograph of the smudge on Schloss’ door.
"“It is possible,” he said, half to himself, “to identify a person by"
"means of the arrangement of the sweat glands or pores. Poroscopy, Dr."
"Edmond Locard, director of the Police Laboratory at Lyons, calls it."
"The shape, arrangement, number per square centimeter, all vary in"
"different individuals. Besides, here we have added the lines of the"
forehead.”
He was studying the two impressions intensely. When he looked up from
"his examination, his face wore a peculiar expression."
“This is not the head which was placed so close to the glass of the
"door of Schloss’ office, peering through, on the night of the robbery,"
in order to see before picking the lock whether the office was empty
and everything ready for the hasty attack on the safe.”
"“That disposes of my theory that Schloss robbed himself,” remarked"
"Winters reluctantly. “But the struggle here, the sleeve of the dress,"
the pistol—could he have been shot?”
"“No, I think not,” considered Kennedy. “It looks to me more like a case"
of apoplexy.”
"“What shall we do?” asked Winters. “Far from clearing anything up, this"
complicates it.”
“Where’s Muller?” asked Kennedy. “Does he know? Perhaps he can shed
"standing, his great height bringing him so near to the low boards of the"
loft where her lover was lying that it seemed as though he must hear the
"wounded man's breathing, all other feelings were swept away by"
overwhelming fear. With the one thought that she must get rid of
"him,--do anything, say anything, but get rid of him quickly, she forced"
"herself forward, with extended hand, and said in a voice that held out"
new promise:
"""Good-night. Jack Rance,--good-night!"""
"Rance seized the hand with an almost fierce gladness in both his own,"
"his keen glance hungrily striving to read her face. Then, suddenly, he"
"released her, drawing back his hand with a quick sharpness."
"""Why, look at my hand! There's blood on it!"" he said."
"And even as he spoke, under the yellow flare of the lamp, the Girl saw a"
"second drop of blood fall at her feet. Like a flash, the terrible"
significance of it came upon her. Only by self-violence could she keep
"her glance from rising, tell-tale, to the boards above."
"""Oh, I'm so sorry,"" she heard herself saying contritely, all the time"
"desperately groping to invent a reason; at length, she added futilely:"
"""I must have scratched you."""
"Rance looked puzzled, staring at the spatter of red as though"
hypnotised.
"""No, there's no scratch there,"" he contended, wiping off the blood with"
his handkerchief.
"""Oh, yes, there is,"" insisted the Girl tremulously; ""that is, there will"
"""Come inside,"" Mr. Jobling begged hurriedly, and, looking round as he"
"followed them into his sanctum, ""Mullins!"" he snapped, ""don't stand"
"there staring. Get on with your work, at once."
"""You're later than I expected,"" he remarked to Slyne as he closed the"
"door, ""but just in time. The Court's closed, of course, for the"
"Christmas vacation, but I've filed an application for a hearing in"
"Chambers, and--"""
"He paused as a telephone-bell rang shrilly outside, and a moment later"
"the shock head of his ""managing clerk"" protruded into the room, almost"
as if it did not belong to a body at all.
"""Mr. Spettigrew says that our application in Chambers will be heard by"
"Mr. Justice Gaunt, in 57B, at eleven-thirty sharp this forenoon,"""
"announced that youth and, with a final wriggle of his long neck,"
withdrew.
"""Devil take him!"" exclaimed Captain Dove, somewhat startled and much"
"incensed. ""I wouldn't keep a crested cobra like that about me for--"""
"""Let's see those accounts of yours, now,"" said Slyne, disregarding that"
"interruption, and Mr. Jobling, having first looked at his watch,"
"produced from another drawer a great sheaf of papers, all carefully"
docketed. He slipped off the top one and somewhat reluctantly handed
that to his friend.
"Slyne took it from him eagerly, and sat for a time gloating over it with"
eyes which presently began to glow.
"But when Captain Dove, growing restless, would have glanced over his"
"""But how do the plates function?"""

"Greca did not know this, save vaguely. She tried to express her little"
knowledge of the scientific achievements of the savage Rogans. After
some moments Brand turned to Dex and said:
"""As near as I can get it, the Rogans, by this peculiar red metal"
"alloy, manage to trap and divert the permanent lines of force, the"
"magnetic field, of Jupiter itself. So the whole red spot is highly"
"magnetized, which somehow upsets natural gravitational attraction. I"
"suppose it is responsible for the discoloration of the ground, too."""
"He turned to question the girl further about this, but she had got"
nervously to her feet already.
"""I'll be taken away soon,"" she said. ""I was brought in here only to"
"urge you to eat the food. I must be interpreter, since the Rogans"
"speak not with the mind, and I know their hateful tongue."""
"""Why are they so anxious for us to eat?"" demanded Dex with an uneasy"
frown.
"""So you will be strong, and endure for a long time the--the ordeal"
"they have in store for you,"" faltered the girl at last. ""They intend"
"to force from you the secret of the power that drove your ship here,"
"so they too may have command of space."""
"""But I don't understand,"" frowned Brand. ""They must already have a"
means of space navigation. They came here to Jupiter from the
"of search, we have produced a nine-nines probability that they will not"
"locate this lifeship."""
"""And the other?"" prompted Viggon Sarri, with interest."
"""I'm not done with the first yet,"" Linus Brein said quietly. ""There"
remains the random search group. Therein lies the eight-oughts-one
"positive probability."""
"Viggon snorted. ""I call ten to the minus ten chances rather hopeless."
"But go on, Linus."""
"""The other has a sixty-forty chance,"" he said. ""If the infrawave"
detector locates the space rift that lies along our coordinate three
"seventy-six, when the ship is near seven sixty-seven, then the scout"
craft will pass within magnetic detection range of the lifeship. That's
"a lot of 'ifs', I know, but they add up to a sixty-forty chance. I"
say this because space rifts tend to produce strong responses in any
of the primitive detecting gear. They've certainly been busy running
"down space warps, which indicates that they've been getting a lot"
"of spurious responses."" He smiled. ""If space were entirely clear of"
"foreign matter and space rifts, they'd find their new detector vaguely"
"inefficient. I--"""
Viggon waved a hand to indicate he had heard enough.
"""Gentlemen,"" he said quietly. ""I've been criticized for waiting, but"
what one man calls study the other man calls timidity. We'll continue
"to wait for the final factor. Then we'll know...."""
*       *       *       *       *
"I reflected for a moment, then in a calm voice answered:"
"""Because I discovered that her heart was not wholly mine."""
She regarded me with undisguised amazement.
"""Do you mean that Yolande had another lover?"""
"""No!""  I cried with sudden resolve.  ""This conversation is not fair to"
"her.  It is all finished.  She has forgotten, and we are both happy."""
"""Happy!"" cried the Countess hoarsely.  ""You are, alas! mistaken.  Poor"
Yolande has been the most unhappy girl in all the world.  She has never
"ceased to think of you."""
"""Then I regret, madame,"" I responded."
"""If you really regret,"" she answered, ""then your love for her is not"
"altogether dead."""
"She spoke the truth.  At this point I may as well confide to you, my"
"reader, the fact that I still regarded my charming little friend of"
those careless days of buoyant youth with a feeling very nearly akin to
love.  I recollected the painful circumstances which led to our parting.
"My memory drifted back to that well-remembered, breathless summer's"
"evening when, while walking with her along the white highway near her"
"home, I charged her with friendliness towards a man whose reputation in"
"Brussels was none of the best; of her tearful protests, of my"
"all-consuming jealousy, of her subsequent dignity, and of our parting."
"After that I had applied to the Foreign Office to be transferred, and a"
month later found myself in Rome.
"""I'm not suicidal."" He stepped back as Vera proceeded to pat them down."
"""I think very carefully about my options."""
"""Get the money."" She was directing the two remaining _Mino-gumi kobun"
_toward the table.
"""Gonna just rob the bank now, Comrade?"" Vance turned and looked at her,"
then at the three bodies strewn on the floor. The _kobun _seemed to
consider their late colleagues merely casualties of war. The dead men
"received almost no notice. ""Pretty costly little enterprise, wouldn't"
you say. Not a very propitious start for your new era of world
"serenity."""
"""You would be advised to shut up,"" she responded sharply."
"""I feel personally violated by all this."" Nogami had turned to her and"
"his voice was like steel. ""As of this moment, you can put out of your"
mind any illusion I might cooperate further. This outrage is beyond
"acceptability."""
"""We did what had to be done,"" Vera said. ""We still expect your"
"cooperation and I do not think we will be disappointed."""
"""Then your expectation is sadly misplaced,"" he replied icily. His eyes"
signified he meant every word.
"""We will see."" She dismissed him as she turned her attention to the"
money. The two _kobun_ had carefully removed their shiny black leather
jackets now and laid them on the table. Underneath they wore tightly
"tailored white shirts, complete with underarm holsters containing 9mm"
"Llamas. The automatics were back in their briefcases, positioned by the"
"Two of its nine satellites were in sight at the moment, with a third"
edging over the western rim.
"""Makes you think you're drunk and seeing triple, doesn't it?"""
"commented Dex, who was staring out the thick glass panel beside Brand."
"""Nine moons! Almost enough for one planet!"""
"Brand nodded abstractly, and concentrated on the control board."
Rapidly the ship rocketed down toward the surface. The disk became a
"whirling, gigantic plate; and then an endless plain, with cloud"
formations beginning to take on definite outline.
"""About to enter Jupiter's atmosphere."" Brand spoke into the radio"
transmitter. Over the invisible thread of radio connection between the
"space ship and Earth, four hundred million miles behind, flashed the"
message.
"""All right. For God's sake, be careful,"" came the answer, minutes"
"later. ""Say something at least every half hour, to let us know"
"communication is unbroken. We will sound at ten second intervals."""
"The sounding began: _peep_, a shrill little piping noise like the"
fiddle of a cricket. Ten seconds later it came again: _peep_.
"Thereafter, intermittently, it keened through the control room--a"
"homely, comforting sound to let them know that there was a distant"
thread between them and Earth.
*       *       *       *       *
Lower the shell rocketed. The endless plain slowly ceased its rushing
underneath them as they entered the planet's atmosphere and began to
be pulled around with it in its revolution. Far to the west a faint

"I muse on all this, and understand that her staying here is somehow"
"connected with her carnal desires, with the fact that Solem is still here."
"How muddled it all is, and how this handsome girl has been spoiled! I saw"
"her not long ago, tall and proud, upright, untouched, walking"
"intentionally close to Solem, yet not replying to his greeting. Did she"
suspect him of complicity in the death of the lawyer and avoid him for
"that reason? Not in the least; she avoided him less than before, even"
"letting him take her letters to the post office, which she had not done"
"previously. But she was unbalanced, a poor thing that had lost her"
"bearings. Whenever she could, she secretly defiled herself with pitch,"
with dung; she sniffed at foulness and was not repelled.
"One day, when Solem swore a needlessly strong oath at a horse that was"
"restless, she looked at him, shivered, and went a deep red. But she"
"mastered herself at once, and asked Josephine:"
"""Isn't that man leaving soon?"""
"""Yes,"" Josephine replied, ""in a few days."""
Though she had seized this opportunity to ask her question with a great
"show of indifference, I am certain it was an important one to her. She"
went away in silence.
"Yes, Miss Torsen stayed, for she was sexually bound to Solem. Solem's"
"despair, Solem's rough passion that she herself had inflamed, his"
"Hark, how the bells ring on the hillside!"
"Romantic? Yes. Mere sentimentality, mood, rhyme--nothing? Yes."
It is the last happiness.
XXIII
The sun has returned. Not darkly glowing and regal--more than that:
"imperial, because it is flaming. This you do not understand, my friend,"
whatever the language in which it is dished up for you. But I say there is
an imperial sun in the sky.
"It's a good day for going to the woods; it is sweeping time, for the woods"
are full of yellow things that have come suddenly into being. A short time
"ago they were not there, or I did not see them, or they had the earth's"
"own complexion. There is something unborn about them, like embryos in an"
"early stage. But if I whirl them about, they are miracles of fulfillment."
"Here are fungi of every sort, mushrooms and puffballs. How close is the"
"poisonous mushroom to the happy family of the edible mushroom, and how"
innocently it stands there! Yet it is deadly. What magnificent cunning! A
"spurious fruit, a criminal, habitual vice itself, but preening in splendor"
"and brilliance, a very cardinal of fungi. I break off a morsel to chew; it"
"is good and soft on the tongue, but I am a coward and spit it out again."
Was it not the poisonous mushroom that drove men berserker? But in the
"dawn of our own day, we die of a hair in the throat."
"""Dex!"" he cried. ""We're moving! And the motor is shut off!"""
"""We're drawing down closer to the ground, too,"" announced Dex,"
"pointing to their altimeter. ""Our altitude has been reduced five"
"thousand feet in the last two minutes."""
"Quickly Brand turned on the motor in reverse. The space ship, as the"
"rushing, reddish ground beneath indicated, continued to glide forward"
as though pulled by an invisible rope. He turned on full power. The
ship's progress was checked a little. A very little! And the metallic
red surface under them grew nearer as they steadily lost altitude.
"""Something seems to have got us by the nose,"" said Dex. ""We're on our"
"way to the center of the red spot, I guess--to find whatever it was"
that Journeyman found. And the radio communication his been broken
"somehow...."""
"Wordlessly, they stared out the panel, while the shell, quivering with"
the strain of the atomic motor's fight against whatever unseen force
"it was that relentlessly drew them forward, bore them swiftly toward"
the heart of the vast crimson area.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Look!"" cried Brand."
"For over an hour the ship had been propelled swiftly, irresistibly"
toward the center of the red spot. It had been up about forty thousand
"feet. Now, with a jerk that sent both men reeling, it had been drawn"
down to within fifteen thousand feet of the surface; and the sight
that was now becoming more and more visible was incredible.
"""My poor Yolande!  My poor daughter!""  Finding that my endeavours to"
"console her were futile, I went forth and made inquiries of the three"
frightened maidservants regarding what had occurred.
"One of them, a dark-eyed Frenchwoman in frilled cap, whom I had seen on"
"my previous visit, said, in answer to my questions:"
"""Jean discovered the poor mademoiselle in the petit salon about a"
quarter of an hour after m'sieur had left.  She was lying upon her face
"near the window, quite rigid.  He shouted; we all rushed in, and on"
"examining her found that she was already dead."""
"""But was there no sign of a struggle?""  I inquired, leading the way to"
the room indicated.
"""The room was just as m'sieur sees it now,"" she answered, with a wave of"
her hand.
"I glanced around, but as far as I could distinguish it was exactly as I"
had left it.
"""There was no mark of violence--nothing to show that mademoiselle had"
"been the victim of foul play?"""
"""Nothing, m'sieur."""
Could it have been a case of suicide?  I wondered.  Yolande's words
"before I had taken leave of her were desponding, and almost led me to"
believe that she had taken her life rather than face the man Wolf who
had so suddenly arrived in Paris--the man who exercised upon her some
"mysterious influence, the nature of which I could not guess."
Enter the name of a firm under the family name rather than the
"forename, and do not fill out the forenames: e.g., _Friedlander"
"und Sohn, Raphael_, not under _Raphael_; _Stokes, F. A. Co._, not"
"_Stokes, Frederick A. Co._"
The consulter is much more likely to remember the family than the
Christian name. Whether the Christian name is written at the end
"or thus, _Town (John)_ and _Bowers (Henry)_, all firms should be"
"arranged after all the other entries of the first family name, i.e.,"
_Friedlander und Sohn_ after all the _Friedlanders_.
"This rule might be extended to include corporations, colleges,"
"libraries, etc., whose legal names include forenames. Entry under a"
"forename, as _Silas Bronson Library_, and especially under initials, as"
"_T. B. Scott Public Library_, is awkward. But the public habit is not"
yet sufficiently settled to justify an exception.
Enter the universities of the European continent and of Central and
South America under the name of the place; all other societies
"under _Königliche_, _Herzogliche_, etc."
Cross-reference from the first word in the university names and from
the place of societies.
"A few learned academies, commonly called by the names of the cities"
"where they are established, may be entered under the place with a"
"cross-reference from the name. These are _Berlin, Göttingen, Leipzig,"
"Lisbon, Madrid, Munich, St. Petersburg, Vienna_."
"Enter national libraries, museums, and galleries, as well as"
"libraries, museums, and galleries instituted or supported by a"
"distance glimmered the sea, and by a rock upon the hillside, armed"
"men, a knot of spears, shone like spirit sentinels athwart the west."
"Mists were creeping up the valleys, as the sun went down into the sea."
A few sparse stars gleamed out like souls still tortured by the
mysteries of life. An inevitable pessimism seemed to challenge the
"universe, taking for its parable the weird afterglow of the west."
Deep in the woods a voice sang wild and solitary in the gathering
"gloom. Like the cry of a ghost, it seemed to set the silence"
"quivering, the leaves quaking with windless awe. The men who looked"
"towards the sea heard it, a song that echoed in the heart like woe."
The duke pointed into the darkening wood.
"""Trust your own heart: self is the man! Through a mistaken sense of"
duty have you been brought nigh unto death and despair! Trust not in
"sophistry: the laws of men are carven upon stone, the laws of Heaven"
"upon the heart! Be strong! From henceforth, scorn mere words! Trample"
"tradition in the dust! Trust yourself, and the God in your heart!"""
The distant voice had sunk into silence. Francesco listened for it
with hands aloft.
"""I must go,"" he said."
"""Go!""--"
"""I must be near her through the night!"""
"""The moon stands full upon the hills! I will await you here!"""
"Dim were the woods that autumn evening, dim and deep with an ecstasy"
"Risca than Risca saw into him. He did not answer the question, for he"
"penetrated, through the fuliginous vapours whence it proceeded, into the"
"crystal regions of the man's spirit. It was he, after a while, who held"
"Risca with his eyes, and it was all that was beautiful and spiritual"
in Risca that was held. And then Herold reached out his hand slowly and
touched him.
“We go down to Southcliff together.”
Risca drew a deep breath.
"“Let us go this evening,” said he."
A few hours afterward when the open cab taking them from the station
to the Channel House came by the sharp turn of the road abruptly to the
"foot of the cliff, and the gusty southwest wind brought the haunting"
"smell of the seaweed into his nostrils, and he saw the beacon-light in"
"the high west window shining like a star, a gossamer feather from the"
wings of Peace fell upon the man's tortured soul.
CHAPTER III
IT will be remembered that Stellamaris was a young person of bountiful
fortune. She had stocks and shares and mortgages and landed property
faithfully administered under a deed of trust. The Channel House and
"all that therein was, except Sir Oliver and Lady Blount's grievances,"
belonged to her. She knew it; she had known it almost since infancy.
The sense of ownership in which she had grown up had its effect on her
"character, giving her the equipoise of a young reigning princess, calm"
must pay me one of her garters as her admission fee to this inn. If she
"be madam, she enters free. It is a privilege conferred on the Maid's"
"Garter by good St. Augustine when he was Bishop of Canterbury, so long"
"ago that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary."""
"""What nonsense is this?"" asked Frances, turning to me, and Bettina asked"
"the same question with her eyes. I explained the matter, and Frances,"
"turning to the porter, said:--"
"""I'll buy you off with a jacobus or a guinea."""
"""Not a hundred guineas would buy me off, my lady,"" answered the porter,"
"bowing, ""though I might say that a shilling usually goes with the"
"garter."""
"""Well, I'll send you both the shilling and the garter from my room,"" said"
"Frances, moving toward the inn door."
"""The garter must be paid here, my lady. The shilling may be paid at any"
"time,"" returned the porter, with polite insistence."
"Frances was about to protest, but Betty, more in sympathy with the"
"eccentric customs of inns, modestly lifted her skirts, untied her garter"
"and offered it to the porter, telling him very seriously:--"
"""I am a maid."""
"The porter thanked her gravely, whereupon Frances, turning her back on"
"the audience in the doorway, brought forth her garter, gave it to the"
"porter, and we were admitted."
"Our supper, beds, and breakfast were all so good that they reconciled"

_Prize Salvage._

"His Majesty's ships of war, she may, with the consent of the"
"re-captors, prosecute her voyage, and it shall not be necessary for the"
million dollars’ worth of high-priced cars every year. The police seem
"to be powerless to stop it. We appeal to them, but with no result. So,"
now we have taken things into our own hands.”
“What are you doing in this case?” asked Kennedy.
“What the insurance companies have to do to recover stolen
"automobiles,” Garwood replied. “For, with all deference to your friend,"
"Deputy O’Connor, it is the insurance companies rather than the police"
who get stolen cars back.”
"He had pulled out a postal card from a pigeon hole in his desk,"
selecting it from several apparently similar. We read:
$250.00 REWARD
"We will pay $100.00 for car, $150.00 additional for information which"
"will convict the thief. When last seen, driven by a woman, name not"
"known, who is described as dark-haired, well-dressed, slight,"
"apparently thirty years old. The car is a Dixon, 1912, seven-passenger,"
"touring, No. 193,222, license No. 200,859, New York; dark red body,"
"mohair top, brass lamps, has no wind shield; rear axle brake band"
device has extra nut on turnbuckle not painted. Car last seen near
"Prince Henry Hotel, New York City, Friday, the 10th."
"Communicate by telegraph or telephone, after notifying nearest police"
"department, with Douglas Garwood, New York City."
"“The secret of it is,” explained Garwood, as we finished reading, “that"
there are innumerable people who keep their eyes open and like to earn
money easily. Thus we have several hundreds of amateur and enthusiastic
"We paraded, and marched off to work. The continuous roar gradually gave"
"place to irregular, though frequent, outbursts of firing along the"
entire front.
The next day the sound seemed to have come nearer. Rumours began to
"circulate--it was said that Armentières had fallen, that the Portuguese"
"had been annihilated at Merville, that the British had counter-attacked"
and taken Lille.
"Rations, newspapers and letters were delayed. Large bodies of troops"
"passed through the village. We got no definite or official news, and"
nobody had any clear notion of what was happening.
But the sound of firing grew louder and louder and our anxiety deepened.
There could no longer be any doubt about it--the Germans were advancing
on our front.
The sickening certainty transcended all other considerations. A few
miles from us thousands were being slaughtered. I ceased to ponder the
problems of failure and success. I forgot the politicians and was
"conscious of only one despairing wish, that the terrible thing might"
come to an end. Victory and defeat seemed irrelevant considerations. If
only the end would come quickly--nothing else really mattered.
I often wondered what was in the minds of the other men. Many of them
"looked anxious, but on the whole they were normal in their behaviour."
They grumbled and quarrelled much as usual and talked rather more than
"usual--but so did I, in spite of my intense mental agitation."
The sound of firing grew louder.
"""Hello, white folks! Here we are, all together again."""
They turned to behold a villanous-looking man beaming benignly upon
"them. He was dirty, his clothes were in rags, and through a riotous"
bristle of beard that hid his thin features a mangy patch showed on
"either cheek. It was undeniably ""Fingerless"" Fraser, but how changed,"
how altered from that radiant flower of indolence they had known! He
"was pallid, emaciated, and bedraggled; his attitude showed hunger and"
"abuse, and his bony joints seemed about to pierce through their"
"tattered covering. As they stood speechless with amazement, he made his"
identification complete by protruding his tongue from the corner of his
mouth and gravely closing one eye in a wink of exceeding wisdom.
"""Fraser!"" they cried in chorus, then fell upon him noisily, shaking his"
grimy hands and slapping his back until he coughed weakly. Summoned by
"their shouts, Big George broke in upon the incoherent greeting, and at"
sight of his late comrade began to laugh hoarsely.
"""Glad to see you, old man!"" he cried, ""but how did you get here?"""
"Fraser drew himself up with injured dignity, then spoke in dramatic"
"accents. ""I worked my way!"" He showed the whites of his eyes,"
tragically.
"""You look like you'd walked in from Kansas,"" George declared."
"""Yes, sir, I _worked! Me!""_"
"""How? Where?"""
"""On that bloody wind-jammer."" He stretched a long arm toward the harbor"
in a theatrical gesture.

HISTORY OF A DISCOVERY
Substance of a Lecture delivered by Prof. J. C. Bose on the 20th
"November 1915, at the Ram Mohan Library, under the Presidency of the"
"Hon'ble Mr. P. C. Lyon, and published at p. 693, Vol. xviii, of the"
"""Modern Review"" (July to December, 1915)."
"At the tournament held before the court at Hastinapur, more than"
"twenty-five centuries ago, Karna, the reputed son of a Charioteer, had"
challenged the supremacy of Prince Arjuna. To this challenge Arjuna had
returned a scornful answer; a prince could not cross swords with one who
"could claim no nobility of descent. ""I am my own ancestor,"" replied"
"Karna, and this perhaps the earliest assertion of the right of man to"
choose and determine his own destiny. In the realm of knowledge also the
great achievements have been won only by men with determined purpose and
without any adventitious aids. Undismayed by human limitations they had
struggled in spite of many a failure. In their inquiry after truth they
"regarded nothing as too laborious, nothing too insignificant, nothing"
too painful. This is the process which all must follow; there is no
easier path.
The lecturer's research on the properties of Electric Waves was begun
just twenty-one years ago. In this he was greatly encouraged by the
"appreciation shown by the Royal Society, which not only published his"
"researches, but also offered a Parliamentary grant for the continuance"
attract the surly pair who played at cards.
"""Now you might try Airedale and Pekinese,"" Tommy suggested, but this was"
lost on the serious little man. Yet he did call in another strangely
"sounding tongue, then with a sigh laid the megaphone down, saying:"
"""They must be stuffies!"""
"""Dummies, sir, dummies,"" Tommy corrected. ""Nice people don't say"
"stuffies, ever!"""
"""Your Tommy does so much cut-upping, eh!"" he smiled at me. I had noticed"
that when preoccupied or excited the idioms of his various languages got
tumbled into a rather hopeless potpourri.
Quarantine and customs were passed in the leisurely fashion of Cuban
"officials, and Monsieur asked to be sent immediately ashore, promising"
"to return at sundown. There was a man, the secret agent, he explained,"
who held important information.
"""I'll have the launch for you at Machina wharf, sir,"" Gates told him,"
"but he refused to consider this, declaring that he could hire any of the"
boatmen thereabout to bring him out.
"""He's that considerate, sir,"" Gates later confided to me. ""But I carn't"
make head nor tail of him. Bilkins says he went in to lay out his
"clothes, and the things he's got stuck in those bags would astonish"
"you!"""
"Nearing six o'clock a skiff drew alongside, being propelled by one"
oar--a method much in vogue with Havana harbormen--and when Monsieur
came aboard we saw at once evidences of disappointment. His arms hung

"“Oh my!” laughed Jimmie, as the fat confidential clerk struggled under"
difficulties to make himself more presentable. “If you think you’re in a
"muss, just look at this beautiful new khaki uniform I put on only a day"
"or two ago! It’s a peach, ain’t it?”"
"“It certainly is in a mess,” admitted Gilroy."
"“Of course,” grinned Jimmie. “I fell down a chute, and rolled into the"
"basement of a mountain, and climbed up a smutty chimney, and fell into a"
secret passage and had all kinds of sport! Ned and I have had a glorious
morning. You should have been with us.”
"The confidential clerk frowned slightly, but made no reply."
"When the boys reached the camp, after giving a great deal of mental and"
"physical assistance to the clerk, they found it just as they had left"

"“Now, what kind of blockheads do you think they are to go away and leave"
the camp like this?” Jimmie asked.
"The boy did not know, of course, that his own signal, shown from the"
"granite rock, had led to their departure, and also to their subsequent"
encounter with the half-breeds.
"“We don’t know why they left,” Ned answered, “but we must suppose that"
they had some good reason for doing so.”
"“Do I understand,” Gilroy asked, “that something has happened to your"
"He stopped her at last, and they talked in the half-light, floating"
"along together half dreamily, as if upon the bosom of some great"
current that bore them into strange regions which they dreaded yet
longed to explore.
"They heard a child crying somewhere in the rear of the house, and"
"Chakawana's voice soothing, then in a moment the Indian girl appeared"
in the doorway saying something about going out with Constantine.
"Cherry acquiesced half consciously, impatient of the intrusion."
"For a long time they talked, so completely in concord that for the most"
part their voices were low and their sentences so incomplete that they
would have sounded incoherent and foolish to other ears. They were
roused finally by the appreciation that it had grown very late and a
"storm was brewing. Boyd rose, and going to the door, saw that the sky"
"was deeply overcast, rendering the night as dark as in a far lower"
latitude.
"""I've overstayed my welcome,"" he ventured, and smiled at her answering"
laugh.
"With a trace of solicitude, she said:"
"""Wait! I'll get you a rain-coat,"" but he reached out a detaining hand."
In the darkness it encountered the bare flesh of her arm.
"""Please don't! You'd have to strike a light to find it, and I don't"
"want a light now."""

that he heard her sharp-drawn breath.

interest.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"RELICS IN GENERAL, AND THE IRON CROWN OF LOMBARDY IN PARTICULAR."
"ROME, _December 23, 1902_."
I had heard of relics before. Years ago I had read Mark Twain's account
of the large piece of the true cross which he had seen in a church in
the Azores; and of another piece which he had seen in the Cathedral
"of Notre Dame in Paris, besides some nails of the true cross and a"
part of the crown of thorns; and of the marble chest in the Cathedral
"of San Lorenzo at Genoa, which he was told contained the ashes of St."
"John, and was wound about with the chain that had confined St. John"
when he was in prison; and of the interesting collection shown him in
"the Cathedral of Milan, including two of St. Paul's fingers and one"
punishment for your impertinence in opening my friend Copplestone's
"private letters. You have had the lesson; profit by it."""
"Dawson flushed angrily. ""Punishment! Impertinence! This to me!"""
"""Yes,"" returned the Admiral stiffly, ""beastly impertinence."""
CHAPTER IV
SABOTAGE
Dawson showed no malice towards the Admiral or myself for our
treatment of him. I do not think that he felt any; he was too fully
occupied in collecting the spoils of victory to trouble his head about
what a Scribbler or a Salt Horse might think of him. He gathered to
himself every scrap of credit which the affair could be induced to
"yield, and received--I admit quite deservedly--the most handsome"
encomiums from his superiors in office. During the two weeks he passed
in my city after the capture--weeks occupied in tracing out the
threads connecting his wretch of a prisoner with the German agents
"upon what Dawson called his ""little list""--he paid several visits both"
to my house and my office. His happiness demanded that he should read
to me the many letters which poured in from high officials of the
"C.I.D., from the Chief Commissioner, and on one day--a day of days in"
the chronicles of Dawson--from the Home Secretary himself. To me it
seemed that all these astute potentates knew their Dawson very
"thoroughly, and lubricated, as it were, with judicious flattery the"
machinery of his energies. I could not but admire Dawson's truly royal
within his lines.
"But at the sight of little Concha, her dark eyes full of light, her"
"hands clapping together in innocent delight, her white teeth disclosed"
"in gay and dainty laughter, a certain _maja_ note of daring unconvention"
"in her costume, she was so exactly all that would have sent him into"
"raptures twenty years before when he was an apprentice in Tortosa, that"
the grim man only smiled and turned again to the unwilling spokesman of
the municipality of Sarria.
A voice from the press before the burning house announced the delegate's
quality.
"""Don Raphael de Flores, son of our _alcalde_."""
"""Speak on, Don Raphael,"" cried Cabrera; ""I will not shoot you unless it"
"should be necessary."""
Thus encouraged the trembling youth began.
"""Your Excellency,"" he quavered, ""we of Sarria have nothing to do with"
the family of Fernandez. We would not give any one of them a handful of
maize or a plate of lentil broth if he were starving. We are loyal men
and women--well-wishers to the cause of the only true and absolute King
"Carlos Quinto."""
"""I am credibly informed that it is otherwise,"" said Cabrera, ""and that"
you are a den of red-hot nationals. I therefore impose a fine of two
"thousand _duros_ on the municipality, and as you are the alcalde's son,"
"we will keep you in durance till they be paid."""
Don Raphael fell on his knees. His pale face was reddened by the flames
"""Everyman can WILL his own destiny,""--returned Alwyn firmly. ""That is"
"just it. But here we are getting into a serious discussion, and I had"
"determined to talk no more on such subjects till to-night."""
"""And to-night we are to go in for them thoroughly, I"
"suppose?""--inquired Villiers with a quick look. ""To-night, my dear boy,"
"you will have to decide whether you consider me mad or sane,"" said"
"Alwyn cheerfully--""I shall tell you truths that seem like romances--and"
"facts that sound like fables,--moreover, I shall have to assure you"
"that miracles DO happen whenever God chooses, in spite of all human"
denial of their possibility. Do you remember Whately's clever
skit--'Historical Doubts of Napoleon I'?--showing how easy it was to
logically prove that Napoleon never existed?--That ought to enlighten
"people as to the very precise and convincing manner in which we can, if"
"we choose, argue away what is nevertheless an incontestible FACT. Thus"
do skeptics deny miracles--yet we live surrounded by miracles! ... do
"you think me crazed for saying so?"""
"Villiers laughed. ""Crazed! No, indeed!--I wish every man in London were"
"as sane and sound as you are!"""
"""Ah, but wait till to-night!"" and Alwyn's eyes sparkled"
"mirthfully--""Perhaps you will alter your opinion then!""--Here,"
"collecting his scattered manuscripts, he put them by--""I've done work"
"for the present,""--he said--""Shall we go for a walk somewhere?"""
"Villiers assented, and they left the room together."
CHAPTER XXXV.
detectives watching all over the city and country for any car that
looks suspicious.”
"Kennedy thanked him for his courtesy, and we rose to go. “I shall be"
"glad to keep you informed of anything that turns up,” he promised."
CHAPTER XX
THE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY
"In the laboratory, Kennedy quietly set to work. He began by tearing"
from the germ letter the piece of gelatine and first examining it with
"a pocket lens. Then, with a sterile platinum wire, he picked out"
several minute sections of the black spot on the gelatine and placed
"them in agar, blood serum, and other media on which they would be"
likely to grow.
"“I shall have to wait until to-morrow to examine them properly,” he"
"remarked. “There are colonies of something there, all right, but I must"
have them more fully developed.”
"WHAT to read. This is like giving a loaded gun to a boy and saying,"
"'Shoot away! ... No matter in which direction you point your aim, . ."
"shoot yourself if you like, and others too,--anyhow, you've GOT the"
gun!' Of course there are a few fellows who have occasionally drawn up
"a list of books as suitable for everybody's perusal,--but then these"
"lists cannot be taken as true criterions, as they all differ from one"
another as much as church sects. One would-be instructor in the art of
reading says we ought all to study 'Tom Jones'--now I don't see the
the regular service and do so under efficient supervision. And there
was created the Government bureau designated as the Planetary
"Exploration Control Board, which was headed by Commander Stone."
*       *       *       *       *
Under this Board the exploration of the planets was undertaken
"methodically and efficiently, with a minimum of lives sacrificed."
"Mercury was charted, tested for essential minerals, and found to be a"
valueless rock heap too near the sun to support life.
Venus was visited and explored segment by segment; and friendly
relations were established with the rather stupid but peaceable people
found there.
Mars was mapped. Here the explorers had lingered a long time: and all
over this planet's surface were found remnants of a vast and intricate
"civilization--from the canals that laced its surface, to great cities"
with mighty buildings still standing. But of life there was none. The
atmosphere was too rare to support it; and the theory was that it had
constantly thinned through thousands of years till the last Martian
had gasped and died in air too attenuated to support life even in
creatures that must have grown greater and greater chested in eons of
adaptation.
Then Jupiter had been reached: and here the methodical planet by
"planet work promised to be checked for a long time to come. Jupiter,"
"with its mighty surface area, was going to take some exploring! It"
would be years before it could be plotted even superficially.
*       *       *       *       *
The Captain in such cases put on a serious face and began speaking with
"killing irony on the theme of weakness of character, of the animal"
"delight of intoxication, and on such subjects as suited the occasion."
One must do him justice: he was captivated by his role of mentor and
"moralist, but the lodgers dogged him, and, listening sceptically to his"
"exhortations to repentance, would whisper aside to each other:"
"""Cunning, skilful, shifty rogue!  I told you so, but you would not"
"listen.  It's your own fault!"""
"""His honour is really a good soldier.  He goes first and examines the"
"road behind him!"""
The teacher then hunted here and there till he found his friend again
"in some corner, and grasping his dirty coat, trembling and licking his"
"dry lips, looked into his face with a deep, tragic glance, without"
articulate words.
"""Can't you?"" asked the Captain sullenly."
The teacher answered by bowing his head and letting it fall on his
"breast, his tall, thin body trembling the while."
"""Wait another day ... perhaps you will be all right then,"" proposed"
"Kuvalda.  The teacher sighed, and shook his head hopelessly."
The Captain saw that his friend's thin body trembled with the thirst
"for the poison, and took some money from his pocket."
"""In the majority of cases it is impossible to fight against fate,"" said"
"he, as if trying to justify himself before someone. But if the teacher"
"all the world to see,"" returned Betty, arching her eyebrows."
"""To whom would it be directed, Betty?"" I asked, to tease her."
"A faint expression of reproach came to her eyes, but after a moment of"
"pretty hesitancy, she answered boldly:--"
"""Since you are so unwise as to ask, I'll answer in like folly. The letter"
"could be directed to but one person in the world--you."""
"I had received more than I had expected, and though I longed to make a"
"suitable return, I dared not for the sake of my vows, so we all remained"
"silent, and somewhat embarrassed, for a minute or two."
"Turning to Frances, I said: ""If you don't want me to read your letter,"
"I'll give you the key, and you may make it into cipher."" But after"
"examining the key, she declared that she could never learn to use it, and"
I suggested that she write a shorter letter in terms fit for a modest man
to read.
"The next day she handed me a shorter letter, saying that she had cut and"
"pruned it till there was nothing left worth sending, but I assured her"
that George would think otherwise.
"When I read the letter, my eyes were opened to the fact that there was"
more fire in Frances's heart than I had supposed any woman capable of
holding in subjection. But that is a mistake often made by men.
"This was my cousin's ""cut and pruned"" letter:--"
"""DEAR ONE:"
"The English author had met a colleague, with whom he stayed behind"
"talking, and Marchmont remained in the “hall,” as if it did not seem to"
him proper for him to go to his wife’s rooms.
"Susanna’s rooms were very high, had balconies on the Via Veneto, and"
were almost opposite Queen Margherita’s palace. One overlooked the
"garden and could see the Queen Mother taking her walks, which is not"
without its importance for persons who live in a republic.
Susanna was most amiable to Laura; repeated to all of them her
invitation to come and see her again; and after they had all promised
"to see one another frequently, Cæsar and Laura went down to their"
"carriage, and took a turn on the Corso by twilight."
XIII. ESTHETICS AND DEMAGOGY
_SUSANNA AND THE YOUNGSTERS_
"From this meeting on, Cæsar noticed that Marchmont paid court to Laura"
"with much persistence. A light-hearted, coquettish woman, it pleased"
"Laura to be pursued by a person like this Englishman, young,"
"distinguished, and rich; but she was not prepared to yield. Her"
"bringing-up, her class-feelings impelled her to consider adultery a"
"heinous thing. Nor was divorce a solution for her, since accepting it"
would oblige her to cease being a Catholic and to quarrel irrevocably
with the Cardinal. Marchmont showed no discretion in the way he paid
"court to Laura; he cared nothing about his wife, and talked of her with"
profound contempt....
"again and laughed softly as she made him sit, and herself sat upon his"
knee.
CHAPTER XXV.
THE TRUTH TOO LATE.
By four o'clock the next afternoon the Club had gathered ample materials
"for fresh gossip. The formalities attendant on the change of government,"
"the composition of the new Cabinet, the prospects of the election--these"
"alone would have supplied many hours, and besides them, indeed"
"supplanting them temporarily by virtue of an intenser interest, there"
"was the account of the inquest on Benyon's body. Medland had gone to it,"
"almost direct from his final interview with the Governor, and Kilshaw"
"had been there, fresh from a conference with Perry. The inquiry had"
"ended, as was foreseen directly Ned Evans' evidence was forthcoming, in"
a verdict of murder against Gaspard; but the interest lay in the course
"of the investigation, not in its issue. Mr. Duncombe, a famous comedian,"
who was then on tour in New Lindsey and had been made an honorary member
"of the Club, smacked his lips over the dramatic moment when the"
"ex-Premier, calmly and in a clear voice, had identified the person in"
"the photograph, declared the deceased man to have been Benyon, and very"
briefly stated how he had been connected with him in old days.
"""The lady,"" he said, ""is Mrs. Benyon. The other figure is that of"
"myself. I had not seen the deceased for many years."""
"""You were not on terms with him?"" asked the coroner, who, in common with"
E2-P6-W41-K3-R19-S7-M14. You will hold a constant acceleration of 981.27
centimeters between initial and final check stations. Your take-off
"will be practically unobstructed, but you will have to use the utmost"
"caution in landing upon Mars, because in order to avoid a weightless"
"detour and a loss of thirty-one minutes, you must pass very close"
to both the Martian satellites. To do so safely you must pass the
"last meteorological station, M14, on schedule time plus or minus five"
"seconds, at scheduled velocity plus or minus ten meters, with exactly"
"the given negative acceleration of 981.27 centimeters, and exactly upon"
"the pilot ray M14 will have set for you."""
"""All x."" Breckenridge studied his triplex chronometer intently, then"
"unplugged and glanced around the control room, in various parts of which"
half a dozen assistants were loafing at their stations.
"""Control and power check-out--Hipe!"" he barked. ""Driving converters and"
"projectors!"""
The first assistant scanned his meters narrowly as he swung a
"multi-point switch in a flashing arc. ""Converter efficiency 100,"
projector reactivity 100; on each of numbers one to forty-five
"inclusive. All x."""
"""Dirigible projectors!"""
*       *       *       *       *
"Two more gleaming switches leaped from point to point. ""Converter"
"efficiency 100, projector reactivity 100, dirigibility 100, on each of"
"numbers one to thirty-two, inclusive, of upper band; and numbers one to"
"thirty-two, inclusive, of lower band. All x."""
Suddenly a cart would come down one of these narrow streets without
"sidewalks, driving very quickly and scattering the women and children"
seated by the gutter.
In all these poor quarters there were lanes crossed by ropes loaded with
torn washing; there were wretched black shops from which an odour of
grease exhaled; there were narrow streets with mounds of garbage in the
"middle. In the very palaces, now shorn of their grandeur, appeared"
the same decoration of rags waving in the breeze. In the Theatre of
"Marcellus one’s gaze got lost in the depths of black caves, where smiths"
stood out against flames.
"This mixture of sumptuousness and squalor, of beauty and ugliness, was"
reflected in the people; young and most beautiful women were side by
"side with fat, filthy old ones covered with rags, their eyes gloomy, and"
of a type that recalled old African Jewesses.
_WHAT CAN BE READ ON WALLS_
Cæsar and Kennedy went on toward the Temple of Vesta and followed the
river bank until the Tiber Embankment ended.
Here the banks were green and the river clearer and more poetic. To the
left rose the Aventine with its villas; in the harbour two or three tugs
were tied up; and here and there along the pier stood a crane. Evening
was falling and the sky was filling with pink clouds.
"They sat down awhile on the side of the road, and Cæsar entertained"
himself deciphering the inscriptions written in charcoal on a mud-wall.
"1. A SOURCE below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic"
matter they have been derived by slow change.
"2. A RESERVOIR above, in which they have gathered. This is either"
a porous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.
"3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under"
"pressure owing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them"
"from escaping to the surface, the reservoir must have the shape of"
"an ANTICLINE, DOME, or LENS."
"4. It must also have an IMPERVIOUS COVER, usually a shale. In"
"these reservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous,"
reaching in extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred
pounds to the square inch. When tapped it rushes out with a
"deafening roar, sometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In"
accounting for this pressure we must remember that the gas has
been compressed within the pores of the reservoir rock by artesian
"water, and in some cases also by its own expansive force. It is"
not uncommon for artesian water to rise in wells after the
exhaustion of gas and oil.
LIFE OF THE ORDOVICIAN
"During the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types"
"already present branched widely into new genera and species, and"
new and higher types appeared.
Sponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their
climax.
STROMATOPORA--colonies of minute hydrozoans allied to corals--grew
"splendid aim, rebounded from the staff-paymaster's shiny pate."
"""The ship's company will have to make up the loss,"" he muttered."
"""They're responsible for their confounded pet."""
"""But you're responsible for the money, Staggles,"" remarked the"
"commander drily. ""At any rate, Mephisto is paying you back by"
"instalments."""
It wanted all the self-control at their command to keep the lookout
"men's attention from the comic scene to a duty of a serious nature,"
while the gun's crews temporarily forgot their duties to watch the
encounter between the mascot and the staff-paymaster.
"""Catch it--oh, you rotten butterfingers!"" groaned the accountant"
"officer to the assistant-paymaster, who, missing a coin thrown by the"
"animal, allowed the sum of one penny to be committed to the deep."
"""Here, ship's steward, nip below and open a tin of condensed. That"
"may tempt the brute below."""
"""You're condoning an offence, Staggles,"" said the commander in an"
"undertone, with a humorous gleam in his eye."
Another coin tinkled on the deck. The commander promptly placed his
foot on it to check its career towards the side.
"""Where did that go?"" asked the staff-paymaster, who, curiously"
"enough, had a miserly regard for any money except his own, which he"
spent liberally.
The commander shifted his foot and pointed to the retrieved coin; as
"he did so, another penny, hurtling through the air, hit him smartly"
"a marine signal-station as well, passing ships have to be signalled"
and reported. The spell of labour varies from four to five hours or
"more. Obviously, the task is more exacting and arduous in the winter"
than in summer. During the former season the lamps have to be lighted
"as early as 3.15 p.m., and are not extinguished until eight o’clock"
"the next morning. In the summer, on the other hand, the lamps may be"
required for less than six hours or so. In northern latitudes where the
"daylight is continuous owing to the midnight sun, the light scarcely"
seems necessary. Yet it is kept burning during the scheduled hours of
darkness.
"Thus, night in and night out the whole year round, a comparatively"
small band of faithful toilers keeps alert vigil over the dangers of
"the deep, for the benefit of those who “go down to the sea in ships,"
and do their business in great waters.” The safety of thousands of
human lives and of millions sterling of merchandise is vested in
"their keeping. The resources of the shipbuilder, the staunchness of"
"the ship, the skill and knowledge of the captain--all would count for"
"nothing were it not for the persistent, steady glare of the fixed,"
"the twinkling of the occulting, or the rhythmic, monotonous turning"
"spokes of the revolving light, thrown over the waste of waters from the"
lighthouse and the lightship.

"whose movements had been so swift and furious, but his conjectures left"
him more at sea than ever. Of one thing he felt sure. It was not enmity
alone that prompted Marsh to accuse him of the stabbing. The man was
"concealing something, in deadly fear of the truth, for rather than"
submit to questioning he had let his enemy go scot-free.
"Suddenly Boyd paused in his walk, recalling again the shadowy outlines"
of the figure with whom he had so nearly collided on his way up from
"the beach. There was something familiar about it, he mused; then, with"
"a low whistle of surprise, he smote his palms together. He began to see"
dimly.
For more than an hour the young man paced back and forth before the
"door of his sleeping-quarters, so deeply immersed in thought that only"
"the breaking storm drove him within. When at last he retired, it was"
with the certainty that this night had placed a new weapon in his hand;
"but of what tremendous value it was destined to prove, he little knew."

The main body of salmon struck into the Kalvik River on the first day

"LETTER TO THE CLEVELAND CONGRESS OF FREETHINKERS, OCTOBER, 1885."
I send my greetings to the Congress of Freethinkers assembled at
"Cleveland, and regret, more than I can express, that I am unable to"
"be there and hear all the good things you will hear, and see all the"
earnest workers you will see.
The Freethinkers of America ought to be a very proud and enthusiastic
"body, when they have in their presidential chair the ablest orator"
"of modern times, and the broadest, bravest, and most comprehensive"
"intellect that has ever been called ""Mr. President"" in this land of"
bravery and presidents. Washington was a patriot of whom we are all
justly proud. He was liberal in his religion and progressive in his
views of personal rights. And yet he had his limitations. To him liberty
"and personal rights were modified by the words, ""free, white, adult,"
"males."" He got no farther. He who fought for freedom upheld slavery! And"
yet we are all proud and glad to pay honor and respect to the memory of
Washington.
"Abraham Lincoln we place still higher on the roll of honor; for, added"
"to his still more liberal religious views, in his conceptions of freedom"
and justice he had at least two fewer limitations than had the patriot
"of 1776. He struck both ""free"" and ""white"" from his mental black list,"
and gave once more an impulse to liberty that thrilled a nation and gave
fresh dignity to the human race.
"""Sunderland"" than it had hitherto been, since the distance between"
the two airships was less than a thousand yards and was visibly
decreasing.
"""They're going to take her in tow, by Jove!"" ejaculated Aubyn, who"
had brought his binoculars to play upon the scene.
Oswestry gave a snort that implied disbelief in his brother-officer's
"assertion, but presently he exclaimed:--"
"""Well, blest if you aren't right, old man. And a deuced smart move,"""
"he added, with a true sailor's admiration for a smart manoeuvre,"
whether executed by friend or foe.
"""What a chance for our seaplanes!"" said the torpedo lieutenant."
"""They ought to have been on the spot before this."""
"""They're on the way all right, Torps,"" declared the commander. ""I"
wouldn't mind betting a month's pay that they've spotted their
"quarry. By Jove, they've established communication!"""
The undamaged Zeppelin had circled round her consort and was now
forging gently ahead. An upward jerk of the other's bows announced
that the strain on the towing hawser was beginning to be felt.
"Gradually the hitherto uncontrollable airship began to gather way,"
both vessels rolling sluggishly in the light air-currents.
"The aerial searchlight had now been switched off, but by means of the"
rays directed from the British ships the progress of the two
"Zeppelins could be followed as their huge shapes, showing ghost-like"
"in the silvery light, moved slowly in a north-easterly direction."
"The ""Sunderland,"" like her consorts, was already cleared for action."
"All the crew were behind the protected portions of the ship, but the"
captain and seven of the officers elected to fight the ship not from
the armoured conning-tower but from the fore-bridge.
"""By Jove! They're at it already,"" exclaimed Oswestry, as a series of"
rapid detonations came from across the dunes.
By the aid of their glasses the officers could discern the fleecy
mushrooms of smoke caused by the bursting of the anti-aerial guns
directed against the British airmen. Viewed from a distance it seemed
impossible that a frail aeroplane could exist amid that tornado of
shell.
"""Wireless reports mobile battery three hundred yards sou'-sou'-east"
"of Clemskercke church, sir,"" reported a signalman."
Promptly the news was transmitted to the fire-control platform. In
his lofty perch a gunnery-lieutenant was busy with a complication of
"instruments, assisted by a midshipman and three seamen."
"""Fire-control to for'ard 6-inch gun: stand by!"" came the telephonic"
"order. ""Fire-control to port battery stand by."""
"Round swung the guns, ""laid"" by the master hand of the"
gunnery-lieutenant on the fire-control platform. Docilely obedient to
the delicate mechanism they reared their muzzles high in the air.
"Then, with a crash that shook the ship, five of the 6-inch guns spoke"
simultaneously. To the accompaniment of a long-drawn shriek the
100-pound missiles hurtled through space.

"difficulties, for the seaplane was rocking violently, and in spite of"
a dangerous tilt of the elevating planes was appreciably descending.
"Suddenly the frail craft plunged, literally on end, towards the sea,"
"the force of gravity, acting with the pull of the propeller, greatly"
increasing its velocity.
When within two hundred feet of the surface the seaplane made a
"complete loop, then after climbing a hundred feet or so, began to"
side-slip.
"""By Jove! He'll be drowned for a dead cert,"" exclaimed Terence, for"
he knew for a fact that the aviator had not been thrown from the
"chassis when the seaplane ""looped the loop,"" and in consequence must"
be strapped to his seat.
"""Away sea-boat,"" ordered the captain, at the same time giving"
directions for both engines to be reversed.
"The ""Sunderland"" was considerably the nearest warship to the"
"descending airman. Already the ""Livingstone"" and her two sister-ship"
"destroyers were a mile or so away, and wearing at full speed to"
investigate a suspicious swirl in the water.
Shells were again dropping unpleasantly near to the cruiser as Aubyn
"hurried towards the boat which was, owing to being cleared for"
"action, secured inboard, abreast the after funnel."
Before he reached this spot the seaplane had struck the surface of
"the water. Falling obliquely and at a sharp angle, the impact had"
shattered one of the floats. When the cascade of spray had subsided
the wrecked craft could be seen still afloat but listing acutely. The
"missals, hours, offices, prayer books, etc., go under _Baptists,"
"Benedictines, Catholic Church, Church of England, Friends_, etc."
That part of a body which belongs to any place should be entered
"under the name of the body, not the place: e.g., _Congregationalists"
"in New England_, _Congregationalists in Massachusetts_, not _New"
"England Congregationalists_, _Massachusetts Congregationalists_. But"
cross-references must be made from the place (indeed in cases like
"_Massachusetts Convention_, _Essex Conference_, it may be doubted"
whether those well-known names should not be the headings).
"Enter corporations and quasi corporations, both English and"
"foreign, under their names as they read, neglecting an initial"

"Enter orders of knighthood, both those of medieval times and their"
"honorary modern equivalents, under the significant word of the"
"English title: e.g., _Garter, Order of the_; _Malta, Knights"
"of_; _Templars, Knights_; _Teutonic Order_; _Freemasons_. But"
"the American Knights Templars, being merely a division of the"
"Freemasons, belong under _Freemasons_; so of other regular"
masonic bodies.
The colleges of an English university and the unnamed professional
schools of an American university go under the university's
"name. Such professional schools, if they have a distinctive"
"name, particularly if at a distance from the university, or for"
"any other reason less closely connected with it, go under their"
"own name: e.g., _Oxford University, Magdalen College_; _Harvard"
"University, Veterinary School_; but _Barnard College, Columbia"
"University_; _Radcliffe College, Harvard University_; _Sheffield"
Scientific School of Yale University_.
"For my part, I would unhesitatingly give to boys and girls an element"
of strong romance in the stories which are told them even before they
are twelve. Miss Sewell says:
"“The system that keeps girls in the schoolroom reading simple stories,"
"without reading Scott and Shakespeare and Spenser, and then hands them"
"over to the unexplored recesses of the Circulating Library, has been"
shown to be the most frivolizing that can be devised.” She sets forward
"the result of her experience that a good novel, especially a romantic"
"one, read at twelve or fourteen, is really a beneficial thing."
At present many of the children from the elementary schools get their
first idea of love (if one can give it such a name) from vulgar
"pictures displayed in the shop windows, or jokes on marriage culled"
"from the lowest type of paper, or the proceedings of a divorce-court."
What an antidote to such representation might be found in the story of
"Hector and Andromache,"
"Siegfreid and Brunhild,"
"Dido and Æneas,"
"Orpheus and Eurydice,"
St. Francis and St. Clare.
One of the strongest elements we should introduce into our stories for
children of all ages is that which calls forth love of beauty. And the
"beauty should stand out, not necessarily only in delineation of noble"
"qualities in our heroes and heroines, but in beauty and strength of"
language and form.
In this latter respect the Bible stories are of such inestimable

ignore the supreme truth which is our possession and which was not
vouchsafed to the great Greek thinkers.

The way of Nature is for every species to increase nearly to its

GNEISS is the general name under which are comprised coarsely
foliated rocks banded with irregular layers of feldspar and other
minerals. The gneisses appear to be due in many cases to the
"crushing and shearing of deep-seated igneous rocks, such as"
granite and gabbro.
"THE CRYSTALLINE SCHISTS, representing the finer types of"
"foliation, consist of thin, parallel, crystalline leaves, which"
are often remarkably crumpled. These folia can be distinguished
from the laminae of sedimentary rocks by their lenticular form and
"lack of continuity, and especially by the fact that they consist"
"of platy, crystalline grains, and not of particles rounded by"
wear.

"The authorities of Panama estimate that there are about 36,000 tribal"
"Indians, that is to say aborigines, still holding their tribal"
organizations and acknowledging fealty to no other government now in the
"Isthmus. The estimate is of course largely guesswork, for few of the"
wild Indians leave the jungle and fewer still of the census enumerators
enter it. Most of these Indians live in the mountains of the provinces
"of Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veragua, or in the Darien. Their tribes"
are many and the sources of information concerning them but few. The
most accessible and complete record of the various tribes is in a
"pamphlet issued by the Smithsonian Institution, and now obtainable only"
"through public libraries, as the edition for distribution has been"
"exhausted. The author, Miss Eleanor Yorke Bell, beside studies made at"

has presented the only considerable treatise on the subject of which I

The process of electrotyping is one of the most interesting steps in
"the making of a book, and authors will find it well worth while to"
brave the grime of the black-lead in order to become familiar with the
"detail. In brief, the type form is pressed down into a tablet made of"
"wax or similar substance, in which it leaves an impression. This wax"
"tablet is then allowed to remain in a galvanic bath, through which it"
"becomes covered with a coating of copper. When separated from the wax,"
"the thin, copper replica of the composed type is backed up by an alloy,"
"and, after passing through various stages in finishing, finally becomes"
an electrotype plate.[39]

Before the men had pulled five yards the wrecked machine gave a lurch
and capsized completely. Supported by trapped air in the partially
"intact float the seaplane sank slowly, and with hardly a ripple"
disappeared from view.
With the least possible delay rescuers and rescued were taken on

Somewhat unceremoniously leaving his friend Terence hastened towards

the blast of the explosion and temporarily blinded by the pungent

a huge shell.

An Act to make further provision for the establishment of
"Prize Courts, and for other purposes connected therewith."
[_17th August 1894._]
"Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the"
"advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in"
"this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as"
follows:
[Sidenote: Short Title.]
"1. This Act may be cited as the Prize Courts Act, 1894."
[Sidenote: Constitution of Prize Courts in British Possessions.]
"2.--(1) Any commission, warrant, or instructions from Her Majesty the"
Queen or the Admiralty for the purpose of commissioning or regulating
"the procedure of a prize court at any place in a British possession may,"
"notwithstanding the existence of peace, be issued at any time, with a"
direction that the court shall act only upon such proclamation as
herein-after mentioned being made in the possession.
"(2) Where any such commission, warrant, or instructions have been"
"issued, then, subject to instructions from Her Majesty, the Vice-Admiral"
"of such possession may, when satisfied, by information from a Secretary"
"of State or otherwise, that war has broken out between Her Majesty and"
"any foreign State, proclaim that war has so broken out, and thereupon"
"the said commission, warrant, and instructions shall take effect as if"
the same had been issued after the breaking out of such war and such
foreign State were named therein.

"chest was dull, with signs of the presence of fluid, the heart"
being displaced to the left. There was considerable distress;
"the respirations averaged 40, the pulse 100, and the"
temperature reached 101.5° the first evening after arrival.
On the nineteenth day the thorax was aspirated (Mr. Hanwell)
"and 50 ounces of dirty red-coloured fluid, half clot, half"
"serum, were evacuated. Considerable relief was afforded; the"
respirations became slightly less frequent; the heart returned
"to a normal position, and distant tubular respiration was"
audible. The temperature dropped to normal the third day after
"evacuation of the fluid, but on the sixth day it again"
"commenced to rise, and meanwhile fluid again began to collect."
On the twenty-sixth day a second aspiration resulted in the
evacuation of 35 ounces of bloody fluid in which flakes of
lymph were found. Three days later the temperature became
"normal. The respirations fell to 22, and the patient made an"
uninterrupted recovery.

Eastern and Western seaboards of this country in the times of
"which the stories treat, “the long, drowsy, shimmering days"
"before the Gringo came,” to the California of which she writes."
"“Pointed, spirited, and Spanish” are these “rich and impressive”"
stories; “such as could hardly have been told in any other
country since the Bagdad of the ‘Thousand and One Nights.’ The
"book is full of weird fascination, and will add to Mrs."
"Atherton’s deservedly high reputation,” says _The Athenæum_."
“In this book even more than in her others is shown that
imaginative brilliancy so striking as to set one
wondering what is the secret of the effect. . . . For

chosen from the great bulk of his state papers and other letters
in such a way as to bring to the average reader the means of
estimating the personality of this remarkable man from his own
words. Incidentally it is the surest refutation of some of the
"hasty criticisms upon the picture of him in “The Conqueror,”"
"where, as Mr. Le Gallienne justly observes, “it was reserved for"
Mrs. Atherton to make him really alive to the present
generation.”

SYRIA.
The religions of Syria never had the same solidarity in the Occident as
those from Egypt or Asia Minor. From the coasts of Phoenicia and the
"valleys of Lebanon, from the borders of the Euphrates and the oases of the"
"desert, they came at various periods, like the successive waves of the"
"incoming tide, and existed side by side in the Roman world without uniting,"
in spite of their similarities. The isolation in which they remained and
the persistent adherence of their believers to their particular rites were
"a consequence and reflection of the disunited condition of Syria herself,"
where the different tribes and districts remained more distinct than
"anywhere else, even after they had been brought together under the"
domination of Rome. They doggedly preserved their local gods and Semitic
dialects.
It would be impossible to outline each one of these religions in detail at
"this time and to reconstruct their history, because our meager information"
"would not permit it, but we can indicate, in a general way, how they"
"penetrated into the Occidental countries at various periods, and we can try"
to define their common characteristics by showing what new elements the
Syrian paganism brought to the Romans.
"The first Semitic divinity to enter Italy was {104} _Atargatis_, frequently"
"mistaken for the Phoenician Astarte, who had a famous temple at Bambyce or"
"Hierapolis, not far from the Euphrates, and was worshiped with her husband,"
"earth for ages before this in lowly types, which, being destitute"
"of hard parts, would leave no record."
THE SILURIAN
The narrowing of the seas and the emergence of the lands which
characterized the closing epoch of the Ordovician in eastern North
America continue into the succeeding period of the Silurian. New
species appear and many old species now become extinct.
THE APPALACHIAN REGION. Where the Silurian system is most fully
"developed, from New York southward along the Appalachian"
"Mountains, it comprises four series:"
"4 Salina  . . . shales, impure limestones, gypsum, salt"
3 Niagara . . . chiefly limestones
"2 Clinton . . . sandstones, shales, with some limestones"
"1 Medina  . . . conglomerates, sandstones"
The rocks of these series are shallow-water deposits and reach the
total thickness of some five thousand feet. Evidently they were
"laid over an area which was on the whole gradually subsiding,"
although with various gentle oscillations which are recorded in
the different formations. The coarse sands of the heavy Medina
"formations record a period of uplift of the oldland of Appalachia,"
when erosion went on rapidly and coarse waste in abundance was
brought down from the hills by swift streams and spread by the
"waves in wide, sandy flats. As the lands were worn lower the waste"
"became finer, and during an epoch of transition--the Clinton--"
"there were deposited various formations of sandstones, shales, and"
limestones. The Niagara limestones testify to a long epoch of
"repose, when low-lying lands sent little waste down to the sea."
"form of line or mezzotint effects,[41] photogravure,[41] and the yet"
"more recent photo-intaglio process known as rotogravure,[41] and"
photo-mezzotint.
DIE CUTTING
"Dies,[41] generally required for stamping the covers of books in gilt"
"letters and designs, are cut in brass by hand or by finely adjusted"
"routing-machines, the design being drawn upon the metal by an artist,"
or transferred to it by photography. In the case of very elaborate
"designs, the dies are first etched by nitric acid or iron perchloride,"
"and the more open or less intricate spaces then deepened by hand, or by"
the routing-machines.
THE PAPER
"In selecting the paper for the book, the publisher must consider the"
"surface required by his plates, the weight necessary to give a proper"
"bulk in proportion to the size of his volume, and the quality as"
"regulated by the price. The average book, with no text illustrations,"
"is printed on wove[42] paper of antique finish, which is a fairly rough"
"surface, giving a maximum bulk. A 12mo[42] book should bulk 1 to 1⅛"
"inches, a 10mo[42] book, 1⅛ to 1¼ inches. If the book runs more than an"
"average length, a medium-or a plate-finish paper may be used, and the"
weight per ream is regulated by the number of pages in each volume and
the bulk required.
"Lineplates print satisfactorily on medium-finish paper, and even"
on antique-finish if the lines are not too fine. Halftones require
"English-finish,[42] super-calendered[42] or coated[42] paper."

The obstacles in the path of the fuller development of the national
resources of Panama have sprung wholly from the nature of its
"population. The Indian is, of course, not primarily an agriculturist,"
not a developer of the possibilities of the land he inhabits. The
Spanish infusion brought to the native population no qualities of
"energy, of well-directed effort, of the laborious determination to build"
up a new and thriving commonwealth. Spanish ideals run directly counter
"to those involved in empire building. Such energy, such determination as"
built up our great northwest and is building in British Columbia the
"greatest agricultural empire in the world, despite seven months annually"
"of drifting snow and frozen ground, would make of the Panama savannas"
and valleys the garden spot of the world. That will never be
"accomplished by the present agrarian population, but it is incredible"
that with population absorbing and overrunning the available
"agricultural lands of other zones, the tropics should long be left"
dormant in control of a lethargic and indolent people.

"existence only to further its Creator's purpose toward man, became"
incredible (by the light of the new thought). What seems to careless

manifestation. It came from them; we find them everywhere in that blest

"opening of the future.... The new society, the desire for equality"

Yet the records of his early life show that in his character there was
a strain of true sentiment and affection. In him Nature carved out a
"character of rock-like firmness, but she adorned it with flowers of"
human sympathy and tendrils of family love. At his first parting from
"his brother Joseph at Autun, when the elder brother was weeping"
"passionately, the little Napoleon dropped a tear: but that, said the"
"tutor, meant as much as the flood of tears from Joseph. Love of his"
relatives was a potent factor of his policy in later life; and slander
has never been able wholly to blacken the character of a man who loved
"and honoured his mother, who asserted that her advice had often been"
"of the highest service to him, and that her justice and firmness of"
spirit marked her out as a natural ruler of men. But when these
"admissions are freely granted, it still remains true that his"
character was naturally hard; that his sense of personal superiority
"made him, even as a child, exacting and domineering; and the sequel"
"was to show that even the strongest passion of his youth, his"
"determination to free Corsica from France, could be abjured if"
"occasion demanded, all the force of his nature being thenceforth"
concentrated on vaster adventures.

clamour against intellectual complications which are the inevitable
"endowment of these days. Life is necessarily intricate, subtle and"
"anxious, and Democracy has made of each man a ruler and governor in"
his degree. Is it possible to point to a single principle which shall
"be a motive and a standard of duty, which shall establish a synthetic"
method after the ruthless analysis of the later Victorian days?
How searching that analysis has been! Fifty years ago the man in the
"street might rarely read the Bible, but he had a tolerably assured"
"conviction that the Bible was infallible, however resolutely he might"
refuse its interpretation by an infallible church.
Then
“...the Essays and Reviews debate Begins to tell on the
"public mind, and Colenso’s views have weight.”"
Plain people were taught to look on the Old Testament as a library of
"Hebrew literature containing not only poetry and history, but romance."
"When Colenso’s book first appeared, Matthew Arnold deprecated its"
publication since it brought criticisms familiar to men of culture
"before the notice of the public, without considering how the beliefs"
of “the vulgar” might be upset.
"The supercilious apostle of “sweetness and light,” himself contributed"
"largely in later years to the general confusion in men’s minds, and"
the New Testament criticism has been introduced to the general public
by Mr. Arnold’s accomplished niece.
"Our friend, the man in the street, was all unprepared!"

In discussing dreams of flying I have referred to a dream in which a
slight disturbance of the heart's action was transformed by sleeping
consciousness into the image of an athlete manipulating an elastic ball.
"This objectivation of what are really the dreamer's subjective sensations,"
"although he is not conscious of them as subjective, is, indeed, a"
"phenomenon which we have encountered many times. It is, however, so"
"important a feature of dream psychology, and probably of such significant"
"weight in its influence on waking life, that it is worth while to deal"
with it separately.
"The dramatisation of subjective elements of the personality, which"
"contributes so largely to render our dreams vivid and interesting, rests"
"on that dissociation, or falling apart of the constituent groups of"
"psychic centres, which is so fundamental a fact of dream life. That is to"
"earlier. As a founder of a dynasty that overthrew a previous one, Azag-Bau"
"must have engaged in hostilities with other centres, so that the second"
interpretation that 'the king's country will be seized' may well refer to
"some historical event of the same general period. Be that as it may, the"
important point for us is that we have here another proof of the practical
purpose served by the observation of birth-omens.
IV
Passing now to some illustrations of birth-omens from the collections of
"the =bârû=-priests, let us first take up some texts dealing with omens"
"from the young of animals. Naturally, the animals to which attention was"
"directed were the domesticated ones--sheep, goats, cows, dogs, horses and"
"pigs. Among these the most prominent is the sheep, corresponding to the"
"significance attached to the sheep in liver divination where it is, in"
"fact, the only animal whose liver is read as a means of forecasting the"
future[33]. As a result of this particularly prominent position taken by
"the sheep in birth-omens, the word =isbu=, designating the normal or"
abnormal foetus--human or animal--when introduced without further
qualification generally indicates the foetus of a sheep[34].
"A text[35] dealing with a double foetus, i. e., of a sheep[36], reads in"
part as follows:
"'If it is a double foetus with slits (?) on the head and tail, the"
land will be secure.
"If it is a double foetus and enclosed[37], confusion in the country,"
The great vaults of the Abbey of Farfa resounded with glee and
merriment.
"Before a low, massive stone table, resembling a druidical altar,"
"surrounded by giant casks filled with the choicest wines of Italy,"
"Greece and Spain, there sat the Duke of Spoleto and the Abbot"
"Hilarius, discoursing largely upon the vanities of the world, and"
touching incidentally upon questions pertaining to the welfare of
Church and State. A single cresset shed an unsteady light over the
"twain, while a lean, cadaverous friar glided noiselessly in and out"
"the transepts, obsequiously replenishing the beverage as it"
disappeared with astounding swiftness in the feasters' capacious
"stomachs. And each time he replenished the vessels, he refilled his"
"own with grim impartiality, watching the Abbot and his guest from a"
low settle in a dark recess.
The vault was of singular construction and considerable extent. The
roof was of solid stone masonry and rose in a wide semicircular arch
"to the height of about twelve feet, measured from the centre of the"
ceiling to the ground floor.
"The transepts were divided by obtusely pointed arches, resting on"
"slender granite pillars, and the intervening space was filled up with"
drinking vessels of every conceivable shape and size.
"The Abbot of Farfa was a discriminating drinker, boasting of an"
"ancestral thirst of uncommonly high degree, the legacy of a Teutonic"
ancestor who had served the Church with much credit in his time.
They had been carousing since sunset.
with a view to checking internal hæmorrhage was used with good effect.
The wounds needed simple dressing only.
"The treatment of hæmothorax at a later date, however, was of much"
interest and difficulty. I think the following lines may be laid down
for guidance in such cases:--
"(i) Hæmothorax, even of considerable severity, will undergo spontaneous"
cure. An early rise of temperature may be disregarded.
(ii) Tapping the chest is indicated when pressure signs on the lung are
"sufficiently severe to cause serious symptoms, and the removal of the"
"blood undoubtedly shortens the period of recovery, as well as relieves"
symptoms.
In such cases the collection of blood has usually been rapid and
continuous; hence a fresh hæmorrhage is always probable when the local
pressure has been removed. Tapping therefore should not necessarily mean
"complete evacuation, and should be followed by careful firm binding up"
"of the chest, the administration of opium, and the most stringent"
precautions for rest.
"(iii) Tapping may be needed as a diagnostic aid, and in such"
circumstances as much fluid as can be removed should be evacuated with
the same precautions as mentioned in the last paragraph.
(iv) Tapping may be indicated for the evacuation of serum expressed from
"the blood-clot, or due to pleural effusion, on the same lines as in any"
other collection of fluid in the pleural cavity.
"(v) Early free incision is, as a rule, to be steadfastly avoided. Some"
cases already quoted fully illustrate its disadvantages.
PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS. These valuable illuminants and fuels
"are considered here because, although they are found in traces in"
"older strata, it is in the Ordovician that they occur for the"
first time in large quantities. They range throughout later
formations down to the most recent.
The oil horizons of California and Texas are Tertiary; those of
"Colorado, Cretaceous; those of West Virginia, Carboniferous; those"
"of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Canada, Devonian; and the large"
field of Ohio and Indiana belongs to the Ordovician and higher
systems.
"Petroleum and natural gas, wherever found, have probably"
originated from the decay of organic matter when buried in
"sedimentary deposits, just as at present in swampy places the"
hydrogen and carbon of decaying vegetation combine to form marsh
"gas. The light and heat of these hydrocarbons we may think of,"
"therefore, as a gift to the civilized life of our race from the"
"humble organisms, both animal and vegetable, of the remote past,"
whose remains were entombed in the sediments of the Ordovician and
later geological ages.
Petroleum is very widely disseminated throughout the stratified
"rocks. Certain limestones are visibly greasy with it, and others"
give off its characteristic fetid odor when struck with a hammer.
"Many shales are bituminous, and some are so highly charged that"
"small flakes may be lighted like tapers, and several gallons of"
oil to the ton may be obtained by distillation.
But oil and gas are found in paying quantities only when certain
conditions meet:
"with the head of a lamb[51], devastation will take place in the"
country.
"If an ewe gives birth to six, confusion among the population."
"If an ewe gives birth to seven,--three male and four female--, the"
king will perish.
"If an ewe gives birth to eight, approach of an usurper, the tribute"
of the king will be withheld.
"If an ewe gives birth to nine, end of the dynasty."
"If an ewe gives birth to ten, a weakling will acquire universal"
sovereignty[52].
The general similarity of the interpretations may be taken as a further
indication that the =bârû=-priests were simply giving their fancy free
scope in making prognostications for conditions that could never arise;
nor is it of serious moment that in the case of triplets the
"interpretation is favorable to the owner of the ewe, or that in the case"
"of ten lambs, even the official interpretation is not distinctly"
unfavorable--in view of the purely 'academic' character of such entries.
An extract from a long text[53] furnishing omens derived from all kinds of
peculiarities and abnormal phenomena noted on the ears of an
"animal--primarily again the sheep, though no doubt assumed to be"
applicable to other domesticated animals--will throw further light on the
"system of divination devised by the =bârû=-priests, and will also"
illustrate the extravagant fancy of the priests in their endeavor to make
their collections provide for all possible and indeed for many impossible
contingencies.
of their original structure and mineral composition remains to
tell whether the rocks from which they were derived were
"sedimentary or igneous, or to what variety of either of these"
classes they belonged.
"In many cases, however, the early history of a metamorphic rock"
can be deciphered. Fossils not wholly obliterated may prove it
"originally water-laid. Schists may contain rolled-out pebbles,"
showing their derivation from a conglomerate. Dikes of igneous
rocks may be followed into a region where they have been foliated
by pressure. The most thoroughly metamorphosed rocks may sometimes
"be traced out into unaltered sedimentary or igneous rocks, or"
among them may be found patches of little change where their
history maybe read.
Metamorphism is most common among rocks of the earlier geological
"ages, and most rare among rocks of recent formation. No doubt it"
is now in progress where deep-buried sediments are invaded
by heat either from intrusive igneous masses or from the earth's
"interior, or are suffering slow deformation under the thrust of"
mountain-making forces.
Suggest how rocks now in process of metamorphism may sometimes be
exposed to view. Why do metamorphic rocks appear on the surface
to-day?
MINERAL VEINS
In regions of folded and broken rocks fissures are frequently
found to be filled with sheets of crystalline minerals deposited
"from solution by underground water, and fissures thus filled are"
known as mineral veins. Much of the importance of mineral veins is
"faith, and only a comparatively small number of strong minds succeed"
in after years in freeing themselves by their own powers from these
"fetters, whilst the majority remain captive in the accustomed bonds and"
form their judgment in accordance with the celebrated saying of Bishop
"Berkeley: 'Few men think; but all will have opinions.'""--Buchner, ""Man"
"in the Past, Present, and Future."""
Appendix U.
"""And here it may be remarked, once for all, that no man who has"
"subscribed to creeds and formulas, whether in theology or philosophy,"
can be an unbiased investigator of the truth or an unprejudiced judge
of the opinions of others. His sworn preconceptions warping his
"discernment, adherence to his sect or party engenders intolerance to the"
"honest convictions of other inquirer? Beliefs we may and must have,"
but a belief to be changed with new and advancing knowledge impedes no
"progress, while a creed subscribed to as _ultimate truth, and sworn"
"to be defended_, not only puts a bar to further research, but as a"
consequence throws the odium of distrust on all that may seem to oppose
it.
"""Even when such odium cannot deter, it annoys and irritates; hence the"
frequent unwillingness of men of science to come prominently forward
with the avowal of their beliefs.
"""It is time this delicacy were thrown aside, and such theologians"
plainly told that the skepticism and Infidelity--if skepticism and
Infidelity there be--lies all on their own side.

"I'm not mad, Dean."
"I thought maybe, underneath your whole I-could-give-a-crap-bad-boy thing that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like, the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
You spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool but it's just an act.
"We both know that you're just a sad, lonely little kid."
"And I feel sorry for you, Dean."
"You feel sorry for me, huh?"
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know anything about me.
I save lives.
I'm a hero.
A hero.
What?
What?

I thought you'd like to keep this.
Why don't you keep it?
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
That's important.
That's important.
"Back to business, back to work."
"-Good-bye, Father."
-Good-bye.
Father Dyer do you go to films?

Another one.

-No.
"There's a story told in the town of Big Lake, Texas -- a story of the town's beginnings."
"It's the story of the Santa Rita Number One, birthplace of West Texas Oil."
"Now, as with most Texas legends, there was a man who thought oil was right beneath his feet."
"It's all right, mother."
I'm home now.
"Oh, yes, yes, I know, darling."
"No, I'm all right."
"Oh, my dear!"
"Hi, dads."
I'm here.
"Oh, son!"
That's a boy.
You all right?
"- Yeah, but I have to sleep."
Leave him alone.
"Oh, it's all right, Joe."
"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"
Let's get this coat off.
"You two must have had some experience, huh?"
Yes.
"Here are your pajamas, darling."
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?
"OK, everybody listen up,"
I'm gonna take the front and I want 2 cars out the back.
Come with me.

Hold the door.
He's gone upstairs.

Are you OK?
"I'm fine, get him!"
He's entering the building.

"Bomb them where they live. "" Yeah."

"(music stops, Anna breathing heavily)"
"Just when I think it's over between us,   he's back in my face."

"It's gotta be fun, for Christ's sake."

"It's gotta be fun, right?"
"It's gotta be fun, right?"
Fun's OK.

"If someone would've told me last year that you and I would be the two loneliest people in Newport, I wouldn't have believed '"
Well... at least not the you part.
-I'm pregnant.
-What?
-Previously on The O.C.:
-We're having a baby.
-Find something you care about.
-I could be a critic.
Spending your whole life watching terrible movies?
-Wanna rent An Inconvenient Truth?
-What'd you tell Frank?
"I told him that right now, I need to be spending some time with my daughter."
So let's put it all on the table.
"I love you, and I don't wanna lose you."
-Mom!
"-It's okay, it's just-"
- Just an earthquake!
Get in.
Kirsten!

"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, I got myself something there."
What?
A barrette.
"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME WORK.
"I APPRECIATE THAT,LUCY."
DON'T SAY I NEVER DID ANYTHING FOR YOU.
I NEVER WOULD.
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING BEFORE...
SHE WISHED
THAT THINGS HAD TURNED OUT...
DIFFERENTLY.
TELL ME ABOUT DOUG AND JASPER.
ON THEIR WAY TO A NEW LIFE IN AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK FOR TRIAL.
HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THAT.
AND I HAVE ANOTHER PRESENT FOR YOU.
IT'S YOUR NEW IDENTITY.
IT SHOULD GET YOU TO D.C. OR WHEREVER.
"THANK YOU,LUCY."
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO -
"- AND YOUR CAR,"
"WHATEVER IT COSTS TO REPAIR, I WANT TO REIMBURSE YOU."
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M NOT GONNA BE IN MIAMI THAT MUCH LONGER.
WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?
MAYBE.
LUCY.
SAM.
"SO,IS THAT YOUR NEW I.D.?"
YEP.
I COULD GET INTO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM

I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

Decent guy.
"Well, I guess forme italso, um, depends on... what I'm doin' to the music, Dick."
[Mutters] Yeah.
"So, uh, what's it like bein' so famous and all?"
Avice president!
"Well, it's, uh, not like that, Sandy."
"You see, the reason I got into politics in the first place was, well, uh, to do something forthe people."
"So, how are you two doing?"
"You know, Dick, there's more privacy in the back ofthe..."
"No, Trini, we're fine here."
Okay.
"Hell, Kennedy just pissed Cuba away to the Russians."
Just pissed it away.
I don't know.
I just thought.
"Well, you didn't think so good."
How do you know?
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Ok?
Really.
Ok.
You ready for sleep?
Good night.
"Good night, honey."
"Jukebox: ¶ lord, I was born a ramblin' man ¶"

She's alone.
I never should have left her.
"At least in New York, I'd be near."
I'd be close to her.
"I could see about a transfer, Damien."
"I need reassignment, tom."
I want out of this job.
It's wrong.
It's no good.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith-- their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"I think I've lost my faith, tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
Yes.
I'd like that very much.

- I could call.
Yes.
- Or I could give you my number.
"- If you've got one, I'd like that."
- Now you know I exist.
- Yes.
I've got a pencil and some paper.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I better go now.
Bye.
I'II be home very soon.
Do I have any brothers or sisters?
"- No, not really."
- What do you mean?
There's a little boy at the orphanage called Pramod.
- Pramod?
"- Pramod, yes."
I've taken care of him since he was a baby.
- How old is he now?
- He'll turn eight in precisely a week.
He's this big.
"He's tiny, but he want's to be a footballer."
"Maybe it's stupid, but I brought some pictures, if you'd like to see them."
"Yes, please."
Here I'm taking a bath.
"That's Lennart, my first boyfriend."
He had a moped.
- But he didn't want me.
"How are you, Dud?"
Pleasure.
This is Dan Mackintosh.
"Hi, Dan."
John McFeely.
"Oh, yeah, McFeely."
"All them ""Mac"" names sound alike to me."
"Had breakfast, Charlie?"
Yeah.
Charlie's a goddamn Yankee from Detroit.

"Well, I understand that."
"Well, you boys about ready?"
Just a second.
DALE:
"Here you go, Fern."
Keep the change.
"There ain't no change here, Hurricane."
It's a $12 check.
You give me a ten.
I'll catch you later.
Is he gone?
I haven't had a full meal since I met the son of a bitch.
"2-10, go ahead, Jimmy."
Go over to Harlan Childress'.
Lureen said he's raising hell.
I'm on a case.
Unless he's trying to kill her I don't have time.
She said he is.
"well, you can hear me, and I told you to hush up."
stella.
"Look, this is my house and I'II talk as much as I want to."

"Come on, will you?"
Let the girls have their music?

There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!
"-Didn't I name it, Mitch?"
-I wasn't listening.
What were you doing?
He was looking through the drapes.
-I was looking through no drapes.
-We're gonna play.
"We're gonna deal this hand again, play cards or quit."

"AII right, this game's gonna be Spit in the Ocean."
Yes?

Excuse me.
The little boy's room is occupied right now.
"Oh, excuse me."
-And I went up.
"-Son, we are penguins"
-We can not fly.
-But Sven is a penguin.
"I do not know what type of penguin Sven is, but penguins are"
"Emperor, we can not ..."
-If I learn to fly
Mom can get out of there.
I do not know if there is a way out.
"Erik, surely, is not flying."
If you want you must desire and if you want
-What is your wish!
"-Erik, get real."
They are trapped.
They are hungry and afraid.
The last thing we need is false hope.
-Boys?
-Then all will die.
"Boys, what's the problem with you two?"
It's just a conversation.
-Erik?
We need a mother's love.
It will explode.
"Dude, why will not catch a few more fish?"
"He is not hungry, Aunt Gloria."
"Yeah beauty, Atticus, I know, I understand."
I'm going fishing.
"Erik, stop with this anger."
"Calm down, Erik."
"Honey, take a step back."
Close your eyes ...
Take a deep breath ...
Honey?
This reminds me of the time in college when we drove to Fort lauderdale in my Austin HeaIy.
I haven`t thought about that for a Iong time.
Remember what we did in the car?
It`s amazing we didn`t get in an accident.
Want to relive a fond memory?
Are you serious?
No!
Why not?
"Because, that`s why."
The kids are asleep.
Let`s just wait `tiII we get to a motel.
"Okay, we`II wait."
I`II find the best one on the road.
Do you want to put your head in my lap?
That`s not what I was thinking.
The wheel.
"There you go, out of your way."
Comfy?
clark?
My head`s stuck.
Quit kidding around!
It hurts!
It`s stuck.
Cut it out!
"I know what you`re trying to do, and I think it`s sick!"
The wheeI`s stuck!
That was a dirty trick!
The damn wheel is all screwed up.
You`re tired.
You get weird when you get tired.
Let`s just find a motel.
It's the box step.
LAUGHTER
And the third one is my own personal favourite - the knee bounce.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
The reason they use these moves is because they work for any show tune at all.
What was that?
"Luck Be A Lady, a bit of Guys And Dolls."
# Luck be a lady tonight
# Luck be a lady tonight

# Luck be a lady tonight... # APPLAUSE

What's that?
Christmas.
Here we go.
"# Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way"

What's that?
-I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.
"Look, I'm gonna race next week."
Alright?
"I'm gonna win for you and dad, whole town's gonna see it."
Okay.
"-I need you to be there, okay?"
You gotta tell Pam.
Wes?
[Ring]
Let me go.
"Hey mom's still at her bridge club, you wanna come in for a cold one."
(Hollis) I gotta get back.
"Everything's gonna work out just fine, man."
What 'you worried about.

Put some clothes on.
You scaring the kids.

"Well, come on, get in."
[Roaring engines].
"(Speaker) ""If you're just pulling in at the front gate you can tune in at 87.5 on your fm radio""."

Of course he's cool.
I don't know how you're not nervous.
I'm freaking out.
Will you shut the fuck up?
You shouldn't even be here.
I'm Kent.
I spoke with you on the phone.
- How's it going?
- Good good.
huh?
- Yeah.
Every high roller in the county must be here.
- It is quite the event.
- Your boy ready?
He's always ready.
I was thinking--
Kent.
Let's get this thing started.
All right.
Let's do it.
We need to get the bets in.
Bullshit.
I'll cover anybody lays off on Victor.
let's have a good show.
Fight.
♪ Feel better about yourself ♪
♪ I didn't care to know your name ♪
♪ But you made it a point to try to dump mine ♪
♪ And then the words slip ♪
♪ Try my best to find a way ♪
♪ To will this bullshit past aside... ♪ you got nothing!
I think we both know it didn't go as well as we'd have liked.
But I've heard from your previous employer and she speaks of you in glowing terms.
"So, I've decided to offer you the job."
Yes!
Yes!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Bang!
Yes!
I got you the job!
I got you the job!
"Oh, I got a job!"
Oh!
That is brilliant.
I'm gonna take you for a walk on the seafront.
"- Cos, boy, do I know how to celebrate!"
- Yeah.
- We got a job.
- Yeah.
- Ajob!
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Oh!
"- Get out of here, you."
Oh!
You're dressed already.
What a shame.
- I'm not sure about this.
"- Oh, that was Number Two's."
He was a smallish gentleman.
That's why he only lasted such a short time.
But I think it's a close enough fit.
"Yeah, well, I usually go for a more relaxed vibe."
"Oh, but the great and the good are gathering."
"No, really, I'm fine."
Fine?
You must be exhausted.
"Multitasking, multi-flirting."
"No, I'm used to it."
"I think jealousy uses much more energy, negative energy."
Are you feeling okay?
"Oh yeah, I'm good."
I'm going over to Ricky's tonight.
"Okay, everyone out!"
"(SIGHS) Thanks, Adrian, see you around."
See you later.
Text me.
"So, let me guess."
You're going over to Ricky's to meet Amy?
"Yeah, she says she wants to meet me."
She wants to be friends.
"You know her, right?"
"Yeah, I know her."
And I kind of doubt she wants to be friends with you.
She's not going to like you.
She's probably setting you up.
It is a setup.
They're introducing me to someone.
Who?
"I don't know, but, uh, should be fun."
Could I have some more coffee?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I just ran out.
I'll have to make you some new coffee.
Hi.
Hi yourself.
I'll put you up after Cassie.
"Arnie, listen, man, I had a sales call in Bakersfield and it went long, okay?"
"I--and I have to go get the groceries, you understand?"
I have to sit down and have dinner with my wife and kid.
I've gotta plan out this goddamn christening!
"What am I, Dear Abby now?"
1:45.
"You can be a fucking dickhead, you know that, Arnie?"
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Nick.
- [Nick] Hey.
"- Hey, hey, hey."
- How are ya?
- Good.
- How are you?
"- Yeah, good--good to see you."
Good.
This must be Tawny.

- Yes.
"My wife, Olivia."
Hi.
So nice to meet you.
"Last time I was invited to a house this nice, it had a grotto, so."
[laughter]
"Holy guacamole, I-I love marble."
- Yeah.
- [Tawny] Yeah.
"[laughs] Oh, my God, so cute!"
Can we have them for dinner?
'Cause I could just eat them up.
"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.
DC Review.
- You watch that?
Come quickly.
Would you like soup kitchen?
It's not him.
It's alright though.
"He don't like strangers, see."
Don't like a lotta things.
But you took his boat without asking.
Weren't you scared?
One of the soldier's had this kit bag and suddenly it woofed!
It gave us such a fright.
It was a dog.
And one of them Frenches tried to kiss her.
I'm scared now of what your dad might do.
No!
He got himself a bottle.
He thought we'll be back before he woke up.
"Besides, Eric was in Dunkirk."
Eric?
Dad's first-mate.
Got us photographs for our birthday.
Yeah.
He got same birthday.
"Robert Donat in ""The 39 Steps""... and John Clements in ""The Four Feathers""."
Have you ever met John Clements?
No.
I haven't.
Those ones are mum's.
We don't know who he is.
Oh!
I did meet him.
Is there going to be a film?
Probably not.
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
"I've looked everywhere, Max."
Where could she be?
"Well, look at what the catfish dragged in."
[Laughs] Look at ya.
Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it.
"It's your hairdo, right?"
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No?
"No, huh?"
"Well, let me see."
New seashells?

And you were in the bathroom because?
Because?
I had to go to the bathroom--
Which one?

A hunch.

Then what are we going to do?
I don't know?
I don't know?
"You know if you put your gun away, it will help you bury your cousin."
Italian
"wow, wow."
What did you call me?
"All right, all right."
Enough.
Enough.
What did you call me?
"Dino, dino."
"Dino let him up, dino!"
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to kill him?
Shut up Vic.
"Yes, I'm trying to kill him."
I will kill him.
God damn it.
"Rudy just give the man what he wants, huh?"
Did I hear you say you were sorry?
Tell him?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Jesus Christ.
"Did I hear you say you're sorry, huh?"
I'm sorry.
More and more of the Germans.
Watch out for that Jerry!
I'm going to have to take a chance.
"Your pistol, Sergeant Major."
Thank God for the Navy.
Get down to the boats.
Come on there.
Hurry upl
"Come on at the double, get a move on!"
"Sergeant Box and his party, hurry, hurry!"
Get a move on!
"Don't play around in the bloody sand, you bloody fools!"
"All the other boats are loaded, Sir."
"All right, all away."
Take it away.
I thought you weren't going to make it.
So did I. We met a German destroyer outside the port.
"Here you are, boys."
Ta.
Thanks.
"Well, what was it like?"
"I don't know, very foggy."
The Germans?
"Oh, I couldn't understand a word they said."
Here.
Corporal Dawes?
"Yes, he's behind the screen."
"He's still under a sedative, so please don't stay too long."
Thank you.
"Hello, Corporal."
Who is it?
"Blimey, it's the Yank."
Tommy!
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.
Can you believe that?
This little Guinea bastard.
He's getting made.
We'll work for this guy one day.
He's gonna be a boss.
I can't believe it.
I'm really happy for you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
"Motherfuckers, we got them now."
"Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you, baby."
"Jimmy, can I talk to you for a second?"
"I mastermind the Goddamned thing, I'm left with dick."
They'd be up a creek without a paddle if not for me.
Fuck him!
I want my money.
"Henry, I want my fuckin' money!"
I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacking Mick.
"-No, fuck him!"
I want my money!
-Good.
Go tell him.
"Are you gonna keep your mouth shut, or what?"
Huh?
"Morrie, you're gonna get your money."
You just got to stop busting balls.
Look at me.
You hear me?
"I mean, are you sure?"
Yeah.
"Um, Dave said he came in this morning and didn't give any notice."
Just walked out the door.
"Oh, it's the lawyer calling me back."
One sec.
Hello?
"Yes, this is Samantha."
Hey.
There you go.
"Sorry, we're closing."
I know.
"But, Dave, look, I heard that Kai quit, and I really need to talk to him."
"So, do you have his phone number?"
"He doesn't want me giving that to anyone, especially you."
Dave!
"Look, please."
"Something is going on with him, and..."
"Kai, he loves this job."
Apparently not.
He didn't even give me two weeks notice.
Did he tell you that he's quitting his band?
What?
!
Last thing he said before he walked out.
I don't know what's happening to him.
"Please, please,"
"Dave, I really need to talk to him."
This is his address.
He's not answering his phone.
You didn't get this from me.
Uh-huh?
0h?
"I thought perhaps you had seen me in Paris, being French."
"The theatre requires time, and for me time is often a luxury."
"Have you ever been to Paris, Mr Bernard?"
I was born there.
0h.
- What business are you in?
- l buy... and sell.
- What?
- Whatever gives the best profit.
"Now that you're in Marrakech, what are you buying and selling?"
"You know, I would much rather talk about the stage."
If you tell me what shows you are in   (Knocking On Door)
- Would you excuse me?
I'll get it.
"- No, I'll get it."
"- No, I will."
(Speaking French) I'm inquiring for the room of Mr Montgomery.
"He asked me for a drink, and I - l'm sorry."
There's no Montgomery here.
"Pardon me, monsieur."
I regret disturbing you.
(McKenna) OK.
"- May I use your telephone, please?"
- Sure.
- Mommy!
- Yes?
- I can't cut this meat.
- l'll do it for you.
(Speaking French)
Merci.
Allô?
(CHUCKLES)
"He thought it would inspire the guys to try a little bit harder but the other team's coach saw it, protested, and had him kicked off the team and they lost without him."
"So, maybe his name is not on a plaque."
"(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Oh, excuse me,"
"I have friends dropping over, too."
"Hi, Amy."
Hi.
"Hey, come on in."
Sorry we're late.
We wanted to stop and get some dessert.
"Oh, hi."
I'm Grace.
I'm...
Clementine.
Yeah.
This is Jack.
And we're Christians.
Oh.
Interesting.
Clementine is at the same college that Ricky and Jack go to.
"Hi, Clementine."
Hi.
I should be going.
"Oh, no, please stay."
Ricky's just getting John down to bed.
I really should be going.
Thank you so much for inviting me over and letting me meet you and John.
Ricky loves you both so much.
But the meatballs...
I have work tomorrow.
"Hey, it was nice meeting you, uh..."
It's Grace.
It's OK.
I am still worried about you.
More than ever.
"Sorry, mom is calling."
"Mom, I'm in Istanbul..."
it's been six months.
I don't know.
"Mom, I'll try to."
"Sure, I am doing fine."
Coffee?
What coffee?
"Oh, I see dad wants some coffee."
"Mom, I have to go now."
Clients...
Bye mom.
"Watch out, God damn it!"
How many have you broken so far.
Enough with your morning tempers.
"Get away from me, you asshole!"
"Auntie, what do you find in that animal?"
That's exactly what I like in him:
The animal in my bed.
Take down those pictures.
I'm sure they drive him crazy.
"Well, he hates me anyway."
He can fuck off...
I'll kick him out soon.
Is this forthe rent?
It's been 9 months and I still don't have a job...
Cavit still asks about you...
"Oh, he is disgusting!"
I wish our motel was still open.

"Wait, you didn't tell them?"
"The Bears were playing, okay?"
It never seemed to be a good time.
There was a game last night?
"It's called Monday Night Football, Mackie."
"It's been around for, like, 40 years."
I'm going to tell them!
When?
It's already been a week.
I know.
I will.
Sunday dinner.
That's another five days.
- It will be fine.
"- No, it won't."
Waiting is only gonna make this worse.
"Trust me, nothing could possibly make this any worse."
Very nice.
"There was a rock, okay, Mackie?"
"Sir, you really don't have to help me."
- Abby?
- Danny!
"Oh, my gosh."
"What's it been, like, three years?"
I see you're still tripping over things that don't exist.
"- Oh, there was a rock."
"- No, there wasn't."
Ah.
The little girl must be her.
Her?
Her.
[ Sam ] She's dead.
"Melvin, you should've been a detective instead of a mortician."
[ Man ] It was the saddest thing-- finding her purse... sittin' on top of a neatly folded coat out there at the end of the dock.
Hmm.
She drowned herself?
I found this shoe floating' under the dock.
Guess the other one sunk to the bottom.
Melvin?
"What is it, Melvin?"
Hmm?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
It's not like you've never seen this sort of thing before.
It's just that she's so young.
"Well, don't you remember?"
"What, two summers ago?"
The little boy who got hit by the speedboat.
Hmm?
Whew.
I'll never forget what he looked like.
Yeah.
"That was, uh-- [ Clears Throat ]"
That was horrible.
"You know, Melvin, I think this job's startin'to get to you."

Why do you keep trying to make us have a baby?

I don't know.
I don't know why I'm doing any of this.
Who is it?
Is everything okay?
Richard told me you had diarrhea.
"Oh, God."
Should I put it on the board?
Get out.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I don't have... that.
What happened?
Why did you leave?
I don't know.
I just freaked out.
I had to come home and get it straight.
I charted what our family tree would look like.
- Looks confusing.
- Confusing?

"Connect the dots, you get a map of freakin' Alabama!"
Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?
"No, I'm not."
- Who's Emma?
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.

Keeping me waiting or lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.

I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
"A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am."

An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it.

"Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged."

Thought you might know the right man.
"Uh, well, Gibbs is right-  we should get going."
Yeah.
"- Yeah, we should."
6:30 flight out of Dulles.
Tony should be into Dulles about now.
DiNozzo-- that's who's missing.
His father's flying in from London.
Maybe you'll see him there.
Or maybe not.
Airport's gonna be nuts.
"Actually, I'm thinking the snow might thin the crowds a little."
"All right, well, we'll see you guys."
Nice meeting you.
Your attention please--
Do not leave any baggage unattended...
Are you sure I was okay?
You heard Abby-- you were adorable.
"But that Gibbs-- I was babbling away about Turkey, and he's just looking at me with that look."
The Gibbs look.
Hello?
Did you think I was making it up?
You were great.
Really.
You okay?
You seem on edge lately.
The flight?
"No, no."
I'm good flying.
Okay.
"Just, um, I don't know, the holidays, I guess."
I'm fine.
Okay.
Bye.
Hello?
I'm Max.
"Excuse me, I thought you were Cristina."
I got the wrong number.
Sorry.
Fermín?
I'm Max.
"Hey, don't you remember Cristina's number by any chance?"
What do you mean Cristina who?
"Well, some years went by but... you know Cristina."
"Yes, of course, that Cristina!"
All of a sudden I thought I could remember her number.
Yes that's right.
It's possible that she doesn't live there anymore.
"But, I don't know."
Nothing in particular.
I just... wanted to know how she was.
"Well, I'll find her anyways."
Thanks a lot Fermín.
Bye.
Can you put Father Urlieta on the phone please?
Thank you.

You taught me religion for 4 years!
Of course it was a lot time ago... 30...
More than 30 years ago I think.
Then her shoes disappear in the light of the lamp.
"It blinds me, so I close my eyes"

Get up and do your exercises.
Yes.

She only drinks.

"My Gonki, my Gonki."
"It went by fast, huh?"
What am I talking about?
It's over.
I have to put it behind me.
"It's easy for us to say, but for you?"
It's over.
Where's Ora?
Having some tests done.
She couldn't cancel them.
She didn't tell me about any tests.
She said the swelling went down a few weeks ago.
Hello.
"Hello, Daddy."
- Hello.
That's what they all say.
Wood:
"Adam was given a $20 tip, bringing his total for the evening to 60 bucks."
"Gentlemen, you guys have a good night."
"And even though I laid on the charm with the ladies, they only gave me $10, making my tip total for the night $30, which meant Adam beat me at my own game."
- Thanks for getting us home safe.
- I hope you find a nice chubby fella.

"No, two weeks is the perfect amount of time."
It's not enough time.
That's more than enough time.
"Yeah, so much time."
Oh my God.
We can do a lot in two weeks.
Plenty of time.

- Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...?
-All her religious crap...?
- No.
You know what?
"Owen, listen put your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her... she's not here..."
"All right. please have her call me when she gets back, alright...?"
Well.
Dad!
"Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?"
You mother just... she has problems... and I'm gonna talk to her.
"So I don't want to hear any more about this, alright?"
alright?
...Yeah...
"You have a good night, pal."
I love you.
"And I'm sorry about the last couple months, but I'll see you real soon, okay?"
- I promise!
Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...
I love you!
Can I come in...?
...You have to say it You can... come in..
Are you a vampire...?
I... need blood.
To live.
- How old are you?
Really.
- twelve...
But...
I been twelve for a very long time...
-Come in.
"-Thank you, my dear."
-You're going to break your eardrums.
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.
"You're young, I'm old and sick."
What we'll do in the next few months will make history.
It's never been done before.
Not even your father would dream that such a thing could be possible.
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?
He's small potatoes.
What's up?
We got company?
What's going on?
Michael Corleone is here.
Where is he?
He's in your den.
You better hurry.
He's been waiting a half hour.
Is something wrong?
I wish you would have let me know you were coming.
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died.
We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
"You know, I can honestly say that you are the only grandfather"
I have ever wanted to be with.
- Oh!
Hello.
- Daddy's girl.
I'm going to bring Ritchie his pancakes.
Okay.
I'm going to get us some coffee.
I'll be right over there.
"- Hi, Christine."
- Hi.
You having a nice Grandparents' Day?
"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am."
You seem to have a very close family.
"Yes, you certainly seem to be daddy's best girl."
W hat?
Oh.
Ew!
"Oh, no."
That's not my father.
"No, no, no."
That's New Christine's father.
Why were you kissing him?
"Um, because I'm, um..."
I'm sort of dating him.
You're dating your ex-husband's girlfriend's father?
Yeah.
That's right.
"Well, you know, Christine, if we don't tell you enough, we are so happy you're at this school."
That's nice.
Ugh!
"I got so distracted by those meanie moms,"
"Look, you got to trust me, okay?"
Everything's going to be just fine.
"Hi, there."
I'm Judy.
Who are you?
Becca.
You're the lady on TV.
"Stay here, Becca."
We'll be right back.
I brought your phone back.
You haven't played the message on TV yet.
I will.
I made a copy.
"Mrs. Jerome, I have to ask you one more time."
Where did your daughter go when she disappeared 12 years ago?
I already told you.
I don't know.
This may be important.
I'll tell you what's important.
Everyone believes Jeffrey's a victim in this.
I need them to hear my daughter.
"Look, I've called the hotline, like, five times."
Why the hell hasn't anyone called me back?
!
You know what?
Forget it.
Don't bother.
"Hey, you seen Nicky?"
She'll show up.
Don't worry.
"Come on, Peter, we gotta go."
Are you in or are you out?
Please don't make a scene.
Where's the restroom?
"Yes, I called him."
When?
Why?
Because.
Want something to eat?
The cafeteria's closed.
He's sleeping.
"It went well, but took a long time."
"We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right."
"Good thing he came in, it was almost too late."
There's a problem with his papers.
- If you don't mind...
- I'll take care of it.
"We almost killed him, and for what?"
My battery's run out.
I need to make a call.
I need to talk to Raziya.
This whole costume is for her sake.
All because I love her.
What's the sense in hiding all this from her?
You know what she calls Him?
Daddy.
"She calls God ""Daddy"" and me she calls ""Honey""."
Do you need help?
No.
What's your name?
Dorona.
- And your brothers?
"- Natanel, and the little one is Shai."
- There's another one.
- We're down one.
- Just for a minute.
- I risk getting hurt.
- Don't make us beg.
That was a penalty.
It was!
I'II kick it.
"Run, a bombing!"
Who else?
The MiIanese!
could you take my window for a minute?
This has to be sent back.
hello.
Do you know my grandson Peppe?
"I have to send him this, it's a sweaterI made."
"I want it to get there fast, how long will it take?"
- Two orthree days.
- Two orthree?
"And if it rains, what will the dearthing wear?"
.
should he freeze to death?
Two orthree days?
But it's just a small package.
Your grandson Peppe?
- You're talking about Peppe?
- Do you know him?
"Peppe said, I quote:"
"""If my grandma comes, tell her she can't make sweaters,"""
"""she's gotta do fried dough, 'cause she does 'em great."""
"But he doesn't like sweaters, make him a dessert."
"Making sweaters isn't foryou, Peppe said so."
- Make scarves.
"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
Of course not.
"I just thought you were working, that's all."
I took off.
For this?
Yeah.
Didn't your father ever teach you how to tie a tie?
"No, he didn't."
You know...
I didn't mean to make you do anything
You didn't want to do.
I'm chillin' yo.
"Oh shit, my dude..."
That's a nigga right there.
"No gas, no gas!"
Oh!
You just gonna stand there?
You're not gonna say anything?
"Yo, what you want me to say, yo?"
It ain't like they lying.
"You know, you're fucked up."
Yo.
"Yo, you ain't my girl."
"You need to chill the fuck out, a'ight?"
"Oh, so I'm good enough for you to fuck"
"And for me to suck your dick,"
But I'm not your girl?
"Well, then fuck you..."
fuck you!
"Yo, you good?"
"I'm good, yo."
"Wait, Chris."
And he's one of your best friends.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you pursue him?
I always liked him.
I'm just not good at pursuing a guy.
"HALLIE, I'm sorry if I made you feel..."
jealous.
"I mean, I never, never meant to."
I never even knew I did.
"I guess I just feel the way you felt with J.P., you know?"
Yeah.
I understand that.
The next morning as soon as she woke up
Jill took a cab straight home to face the music.
Not knowing if that music...
would be a wedding march.
Drew.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I really do love you.
"Me, too."
Smell my hair.
Does it still smell like cigarettes?
No.
It smells like Jill.
Ugh.
Wow.
Look at this.
"Party at our place, and it's only 9am."
"Last night, she was wearing the ugliest pair of cotton granny panties"
I've ever seen in my entire life.
Listen in on his conversation.
He said it was a friendly dinner.
No way.
Not a chance.
"Tell them, Bobbi."
"- Let""s not jump to any conclusions."
- What?
Do you have a picture of the receptionist?
"No, but she has blonde hair, like Clara."
"Like Mom""s."
"Yeah, well, she""s thinner than me... and she""s prettier."
Is this your daughter?
"She""s so pretty."
Yeah.
"That""s my oldest daughter, Cassie."
"She""s getting married."
A wedding.
You must be so excited.
Yeah.
We are.
We really are.
"Now, how long has this scumbag been sneaking around?"
"We""ve known about it for a couple of weeks."
"Clara can""t sleep, she can""t eat."
"L""m worried about you, Mom."
"We""ll get even for y""all."
"Won""t we, Bobbi?"
"We""ll nail that lying, cheating bastard to the wall."
"We""ll rake him over the coals."
"And when we""re done with David Harris... he""ll wish he never stepped foot outside your bedroom door."
"- Do you love him, Clara?"
"- What""s love got to do with anything?"
LookI know he's not dead.
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.
No.
Agent Lee.
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a DNA search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca Kemp.I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... you miss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why, do you miss me?"
"Uh, sure."
Boss...
Agent Lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At Finn, us, the world."
"Go back with her to her apartment, get Finn's stuff."
"And, no, I don't want to wait for a search warrant."
- I'll grab my coat .Wait at the elevator.
- Okay.
"Hey, you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah, you."
Did you and Jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am Jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
He used you.
I know that what he did was wrong.
It was stupid and I was angry at him.
But you were his best friend.
You should've helped him.
You were a little girl then.
I'm a big girl now.
I gave him a chance and he blew it.
You liar.
He's the one who gave you a chance.
He made you thrive on stage and gave you the best parts.
He took you places you thought you'd never reach.
"He let you dance and sing, the best thing you ever did."
I loved your father and mother very much.
How can you even talk about love?
"Relax, it'll be easier if you relax."
My love.
We'll try again.
Help me.
- Okay.
Gently.
- Okay.
"Okay, never mind."
I can't.
"Never mind, my love."
I'll get some bandages.
"Tell me the truth, Daddy."
"What, Gonki?"
About Mommy.
Tell me about Mommy.
"Say it, Daddy."
Mommy is dead.
Say it again.
"Clara, please."
"L""ll do anything."
"Clara, look at me."
Do you hear that?
That rattle?
Will you take it in?
I can take it in this weekend.
Fine.
"L""ll have dinner ready in an hour."
Spaghetti.
- The casserole is in the oven.
"- Let""s brown it."
"Do you want a picture of him, Bobbi?"
"Let""s just sneak on up here and get a little peek at him."
Get your camera ready.
"That""s him?"
"Danny Caine, Mr. Hidden Agenda?"
"That""s Pam Caine""s husband?"
That guy hired us six months ago.
"We""re in it now, so we might as well go for it."
"L""m going to nail this deadbeat."
"Baby, thanks for letting me come home."
Clara told us everything.
"So when Clara called, your mother and I knew what we had to do."
You are our son.
Clara is our daughter.
"- We""ll get through this together."
"- It""s over with that woman."
"- Of course it""s over."
"- Isn""t it, David?"
"You married a beauty queen, David."
Miss Colombia Houston.
"Fi, we need to get the biggest armed response we can get at that place."
How big?
Very big.
Jabbar's guys are armed to the teeth
And aren't gonna go down without a fight.
I think I have an idea.
Remember that burner phone we gave your mom?
Hello?
"Mom, I don't have a lot of time."
"I need you to say, in a loud, clear voice,"
"""1212 Bayshore Avenue."
"Yes, Michael, I can be there."""
Are you sure?
I don't know if anybody's told you --
I know Riley bugged the house.
It's what I'm counting on.
I need to get the CIA to show up someplace fast.
Can you do that for me?
"Yes, Michael."
1212 Bayshore Avenue.
I can be there.
"Thanks, Mom."
I'll be in touch when I can.
M-Michael --
"We lost his pulse, Sam!"
What?
I can't find a pulse!
"There's nothing, man."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do it!
Do it!
♪ That my heart's like a big balloon ♪
"♪ And, like a love light in your eyes ♪"
♪ They can't black out the moon. ♪
What's the matter Mrs.James?
You better get some good rest tonight.
It's these the hard shifts.
"I had some bad news this morning, Miss."
My Jim's missing.
Oh!
Try not to worry.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Oh!
"I do hope so, Miss."
I expect I'll feel better when I have cuppa tea.
That's right.
It's finishing time now.
A million bullets for dispatch by the morning!
?
But I tell you the girls have done 10 hours today already.
Yes.
I hear myself urgently.
But you expect these girls to run 14 hours on stretch.
Alright!
I'll ask them.
She doesn't have to ask us.
A million bullets by the morning!
Alright!
"Come on girls, it's gotta be done!"
Stop!
Stop there.
Stop right there.
"Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton."
I
"- I suppose I was a little difficult, but..."
"- well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't-"
"- Yes, I know."
I'm sorry I was so rough.
"Well, I"
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm.
I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No.
My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up here.
We've known all along.
"I mean, old man Blake's claim."
But how?
How could you possibly know?
"Give me that map, Shorty."
Yeah.
Did you ever see this?
"Or, uh, something like it?"
Yes.
"Yes, I've seen the original."
This won't do you any good.
It isn't correct.
I know it.
That's why I was going to suggest that-
Say it.
Let's go.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Even though-
Even though- We're scared.
We're scared.
'Cause it's life- It's life.
And it's happening.
"It's really, really happening... right now."
All right.
"Now let's kiss to make it real, okay?"
Okay.
"So, how is your art project?"
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No.
That's not how it works.
"You know, they have to know about your work-"
"I would just march in there and show it to them, you know?"
No one is going to live your life for you.
Okay.
"That's not how itworks, but okay."
"So, how's Ellen?"
"Oh, she's wonderful."
I can't sleep at night thinking about her.
I just wish I had met her 50 years sooner.
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed... 70 years of life... to be ready for a woman like Ellen.
This rug is dirty.
Everyone get a box on the way out.
Ow.
Ow.
"Okay, I will search for her."
I will also go to look around again.
I'm leaving first.
It's still my official duties.
Go there and look around.
Miss Kim Mi Jin!
"Oh, you are..."
You okay?
Wait a minute.
I'm with the Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces.
Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju.
I'm not a pervert.
Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces?
Is it true?
There has been too many impostors recently.
It's true.
But this time what are you working as?
This dress...
Not working anymore.
"I'm currently working as a country official, I'm afraid I can't say more."
A country official?
Can it be you're a police woman?
That is also a secret.
I'm in a hurry to find someone.
I'm sorry.
That...
"The woman who was with you the last time you interfered,"
Where did you take her?
Da Hye!
Do you know how to contact her?
Da Hye!
Da Hye!
That was seven years ago.
I know.
"I'm trying, darling."
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
"Kay, are you all right?"
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
"Yeah, come in."
"-Mike, are you all right?"
-Yeah.
"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom."
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
"Well, he's got a good heart."
"But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death."
"Tom, you're my brother."
"I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey."
A real brother.
- This is 7 Mary 3.
U.C. Medical says the baby should have its stomach pumped immediately.
Imperative.
Antitoxin must be administered.
- We have to get him to a hospital.
- Don't worry.
We will.
Send an ambulance to Malibu end of the canyon.
We'll meet them there.
- 10-4.
- Carry or lead?
I'll carry.
"Come on, Henry."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
You'll go with big Jon.
"Hang on, Henry."
"Hey, screw you, cop."
Get over there.
Easy.
"Easy, Henry."
Come on.
Here.
Take it easy.
Attaboy.
"Hey, his name is Henry."
"He's still in recovery, but the doctor says he's gonna be okay."
What about the baby food?
It's all accounted for. 15-8's got it.
"You put in a good day, fellows."
There is one other thing.
I hate to bring it up but you'll have to cut down on the personal calls at the office.
But we weren't even there to make any calls.
- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Richard!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought your car was over here.
It is.
It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.
Doesn't that break the rules of the thing?
This can be like the afterlife.
"You know, like we're angels or something?"
Cute.
What are you doing in my car?
"No, I don't know you, and you certainly don't know anything about me."
"I mean, what if I'm a killer of children?"
Yeah.
"Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?"
"See, you're acting like I'm just this regular man."
Like a man in a book who thewoman in the book meets.
I'm not doing that.
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?
"-Well, I'm sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.
-You should be.
Good.
Terrific.
Canyou get out of my car now?
Okay.
Okay.
You heard Rhodes.
He's got his hands full.
"Besides, we're running out of time as it is."
"Now, now."
Where's--?
Where's my journal?
D-d-don't...
"Don't, uh-- Don't touch... anything."
"What do you mean, we're running out of time?"
That's right.
"In fact, we've only got two days to find the treasure."
I can't even find my journal.
Why only two days?
Ah!
Ha.
Success.
"Professor, why only two days?"
Because that is when the first line of Solon's riddle comes true.
"I copied it, uh--"
"Uh, from an altar I found in--"
In the caves at Exeter.
Where is it?
Hm.
There we are.
There you are.
"""When the gods march in rank."""
What does it mean?
"Well, you saw the carvings on the Ark."
"Now, as you know--"
"I mean, when the Romans adopted the Greek gods, they gave them new names."
"Now, let's see, uh,"
Hermes became Mercury.
James:
That's me.
"Hi, I'm Agnes lenbert."
I work for social services.
Who's she?
Her name is kalaya nirapattanassai.
She's a thai national.
"Hello, kalaya."
My name is James.
She doesn't speak much English.
Can we speak in private?
Why is she here?
She was arrested at the airport yesterday with 2 adult thai nationals who were smuggling heroin.
She was posing as the drug smugglers' daughter.
Where there any drugs found on her?
"No, she was just there to make it look like a family vacation."
To Pittsburgh.
Heh!
Not exactly a thai dream.
No wonder they got caught.
Where's she staying?
At a locked shelter for juvenile offenders.
But I don't understand why you're here.
I think she wants asylum.
[Slowly] Do you speak any English?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
Do you want to stay with Uncle Joe?
Does Uncle Joe live here?
Does Uncle Joe know you're coming?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
Yeah.
You seemed bored.
-I tried to be seductive.
-Other guys can see it.
One guy under a bridge.
He wasn't interested.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-Nothing's wrong.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-I said answer it!
Answer it and turn it off.
It bothers me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Yeah.
-Hey I'm at yoga place.
It's not at this time usually.
"Yeah, the trainer came home late last night."
Maybe she was drunk her ass off.
She loves drinking.
You don't have to hang up.
She isn't here yet.
Are you busy?
I guess I'll have to hang up then.
I got vaccine for German Measles.
They say I don't have the antibodies.
Doctor says that we have to use condoms for a month to 3 months at least.
It takes about that long for the antibodies to generate.
You have to do them.
I can't take pills.
-Hyang Gi.
Be a fucking 'nother Toxie.
TRENT HAAGA:
"All right, no problem."
"And In fact, I want that other guy."
I want you to get-- hey.
"Rhonda, Rhonda."
"We're gonna sign that other guy, and we're gonna pay him."
So we can't do the first 12 feet?
"No, Lloyd won't do it."
He's fucking pissed at me.
He's pissed at everybody.
He's totally psycho.
This is a super long shot over the tops
Of the heads of crowds.
We got fog and--
I was gonna carry them both up.
Yeah.
Wasn't that good?
That was excellent.
You know what I mean?
I agree.
But--
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"OK, let's do it?"
Can we just--
Unbelievable.
All right?
And it looks like shit.
It's gonna look like shit.
I can't get through that little flag there.
But this guy can.
"He's a half inch taller than Tito, for christ sake."
Until when are you going to be like this?
We're not rich enough to take care of a shut-in!
"Since you graduated already, start helping out with the store already!"
Yeah.
Souta-kun.
I love Bonheur's chocolates the most in the whole world.
"Oh, onii-chan woke up."
(T/N: onii-chan means older brother)
"What, at this hour?"
- I'm going to Paris for a bit.
See you~!
Paris?
"He said Paris, right?"
He said Paris.
- He did.
Bonjour.
I come from Japan.
I would like to work in L'atelier de Bonheur.
"As expected, was it too suspicious?"
Eh?
- Hi.
Eh?
- You came from Japan?
I'm begging you!
I want to work here!
Huh?
What are you saying?
That's impossible.
"I admit that it's unreasonable, but - after coming all the way here, I can't just go back."
"Ah, if you want, I can talk directly to the mana-"
Wait!
"This is weekly shounen monday, special extra-large spring edition!"
Then you should fight.
With everything you have.
- What do you want?
- I want you to stop being so afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- I'm want us to stop being so careful.
- I'm just-
- I wanna marry you!
What?
I wish the sun would rise already.
This graveyard shift's going forever.
You okay?
"I love you too, Carter, but it's over."
I'm gonna ask her tonight.
You're going to propose?
"Actually, I already did, but badly."
- She said no?
- She didn't say anything.
But this time I'm gonna do it right.
That is a nice rock.
That was my great-grandmother's.
Great-grandfather gave it to her the day he left for the Army.
I don't think she'll mind that it's secondhand.
Hey.
You guys want something from Magoo's?
My treat.
"- No, thanks."
"- No, I'm all right."
"- Hey, Luka."
- Hey.
You dispo Mr. Lindsey?
- They took him up to Cards.
Don't you believe me?
You want me to show you?
What are you looking at?
Don't you know me?
I'm Mousy!
I'm a fighter!
You're filthy!
And you have a bad attitude!
"You see good people, and you bully them!"
"You see bad people, and you fear them!"
My big sister's no coward!
"If we don't get the money, we'll come after you!"
"Mousy, who are you shouting at?"
- Him.
- Who's he?
He's me and I'm him.
Useless bum!
Where's the money you collected today?
I collected more laundry.
- Here.
- More business as well.
Your shirt looks dirty.
Take it off for a wash.
It's OK to be dirty.
- Take it off!
- No need!
Where's the money?
Where's the money you collected today?
Ah Fook's house has a fierce dog.
Ah Sao says he's got no money.
Big Mouth shouted at me.
I didn't collect any money.
- Valentine's day?
That's in two weeks.
"Give me the sandwich, Will."
Hold my beer.
I need to talk like an old Italian lady.
What are you talking about?
Is there something you're not telling me?

It's just a pity you have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(CHAINS RATTLING)
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Hatter.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
"I'm frightened, Alice."
I don't like it in here.

Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
RED QUEEN:
Hat man!
Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.
The rabbit will help you.
"Find it, Alice."
Take it to the White Queen.
We'll go to the White Queen together.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?
How you know?
Change the tags.

The hotel staff is here.
"Its big job Papa, yeah it is."
Go tease the girl who is standing being me.
Who me?
"Yeah who elss, go tease her."
"She will shout, help... help... i will come and beat you, hotel's staff will gather here."
At the same time they will change the tags.
No one has ever tease a girl in my whole family.
"You are saying i tease her, i don't even know it."
"There is not much to do, go near her and say."
Coming?

Ma am.
Ma'am?

Right or left behind you?
Left one.
You left or mine?
Your left.
There are two girls in my left.
The pink one.
"There are two with pink, light pink or dark pink."
Laxmi Narayan do one thing.

"Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum, he's Tweedledee."
DODO:
You'd think she would remember all this from the first time.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"It wasn't a dream at all, it was a memory."
"This place is real, and so are you and so is the Hatter."
And the Jabberwocky.
"Remember, the Vorpal sword knows what it wants."
All you have to do is hold on to it.
"Fairfarren, Alice."
Perhaps I will see you in another life.

There you go.
A star is born.
No.

I'm sorry.
(Jo) Not in the least.
"Dr McKenna, do you -"
"Why don't all of you sort of turn around here, or something."
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.

"Hey, kids, look."
I don't understand this.
- Man!
"- Wow, what a family."
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...
- ...somehow.
"- Uh, that's a possibility."
You know what this means?
They never saw the wreck.
I'll tell them that the reports were exaggerated.
"And, if you kids will go back to school,"
I'm sure they won't fire me.
"No, it's a lovely day."

I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in Ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth!
We have no reason to lie.

"- No, sir, not the lucky one."
Wait a minute.
I'll get a smoke.
"I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?"
Thank you.
"Mandy, I really like you."
That's for making me fall for you.
"Aw, they're in love."
"Ah, my face!"
We got our very own chocolate fountain!
Some of it just went down my underwear.
I like it.
This is the best weekend of my life.
It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate.
"Rudy, what?"
"Ugh, stop eating it, then."
"Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it?"
"Yeah, what happens when you eat it?"
"I don't know, I've never eaten it."
I don't know what...
Rudy!

Just kidding.
"Damn it, Rudy."
It's not that bad.

"Yeah, ditto."
Oh.

Uh... yum.
"Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least?"
I did.
"Wait, who told you it was my birthday?"
You are gonna have so many guys calling you.
Can I have your leftovers?
"Molly, men aren't Chinese food."
You can't just heat them up the next day.
I'll take 'em cold.
"Hello, Alex."
"Oh, hi."
You came to see me...
Mr. Larson.
What brings you here?
"Uh, a peace offering for your dad."
"I know he's ticked off 'cause I screwed up his real estate deal, so I brought you all some of our tavern's famous corned beef sandwiches."
Mm.
Yummy.
That's very considerate of you.
"Can I see you in my office, please?"
Should I come in and take notes?
- No.
- Please?
Can I come in and...
"Right, get back to my own work, that's what I'll do."
You look great.

It's a quark.
A subatomic particle.
How's your thing going?
You were gonna show it to David.
The police are investigating bars near the Nam Mountain area.
What's that?
I'm going to eat it after I raise it.
You should've picked a tastier one.
What the hell is she?
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?
"Mister, big problem!"
Your daughter's face came out like this.
Catch him!
You bitch!
It's me.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
I got him!
Excuse me.
Please let me live.
"You know we're foxes now, so we can't let you live."
Foxes?
"Dad, why'd you go on and tell him?"
You've got such a big mouth.
Shut up.
"He's going to die anyway, so who cares if he knows."
Wait.
Can't we let him live until that day?
"I know you're a bit reluctant, but if we let him live it could spell trouble later."
"Sorry, I know it's a waste."
Where should we start chopping?

Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?

I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.

Come in.
Hedley here.
"Come in, Paula."
Where are you?
"Well, I'm at the north waterhole, but no astro-chimp."
Where's Dad?
He's out in the bush looking for tracks.
"You know, the trouble with chimps is they're very tricky, and it's almost impossible to track them."
"But if anyone can find a missing chimp,"
I'd place my money on Marsh.
I'm afraid Daktari hasn't had any luck either.
- How are you doing?
"- Well, not too well."
"And you know, I guess it takes a chimp to find a chimp."
Judy's out in the bush scouting around.
"Over and out, Hedley."
"Oh, Clarence, I hope Judy can find Sally."

This is the last dispatch from Havas news agency:
"""The findings made on the trunk of the Munich-Paris train led to the discovery of a fingerprint left by Jacques Dollon, the man wanted for the murder of the Baroness de Vibray and the theft from the Princess Danidoff."""
This is madness!
I'm going crazy!
Not now!
"I need sensational stuff, so sort it out yourself."
Go!
"Hello, Fandor."
Good morning.
She was in her room.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- How are you?
- Better.
I find it peaceful here.
I got your message.
What's wrong?
"Ah, yes."
I read your article on the princess Danidoff.
I 'm sure now:
Her name was on the list with the date of April 12.
"Sorry to bother you, but someone is asking for Miss Elizabeth on the phone."
Anyone know you are here?
"No, just you."
I can accompany you?
"Yeah, sure."
Hello?
Elizabeth Dollon?
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
Maybe we could find out who it is.
Check and see if somebody died around here.
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
-Guess which ones.
-No.
"Ahem, there was one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
[SIGHING] I knew him.
How'd he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
-That's where--
-Where the chick got swirlied to death.
"So, what, this ghost is possessing nerds?"
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.

"Thanks, Sam."
Great school.
I don't care.
Three years and I'm out of here.
Going to Michigan State.
They got the best vet program in the country.
What are we going to do with everyone ?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
And what about looters ?
We just have to get organized.
"Also, keep the radio on and gather up anything you think might be useful... flashlights, blankets, water, batteries, you'll be fine."
I can't get through to either of the boys.
"Well, keep trying."
How about you ?
We should get you to the hospital.
"I'm fine, it's just a bump on the head."
Mine.
Not his or hers.
Hello.
"Ryan, where are you ?"
They're at the Cooper house with Taylor.
Tell him to stay there.
Okay.
"Just stay there, okay."
All right.
Seth ?
"Hey, Dad."
"Yeah, yeah, we're okay."
I wish I could say the same for Ryan's car though.
How's Mom ?
Mm-hmm.
And Ryan ?
Ryan and Taylor are at your house.
"Yeah, sounds good, we'll do that."
"All right, take care."
Found a flashlight.
I can see that.
I'm not gonna answer it.
What?
What?
I don't have the money.
What do you want me to do?
"Ok, you tell your mom, she gives you the money, you're out of debt."
Then you enroll in a public school.
You make it-- you make it sound just so easy.
It's--it's not--
I will give you until tonight to tell your mom.
"Nick, please, man."
I will get the money.
Ok?
That's--that's not a problem.
"I'll get it from this guy who owes me anyway, and I can pay him back with that and she'll never know."
Ok?
[Cell phone rings]
Uh...
Please don't make me sorry that I told you this.

"Oh, wait... it is chocolate."
How's she doing?
"Couple more hours, and she should be out of the woods."
Mel...
I don't think you should come to Dallas.
I said I was scared.
I didn't say I didn't want to go.
"I know, but..."
You're getting cold feet.
- No my feet are fine...
- Liar.
I think you're going for the wrong reason.
Is this your thing?
Thrill of the chase and then lose interest?
I'm the bad boyfriend you want to make happy.

- And you don't even know it.
- I'm going to Dallas.

"What is it, snookums?"
I can't make heads or tails of this stuff.
"Franz, how about we get away from this place?"
Why?
I've got money I can lend you.
Why?
Things are fine here.
You sent all the guys off.
Now we're short tonight.
We've got a first-class replacement.
Who?
I see.
Mr. Peep Peep.
A most respectable man... who'll soon be chirping a different tune.
Let's move out to the suburbs.
Come in.
"Miss Cilly, there's a man here to see you."
I just look at tax forms and I'm lost.

He wants Franz to stop by.
Well?

"Yeah, space, totally."
I know.
"- Hey, do you know where Ryan is?"

He's kind of a dork now.

- So that's it?
No second thoughts?
You're not going to change your mind?

It's me who you need to forgive
For doing all those things to you.
And then after that we can go swing and go to the park.
Ma'am?
"No, thanks."
You sure you don't need something?
"I need 100 bucks, or I'm going to get smacked."
You got that?
"Yes, I do."
You can have it.
You saved my life.
What are you doing with all that money?
We wanted to see a naked lady.
"Oh, God."
You know what?
"Why don't you take that money and go home, before you get hurt, okay?"
"I-I wish I could, but... it means a lot to my friends, and we just want a look."
How much looking?
As much as money can buy.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Okay, pull your shirts up over your heads."
You first.
"Show me yours, and I'll show you mine."

"I do, so much."
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..
You know what?
You have to go for it.
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
"Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?"
Let me know how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're having a baby and you need to prepare.
You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing.
Just do it!
I came to the big city to become a star.
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?
Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father.
"No, no."
Can't get pregnant that way.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
"If we ever have a daughter, we should do her hair like that."
"- Oh, like Jeannie's?"
- Yes.
"No, no."
You got to be born in a lamp.
"No, it's adorable!"
"I could do it one day, and then you could do it the next day."
- But no hat.
- I love the hat!
"Hel, that hat looks like it's for a monkey who should be clanging a symbol."
Austin.
Okay.
How does the other guy look?
"Oh, no."
You're not gonna be one of those exes that shows up when he's drunk?
Even though we're not exes.
Even though we only did it once.
They're gone.
What?
Who's gone?
My kids.
I lost custody of my kids.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.

And took a soldering iron...

Five hundred apiece...
"What do ya say, huh?"
"Hey, man, sounds good."
"They look all right, I'll take 'em."
"Hey, you got pictures?"
"You really are a sick motherfucker, you know that?"
"Hey man, what's wrong with you?"
Just takin' care of business.
"You know, it's kinda funny."
- Does your mom know?
"- No, but..."
- ...it's for a couple of nights.
- A couple of nights?
- Are you crazy?
- This is stunning.

Your dad came in like he wanted to chop me off at the knees.
And I'm telling you that's not my dad.
I recognize him from the picture of everybody on the glacier.
- I'm serious.
- So am I. I act like I'm not in love with his daughter.
He's acting like he wants to challenge me to a duel over your mother.
- I don't understand.
- I do.
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.
He hates me or he's crazy.
"No, he does not hate you."
He couldn't.
Then he's crazy.

"Oh, hey, Ella."

"Hold his leg, not mine hold his leg."
"First I'll get down, I'll help Papa."
"I'll give my hand to Papa, Should I give you my hand?"
"OKs, OKs,"
"First you people give me the hand, give me your hand, Which one?"
Left or Right?
"Anyone, otherwise I couldn't climb up."
"You come from right, and you come from left."
"Sir, sorry Sir!"
You will murder D'Melo's Yadav's
"Sir that Laxminarayan is someone else, I'll chop you in pieces."
Why you'll chop my pieces?
You're behind me.
You're eating my Supari.
"Sir, I don't eat anything."
"Can't you see, No, I can't."
"You hit me, Yes, I did it."
So.
"If he won't with me, then I'll chop your pieces."
Who?

Where he's gone?
Hey!

"- Fergus, my lad."
"- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy."
We're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair.
Did you see?
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"That's all right, sweetie."
Mama didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.

You don't think that someone's inside?
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
"Oh, wow."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."

"Almeida's going to be interrogating Nina, and I'll follow it from a feed."
"Okay, good."

A boyfriend even though she wouldn't be stealing.
Her boyfriend 'cause my boyfriend is her boyfriend.
Which brings me right back to... what?
"You're dating Miley, not Hannah."
Got it.

I saw them.
Wilbur.
What?
"When you were on the train, did you spend the whole night in Nancy's drawing room?"
Aunt Nancy's drawing room.
"Yet, you guys are going to ship him off to a group home?"
Am I the only one who gets how much that sucks?
It's okay.
Really.
Good luck with it.
It looks perfect.
Good night.
Good night.
Got a little...
Playstation.
Perhaps... are you running away?
"Go back in the house, Seth."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You can't just run away.
What are you thinking?
"What about, like, Child Services, or my dad?"
"Okay, then, wait."
"Hey, I want to come with you."
"You know what I've always wanted to do, besides sail to Tahiti."
I want to do that whole Kerouac thing...
"Hit the road, stop at diner to diner, the pancake tour of North America."
No.
Fair enough.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
"New town, get a job somewhere, save some money."
Great plan.
Sounds like you've given it a lot of thought.
You got a better idea?
"Actually, I do."
Seth...
Hey... can I talk to you?
"No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you."
"Monica, come on."
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork is gonna bring mine.
"Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone."
She's right.
Of course not.
"Honey, get the tape."
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
"Oh, sure."
But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Oh, my."
"Come on, come on."
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's beautiful.
-It's horrible!
"-I know, I know!"
I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do?
I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys!
"You guys, look!"
-What?
Did her ass explode?
"No, the baby's out."
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
Oh.
"So, who's first?"
Uh...
[Chuckles]
Um... tell you what.
"Uh, why don't you let me tie you up first?"
Then how am I gonna be able to do all the terrible things that I've got planned for you?
"[Laughs] Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out."
"[Chuckling] Isn't that right, Kendall?"
Kendall...
Kendall?
Damn it.
She's gonna miss all the fun.
[Grunts]
You've been had.
That dirty little...
[Chuckles]
I'm getting tired of chasing you.
"Well, there's no rule against taking a short break."
[Laughs]
[Alarm blaring]
What the hell?
"Hey, where's your friend?"
Huh?
Castle:
Thought we had a deal.
No more double-crosses.
"Sorry, Ricky, but I am going to be the one to take those trophies in."
Castle:
"Well, good luck with that, because I'm looking for a murder weapon."
"It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that."
- You're lying.
"McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing."
- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...
Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.
I hope Lightning's OK.
I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.
"I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!"
Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?
"Oh, boy."
Where am I?
"- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!"
- Ah!
"Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up."
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?
- What's going on here?
Please!
- You're funny.
I like you already.
My name's Mater.
Mater?
"Yeah, like ""tuh-mater,"" but without the ""tuh""."
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?
Uh...
"No, I know your name."
Is your name Mater too?
What?
It's OK.
I was too drunk to worry about it.
But really.
What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy?
I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan.
"- So, what's up?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
"Well, let me think."
Just screw the brain out of me.
"So, you really moved my stuff?"
(cell phone rings)
"Yeah, two hours or something."
I just need to move this piano.
"See you, honey."
Yeah?
Yes...
"Yeah, OK."
- What are you doing?
"- Hey, OK..."
- You're sick.
Sick!
"- Hey, sorry, OK?"
(slow jazz)
"I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I..."
I just thought...
Can I come in?
"No, this is a bad idea."
I really feel bad.
"You were so good to me, and I just didn't..."
"I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me..."
"Anna, please don't!"
I don't blame you for not daring.
Okay.
Okay.
Stop laughing!
Bella?
"Okay,okay,okay."
Holy cow.
Okay.
"God,be careful!"
What was the plan here?
"You know,to show Augie that he's an idiot."
"I figured he'd see some hair,come on to me, and then,you know..."
I take advice from you?
Hey.
Good morning.
Did I wake you?
No.
"No,I..."
I thought you were gone.
I was gonna make you some breakfast.
Come back to bed.
Come here.
Are you okay?
I'm in bed with the girl of my dreams.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm so glad we talked yesterday.
"I was really overwhelmed and ready to bolt, and you were just so cool and understanding."
I don't want to make the same mistakes I made last time.
You know...
"I think that I am going to have to write,like, a couple million songs about you."
"Oh,yeah?"
Is that okay?
"Or do you need me to,like,taper back?"
"And, you know, I didn't - we didn't have our parents already."
"So, it meant my being alone."
"And if my sister wanted to go out, she went... and I was left alone... at home."
"You know, it was a - It wasn't a good situation."
- When did Max die?
- Nine days ago.
- Pardon?
- Nine days ago.
What was wrong with him?
"He fell, and we don't know what's wrong with him, what happened yet."
- But he died.
- Yes.
My best friend.
[Woman] Claire?
- Are you leaving?
- Okay.
The nurse is here.
L-l-I just want her to have a look at you.
"She's just, um -"
- She's not doing very well.
- Do you have any pain?
- Pardon?
- Do you have any pain?
"What do you mean, ""Do I have anything?"""
Pain.
Do you have any pain?
Pain?
[Chuckles]
"Yes, I have pain from what I heard... about Max."
- Do you have headache or something?
- Max
"- Max is gone, is he?"
Pancakes.
Pancakes.
Don't be afraid.
It's just me.
"Summer, you're such a good mother."
Thanks.
"When I think of the lengths that you're going to to save your adopted rabbit son, and my own mother can't even pick up the phone and send me a text message saying, ""Hi."
"Are you alive ?"""
That's okay... you have us now.
"Seth and I rode on a bicycle just so we could be here together, and Julie and Kaitlin left a message and the Cohens asked about you."
"Yeah, I know... you're right."
"You know, if there's one thing"
"I've learned over the years, it's you make your own family."
It seems to me that you've scraped together quite an awesome one.
Wait.
What ?
You hear that ?
Where ?
In the vent.
It's Pancakes.
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
Here.
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
"Um, stay there, Pancakes."
Let's pry this open.
Okay.
Pancakes ?
There he is !
Come on !
Good boy !
How's she doing?
We couldn't revive her.
She's...
"I know she looked bad, but you guys usually..."
Stephanie's injuries were overwhelming.
We did everything we could.
"He'll be OK, it's, um, just rough."
I'm sorry.
"- OK, Doc, time's up."
- Stay away from me.
"- Come on, get up."
- I'm not finished treating.
... She died!
An officer's dead and we need to interview.
"Just back up, right now."
Throw some bandages on him.
This piece of crap needs to get charged!
Come on!
"Come on, get up!"
"Come on, get up!"
"OK, OK!"
We gotta get him to division before his lawyer gets here.
"- OK, calm down."
- I am calm!
"Call the divisional detective, tell her what happened"
"- so she can call homicide, OK?"
- What about Pike?
Dr. Connor isn't going to let him walk out of here.
"- Are you, Dr. Connor?"
"- No, I'm not."
Stephanie was 34 years old.
What a waste.
Just put her in the oven!
"OK, a little privacy?"
Take a hike.
"Oh, oui."
"Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!"
You're like a cookie angel.
Wow!
"And you're hot, too!"
Hello?
I guess it didn't work.
Gingy.
Is it you?
The one I was made for?
We'll be together forever.
Sweet!
"Are you happy, Gingy?"
You bet!
The time since I met you has been the best...
seven and a half minutes of my life.
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
"I'm going to love you and hold you, and feed you and dress you and cling to you and hang onto you and smother you with my love."
- Yeah.
- Forever and ever and ever and ever...
"You know, it's getting a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I'm gonna go get some air."
"- Oh, no, you don't."
"- Oh, no!"
Not without your umbrella.
Come on!
"Here, let me get that."
Wait for me.
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."
For all of us.
WOMAN:
Mr and Mrs Clayton?
OK?
WOMAN:
Mr Clayton?
There's someone to see you.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
Is she OK?
Yes.
How did you know?
How long have you been following me?
Awhile.
I haven't got much time to explain.
- It's not safe for me here.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else, and he knows you have it, Harry."
- You're talking about the bracelet?
"- I know you're a good man, which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you."
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
"You're already starting to feel it, though, aren't you?"
No.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"Hi, Christo."
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.
Let her rest.
She OK?
Just OK.
Still after that van gang?
Still am.
I hear they hit again.
"Near the beltway, right?"
My only advice is:
"when you bust 'em, shoot first!"
You know anything?
I'm not a snitch.
Ask your questions elsewhere.
Who worked over Manou?
What do you mean?
Leo...
"I'm 46, I spent 1 8 years in jail."
She's the best thing that happened to me.
"Someone hurt her, I gotta know."
"If I tell you, what'll you do?"
That's up to me.
You're in trouble any time you step out of here!
"You're a hood, Christo."
With a record for armed robbery.
"If you smack your neighbor over a trifle, you go back to jail!"
Manou needs you:
"if you go down, so does she."
Screw your cop morality.
"Anyway, it's settled."
I dealt with it.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
That means... we pretend that we've done nothing for two weeks.
"Put him on, I want to talk to him... I want to talk to him..."
At least give him my message.
I simply can't do that.
No.
Why do they want the material?
"No, answer me."
Why do they want the material?
We don't want to use it as a pillow.
"Yes... ln any case, that's impossible."
Yes... lt sounds as if we're guilty!
I'll contact him myself.
I'll call...
Good-bye.
"Hello, are you well?"
"- Yes, thank you."
- What do you want?
Can I have a word with Farzad?
Sohrabi?
Yes.
He's sitting an exam.
I know. lt won't take a minute.
Please call him for me.
Sohrabi!
You're wanted.
Are you well?
Yes.
Are you sitting an exam?
Yes.
is there a question that you can't answer?
"No, I know them all."
I want to apologise about this morning.
- I'm just making conversation.
No one else in this house likes me.
At least I can talk to you.
- Especially if you need someone to talk to.
JENNA:
"Oh, please, I'm eating."
"So seriously, how well do you know Anna?"
I know Anna extremely well.
Uh-huh.
"Well, know that you can talk to me about anything."
I'm here to answer any questions that you have to help you in any way I can.
Why?
Because your dad would want me to.
"I'm, uh..."
I'm good.
"Uh-oh, Cherie."
You won again.
Hope I'm wearing my good underwear.
Tonight's just one blast from the past after another.
"- No, no, no."
DAMON:
Mm.
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
DAMON:
Mm.
"It's good to see you, Isobel."
Just having fun with your naughty little minion.
ISOBEL:
Mm.
How'd you find me?
I searched all the bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
"Oh, I should have known."
"It's dirty, there's something in the..."
- Jerry.
- What?
What are you doing?
Being forced to work quickly.
"- Normally, I'd be much more charming."
- Take it back!
"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, in my life,"
- not giving that to you.
- Don't... don't...
- Don't do this.
- The situation calls for a grand gesture.
That's all I got.
"I love you, Mel."
"And not being with you, it hurts."
Every day.
"- And it's my fault, I blew it."
- Stop.
"You're right, I should stop."
Jerry this...
- ... isn't going to work.
- It could.
It did.
And then it didn't.
Keep it.
I don't want to throw it away.
OK.
"So, like, hmm, I am..."
"I'm, well..."
"My boyfriend, Luke, hi Luke, he.. he said that he... he wants me to do this, and he told me he doesn't think that I will."
"I, Stacey Ragota, hereby accept the cinnamon challenge."
OK.
- We talked for an hour.
- Oh.
Oh.
Ah!
You've no memory of this.
- He was really drunk.
- Oh God.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
- Meredith was right about you
- No.
"- About me, about the whole thing."
- No.
Meredith was not right.
"It doesn't matter that I don't remember the specifics of what I said, because I was drunk when I said them and, you know..."
- In Vino Veritas.
- In Vino Veritas
"I mean, we know Vino Veritas is Latin for a reason."
It's just that you said some really beautiful things.
- You did.
- That's when I cried.
"I meant those things that I said, every word."
"Yeah, ok."
"Alright, we should get going."
You need to get your stuff.
It's like an hour to Sudbury or something.
You're gonna drive us?
- You asked me to.
- You asked her to.
Right.
Right.
"Hey, can we stop at a mall or something?"
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the new janitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousy job.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What if there's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
I brought you the best seafood.
It was the Mano-there he is.
Hi.
He asked me.
-It is my language.
I'm sorry.
If direction is not the feeling satisfied.
Can I get more.
"No Sven, I bet you have others more hungry than me."
I understand.
See you at dinner?
I'm kinda busy.
Kinda busy.
Even more!
She is beautiful.
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he no relation to Ramon?
You Ingracia!
"Should not scoff at someone, just because it's different."
Even someone who is having more a lot of work to save us.
-You are right.
When Sven- teach them all to fly.
It will be a rising up.
"-Erik, not ..."
-Get out of here.
-You will see.
Who dropped the fish?
"Guys, what's happening with the fish?"
Fish friends what's the problem?
The birds eat.
"Sven, you must fly on the wings of hope and ask them to help brothers emperors."
I'd love to know but ...
So far you haven't shown me a thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right into next week."
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off.
"Cut it out, will ya, for Christ's sakes!"
There's nothin' goin' down.
Get some sleep.
Blastoff. 180.
200.
Good Housekeeping seal of approval.
210.
US government certified.
220.
Lunar trajectory.
Junk-of-the-month club.
Sirloin steak.
230.
Grade-A poison.
Absolute dynamite.
89 per cent pure junk.
Best I've ever seen.
"Ifthe rest is like this, you'll be dealin' on this load for two years."
- It's worth the half million?
- How many kilos?
- 60.
- 60 kilos...
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuffll take a seven-to-one hit on the street.
"By the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
Take what's left there with you and good night.
Uh-uh.
"Most of all, friends."
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
A man's life is not the bricks.
It's the mortar.
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
-He's a good man.
-But this is tough stuff.
This is body-bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I gotta go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface...
... justasIknew when that bullet hit that boy...
... itwouldkeeptraveling.
And find its way... ?
"Oh, they're a bunch of fucking liars."
The president is a liar.
I think there may be a problem.
Only problem is you motherfucker think I can't hear you!
"Hi, Mr. Freeman."
Unh!
Hey!
"Damn it, watch where you're going, bitch!"
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
Shit I ought to whup your big ass!
Now get the fuck out of my way!
"- Slow down, granddad!"
"- Granddad, watch out for that curb!"
Ow!
I can't find my seat belt!
"Whoa, hey, granddad, I think we should talk about your eyesight and whether it's safe to drive."
I've been driving my whole life!
I don't need to know how to see to drive!
Shut up!
"Now, what the fuck is this?"
!
I hate when people do that.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I fucking Hate it!
That was supposed to be our space!
You know what?
You know what?
!
Fuck That!
"That's our space, God damn it!"
No le dejen mover.
Take off your clothes.
She's clean.
"Viktor Karp, I'm Regan."
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.
ETU.
I'm out.
That's why I'm here.
What happened here?
I had a baby.
The humans took it.
Why you want to see Liana?
I'm her daughter.
Liana doesn't have a daughter.
You're at home.
So I see.
I had you brought here.
We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't.
"Flynn, you got a drug problem."
No.
- No.
I got an alien problem.
"- Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team."
Team?
Right.
"'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss?"
You're using me.
You're using Regan.
God knows what you got on Briggs.
You are privy to information that is beyond classified.
"And if I don't come back and play, you're gonna contain me?"
If I have to.
"Finally, a letter from Naples!"
"Vito, how do you like my little angel?"
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
"To you, she's beautiful."
"For me, there's only my wife and son."
Our dear mother - ...is dead!
We'll go backstage later and take her to eat.
"Sit down, you bum!"
"Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci."
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter!
Let her go!
"Here, take all my money!"
"Vito, come on."
I know what you're thinking.
But you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
"Even my father, in the grocery store."
If he's Italian why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody to protect them.
Forget that.
Did you like my angel?
"And tell Mrs. Manicotti that I'll stop up there later, okay?"
All right.
Should I take the rest of the dog food along?
No.
I won't have to feed him till tomorrow morning
-when I get him back.
"-Oh, I see."
Okay.
"- Don't drop him now, Trix."
"-No, I won't."
"- Oh, he's a good fella."
Bye.
-Thank you.
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-All right, bye-bye."
(clears throat)
"Hiya, sweetheart."
"Hiya, Ralph."
I'll have your supper ready for you in a minute.
"Oh, don't go to any trouble."
I'm not gonna eat here.
I'll eat over at the lodge.
I got just enough time to wash up and get over there.
We got another emergency meeting.
Again?
!
"Ralph, you had an emergency meeting last night."
-So?
-So?
Do you realize you Racoons have more emergency meetings than the U.N.?
Just so happens that the Racoons have more emergencies than the U.N.
(Alice sighs)
Which one?
"No, no, no, no."
You were in your best suit.
Was I?
"Oh, yes, of course!"
"I went to the theater, of course!"
"- No, no..."
"- Yes, yes, with Winnie Atwell, yes."
Winnie Atwell?
"Well, Marjorie Atwell then, Marjorie."
I always call her Winnie because...
"well, because she looks like Winnie."
She's not black.
Black?
Churchill wasn't black.
"Look, look, look,"
I gave you £75.
You put it in there.
What do you mean by telling me you called the police?
You've done no such thing.
Your wife's just told me you're still searching the rooms.
"Well, I thought she'd called them."
You lying hound!
- Mrs. Richards...
"- Go and call them now, immediately."
"Mrs. Richards, we will, the moment we've searched..."
Right.
I shall call them myself then.
Couldn't we just wait until...
I've never seen such a place!
"All right, Mrs. Richards."
Would you like to use the office phone?
I'll say.
Ka-chow.
You're gonna fit right in in California.
My goodness.
It looks like you've helped everybody in town.
"Yeah, everybody except one."
"- Hey, is it getting dark out?"
- What?
What'd he say?
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?
"Now, what was I supposed to do after that?"
They fixed their neon!
- Low and slow?
"- Oh, yeah, baby!"
"Just like in its heyday, right?"
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.
Shall we cruise?
"Oh, thank you, dear."
I'd love to!
"- No, no, no."
- Lizzie!
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
"Hey, Miss Sally."
May I have this cruise?
"- Of course, Mater."
- Uh-uh-uh!
"...and again and I said, ""No. "" He asked me again, and I said, ""No. """
"But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder."
"Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive. """
Oh!
"Hey, man."
"It's all good, right?"
"Look, you get a little money in your pocket."
Nothing wrong with that.
"Just for now, right?"
Plus it's always good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent.
"Hey, what do you say you and me head down to the rec center?"
Got a pick-up rugby game going on.
"Then afterwards, maybe go get me some ribs, some corn."
Some hot chicks.
Maybe she got a friend for you.
But one of them ugly ones.
"Buck-toothed and, you know, just got the fangs."
"Got the fangs happening, huh?"
Know what?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Just give me a couple minutes to change and then we'll head on out.
"Oh, dinner's on you tonight."
You still owe me...
"I think, what is it, $19.40?"
"Oh, you're serious about that?"
So...
Yeah.
Dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.
"No, the girls will be on me."
I...
- I'm...
Shh!
(Whispers) I came to apologise about yesterday.
Is that the only reason you came?
"No, it isn't."
Now I've really lost Bill.
- I am going to the police.
- Please...
That's no good.
No point crying over spilt milk.
You don't understand.
It's not his money I care about.
I really love him.
"So, now I'm getting my own back on that beastly Dennis."
Just a minute.
You said you saw a file on that authoress Flora Ransom?
- Yes.
- Right!
We're going to see her.
I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman.
Excuse me.
- Have a good time.
- I am not going to have a good time!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
She's out but we are expecting her back soon.
Come in.
Thank you.
My name's Bastable.
I'm the lucky fellow she's consented to marry.
"She's a widow, you know."
This way.
"Oh, was Flora expecting you?"
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the newjanitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousyjob.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What ifthere's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- Yeah.
I loved that old house.
"- Yeah, I loved that place, too."
- I had my first kiss there.
"- Me, too."
"So what's going on, Jimmy?"
"I've just had a really bad year with the market and, it's disastrous, and it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent for the next..."
How much do you need?
No.
It's... it's a lot of money.
It's too much.
Jimmy.
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
I'll call the bank.
No.
I can't.
I can.
I'll pay you back.
But it's going to take me a couple of months.
I know where you live.
This place is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
New contractors come tomorrow.
Better get the job finished.
New contractors.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.
Pretty much.
You okay?
So the contractors start tomorrow.
Guess that means I'm gone.
One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
The Boss is being over-enthusiastic... but I'm going to use my brains.
By playing the right card at the right moment.
Daddy.
By the time he plays his cards...
Shiv and Ankita will already have their honeymoon.
I'm moron.
Hold on.
Jabbar bhai.
Dad call Jabbar bhai right now.
On the spot finish his entire family right now.
- Father's here.
- So what?
- Father's here.
- Shiv?
I told you we'll be visiting the saint's tomb one day.
And return to Benaras after that.
We'll visit the shrine today.
It's a good day today.
I'm pleased that you've been released.
And even happier... that you didn't need that goon's help for it.
Brother...
Brother come in.
No actually I couldn't do the job.
So I'm here to return Mr. Satyakant's money.
Brother come... come in.
- I'll leave.
- Please.
Please.
Brother come...
I'm going to the shrine.
Are you coming?
Yes father.
- We have our own bikes.
Fucking hell.
"Sometimes it is easy just to say ""yes""."
"Henry, catch it!"
"Oh, God."
I thought I'd lost forever Henry.
I was so scared.
I was so scared and you fell.
I thought I'd never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea.
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, please."
We can go now.
"Every year, 100000 baseball bats are sold in Russia."
"And at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives an idea of a great Russians pastime?
"This is a rare, survived bat."
Estelle.
"Would you, please, be so kind and stand up?"
No.
Or you wanna take her place?
"Estelle, your boy is quite a knight."
Sacrificing himself to keeping you alive.
Only for my dick... to kill you later.
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
"- I didn't hear a ""no""."
- Brilliant!
"Come over here, Henry."
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up.
"I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too."
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din.
What's up?
"Tonight, when everyone sleep, Din go back again."
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it.
All gold.
"Here, now."
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
"Is this satisfactory, sahib?"
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
"Go on, get something big."
Jaldi!
"Up, Annie."
"Please, Annie."
"What are you doing, Din?"
"A large tool you asked for, sahib."
"Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me."
Work for me.
"Get me out of here, Annie."
"Come on, Annie."
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
We're gonna crown us a new champion!
"Checkered flag, here I come!"
No!
McQueen's blown a tire!
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?
You fool!
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!
"Go, go, go!"
He's lost another tire!
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!
Come on.
"I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!"
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
The King and Chick rounding turn four.
Down the stretch they come!
"And it's, and it's..."
- It's too close to call!
Too close!
- I don't believe it!
Lightning!
"- The most spectacular, amazing..."
- I don't believe it!
"...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!"
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?
"Hey, no cameras!"
Mom.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's fine.
`
The baby's okay.
She's okay.
She ?
It's a girl.
Sweet.
Cool.
"Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have.
I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
Or sleeping anywhere.
"Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going..."
it'll be fun.
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.
"- Oh, my God, the yard guy?"
"- Yeah, I know."
"What was I supposed to do, wait for you?"
You weren't coming back.
I wanted you to tell me the truth.
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.
"Well, hot damn, welcome to the club."
- I love that guy.
- You're not the only one.
"- You had me three months ago, and you left."
- I want to make that up to you.
"In the Paratroopers, I mean."
I don't know.
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother... I suddenly realized how wonderful life really was!
And then I fought like a tiger to stay alive!
I was running away from problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah...
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
Better not to talk about it.
All right.
"-Hey, have you had dinner?"
-No.
-Would you like dinner with me?
-Okay!
All right.
Doc Swain?
"Evening, Selena."
I'll be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
"Ah, watch your feet."
Are you going to tell them about me?
"-I'll have to, Selena."
-Nobody in town must ever know.
"But, if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
-I know that.
"-Well, then, why?"
-Because of Ted.
What're you doing here in the middle of night
You want to break into my shop?
"I'm sorry, boss, I need 1 0 grams of Tianqi 50 grams of Baiyao, also..."
Are you mad?
You know what time it is?
Come again tomorrow!
Please help.
It's a matter of life and death
What does it have to do with me!
I need to sleep!
"You can't sleep, boss!"
"Asshole, no sympathy at all"
All you want is sleep!
Think you can sleep no more?
What are you looking at?
Get off!
Asshole
I'll make it hard for you to sleep!
Sleep!
I'll let you sleep!
Son of a bitch!
Sleep!
Since you like to sleep!
Damn it
Sleep!
I'll let you sleep!
What are you doing?
The gold is mine
"It has the word ""San"" engraved on it"
Doesn't this belong to Zhou Sanzhao?
So you know Zhou Sanzhao?
"Don't get me wrong, I didn't steal it"
Takehara sees Mother a lot?
I don't know.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
What do you think?
Will you let us use it?
It's a little embarrassing.
It'll get you a lot in return if you do let me use it.
My mother says that she can't make it today.
I think you were supposed to go the Kabuki with her.
Has something come up?
My father came back.
I see.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Same as ever.
"Takao, I haven't seen you in ages."
Is your mother well?
Yes.
You should come to Kamakura.
The beach is really popular.
I'd like to get there this summer.
Excuse me.
Someone from the Kokuminsha is here.
"Send him in, please."
Will you be going in the bath later?
"I will, but after we're done talking."
Make yourself at home.
Mother was a friend of hers wasn't she?
"Yes, I think they were very close."
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, of course."
- We'll have you guys over.
Maybe I'll make some of my famous apps and we can throw some games in there.
"- That'll be fun, right?"
"- Hey, can you make those baby hot dogs that look like they're taking a nap in pastry?"
"- Oh, pigs in a blanket."
"- Yeah, I guess you could make those, too, if you want, pfft."
All right.
♪ ♪
You did not have to make me dinner.
I haven't ever made anything other than a DiGiorno's pizza.
"Well, I'm sure it's delicious."
"Okay, here we go, right?"
[chuckles]
All right.
Bon appétit.
All right.
"Now, is this a chicken or a fish?"
It is a chicken.
"Mm, can't wait."
Okay. [crunches]
"- Ooh, there's a crackle."
- Mm-hmm.
What is this?
There are...
What is...?
Rice Krispies.
It's a Rice Krispie crusted chicken.
"Mm, did you come up with that yourself?"
I did.
I didn't have any hazelnuts.
"I mean, you're supposed to wait a little while, make sure you're ready."
Uh...we should go.
"Lulu, Alvin wanted me to tell you he's gone to the track."
"Hey, do you have a second?"
Yeah. I'll be right there.
I think that Alvin's trying to get me to fire him.
Do it.
[sighs]
- Are you busy with that case?
- Yeah.
"Well, I heard that woman died when you were there."
"I mean, I didn't think about your mother."
That's not important.
- l should've thought about it.
- l'm fine.
"Well, I'm sorry, Nick, to have to send you there."
Thank you.
Ready?
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
One--and make a little turn.
And that turns into a box step.
- Hi.
- Hey.
"No, don't stop."
"That was excellent, sweetheart."
She's learning the fo_rot as well.
"Oh, great, great."
"So, you want to-- you want to dance?"
- Burton.
- No?
"And ""druid's noch""?"
A period landmark.
The location of the astronomicon.
"I'll call karen,"
Then we'll be off.
After we find andreas.
You mean rescue him from the gural nataz?
(karen:) hello?
Huh?
"Karen, nigel."
"Yeah, I need you to look up a site."
It's called the druid's noch.
Circa 70 a.D.
This all seems so strange:
You helping to rescue my son.
"Yeah, well don't read"
"Too much into it, da veiga."
It's you he needs saving from.
"Thanks, karen."
"Okay, she's on it."
I have to go.
"Here, take this with you."
"Sydney, we may need that."
We don't have that luxury.
He could trade it for andreas.
"Because that's what you do, isn't it?"
"Trade, steal..."
"When I show this to the gural nataz,"
They will decipher the code
"Just as you have done,"
And then they will send out more agents.
You have to find the astronomicons
Look around you...
"new fallen snow, you're with your family."
I just know this is going to be a great day.
Sue?
Sue Murphy?
"Oh, fuck me!"
"Hi, Ginny!"
"Oh, hi, Frank."
"How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?"
Any nibbles?
I should've died in Korea.
"Go play with Maureen, that's fun!"
Sorry about Frank.
He hasn't been himself lately.
That's all right.
Failure can break down even the strongest man.
How are you?
"Must have been a difficult Christmas after, you know,"
Greg abandoned you and the kids.
"Oh, no, we're back together!"
Greg took a Catholic cruise with Father Pat and came back a different man.
We're going at it like newlyweds!
"Well, that's a dirty mouth."
"Mister, I'm gonna shut you up."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, hi, stud!"
"Dear Lord, give me strength."
"Vagina, vagina, vagina!"
"Hey, baby!"
Looking attractive!
"Christ, I hate it here."
Bunch of kids.

- Spencer.
"- Hey, Tanya."
- You look beautiful as always.
- ( kisses )
- What are you doing here?
"- Well, I heard a couple of my friends were vacationing in my neck of the woods, I thought I'd come by."
"Yeah, and I grew up nearby."
Might pop into my mom.
"Tanya, my business partner, Joe Krutel."
"- Hi, Joe."
- Hi.
Boys are getting big.
"Ah, yeah."
"Henry is already 6'1"" and he's only in middle school."
They grow 'em big like that in Texas.
When are you gonna make some?
It's such a shame to waste those genetics.
"Yeah, I am working on it."
"Tanya, where is, uh..."
Where is your husband?
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?
"Over there, massage."
Something really got under his skin this morning.
Said he needed extra pressure.
"Huh, wonder what that could be."
"No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
(WHISPERING) Giants can smell blood.
And I'm always a gentleman.
(CORK POPS)
(CORK THUDS)
(GASPING) Ah!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
Bloody waste of it.
(EMMA PANTING)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
That's where the treasures are.
Where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
"The powder Mulan gave us, we need to use it."
We've gotta knock him out.
That's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
"Who's Milah, on the tattoo?"
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
"You, too."
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
"Well, he came in."
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
-l can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
"This stuff is great, but it's like lead."
"Tell me, where you been?"
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
"Mom, I been working nights."
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and we hit one of them deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
"It reminds me, I need this knife."
"Okay, Jenny a-and I, we're looking to have a new nanny."
"Or in Tyler's case, a... a manny."
[Laughs]
- What?
- Yeah.
[Both chuckle]
Stop it.
"You're, like, the worst liar ever."
Who is this guy?
He's Lanie's new boyfriend.
She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.
"You know what this means, right?"
We... are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.
"Hey, Lanie."
I got your text.
And I've got your murder weapon...
"A picture of it, anyway."
I used the autopsies of The Phantom's victims to generate this.
Ryan:
Hmm.
Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Exactly.
Find the knife...
Find the killer.
Nice work.
"So, how's the background check going?"
"Oh, pretty good so far."
I don't like the sound of that.
"No, t-there's..."
there's nothing to worry about... y-yet.
It's... it's just a rumor.
Let's hear it.
- This is not the time.
- It's the perfect time.
"Truth, Gemma."
- I love you.
"- Oh, shit, Chris."
Give me another chance.
You know you want to.
No!
Sorry.
"Serious buzzkill, Chris."
"- I say the moment's passed, mate."
- Yeah.
I choose truth.
- Felix isn't in Chile.
- So... where is he?
"Well, what happened was that he hung himself."
What?
He hung himself.
"Right here, from that crossbeam there."
"- Is this a joke, mate?"
"- No joke, mate."
It's what happened.
I'm in Afghanistan stewing in sweat and fear and blood.
"And when I get home, my kid brother's found swinging from the rafters."
The groundsman cut him down.
True story.
But this is terrible.
"It's been hushed up, naturally, 16 generations of French Catholics."
"Suicide's about as shameful as it gets, not to menton a faggot cop-out."
So why are we here?
I need to get the bottom of it.
Family honour's at stake.
Coming up...
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?

You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.

"And later, Rutledge makes a scientific breakthrough."
"Oh, come on!"
You unplugged it!

"To celebrate our 25th episode, we've turned over control of the show to Rutledge."
I've got Wood.
"So far, he almost killed himself."
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Bleep]
And now he had me working the streets of San Francisco for tips.
Andrew?
I had $40 to Rut's $20.
Pow!
Yeah!
And we had our last passengers of the night.
I want to know more about this boy that you say you like.
I'm not sure about this.
He was really nice.
- I don't know.
- He was nice.
I thought he was nice.
Really?
You don't like him 'cause he's chubby and nerdy.
No.
That's not true.
I am two people.
One was born when I met you.
The other one began in a downtown L.A. tattoo parlor.

Read all about it!
Get your paper.
MAN 2:
Come on.
"Come on, let's get out of here."
Let's bring our boys home to fight those zoot-suited dandies that are making it unsafe to walk our streets today.
"All right, now."
"Here, we're gonna start weight training."
First things first...
Squats.
Okay.
That's it.
"Uh, that looks really heavy."
Look.
This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.
"- Yeah, but I can't lift that."
- Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.
Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.
Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.
Look.
You wanna fight like a man?
You gotta train like a man.
"Now, come on."
Gimme a squat.
- Ready.
Go!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Go.
Keep it up.
"- Daddy, I can't."
- It's...
I can't.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up.
No!
Not again.
Get...
Go back!

"Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream."
You were having another kid.
"Maureen's the last one, right?"
Tell me she's the last one!
She's the last one.
"Oh, thank God."
It was horrible.
This baby had teeth!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
"Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now."
"So, heat it is."
"Frank, we'll get through this."
We always do.
I'm here for you.
The kids love you.
Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
"And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm gonna go downstairs.
"Oh, Sue, don't do that."
I haven't showered in days.
"I meant the kitchen, Frank."
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
Only if I get hit by a bus.
- Yes.
- Listen.
- Yes.
See that boy sitting there.
Yes Big Boss.
- Give one to him too.
- Yes.
I don't have money.
I didn't ask for it.
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.
Here.
Take it son.
Hey boy.
Won't you thank the Big Boss?
Offering water to the thirsty is a good deed.
And you've earned a merit because of me.
So should I be thanking him or will he thank me?
I must admit.
He's no ordinary boy.
Because he talks about common sense.
I forgot Lallan.
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.
And you Dushyant.
Why don't you setup a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?
You made a big mistake... taking up enmity with Dushyant.
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axe...
And all of North India... won't be able to put you back.
Hey boy let's go.
Stop.
Hadn't you better catch him up?
You don't want him taking the hump again.
"Oh, lord, he could be anywhere."
I'll see you at Popmobility.
Thanks for everything!
Bye!
Bye.
"You'll have to take the lift, love."
"Oh, flip."
It's all right.
You don't have to fling me into the gutter by the seat of my trousers.
It's not the Beano.
"Quick as you can, boys."
Up over there!
Who is it?
Sir!
"It's Jimmy Baker, he's up on that ledge."
Everyone shush!
"He's too late, though, isn't he, sir?"
"Because he didn't come on the tram, sir."
"Climb over, jump down, I'll catch you!"
Look lively.
Is everything all right over there?
Get in your place!
"Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton."
Baker was just helping me up.
"Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge."
Good man.
I was Naval Reserve.
North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.
You said Baker hadn't turned up.
It was just a question of time.
"Shall we go, son?"
Now?
You wouldn't want to worry Mama.
"No, I wouldn't."
Take good care of him.
"Oh, he'll be taken care of."
I don't want to go.
"Why, Wilbur?"
"Yes, tell her why."
"Well, because, you see, I'm not really a little..."
I like it here.
I want to go to school here.
This is a girls' school.
That's why I like it here.
"Now, Wilbur, you mustn't hurt your father's feelings."
"You wouldn't do that, would you, Wilbur?"
No.
You know how sensitive I am.
He's very sensitive.
"You're choking him, Mr. Hoolick."
Oh.
(COUGHS)
"Come along, son."
You don't have much time.
"It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Hoolick."
"It's been very nice meeting you, Mrs. Brendan."
"Goodbye, Wilbur."
"Don't say that, Mrs. Brendan!"
"All right, you."
Where is it?
Why did you tell Mrs. Brendan you're my father?
Not when he's your dad and he acts like your diary is part of the collective unconscious.
Wait.
"Sorry, I keep thinking about people sitting on this couch talking about being sexually abused."
That's what makes it fun.
You're a good kisser.
Am I a manly kisser?
Do you want to go to my prom with me?
N.Y.U. has proms?
Shit.
I'm drunk.
I should be honest with you.
I don't go to N.Y.U.
- Where do you go?
Hunter?
- St. Anne's.
The high school?
How old are you?
- Old enough.
- Wait wait.
"You want me to go to your senior prom, right?"
You're 18?
"- No, junior prom."
- You're 17?
- 16.
- 16 years old?
But I'll be 17 in two weeks.
You're 16?
"Oh my God, oh my God."
Don't freak out.
I haven't been a virgin for almost a year.
I probably know more about sex than you do.
"I know plenty about sex, okay?"
This was a dream come true.
I'd landed a custom '66 Mustang.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ] There you go.
I knew I had to go easy on her if I wanted a good tip.
But I had to take a shot.
How drunk are you?
[ Laughs ]
"Had a few, I'd say, at least."
[ Engine revs ]
"Oh, I will have you home in no time, my friend."
Done.
[ Laughs ]
"I don't want you to baby this thing, all right?"
You have nothing to worry about.
Seriously.
[ Both laugh ]
"Oh, that's sweet."
This was great.
"If I could just keep him happy and not wreck his car, a healthy tip would be in my future."
Don't baby that clutch.
Come on.
Give it a little gas.
[ Engine revs ]
[ Tires screech ]
Perfect.
[ Laughs ]
There's no way Rutledge was having this much fun.
You're the best driver that I have had yet.
Wood:
- I don't know what he knew.
This is crazy.
"You're saying Dad hid one of his kids from us for years and then gave Holly the land, so his affair is thrown in our face because of some girl named Rebecca?"
I wish I could tell you what he was thinking.
- It's a shock for me too.
- I don't know why.
- He lied about having a mistress.
- That's not fair.
Why should I be so shocked that he lied to us too?
This whole family revolves around lying.
"- Justin, please!"
- Grandma!
Aunt Kitty!
- Hi.
"- Hi, Grandma."
- Hi.
Hi.
"- Hey, guys."
"Hey, sweetie boy."
"Hi, guys."
- This is wonderful.
- Joe.
"- Hey, Nora."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Kitty."
- I can hardly pick you up.
Please help me understand how you could discover your father has another child and not tell me?
- We were trying to spare you the pain.
- How?
By keeping me in the dark?
God.
You should've seen Justin's reaction.
My room.
Lie down and rest.
What room is this?
It hurts here.
I can't believe this.
This is my room.
Just lie down and relax.
You were in my dream.
"No, when I was taking a bath."
Really?
Do I look dirty to you?
Think I slept with Changwook?
"No, no."
"Then, what's wrong, huh?"
Because I used to date foreigners?
No.
"Actually, it makes it better."
"When you're dating, it's a turn-on."
It is?
"But to cherish someone in your heart, it can be a problem."
It hurts so much.
"There's no woman here, is there?"
"No, stupid."
Really?
Of course not.
It hurts?
It's nice being with you in the morning.
I don't know what to do.
In my brain there is this illness.
My ex-wife had slept with my friend before we married.
I didn't know that before.
"But then, I found out, and I couldn't forgive her."
It looks like there's some tidy minge here.
"Yes, it's tidy because there's no hair on it."
"Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there."
It's her who write your Valentine?
"Oh, yeah, shit."
She looks quite fit actually.
"Right, I'll go over and tell her you fancy her."
- No.
- Why?
"Well, you going over and telling her I fancy her, seems a bit, y'know, childish."
When in Rome.
That's how you got to play it with younger girls.
You go over...
"Shit, she's coming over here."
So did you get my valentine's card then?
"Oh, yeah, great."
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.
"No, I mean a proper drink."
Oh... right.
"Yeah, thanks."
You're fit.
- Sorry?
"- Oh, forget it."
Come on.
"You're well sexy, I used to stare at you in assembly."
Right.
"Ooh, you're so horny."
Tongue me!
"Um, how old are you?"
"Blimey, that didn't take long."
Why can't you compromise on something?
Anything?
Because then I'd be you.
A real Hollywood agent.
"I want to look like that French girl in ""Last Tango in Paris."" Oh."
Where are my heels?
"She had that hat, remember?"
It's black with the flower?
Clothes are not what I remember about that movie.
What?
You're nervous.
[scoffs] [laughs] It's cute.
You're cute.
Just cleaning my boots.
[sighs] [brush swiping]
"Do you love me, Nick?"
[laughs softly]
I wouldn't want to be on this ride with anyone else.
[chuckles]
♪ solemn music ♪ [sighs softly]
Do you remember what I said the first time I saw you do stand-up?
"""The fries here are so good."""
- [both laughing]
- No.

I said you were going places.
Yeah.

I want to come with you.

I can't wait until our trip to Merced this weekend.
Come on.
"One, two, three!"
Wow.
That train is not moving very fast.
This window won't open.
That's why we need to get back in there.
Could pick up the pace.
You're not going fast enough.
I am too going fast enough.
No job is done until the paperwork is complete.
Stand by.
Where the hell is Rudy?
Okay.
"Oh, boy!"
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, wow..."
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal.
Wow.
You're making...
Come on.
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.
Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up.
Hand you the chocolates?
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.
How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate?
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
you are on in 5 minutes we need to go over this.....
"nancy....just try out A good time tonight,okay,for my sake?"
...Bill that'll mean 180 million in my district alone.
Do my best to get it out of conference.
Thank you.
"I'll just take a hundred mil,no complaints."
Where's your sister?
Like I keep tabs on marcy.
"- Hey,chief."
- Max.
- Good to see ya.
- Senator.
Hey.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Becky
"Thank you for all your charity work,mrs."
Collins.
It's a necklace.
Thank you.
It is lovely.
"Hey,put it on."
Um... go great with that dress.
i made it from real microrony but you can't eat it because it is over paint
"Becky,that is good to know."
- bye.
- Bye.
Excuse me.
"Mrs.Collins,you have a call on our house phone."
Who is it?
"She didn't say,but it sounded urgent."
What do you bet it's marcy.
Kevin.
I'm Frank.
Brad.
-Hey.
"-Oh, hey."
"Oh, God."
"Come on, come in."
Excuse me.
What do we do now?
Just ask her to...
you know.
You kids see a lot of hookers?
"No, this is our first one."
Why do you have a picture of Grace Kelley?
'Cause I'd like to be like her:
Marry a prince and never get old.
"When you take your clothes off for money, do you get cold?"
Depends on the room.
"I have this dream that I'm naked at school, and I have to get home without anyone seeing me."
"I have that dream, too."
"Last time I had that dream, there was an alligator chasing me."
You ever get that one?
Nope.
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Yes.
Are you married?
"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
The meter's ticking.
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!
"Now, how do you want to do this:"
standing up or on the bed?
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"""Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."" I wonder what's in there."
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens.
Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
"- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens."
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
"Now, listen."
"What we don't take, we ain't got."
Look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
"All right, whoever's in here, come on out."
"Come on out, I say!"
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids.
I heard them.
Come on out of there.
"Come on, you hoodlums."
You won't get away.
"- Come out, or I'll come in after you."
"- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now."
"Come on, Rocky!"
Jump!
"Hi, Snowflakes."
"- Hi, Jerry."
- Hello.
What do you hear?
Did anyone come to visit me?
who do you mean?
We are all here.
My friend.
Which friend?
Did anyone by the name Deepa visit me?
Deepa?
No.
No one like that had come.
Where is my phone?
Did she call me?
I need to talk to her immediately.
I'll leave.
"Sadhana, wait."
Where are you going?
He is asking about someone called Deepa.
I asked for my phone.
I need to talk to Deepa immediately.
I need to see her.
What is this?
Sadhana was the one who took care of you.
You didn't even talk to her.
"I will talk to her, later."
I need to talk to Deepa now.
Will you give my phone?
What do you think you are doing?
We have been praying for your recovery...
We have spent a lot of money and waited.
You must be happy for getting your vision back.
You are reciting someone random woman's name!
- What did you say?
What?
I just wanna walk.
How is he?
"Well, he's doing pretty good, considering."
Do you think she ever really loved him?
It doesn't look like that matters.
"- Breathe, Harriet, breathe."
- I am breathing.
We need to come up with a better game plan for that next contraction.
You're doing just fine.
- Let's just have a look at you.
- Okay.
You're going to feel a little pressure.
A little pressure might be a nice change.
Where's Dr. Gettis?
He was due in here 10 minutes ago.
- I don't know.
I paged him.
- Get him in here.
- What is it?
- I need you to roll over on your side.
- I need Dr. Gettis right away.
- Okay.
Get that pillow down.
Yes.
- Don't push yet.
- What's happened?
Just something the doctor needs to look at.
They can't find him.
I've got Dr. Chadway.
"Doctor, we have a prolapsed cord."
The baby's heart rate is showing decels.
"Yes, sir."
He's cute.
I know how to make him feel better.
"No, I know a better way."
Lift him up.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What are you doing this time, Jimmy?"
He's still conscious?
Yes.
Hello.
You'll be fine.
You just gotta get a little bit power.
"Ladies, could you give us a little space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
Here we go.
That's wonderful.
Now we can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you at the lab.
Hello?
"Oh, thank you."
They're Here.
They must have followed you.
I can't...
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
"And that, you know, makes me uncomfortable."
[SCOFFS]
"Well, just because I'm comfortable with myself doesn't mean I don't wanna fit in."
"- What, you wanna fit in with us?"
- Yeah.
"I mean, you guys could try and be a little nicer to me at school."
"- Okay, well, we could try."
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Good.
- Okay.
Good.
- This is good.
- This is good.
This is a tip for you.
A tip?
"No, Marly, that's not..."
"Oh, a hundred bucks?"
"Whoa, thank you."
Somebody's getting a haircut.
And a new pair of shoes.
"I'm not looking, I'm not looking."
I just wanna get my purse.
"I don't wanna see anything, or, God forbid, touch anything."
"It's okay, he's gone."
Ah.
"Well, I am leaving."
I wanna thank you for a particularly humiliating afternoon.
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad at you?
"No, that was great."
"I don't know, which part was my favorite?"
You're his kin.
"People would keep coming in, 'cause they associate you with your old man."
Maybe you should hang with las viejas on 190th.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Doctor says you're getting out of here soon.
They set you up with a daytime nurse for a couple of months.
I spoke to the insurance lady.
I put a little extra in to get you through the next few weeks.
- Gracias.
"- You've got a real gift, Carlos."
Don't let go of that.
"- Put me down, carajo!"
- I got you.
"- Put me down, coño!"
- I got you.
Nice!
Let's get some light in here.
"Better, right?"
"You have some nice plants here, Mr. Eddie."
Let me knot it for you.
They could use some water.
Let's take this jug.
Carlos:
"Turn it, dude."
You're gonna break the window.
- Mickey:
Stop fucking bitching.
- Carlos:
What did I tell you?
- Daisy:
You'll hit the walls.
- Shit.
Why aren't you trying anything on?
Did you take your meds?
"What do you mean, did I take my meds?"
Of course.
"For God's sake, Mom."
Ha-ha-ha.
"It's just, you don't spend money like this when you're on them."
"- What are you saying, hm?"
- Nothing.
It's nothing.
Just having a good time with your friends.
Isn't that all right?
"Just because I'm sick from time to time, I can't have a good time?"
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We're having a good time.
See?
That jacket is gorgeous.
You see that jacket?
"It's beautiful, right?"
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, with the shoes."
"Oh, my God, it's perfect."
"Come on, baby."
Just try something on.
Try these on.
Wanna try these on?
They're really cute.
We'll get three of these.
We'll get one for you and one for Grace.
Let's get three of them.
"- Thanks, Robin."
You're awesome.
What else?
"Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable."
-You won't score points by telling her.
-Okay.
Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts.
She doesn't need your life story...
-... beforeyougetthe salad.
-Got it.
"As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all."
"Right, right."
"I'll be cool, aloof, distant."
"She's here, she's here, she's here!"
What about the-
- What-
- What--
What about the kiss goodnight?
-Should I ask or just go for it?
-Go for it.
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.
-Get it out of the way early.
-How early?
"After dinner, when you walk to the car..."
"... openherdoor,waitforher to say thank you..."
"... smile,leanin ,andkissher."
"Oh, nice."
"Hi, Alan."
You ready?
"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you."
That's another way to go.
-Madam.
-Thank you.
-(overlapping chatter)
"What do you think of your old squad, huh?"
I hate to admit it-- you look almost human.
(laughter)
Pass the glasses around.
"Listen, you want some cigars?"
-Anything you want.
-(overlapping chatter)
"Here you are, pappy."
"Say, pretty classy, pretty classy here."
-Yeah.
"-Oh, I was going to get a whole floor, but some maharaja beat me to it."
(laughs)
TUBBY:
"Doing all right for a PFC, boy."
PFC?
"Look alive, Tubby."
That was ten years ago.
"A lot of things must happen, you know, in ten years."
(laughter and overlapping chatter)
"Hey, hey, if you're not used to it, that's champagne."
Take it easy.
"Yes, I'll, uh, I'll have to go easy."
I've got a big day at the office tomorrow.
Office?
"Working at an office, huh?"
Good boy.
"Gave up driving a truck, huh?"
"Sure, he's got his own company-- Morgan Truck Lines."
Morgan Truck Lines?
Mm-hmm.
That big transcontinental outfit?
I totally forgot to order it without peppers.
Yeah.
Even though I told you seconds before that I hated green peppers.
- My head still must be a little fuzzy.
- Must be.
So what kind of food does Bo like?
- Nothing special.
She seems like someone who'd like a good steak.
- Maybe.
- What's Bo's favourite restaurant?
We don't really eat out much.
...We..?
- Yeah.
"""We"" this, ""we"" that."
"You're pretty much right in there with Bo, huh?"
"Right by her side, day in, day out."
Yeah.
"You know, we're kind of a team."
Is that healthy?
"I mean, don't you want to branch out on your own one day so that both of you can flourish?"
- Yeah.
"You know, you're totally right."
I'm actually planning on going back to school and getting my law degree.
"Oh, law."
- That's so great.
- Yeah. it's so great.
- Gotta pee.
- Okay.
"Oh, jeez."
"On, shit."
"Oh, my God."
"On, God."
"Here, you three can go."
Allez!
Let him go!
"You ""reviendras""?"
You will come back and see me?
Leave them in peace!
"- But, Officer..."
- Sit down and leave them in peace!
- Evening.
- Bonsoir.
"Next time, vous ne sortez pas sans passeport!"
- Sorry?
- Don't go out without passport!
"- Ah yes, passport..."
- Mon amour!
"- Go and call a taxi, I'll wait for you here."
"- Yes, bonsoir!"
"- Excuse me, the Hotel de Bon Commerce?"
- Hotel du Bon Commerce?
- You know it?
"- Yes, Boss."
"Via des Beaux Arts, near the Place des Abbesses."
"- Ah yes, Abbesses Place."
- If you could write...
Shouldn't we call a doctor?
You should start by not fighting all the time.
"She's got indigestion, that's all!"
- Where have you been?
- With Gremier.
"I wanted to come back sooner, but the car broke down."
That'll teach you to go out with the first people you meet on the street.
"They're not the first people I met on the street, they're..."
Still want to take Barry's place?
"- Get out of here, Barry."
- I'll go get a teacher.
You want to go?
"I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk."
Why not?
You chicken?
Come on!
No.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
"- Hey, get back!"
Get back.
That is enough.
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I chould have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It was tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth,"
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
"His pride, my pride."
- Please.
- Enough talk.
Time to play the game.
Hello.
Hello-ah.
Friend of yours?
"It's Jonesy, open up!"
Get rid of him.
I'll be listening.
"Luke, Luke, what's going on?"
I've been calling you for hours.
"- Sorry, man."
"- Not a sound, people."
Thought it's gonna be some country house megabash.
"No, it's a total wipeout."
No one here.
Just a few losers.
"- Well, I may as well come and say hi."
"- Seriously, you don't wanna go in there"
"Seriously, I do."
I've been on the road three hours.
"20 pound carried from the station, treading through this mud, to follow your fucking GPS."
"Plus, I've got a shitload of gear that I'm supposed to be shifting tonight."
"Can't let you in, mate."
It's a private party.
Is this some kinda wind-up.
"What's going on, Luke?"
N-Nothing.
- Are you standing me?
- No.
"That's it, isn't it?"
Fear of bodily fluids.
I need a break.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
"Okay, I'll get him."
Richard.
Why don't you walk around in those and see how they feel.
- It's Peter.
- Hello?
"Oh, no."
Really?
"Well, did you call your mom?"
"Oh, right."
Damn.
"Well, can you make it through the day, Petey?"
Are you barfing?
Okay.
"Okay, let's see here."
"I don't get off until 6:00, and we are just slammed here."
It's a sale day.
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.
This is why we have neighbors.
"We're part of a community, Peter."
Does your mom make you do that?
"No, this is my own towel."
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.
"See, this is the bath sheet... and this is the hand towel... and this is the washcloth."
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.
"When they hang on the rack, they go like this."
No more than five.
- I know a way in.
- No.
"No, your Abbess..."
- She doesn't need to know.
- She said they search every inch.
We can't.
There are inches Mother doesn't know about.
Ladies.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
This is...
Sister Marie.
- Miri.
- Since when do we bring strays home?
She's going to help hide our men at the Abbey.
Then she should be at the Abbey.
Why is she here?
She knows our plan.
I prefer not to let her out of our sight.
We'll need a car or a way to slow the Germans down.
The Abbey has a truck.
They take it to town on market days.
"I could ""borrow"" the keys."
When do you need it?
Walking freely is a privilege.
- Brilliant.
- Maybe now you will think twice before attacking.
Alfred's going to have to find a way out from the inside.
- How?
- I don't know.
He's going to need our help.
"Oh, my God."
He called?
MARY:
Well...
- He e-mailed?
- No.
BRUCE:
What?
Left his calling card with your lady-in-waiting?
- He MySpaced me.
- Ouch.
- Oh.
"- Oh, girl, I don't know about that."
My trampy little sister says MySpace is the new booty call.
"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
"I mean, things have changed."
People don't meet each other organically anymore.
"If I would like to make myself seem more attractive to the opposite sex I don't go and get a new haircut, I update my profile."
"That's just the way it is, you know?"
[PHONE RINGING]
NATHAN:
"Yeah, she's right."
"Back, back, back, back."
"Ad sales, this is Mary."
"Hi, Mary, this is Conor, Anna's friend, or whatever."
Hi.
"So, what'd you think?"
Looking at it right now.
I'm not sure about this.
"Oh, you have to trust me."
"It's a burgeoning market, you're gonna make a fortune."
I know.
How?
Here's 50.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Hurry up.
There's coffee if you'd like.
Laure!
"Laure, it's Gilou!"
- Calm down!
- How's it going?
"So, who was right?"
You switched your phone off?
"Sorry, I went back to sleep."
"I'm taking a shower, I'm coming."
"- Wait, I'll make some coffee."
- I don't have any left.
I'll see you at the office.
"See you later, then."
"Fuck, just what I didn't want to happen."
"You're entitled to a private life, aren't you?"
I don't know.
What?
How come you don't know?
- Aren't we serious?
"- Yes, we are."
"Anyway, I've got to go."
I'm taking someone in for questioning.
What kind?
The kind of dealer involved in settling scores in a squat.
A guy got hit in the lung by a bullet.
It went through the ceiling.
He is dead?
He'll survive.
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.NYou are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyoneNfall in love with her. (animals GRUNTlNG )
even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
is it not betterNto be feared than loved?
Not certain anymore.
let her have the rabble.Nl don't need them.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be workingNat my trade again.
It's just a pityNyou have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(chains rattling )
(THUNDER crashing )
Hatter.
Have you any ideaNwhy a raven is like a writing desk?
Alice.
I don't like it in here.Nlt's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
You're so tall.
Get lost!
So sorry.
Goodbye.
"David, sit and eat with us."
I've to work.
Thanks.
Thank God having David here.
I'll never know how to deal with those members.
Like it?
We can change it till you like it.
Can you stop spending money to me this way?
"When you did something wrong, sent me gift."
Now you buy me a car.
So what?
I'm not that greedy.
You know how bad that makes me feel?
What?
Aren't I nice to you?
You just walked out on me.
Why did we've to split up?
You really want to know?
Tell me.
"You're ill-tempered, stubborn, give me no sense of security..."
"Ok, cut it out."
"You're not my cup of tea, ok?"
Then imagine me to be coffee.
"Milk tea, tea and coffee mix, anything."
"Michael, let's just be friends."
"It's all my fault, ok?"
"Lisa, is everything ok?"
This is your tea.
Not now.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I keep it running perfect.
"It's Tony's sister, she did it."
She's as weird as he is.
"Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly and continuously without interference from your sister."
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- It's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"Hey, wait for me."
"Come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
Okay.
Less gay it is.
Great!
"I'm gonna give Wes a call, see what he thinks of the glasses idea."
"Oh, Jack."
He has no idea what he just...
Anticlimax.
What's wrong?
My boyfriend back home thinks that college is gonna make me some sort of... sex robot.
Tell me about it.
Mine thinks it's gonna turn me into a brainwashed sex doll.
You know what?
We should teach them a lesson.
Yeah?
If they're gonna treat us like that... maybe we should just act like it.
Yeah!
"Okay, close your eyes."
You tricked me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- That.
- Ouch!
Not too hard!
Stop!
You stop!
"Oh, you're so sexy!"
I feel so much better!
Me too.
Pillow fights fix everything.
"You know, I heard that but I always thought it was a sham."
A pillow sham?
"Ooh, good one."
I've never done that before... with a girl...
- We should all be drunk for this.
- Let's get really drunk.
- All right.
- Yeah.
You know what?
I'll get some beers.
- Come with me.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Let him go.
- Mmm.
- I don't know what happened.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Deandra, we've been at this for days now."
It's like you have no motor skills.
Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck.
Hey!
How's the chip off the old block doin'?
"- Bobby, not now, okay?"
"- Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61?"
"They billed it as ""Beauty Versus the Beast."""
Wasn't much of a fight.
First-round knockout.
- He went down like a...
"- Wait, wait, wait."
Hold on a second.
"What's goin' on with you, Thunderson?"
"What, are you trying to humiliate me?"
"Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago."
You know damn well you hit me after the bell.
What can I do then?
I got an idea.
What is it?
I can guarantee success with my idea.
- Your Highness will have to be patient.
- Why?
"If you can be patient,"
I'll guarantee you'll have the books of Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword.
Brother!
What is it?
Fung-wu killed his master!
He killed his master?
How can it be?
How can it be?
It's true!
Fung-wu's master was playing chess with His Highness.
"Suddenly, he held a sword in his hand and plunged it into his master's body."
That's unreasonable.
How can it be?
I saw it myself.
His master told him before he died that he'd done the right thing.
Done the right thing?
That's strange.
What happened afterwards?
His Highness arrested him for murder.
Did he resist?
It was useless!
He's helpless!
"Yan-ling, don't be sad!"
I'll find out the truth.
"1, 2, 3!"
"1, 2, 3!"
Here.
Look at this one.
"Oh, that's great."
Great.
With the smoke around Jivver's face.
Yeah.
So how's Hallie?
Looks like...
"you guys are an item now, huh?"
No.
"No, not an item."
Definitely not.
"She's a very nice girl, but um, she doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"
"Well, you're a big boy."
I'm sure you can handle... her.
"Hey, um, I wanted to ask you did you tell her to pursue me?"
Uh...
- Hello there Miss homebody.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
For what?
Did you forget my big screen debut deal?
We're going to my L.A. Red carpet premiere.
Hello.
"What do you think, Johnson?"
I think she's dead.
No excuses.
Seven was supposed to tell you.
Yeah.
"Well, he didn't."
"Oh, my god, I did actually."
It's just that you had your head buried in those photos and you didn't notice.
"Well, can I wear this?"
"Strange man, covered in blood, racing away from the scene of the crime."
"I don't know about you, but I don't need no eyewitness to make sense of this."
-Obediah Jackson is a murderer!
MEN:
"Yes, he is."
"All right, save it, Litefoot."
"The people rest, Your Honor."
MAN:
Put him in the ground.
[APPLAUSE AND chattering ]
"[GAVEL BANGS] I'd like to thank you, Mr. Judge, for giving me my day in court."
"I'd like to thank my son's friend, Josiah..."
... forstandingup here...
... representingme in front of all you good people here.
I'll tell you the truth now.
I followed Mr. Catchings behind the feed lot just like they said.
And then...
... beathimto death with my bare hands.
[chattering ]
[MEN shouting ]
travis:
Order.
Order.
Order.
Order.
Order in the court.
Order.
"I said, quiet."
Now.
You freely admit you killed this man?
"Yes, sir."
"But this is my day in court, and I aim to finish."
I just got so nervous.
- You were great.
- It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Good job.
"Well, thank you, mr."
Monk.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
"Natalie, where you going?"
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
The phones are lighting up like crazy.
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did.
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
So...
what do you say?
- About what?
- About doing it full-time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you you're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
Take it!
Go!
"Hold it, lady, what are you doing?"
Looking for somebody!
Who are you looking for?
Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung is at a chess game with his master and Highness.
Having a chess game?
I'll join them.
His Highness has ordered that there be no disturbance.
It's alright!
I won't tell anybody if His Highness loses.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking for his student.
No!
No?
Surround her!
This is ridiculous!
"Go away, or we'll do something!"
I won't leave unless I see Fung-wu.
Brother!
"Yan-ling, why do you figtht with them?"
You better go away with your sister.
And don't disturb the chess game!
The chess game?
He's playing chess with Mr. Law!
You came to find Fung-wu.
"Yes, they just won't let me in."
Mr. Royal Guard!
We are friends of His Highness.
You should at least tell Fung-wu that she's here.
That's right!
"The way he talks, you'd think he had something there."
Excuse me.
Hey.
Look at the dude.
- Come on.
Let's give him the works.
"- All right, kiddo."
"- Hey, watch out!"
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
"All right, come on!"
Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
"How'd you get it, Crab?"
I hoisted it over the transom in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
"Boy, we'll be in the money now."
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
"Hi, Soapy!"
"- Soapy, look what we got."
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's Yo-Yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
- I'm sorry!
- You're sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
BOTH:
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Amy's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
"Oh, my God, Clark."
"Don't look, it's pornography!"
The worst kind...
Long-form narrative.
"""Clark's Playbook of Scenarios to Help Jack Break Up with Amy""?"
"Okay, I'll give in."
It's my playbook of scenarios to help Jack break up with Amy.
"It's a little overthinky, right?"
"It's weird, but kind of sweet."
I wish someone paid that much attention to me.
Maybe there's someone that does.
And he's a lot closer than you think.
Have you tried... online dating?
"Damn it, Clark."
"Amy, I wanted to talk to you because..."
"Oh, I just thought of another crazy payroll story."
Buckle up.
"It was a Friday, of course..."
- We need to smash things all over your body.
- Yes!
- No.
- Yes.
- We need to build up your tolerance to beatings.
- Hence the smashing.
"- We used a trash can, but Dennis wanted to use a chair."
- I think he's ready.
- That's way too excessive at this point.
- That guy's ready.
- He's not ready for a chair.
"- I'm tellin' you, he's ready."
Hey!
Guys!
I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him all worked up.
- He's the toughest guy we know.
"- Yes, he is, but he..."
"Hey, Mac!"
"Get a chair, smash it on my back."
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right attitude.
I'll tell you what.
"Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts."
- Let's take things to the next level.
- Yeah.
- But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
- Let's get drunk!
- Whoa!
A wee little thing like you should be enjoying yourself.
Do you like to get high?
"Mm, naughty girl."
I only have this much.
"Uh, we can do blowbacks."
"Oh, it's been a while since I've had that... but I don't think so."
Do you have a light?
"Hm, sure!"
I knew I would be of some use.
Stupid fucking bitch!
You don't know anything.
Isn't it time you fucked off?
Back to Wisconsin or whatever fucking hole you came from!
"Brandeis was a front, obviously... to launder money, right?"
"So what, your Dad didn't think he had enough?"
The Bank was fucked.
Dad compartmentalized.
He was trying to save the ank.
How?
How?
Elena.
Who is she?
You're missing a fantastic party.
What are you doing?
"Oh, relax, Mom!"
"Marcello, go back outside."
"Irina, hold on..."
Don't she's a child!
I'm not a child.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Adriana!
Sure.
"- Hello, Ed."
How are you?
Why haven't you called me up?
Why...
Uh...
Our phone's out of order.
"- Well, you could have come to see me."
- No.
"No, I couldn't."
"You see, the girl I'm engaged to wouldn't like it."
So long.
"Say, was he trying to insult me?"
"Oh, no worry about that."
It's nothing.
You know the old saying:
"""Is just as many good fish in the ocean as there ever was. """
Fish in the ocean.
"There she is, boy."
Give her the gun.
"Yeah, what's the hurry?"
"Well, they told us to step on it."
You know what Joe says.
They got enough orders to paper this shop.
Oh.
Dombrowski said.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
- That's the fourth drill you've burnt up.
"- Well, what's it to you?"
Dombrowski's trying to sweat a record out of us.
"Listen, Frank, get down to work and quit knocking Joe."
Let her down.
Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for.
But I'm left holding the bag.
What are you complaining about?
The bag's full of cash.
Minus a year.
You can weather a year.
You can weather 1 00 years.
I've got partners.
You're my partners!
You're holding so many options on land...
... youcouldbuyBrooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
-What's that?
-My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I gonna do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
-Take care.
It's written in my notebook right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
"Please, come on!"
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil."
"Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off."
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
- Here's that list you wanted.
"- Great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I should've put more lights back here.
"No, you can't blame yourself."
It was after midnight.
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
- She's adorable in any outfit.
She is.
Damn her.
I looked like...
I literally look like a man who is...
Like a man who's...
A big man in this school uniform.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who invented that?
- You're nuts.
"- Ari, you look adorable."
"- Oh, thank you, honey."
And I look like crap.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
"- Here we are, two girls..."
- Exuberant.
...off into the night.
You just came out of that door looking like you're surprised that you came out of that door.
- How did you achieve that?
- What does that mean?
You came out of the door like you didn't expect to.
Maybe one of the one of the ADs just pushed me out.
"- Oh, right."
- I didn't realize that we were rolling.
"Is it true that there's only, like, a few Yugos in the world?"
Here's a story:
I hit my head here really hard.
- It hurt.
We got from now on to celebrate.
"- I'm not hungry, Mrs. Grogan."
- You've got to eat.
All you had for lunch was a can of tomatoes.
Go on and eat.
"- Oh, don't worry."
I'll be over this tomorrow.
- You will if you stay home tonight.
- Yeah.
"- Never mind, I'll get it."
Hello?
Oh.
"Just a moment, please."
"Ed, it's for you."
Mrs. Danvers.
"- Thanks, Betty."
"- You're welcome, I'm sure."
Hello?
"Hello, Eddie."
"Oh, I'm fine."
I just wanted to find out how you were.
Huh?
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, it must have been the gin chasers."
It couldn't have been the beer.
"Oh, I just called up to tell you I'm not mad about what you said last night."
No.
"Well, you know, about our not having any more dates."
"No, I've forgiven you already."
Uh-huh.
I couldn't stay mad at a swell guy like you.
"Well, that's fine."
- Lucy...
- Yes?
"Lucy, I..."
"I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I..."
I...
I think you should know that...
"Mama, I do know."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"Goodbye, Daddy."
Bye.
"Billy, you missed your tea."
"And you, Faber."
Have something at the pub.
- Thanks.
I'll just have a wash.
- See you there.
"- Freddy, can I come?"
- I don't know about that.
- You in the army yet?
- Tell him about that miracle cream.
"Oh, yeah."
Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off...
"Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you."
- We mustn't let that go to waste.
"- Not with this rationing, we mustn't."
I'll be down in a minute.
"24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it?"
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
- There we are.
Okay sir.
Want to hear their death cries?
Listen.
- No one should escape.
"- Gocha, my father  my people."
Tell police not to shoot them.
Hello... hello...
There are little children.
Hello... hello...
Do you think I will cry  beg you?
Those who are in the bus are your men not mine.
You said Konda Reddy called us.
But you are taking us elsewhere.
"If you're a smart ass,"
I am a much smarter ass.
I know you will do such a thing.
You said you framed them.
I changed everything.
There is an important guest in the bus.
Do you know who it is?
Where are you trying to escape?
Why are you leaving us?
Police?
Go  catch them.
- Listen.
- Go fast!
Those who kidnapped the marriage party are running away.
- Who are you?
- I am Konda Reddy's brother.
I know Konda Reddy's brother.
I am Gocha's son-in-law.
Does this dirty face need Gocha's sister?
I have decided this!
Let Yawang do it.
"And go to the location immediately,"
- to know more about the environment!
- Yes.
"Mr. Qu, Shanhua Desig n Garden Company is here for the design plan."
"Thank you, Mr. Qu!"
"You are new staff in Shanhua Gardening, right?"
"Yes, I am ."
Your attitude is not bad!
Excuse me!
"I have to deliver the plan, and leave now!"
Good bye!
Thank you!
- See you tomorrow!
- Yawang!
No way!
You shouldn't ask me to work like a slave!
Don't play around!
Do you want this job?
Or you can leave!
Not like that!
I just pout to get your sympathy.
My body can not afford to work any longer.
I want to cry!
Oh mine!
"Each one of you, having done so little work, are leaving so punctually!"
Who is her?
"She is our Department Manager, eho resguested male trainees included you to work in this site."
Hi.
My name is Zhang Jingyu.
I am Yawang's friend.
"Well, listen."
"Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up."
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
"I just have to go, is all."
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
"So, you want to go grab some some dinner?"
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We cool?
"Your satellite's on, by the way."
That screen's bad-ass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologize.
Is this going to be every weekend now?
The Wu-tang Sword is really fierce.
Please stop or someone will get killed!
How come?
We're good friends.
"Mr. Wong, this way please!"
Let's go!
Shaolin and Wu-tang are really so fierce.
"Yes, Your Highness!"
I saw them fight myself.
Chin Kang Fist of Shaolin!
8-divine Sword of Wu-tang!
If only...
"Your Highness, that's easy!"
We have gyms of both martial arts schools here.
We'll bring them here!
Wait.
- Sung Chi!
- Yes!
Invite the master of the Shaolin martial arts school here.
I have an idea!
Cheers!
I've always admired Shaolin kung-fu very much.
"Especially your kung-fu, Mr. Liu!"
"Not at all, Your Highness!"
"I just know a little, you don't have to praise me."
I haven't exaggerated it.
Your fist is really marvelous.
"Of course, if my master's kung-fu wasn't good,"
I wouldn't be his student.
Shut up!
"Please excuse her, she's spoiled!"
She's right.
Well ...
- Liar!
It is in vain ...
That's nice of you.
Addons For question 2.
"In addition, compared with a tattoo on the back"
"Addons have pircing on the scrotum, created three years ago."
How nice ...
You know that I love.
- This is not good.
- Looks good.
"I'm not sure about that, Dave."
Addons For question 3.
Amy girl in the photo.
"Addons A student from France, study in the UK."
"Addons you know that last week, You slept with him."
Addons And you have to live with until the next morning.
"Addons you might have marked the night, But today you print anything."
Addons In short:
Tri and EMS in life and in the race.
A large dirt.
Addons
"- Jo, you are taking."

You're late!
The last 15 minutes..
"I've been a fucking roller coaster of emotions, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I lit some of this.
"I fired on my nerves damn you, you know?"
And there you are.
It's okay.
You've just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, bring me some of this strong Russian shit, girls."
"Okay, now where is that ... pump?"
Where's that?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...?
Yeah?
"Fuck you, no!"
This is it.
"This is it, yeah."
Okay.
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, we gotta get this little fucker in there."

I'm not in condition to do this.
"I'm sorry, I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.

What's wrong with his hand?
Who is he?
Is he a robot?
[Phone rings]
Hello?
Who is this?
"Oh, Detective Burris."
"No, it's all right."
I needed to get out.
What would you want with the dog?
"All right, then, but she's not here."
Hester took her to the vet.
You'll have to pick her up over there.
"No, just bring her here after."
And Mr. Burris?
Take good care of her.
[Dogs barking]
"Detective Burris, this dog's a pussy, let me tell you that."
There's no way that I'd ever make her a violent.
"When a dog acts like that, she's never going"
To have a killer instinct.
"Well, thanks a lot."
You just shot my best theory right in the ass.
"Come on, Greta."
"Let's go, girl."
Come on.
There we go.

Oh.

I never let anyone win.
I heard that you were in an accident...
How are you feeling...?
As you can see...
So you're okay...
I'm good.
I'm a little itchy.
This body has allergies.
So...
You have a lot of rocks in the house.
Oh...
It's a hobby of mine.
So people collect rocks too...
That's something.
Ouch!
You shouldn't be touching those...
These rocks represent my family
The large black one...is me.
The pretty white one is my wife.
The nice smooth one is Da Ran!
And this tiny little one...is Choong Sik!
"It's a rock family, a rock family!"
Dad rock...
Mom rock...
Child Rock!
"(The way it's pronounced, it sounds like Idol)"
Yeah...
"Well, since you're a part of our family too now...."
Let's find your own rock that we can put next to Da Ran together.
No thanks!
Why would I want that?
Shall we look for one?
A son-in-law rock?
"Yeah, well, I fucked up."
After that night on the bridge...
I blamed you for Jimmy.
"Yeah, I blamed me, too."
- I looked for you at the funeral.
- I couldn't deal with it.
An empty coffin like my mom's...
The river took half my family.
"It never gave them back, either."
I was wondering what happened to that picture.
"You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin."
All going to be cops.
- Brilliant idea.
- Look at us now.
I'm a dropout.
Jimmy's dead.
- And you're one of those...
- Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault what happened to Jimmy.
He had something wrong with him.
"He did, like my mom."
"Nobody noticed it, until he beat that suspect."
But I noticed it...
I never did anything about it.
You did the right thing.
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.
"- So, are you back now?"
- I'm back.
- You want to get something to eat?
"- No, I've got to meet a girl."
Danny...
Shit.
All the cameras are down.
Audio's on a separate file.
- Yeah.
- Pull it up.
Here.
Nothing.
What time was that?
- One hour ago.
- Earlier.
Fuck you!
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
Go back further.
We just gotta hold out a couple of hours till Emerson gets here and then I hope...
- Quiet!
- Get off of me!
- Where is she?
- Fuck you!
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
- Huh?
You must have gotten somebody else.
Nobody hates the army more than Klinger.
He's spent his entire career trying to get season tickets to Section Eight.
"Gee, I don't know."
"This Klinger... dark, hairy guy, big beak."
Let me see that.
"[Chuckles] When I saw him in the ""O"" Club... crying in his beer over some skirt named Laverne..."
[Fingers Snap] It was all over but the signing.
"Vickers, you're a vulture."
"Doctor, you operate your way."
I'll operate mine.
[Clicks Heels]
See ya.
"- ##[Jukebox. ""Harbor Lights""]"
"- Klinger, come on."
Get up.
- Huh?
- Get up.
The maid wants to put fresh linen on the bar.
"Oh, please."
"Didn't you read the ""Do Not Disturb The Dead"" sign?"
- This is no time to let a sleeping drunk lie.
- ## [Stops]
Oh!
Don't!
All I have left of Laverne is that song.
"Klinger, do you have any idea what you did last night?"
- Last night?
"- Last night, yeah."
- Last night.
- Last night.
But those days are done.
- Oh.
- Mm.
Huh.
"Well, I guess I'm not in control of everything, am I?"
"Funny, isn't it?"
"You can try and try, but in the blink of an eye..."
You can lose everything that matters to you.
"Dad, are you okay?"
Don't you all see what's going on here?
Dad really wanted that milk.
I almost lost you guys today...
All of you.
- Aw.
- Just like that.
"Aw, daddy."
"Oh, honey."
"You spent the whole day trying to control everything, and I spent the entire day trying not to, and neither way worked, did it?"
Nope.
"I may fight you on this, but I'm gonna need you to make me get rid of Jolene two."
- She's a biter.
- I know.
As soon as we're done with this hug.
"Hey, whatever this is, I need to get in on it."
I almost died today.
- Grandpa.
- Daddy.
"- Aw, dad."
- Hey.
Come here.
- Aww.
"- Come here, you."
"He is, but do you know him?"
"Of course, I do."
"He's incredibly kind, generous--"
My dry-cleaning guy is kind and generous.
Where's the prednisone?
Left bottom shelf.
I know him. I do.
Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it...

"And, of course, I'll stand up for you."

-Great.
-Okay.
"Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?"
-Sure.
-Walk with me?
All right.
"This young man, K.J. Thibeaux?"
You've been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.
Yeah.
"He got in the surgical floor storeroom, stole a digital video camera."

Get out of here.

"Dunkirk film, scene 17, take one."
"Good luck, Lieutenant Lundbeck."
Action!
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Come on, boy."
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there.
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 Kurz.
Best damn gun since the Win chester 73.
I'm most awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I've lost my line.
Cut.
Jesus.
Twenty-three takes.
We only stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War Office wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
And no one thought to give him a bloody screen test?
"Well, can't we replace him?"
This film has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
- He's the template.
"- If that lump of Yank stays, the film fails and the national case with it."
He is a brave boy.
Would you or I be so brave?
Is Mr. Baker all right?
- He lost one of his grandsons.
- Oh...
But don't think that's an end to this.
You and your bitch will regret this.
Mark my words.
- Right.
- OK.
I need a drink.
Aargh!
Hm.
Your name is reynolds and before that it was knealy.
"And you ain't never been no jones,"
- So get over it.
"- You'll never get it, will you, mama?"
You just don't understand.
"If it makes me act the way you've been acting all your life,"
- I hope i never get it!
"- Whatever, mama!"
And you know how you're always giving me those bible scriptures
And those quotes from famous people?
"Well, here's a bible scripture for you..."
"""The wealth of the wicked is laid upon the righteous."""
"Well, i am the righteousness of god."
"- Why didn't you give me that scripture, mama?"
- Oh.
Oh.
"God, forgive her."
"Oh, give me the strength."
"Hold me back, jesus."
Hold me back.
"Hey, it's me..."
Marcus.
Marcus!
Come in.
Shit.
"Okay, go to promo."
The breaking news appears to be...
"Higher, higher!"
"...That, ah, for some stupid reason"
I have become the suspect.
"Hey, easy flatfoot."
I am with child.
Ow!
Ten thousand years old...
I can't take this.
"Welcome to ""Ends of Days Exercise."""
"Let's start stretching, shall we?"
Breathe.
And breathe.
Breathe in the darkness and let out the light.
You're letting go of life.
Feel that stretch.
"And now that we are nimble, let's do some cardio."
Start running on the spot.
This is good;
"it makes us feel like we are only 1,000 years old."
Let's get your seven hearts beating.
"Let's get your heartrate to over 3,000 beats per minute."
"Coffee, miss Gablechuck?"
"No, thanks."
So I'm sure you've heard about Heather Weather?
"Yes, that she was murdered."
"No, that she'd been shaving her age."
She's really 62 years old.
"Wh- oh, um..."
I'm not surprised.
You asked how long we've been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes...
Alright.
- We met in a hospital.
- In a hospital?
Yea.
"It was that dull hospital over at Lexington, know it?"
No.
We were doctors.
"I mean, surgeons."
Violet tells me to say surgeons.
"Working at the hospital never gave me bad dreams, that's for sure."
"Anyway, she's my best friend ever."
I'm kinda worry about her sometimes though.
"Half the time, I wish I was more like her."
And then...
What?
I don't know.
She reminds me of my daughter.
Is that her on the phone machine?
But it's not important.
"It is, but... don't let it distract you."
- What's with that?
- What's with what?
The numbers you two have.
- This?
- Yes.
"Oh, that's our rank."
Officially I'm killer number Nine and Violet's killer number Eight.
And how do you move up?
Makin' hits.
Vi says it beats dead entries.
"No, no, that ain't the woman!"
I ought to know!
"- Curly ought to know, too."
"- You're screwy, Curly."
That's just somebody who looks like her.
"You ain't going to work the boy over, are you?"
"That all depends on you, Joe."
You wanna talk?
"Listen, boy- You're not mine, see?"
"They just think you are, see?"
"So no matter what they do to you, you can take it."
I know that you can.
"Just like your old man, see?"
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me go home to mother and dads!
"Don't let them throw you, Joey!"
Start him off.
"I think you'll decide to talk, Joe."
"Start walking, Sonny."
- What ?
- Get a move on!
Walk!
Pick them up!
Feet!
Feet!
"All right, my son."
Dad's at breakfast.
"You're not going to sleep all day, are you?"
"Oh, always throwing your things around."
Don't you want to eat breakfast ?
Paul!
Paul!
- Come on.
"- Oh, my goodness."
Are you getting tired?
You want me to wheel you?
- No!
- All right.
- Absolutely no.
- All right.
This is a big place.
Do you know where you're going?
When we come in the first building - You come into the building -
One second.
Could it be over there?
"- Yes, it must be."
- You think it might be there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause there's more than one entrance.
- But we're gonna look at them all.
"- Well, there's a fence there."
Let's have a look.
Do you see it here?
"- No, not here?"
"- It's downstairs, where you come in."
All right.
Let's go to the other entrance.
I think I know which one you're talking about.
This way.
- I'm thinking it might be along here.
- It's in the entrance.
"Well, let's - let's have a look here."
And he never even told me it was there.
- He didn't tell you?
"It's a quality mozzarella because it ""ooze-s miI-k""."
- What's it do?
- Oozes milk.
"It needs the pause, ""ooze-s miI-k""."
"Taste it, you won't be sorry."
- Acidic.
"- ""Acidi-c""."
Oopsy daisy!

"Make it fast, I don't want to miss the sunset."
"You know, when the sun goes down into the sea?"
hello Ma'am.
I came to say hello.
- I'II make you some good coffee.
- It's not forthat.
"Here you are, would you Iike some?"
"No, if I may, this time I'm bringing you something."
"It's a specialty from my area, smell the fragrance."
"- ""Invernizzi Gim""."
- It's gorgonzoIa.
- You'II like it.
- Thank you.
"It's soft gorgonzoIa, excellent for appetizers."
It should go in the fridge.
I'm off.
"- Wait, some coffee."
- Duty calls.
I have to work.
"Oh, come on."
Who'd check out some gorgeous hottie walking down the street?
- Thanks.
- I was talking about me.
Alex... there's no reason to get paranoid.
But just to be on the safe side...
- What?
- Just go with me on this.
Who was that?
No idea.
I'm really starting to like this hiding thing.
- Don't answer it.
- Not planning on it.
I have to answer it.
It's my assistant.
"Hey, Molly."
"Okay, calm down."
I'm on my way.
I have to go sign some contracts that were dropped off at my apartment by mistake.
Can we pick this up a little later?
It's not like I'm a faucet.
You can't just turn me on and off.
Step.
Step.
We're just going in there to pick up some documents.
Fine.
- And make out a little.
- Works for me.

"Scott, this is everybody."
"Everybody, you all know Scott-- the enemy."
Molly... you did all this for me?

"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
"- Aw, get out— - [Cloudy] Knock it off."
"- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."
- We don't need this.
"Now, cut it out, will ya?"
For Christ's sakes!
Alex looks nervous.
"Oh, God, I hope I'm doing the right thing."
I think you are.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the party is about to get started."
The dance floor is all yours!
"Okay, girls, lick your lips."

Your husband's a lucky guy.
- Mmm.
- Oh!

Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.
"Two more drinks when you get a chance, please."
That would be nice.
This looks delicious.
I'm so happy.
I can't believe he's married.
I can't believe he chose Claire over you.
- I can.
- I told you not to introduce them.
"Well, she already had a husband."
I thought it was safe.
- How are you handling all this?
- I've learned my lesson.
No more fantasies about good-looking men.
You never know.
There's a guy out there somewhere for you.
"Oh, yeah?"
Who?
What a pleasure.

What is this really about?
"Well, we're just trying to clarify the circumstances of your husband's death."
Troy had cancer.
He died.
Seems pretty clear to me.
Your client is a primary suspect in a murder investigation.
"Define ""cooperate."""
- No!
- Do you like them?
The Paki had me while I sucked off the black guy.
"By the way, his name is Lamin and he's really nice."
What shall I say at school?
My sister does porn.
- Why?
- Because I can't be a model.
- And I'm sick of school.
- Maybe I can buy up the negatives.
You think everything revolves around you.
"- Sofie, stay here!"
- There are more mags at the kiosk.
Sofie!
One more year.
Then you can do want you want.
Sofie!
"Mum, it's Sofie."
Listen.
Did you hear that?
It was your car.
You'll have to catch the bus to work.
- You fucking whore!
- I'm not a whore.
Fucking three darkies in a porn mag without telling me first!
Smashing up her car would have done the trick.
- You didn't have to do those photos.
- I did it for us.
So we could go to New York.
- Us?
We're through.
"- Don't go, Simon."
So I've also prepared a rundown...
This is yours... of possible artifacts still in the wild that might be responsible.
There's plane tickets and reservations for the Maximus and all that stuff.
"Vegas, baby."
Kicking it.
Where's the money?
"Well, we need to roll high."
"Yeah, there's $10,000 in Pete's envelope."
Snap!
- Doubt it.
Are you sure this...
- Get out.
Pack.
Boys.
Do me a favor.
"Yes, my liege."
I shall bring you receipts.
"Yeah, that too, but also, one more thing."
Is she mad at me?
Maybe.
A little.
"But look, a trip to Vegas will unbunch the pants."
It should be fun.
Please don't have fun.
"- Yeah, or crap out."
- That's so funny.
Later.
- So what am I doing?
- What do you mean what are you doing?
"Well, Leena told me Mrs. ""F"" was keeping you off the MacPherson trail, so it doesn't mean I can't look for him."
I'll say this once.
Listen.
"No, I've been trying to find a way for Scott to feed without killing ever since Mexico."
This could be his second chance.
What about those kids he killed?
Do they get a second chance?
[Carlos] Give me the goddamn bonds!
[pounding]
Come on!
"I'm coming, my little piggies!"
And I'm gonna make myself some chicharron de rinche!
Let's go!
"Go get 'em, cabrón!"
[sniffs]
[sniffs]
[Scott] Kate!
Get back here!
"They're too weak and hungry, they can't follow us."
Come on!
Stop!
What are you doin'?
Give me the bonds.
You're not gonna shoot.
"Look, I know it's hard to let family go."
"Just give me the bonds, or I swear to God the next one goes in your kneecap."
"Now, cuff yourself to the truck and throw me the keys."
Do it.
- You're making a huge mistake.
- No.
I am making up for one.
[slurping]
"[cracking sound] [grunts, gasps]"
Scott?
Scott.
Cut the nonsense.
Who was the man in the hat?
- I don't know who you mean.
- Where's Quini?
- I don't know.
- You're sick and he hasn't come to visit?
- I didn't tell him.
Why don't you call him?
- Mom!
"- Marina, look at me."
- Does your mom know what you do at the lodge?
- Mom!
- Tell us who the man is or we'll tell her.
- Mom!
- What is it?
- I don't feel well.
- My stomach hurts.
I'm going to throw up.
"- Honey, what's wrong?"
"Don't worry, ma'am."
We were just leaving.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.
Marina?
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?
Me neither.
She's scared and I'm going to find out why.
"There are five bedrooms, each with several beds."
I have extra beds if there are more of you.
There's room outside for the dogs.
"There's water, electricity..."
Good!
Yan.
"Yes, Send this picture to Ho Sai at once."
I want him to meet Foon in court.
"Master, why do you draw such pervertible picture?"
Do you feel happy?
"Brother Lone, we all count on you."
Please go ahead.
The witness must be bribed or threatened.
An eye for an eye!
I want to threaten them too.
Please find them out.
"And then torture them, make them confess."
Good idea.
How can you figure this idea out?
I...
I use my brain.
Don't worry.
Count on me.
"It's alright, count on me."
"Don't worry, count on me."
Brother Lone doesn't seems to be alright
"Your Honour, I would like to summon a new witness."
What big deal?
Your old man!
"Objection, how dare he scold my old man?"
"Come on, don't always object, can you listen his words first?"
Summon Sir Ho Sai.
I mean your dad!
This is my master.
Chan Mon-gut.
"Sir, thank you for your help."
Did you know everybody at this school?
"Got to watch where you're going, man."
"Leave him alone, Dirk."
"You never learn, do you, midget?"
"Get to the bus, Barry."
What's the matter?
You scared?
Don't worry.
I'll go easy on you this time.
"Come on, Lose-Chester."
Let's see what you got.
"Come on, freak!"
Freak!
You're not tough.
You're just a jerk.
"""Dirk the jerk."""
"""Dirk the jerk."" Yeah, that's pretty good."
Dirk the jerk.
"So, you were friends with Dirk?"
"Yes, sir, in high school."
I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman.
"Here, sit."
Sit down.
"When did, uh -- when did Dirk pass?"
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and then too many drugs."
And then he just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know?"
"Dirk, he, uh -- well, he had his troubles."
What kind of troubles?
What did you take?
What did you take?
No.
Aah!
No!
"How are your wrists, hon?"
I'm sorry they restrained you.
Lucy.
You've had another schizophrenic episode.
But we're gonna work on making you well.
"Lucy, why don't you introduce yourself to the group?"
"Hi, I'm Lucy."
I...
Obviously.
I go to law school.
- I went to law school.
- She's a schizo.
I saw them bring her in all strapped down and screaming.
Great.
"What'd you do, bite a cop?"
Bruce.
Okay.
"As if our party wasn't full enough with Chuckles, Forgetful, and Her Majesty here, now we add Schizo to the mix."
"Well, this isn't Club Med, so I doubt you're here for a tan."
"No, I, uh..."
I tried to:
Because I went off my meds.
Me too.
"Lucy, what do you think led you to make that decision?"
Um...
I wanted to prove to you that you were wrong.
Wrong about what?
Now listen.
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First things first, you're gonna put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
You want attorney-client privilege?
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it!
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it!"
That's it.
Come on.
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got's a 5.
- I'll take a 5!
"Come on, already."
Come on.
Be cool.
You're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates.
"Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment, all right?"
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
So if a prison shanking is completely off the table... and we're sure of that?
No shanking!
And I'll get you away from here.
"No, no, francis."
There's something else that you must do.
"Everything I did, I did for you."
You needn't remind me.
I need you to forget all of it.
What?
Everything I warned you of.
The warnings I gave mary.
"Go to her, tell her that I believe"
The two of you can be wed.
I don't understand.
Your fate has changed.
"Oh, what does it matter?"
You never believed
That nostradamus had the power
To see the future anyway.
What matters is that you love mary.
I did love mary.
You destroyed that.
Nonsense.
"She's with bash now, but she loves you."
You don't know that.
I don't know that.
What matters is what you want.
Is it mary?
Is it to save my life?
Is it the throne of France?
Is it the safety of your brothers?
"Say it, say it!"
I know it's true!
Yes.
"Son, I got a man outside with a bullet in his leg."
Do you want to help me with him?
"I'm not outside, friend."
I'm right behind you.
"That's a safe place to be, if you're not a liar."
Have any water?
No.
"No, I don't."
"We're some thirsty, ma'am."
If you could just spare us a half a cup apiece.
We got less than a gallon.
It's for the boy.
Tommy.
Mmm.
"Oh, that sure is good, ma'am."
Haven't you got any manners?
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"It's miss, not ma'am."
"Where's your family, menfolk?"
"Well, yesterday, some men..."
Tommy!
They dead?
"They're away, that's all."
The storm's keeping 'em away.
And the Apaches?
"No, the Mongoles and the Chiricahuas water here."
We live at peace with them.
Oh?
"You live at peace with the marauders, too?"
"- They water here, too?"
- Not until you drank.
You better get off that leg.
Jalon!
- Oh!
"- Oh, no!"
It's nice to see you...
Holy shit!
I haven't seen you since we got arrested at the army induction center in [Indistinct].
What are you doing now?
I'm a doctor.
Baby!
I sell convertible bonds for Baldwin and byrne.
[Laughter]
Sounds brilliant.
"Hey, um, who's your friend?"
This is Dalton...
He's a cop.
A cop... that's a good one.
You always did have a sense of humor.
"Hey, want a joint?"
[Giggling]
You know that I have not seen jalon...
For twelve years?
"Those were some times, huh?"
"Yeah, they, uh..."
They were some times.
But they were a little different for you than they were for me.
What do you mean?
"Well, uh, I was there, and you were here."
Were you really?
Where do you think I was...
Sarah Lawrence?
"What I meant was, I haven't been out with anyone who was in Vietnam before."
"Well, most people from scarsdale wouldn't have."
Filip!
He's not here either.
I found him!
"Here, quickly!"
Come on!
Help!
Let's bring him outside!
I couldn't extinguish it.
I think I might have given too big a dose.
Let me go!
Departure is in one hour.
Greetings to you all.
"- What is it, please?"
- A contemporary custom.
There.
I have a surprise for you.
A cake!
Right!
With Nasper-cream!
And that's not all!
The best is yet to come.
Watch and wonder!
"This is Adam Bernau's violin, about which he wrote in the Memoirs, that it was his companion throughout his entire childhood."
It's so moving to think that I'll have the chance to see the living Adam Bernau in less than 2 hours.
And on his 11th birthday.
I hope we'll only be there for 4 hours.
It seems unreal.
"When my parents boarded the spaceship, that seemed so unbelieveable too."
So many beautiful women!
"While I, idiotically..."
Prepare for start!
Shields off!
"- So, he's not your boyfriend?"
"- Mom, I barely know this person."
I don't know if I want to know this person.
"Well, then you haven't..."
What did you hear?
What did she tell you?
Nothing.
She didn't tell me anything.
Did she say I was sleeping with Jordan Catalano?
No.
"No, of course not."
No one said that.
- lt's just. I just wondered--
- She did.
I can't believe this. I can't believe this. I hate everyone.
Obviously I told my mother.
But all I said was you were hot for him.
Why did you even tell her that?
"Now, my mother thinks we slept together."
Okay.
Do you want my mother to call your mother...
and tell her you didn't sleep together?
I could do that.
- H i honey.
- Hey fag.
Go to hell.
Maybe later.
I have something for you.
is that perfume I smell?
"You know you are boring, don't you?"
- Turd head.
You need something?
By the way she was really upset with me.
And Rosa?
I couldn't go to Rosa's place because her husband was there.
You didn't tell me that.
Truth is I felt offended by the failure of my marriage.
That's why I stayed at the hotel.
So absurd.
"-Quite absurd, yes."
Do you have any children?
One daughter.
Sara.
She kept her too.
I think that's great.
You tell me why?
We had terrible conflicts about Sara.
I started showing myself weak and falling back..
And all of a sudden I had to ask for permission to see my daughter.
(Praying)
Follow me.
She's much better now.
Jacoba!
Don't bother her.
Jacoba.
Who's there?
-I'm Máximo.
Máximo?
Did you come here from school?
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know if your parents are at home or if they've left.
Have you eaten already?
"Jacoba, how are you feeling?"
Bad.

"Oh, don't stop!"
"Monsieur Chopin, you were in the middle of a miracle."
I'm not quite yet cured.
How did you get in?
Who are you?
I am your slave.
And you have summoned me with your music.
"Oh, yes."
I think I know who you are.
I have heard you described.
"Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers."
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.
- Play me one more piece and I'll go.
- This is ridiculously improper!
And frightening as well.
Please leave now.
"Still, I am content."
I've seen you at last.
And I am delighted to find you're not a man at all.
You're an angel.
"Hands, halo, wings... everything."
"Good night, my dream."
"My poor lady, you are a wreck."
I am a resurrected wreck.
Move over.

"Citizen Maurice, the prisoner is ready for execution."
- What?
"- They stole it, it's ours!"
"I'll show you.0100 years, for that pigeon!"
- Won't Elisa be pleased.
"- Yes, she will."
Mind you don't hurl it.
"Fly home quickly, to Elisa."
Tell her we're coming!
"I said I'd fulfil your every wish, right?"
"Yes, your Highness."
And I shall!
You saved my life.
But this will be my keepsake.
"Never take it off, I got it from the devil."
How did you know we wouldn't drown?
I can't swim.
"A miller and water, we're body and soul."
And I'm friends with a watersprite.
"I name you my highest commander,"
I'll give you a house in the city and every year on this day...
Isn't it enough?
Just tell me.
"No, your Highness"
I don't know what I'd do with that.
But if I can really have a wish...
Henry!
Elisa!
"Terry, come, quickly, daddy's back!"
Theresa...
Welcome home.
That's our pigeon!
Look...
- Henry's right.
"- You're out, too."
"- Hey, wait a minute, Henry."
We had a deal.
"I help you, we take it down together."
The deal's changed.
I don't want anyone else to die.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Who's going to die?
Since when did you become altruistic?
What the hell's going on?
It was a mistake to involve you.
Wait a second.
"You know who it is, don't you?"
Anyone else dies Henry and I am holding you personally responsible.
I work better alone.
Stay out of my way.
She's too powerful.
Henry!
That's great!
I mean that's just great.
So now I've got two of them running around the city.
He's doing it to protect us.
She's been watching him.
She's probably been watching him all night.
She?
And he's figured out who it is and he's protecting her.
The woman behind the vampire...
Christina.
And who the hell is Christina?
Trouble.
Yes. thank you.
I'm sorry about what i said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's chuck?
It's over... once and for all.
But i'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
You know everyone else is here.
Yeah...
Everyone's here.
Oh it's beaufiful
It looks so good on you.
Oh!
i've dreamed about this for so long.
Do you want to fire it up?
I can't. blair and I have a meeting at rouge tomate.
Huh. that's cryptic.
Both.
So how are you today?
Miserable.
But at least college
Will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.
No chuck No nate.
No anybody really.
Except gossip girl.
Forget I said that.
It's okay.
I read them too.
"""Spotted--chuck bass in france. chuck bass in germany."
"Chuck bass in italy."""
I hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him.
Open your present.
"W-Well, you see..."
Would you like some food?
It's my mum's birthday today.
She's even got lots of food stalls.
Really?
.
"Hold on, you two."
We can't go about accepting handouts.
"I'm King Pilaf, you know?"
Aw...
Oh well.
"If you say so, Pilaf-sama..."
Is that so?
Okay then.
Y-You fools.
You're too obedient.
How about going against my orders sometimes and bringing me back a bit?
.
It's all tasty.
"Well, if you insist, I guess I'll have to eat it."
Delicious.
You two dig in as well.
Pilaf-sama.
Even 150-fold gravity has outlived its purpose...
"Excuse me, Vegeta-sama?"
Leave.
You're interrupting my training.
"B-Bulma-sama called, she wants you to come to her birthday party."
Just go away already.
Tell her I'm not going to any such thing.
Vegeta.
"What's going on in that head of yours, not coming to your pretty wife's birthday party?"
What?
You know who that is?
You may have met Ted and Alma.
- Ted is still -
"- Oh, I know them."
You know them?
Ted is still volunteering up on the palliative care.
- I knew them very well.
- Yes.
Okay?
So you know some of these people?
Um -
This is the original deed... for the house down on Cecil Street... in 1918.
"It was found recently, and we've had it framed to go with the photographs."
Okay?
That's where Baycrest came from - a house all those years ago.
- And my husband's somewhere here too.
- Yep.
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
This is the auditorium.
- And -
- That should be him.
I should remember this.
[Chattering]
And this is the gift that Al gave us.
He gave us all these photographs that you see here.
All the way down the walls.
Look.
But you come and have a look here.
"- Now - - [Ida] Oh, for goodness' sake."
How do ya like that one?
- You're so easy.
- Shh...
I've got another announcement.
I've got a placement with Grolier  Gaunt.
"Hey, well done, dude."
"Six months in Edinburgh, starting in September."
Edinburgh.
It's the top six practice.
"Oil rights, shipping, all the high-powered clients."
"It's in Scotland, Paul."
"Smile, everyone!"
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
It's only a train ride away.
At least not America or something.
- You could have spoken to me first.
- Yeah.
"Uh, no, I just found out this afternoon."
"But look, look, look, you're right, I should have got you alone."
"- What's up, guy?"
- Cue the lap dog.
"Ah, Lukesta, what's up bro?"
So...
- What've you got for us?
- I've got all sorts.
How's about a drop of the white stuff to kick us off?
"- Paul first, definitely."
"- Oh, no, I shouldn't do it."
"- Well, that's the whole point, mate."
- Yes.
- Go on.
- Okay.
- Been a good night?
"Hey, is this Burton falling's office?"
Is this Burton falling's office?
"Yes, it is."
What do you want?
What do you care?
Bitch.
"It was good to see you again, Liz, and, um, I'm sure"
Jake will do a great job for you.
He's a very bright young man.
"Well, I appreciate this, Burton-- aunt Liz?"
Ohh...
Nicholas?
Ohh!
"My goodness, look at you."
It's been a long time.
Yeah.
You look great.
Heh heh heh!
And I see that you've met my son Jeremy.
Judge:
"I am sentencing you to 1,500 hours of community service."

"Me, too."

But I'm not gonna let you do it.
I can't let anyone else die because of me.
No one else is gonna die because of you.

And if she doesn't?
Then...
Then...
"Then if she doesn't, we figure it out."
Together.
You know I'm just one person.
I'm not worth it.
"No, you are worth it."
You are worth it to me.
I love you.
JEANINE: ...plays a critical role in maintaining the social order.
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack.
This city may be safely enclosed behind a vast wall.
"What an interesting palm you've got, Christine."
Can you read palms?
A bit.
"This line here, for instance, means lots of love but not every love is a happy love."
So?
Tell me.
I don't know enough about it.
I might frighten you.
Why?
is it scary...or dangerous?
I see more loves in your present life than just me.
There's someone else...
Tell me I don't mind.
Yes.
I see a young man.
He's beautiful.
Yes.
He lives in... I see letters.
"K, and O with dots on top..."
is that German?
"Yes, Köln, or Cologne is where he lives."
You're really good at it.
"If you want me to go on, I need something tangible of his."
Something tangible?
- A key or a lock of hair or...
- A letter.
- Could work.
You got one?
- l'll get it.
- Here.
"- No, I don't want to read it."
Or you'll think it's all a trick.
Splendid.
- Your time's running out.
"- Uh, I think it was closer to the waterfall."
"You see, I buried it at night, and I..."
Find it!
Yes.
- Roger!
- Babs.!
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't.
It was too dangerous.
You might get hurt.
Oh.
Terrific idea.
"Now, look, you better find it or..."
You buried the money here?
A year ago.
Only everything's changed so much I haven't been able to find it.
"I'm not a thief, Babs."
Well...
Really I'm not.
It was just so tempting.
But I decided to turn it in for the reward money.
Only I had to find it first.
And today's the only day I could get in here without making everyone suspicious.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Even if you wanted to keep the money and be a thief.
Just tell me you wanted to marry me.
Of course.
Didn't you get my proposal?
The postcard.
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Come on, come on!"
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!
You bought your fucking button!
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!
Keep him here!
"Come on, you fuckin' feel strong?"
I'm sorry.
Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
"He don't mean any disrespect, Henry?"
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid a little fuckin' manners!
"Hey Jimmy, what's right is right."
-You understand what I'm talkin' about?
-lt's alright.
"The kids over here, we're hugging and kissing over here and then 2 minutes later he's acting like a fucking jerk."
"No, no, no, nah."
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order yourself.
-l didn't.
-You insulted him a little.
-l didn't insult nobody.
Give us a drink.
-Okay.
"Come on, let's have some drinks, alright?"
Books?
Butterfly knife?
"Yeah, Dean."
- You okay?
- Sure.

"I mean, look, this is the third school we've been to this year, and it's only November."
I'm just sick of always being the new kid.
You'll be fine.
"If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know."
Relax.
"Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops."
"As soon as he gets back, we're out of here."
To another school.
Awesome.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Sam Winchester."
"Hi, Sam."
"Class, say hello to our new student, Dean Winchester."
"Dean, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?"
"Not really, sweetheart."
Take your seat.
Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?
Not really.
Okay.
"Uh, grab a seat."
"Whoa, that's yours?"

"Don't need 'em, sugar."
Not gonna be here long enough anyway.

Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.

I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
Andwedo it my way.
"Thankyou,Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please...you have to tell him.
I've only seen him a few times...
Why?
You think this is related to the murder case?
Maybe.
I began to believe that two of victims were part of a Satanic cult.
What?
We found another body few days ago...
Same M.O. The victim was completely drained of blood...
But there were bite marks on the victim's neck.
Small ones.

"The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but.... ...Hey."
...Hey.
You... have to invite me in.
It's your home
What if I don't...?
Why can't you just come in...?
Is there something in your way...?
No!
- Yes.
- Go!
- OK!
- Spend a good night?
-Yes.
"I bought a good one, boyo!"
"- What's up, Felix?"
"- Nothing, pal!"
- Did you make move?
- I'm on Gemma.
"Want a teammate, anything wrong?"
That's not true as you said.
The set is definitely not gold.
No matter how much we might want him to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area that I maybe help you out.
"My side, honey."
"Come on, I'm so excited."
Anyway you like!
"Hi, Gemma."
"- Hello, Felix."
- Can we talk?
Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you are my league, but I thought it out just because it worths me."
As what?
If you would like to go out with me sometime.
Something like a coffee or a film.
Sit.
Paul?
I do not think of you in the same way as you expect.
But I'm sure there's someone else helps it out.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.

"All due respect, I am the best equipped to go."
How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
Why would you...
I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
It's me.
I'm going and I'm not going to fail.
You're new here.
It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
You got anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
Or Hook?
Hey!
Come with me.
This.
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
And your sword.
How strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
I set the thing up already for tomorrow.
"What do you mean, tomorrow?"
Connor offered.
It's a vacation home-
- Connor?
The reason why I have two strikes is because your brother is incompetent.
He's reckless.
"All right, he can't read."
Hey.
I looked over the plans and they look good.
Okay?
Easy.
All right.
"Okay, after this, it's our last one."
This time for real.
Our last one.
I should have listened to you.
"We should have stopped a long time ago, but I kept..."
Ollie!
What?
He won't work with you again.
We're doing this job without you.
Shit.
"All right, let's go over this again."
All right.
7:00 AM we leave from here.
8:30 we arrive at the house.
I back the van all the way up to the front.
"8:35, you pick the lock, and open the side door."
Okay.
"Blair keeps the van running', and you and me load up."
Good job.
Who are you?
I'm me.
And what are you not?
A sheep.
Right.
And what does a sheep go?
Marcus?
I love you.
Look.
"I love you, too."
"""I love you, Marcus!"""
Love you!
Look at him!
"While I couldn't accept the offer to become their child's godfather I did allow them to set me up with Angie, a rather beautiful coworker of Christine's."
"They had, however, being them, neglected to tell me one thing."
There's something you don't know about me.
Yeah?
Something exciting?
"I think so, yes."
I have a 3-year-old boy.
"I wanted to throw the napkin on the floor, push over the table and run."
Brilliant.
I love kids.
Yeah.
I like messing about with them.
Doing kid things.
I'd have been disappointed if you didn't have a child.
Why do you say that?
God knows.
Mainly because it sounded smooth and winning.
Because I love kids so much.
They're so lovely.

The morning's work for the young Jenny.
After a wild night.
Wait for me at 4 o'clock at the front door.
The means to an end.
Clothes make the man.
How to find a REAL life ...
An agonizing wait.
I'm only asking you to do it so that you can have the success you deserve.
Every bit of it.
Blake Carrington's a very smart man.
He'd know the difference.
Not if you control yourself.
Just joking.
"Now, don't be upset."
I thought you loved me.
"I'm sorry, it was-"
It was only an idea.
Bad idea.
You're right.
Sleeping with him is too risky.
"Anyway, I want you for myself."
Believe that.
Oh.
L.B.
What are you doing here?
"It's the man's birthday today, and that kiss was his present."
That damned kid.
He follows me everywhere.
What if he tells somebody about what he just saw?
"That is a problem, isn't it?"
"Well, why don't you just see to it that he doesn't?"
Mother.
Welcome home.
Adam.
Mm.
I can't tell you how proud I am of you.
And happy to be working together again?
Yes.
"Oh, what have we here?"
"- Well, that's unnecessary."
"- Oh, she's right, baby."
"If you had worn these things in college, even I wouldn't have slept with you."
"And, if you recall, I was good to go."
(BARNEY LAUGHS)
"No one, I mean, no one could get laid wearing these."
(BARNEY LAUGHING)
Challenge accepted.
"I, Barney Stinson, being of sound mind and amazing body, will wear these overalls until I have sex with a woman."
- I actually dated that guy.
- Yeah.
- (LILY SIGHS)
- Okay.
Quick game plan.
"Maggie shows up, couple minutes of hugs and ""Hi"" s and then everybody's out of here."
This is my one shot.
I am not gonna screw this up.
Who'd you get to cover your class tonight?
- Crap!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Hey.
- (LAUGHS) Hey.
"Oh, my goodness."
"- Hey, stranger."
- Hey.
"- Maggie, this is my roommate, Robin."
- Hey.
- (GIGGLING) Hey.
Nice to meet you.
"- (GIGGLING) Nice to meet you, too."
"Um, I totally forgot I have to teach a class tonight."
Hey!
- Quarter page in the local paper.
- I like!
(Phone rings)
"Anderson  Millington, how may I direct your call?"
"Hello, Scott?"
Lyle?
"I'm sorry, who is this?"
"Er, it's Scott."
"Sorry, it's a bad line."
- Is everything all right?
"- Yeah, everything's fine."
Got to go!
(Dial tone)
(Owl hoots)
(Hums to classical music)
Mm.
"- Oh, where have you been?"
"- Oh, out on the tiles."
And I had a little look around Janet Cramer's rooms.
Simon!
"Just, you know, to see if I could cut the Gordian knot."
By breaking and entering?
!
"Oh, that's what we do now, is it?"
"Not breaking and entering, more easing and entering."
That's not the point.
"The missing research wasn't there, but this was."
Mary Goodyear's will.
"Don't worry, it's a photocopy."
Cramer won't know.
"That is so far from being my objection to what you've done here, Simon."
There's no mention of research.
"Hell, that's some vocabulary you got, kid."
Spite.
"Ill will, vengeance."
"Vengeance means revenge, Miller."
"I'm sure you know what revenge means, don't you?"
I'm onto you Miller.
"Despite your stupid jokes, you secretly blame me for the accident."
"New car, or not, you despise me for it."
How did you get into my place?
Duplicate keys?
Credit card?
What?
"Fuck you, Miller!"
This shit's gonna stop!
"Get off my property, punk!"
Bastards.
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
7-4... 3-C-R-N.
743CRN.
What?
Shit.
Fuck!
"I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide... motorist information to the general public."
I'm not just a member of the general public.
This guy is a friend of mine.
But you don't know your friend's address?
"We just met, I don't know him that well."
"Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service."
I just want talk to him.
"No, you listen to me, sweetheart, okay?"
"I am coming to Fort Lauderdale, and when I get there,"
"I am gonna find you and I am going to [Bleep] you so [Bleep] hard, you..."
Mmm.
I knew you were a bad guy.
This is where I come to be bad.
I'm a good guy. [Chuckles]
Ah.
"Good guy, bad guy, it's all perception."
Me?
I say I'm just a woman.
You say I'm exceptional woman.
- I never said that.
"- Yes, you do."
I see how you look.
"No, I look."
I don't say that.
"Yeah, but, you know, in my village,"
I'm just average woman.
Like fourth most attractive sister in family.
Bullshit.
Don't buy that story for a second.
Okay?
Yeah.
"You are, objectively, the most attractive woman in every village."
[Clicks tongue] Aw.
There are no absolutes.
"No, there are absolutely absolutes, okay?"
Vinyl?
Absolutely overrated.
Dr. Rob?
Absolutely super-duper rich.
- Then what's in Algeria?
- Nothing.
But you just started to say something about Algeria.
Nothing.
We were kids in Algeria.
I don't remember a thing.
Everyone only asks about her.
"""Pretty Jonah, pretty Jonah."" What about me?"
Why don't you ask about me?
What if I'm sick?
Are you sick?
"And where's your husband, Dorona?"
Why isn't he there?
And why don't you let your father mourn with you?
Was it nice of you to throw apples at him?
Did you hear that?
I'm going to bed.
I'm going to shower.
I'm going to die.
What now?
Nothing-Count me out-.
"I'm an orphan, I don't want to be a bastard, too."
What's up?
- Is Natanel here?
"- Yeah, over there."
Do you always have to be late?
I have a teachers' meeting.
- You brought water from home?
- Yeah.
Happy?
"Watch what you breathe, the air here isn't kosher."
"Cut the religious crap, Natanel."
You can do anything you put your mind to.
What would you have done if I wasn't here?
"- You don't like to talk much, do you?"
"- You don't have that problem, do you?"
No.
"No, I talk all the time."
I'm a flibbertigibbet.
"That's what my English teacher, Mrs Wilson, calls me."
"""Tillie Hansen, you are a flibbertigibbet."""
Sounds like a noise a chicken would make.
Mrs Wilson kinda looks like a chicken.
- How come you ain't screaming?
- I am.
You just can't hear me.
"- All right, that's enough."
- One more stitch.
- Don't argue with me.
- One more stitch.
Just tie that off.
Pull it through.
Tie it right there.
Jeez!
All right.
"Here, get..."
Just put that on.
- Here.
- All right.
That's it.
"Come on, easy!"
Do it tight.
"What was that you were saying before to yourself, ""You're one of a kind""?"
I sometimes hear my mother talking to me.
Please accept... to pay them all this morning.
Good!
And so it shall be.
"Get behind me, sons of Fakoli."
You deserve a tribute...
O worthy son of your father.
What about the house?
"The sand's been delivered, the other materials are on their way."
Noumouké has promised it by the end of the month.
"Hurry up,"
German and French experts are coming.
Don't worry.
Hurry up!
Where's Diarra?
He's been arrested.
For lack of papers.
And where is he now?
I don't know.
What's the problem?
One of my workers has been arrested.
And I don't know why.
What's his name?
1000 FM to set him free.
I need him free.
You'll get an ID card.
"Thank you, brother."
"Come on, Diarraké."
Nobody's taking my son away!
I am!
"Then, I'll pursue you forever!"
What's going on?
"This witch is after me every day, we're going home to solve the problem."
It's ridiculous.
Maybe it's a sign you have to keep it.
"No, Mum."
"It's not a sign, I'm going to sell it."
Again.
Are you serious?
Are you selling this car?
"Ah, yeah."
Sold.
Sorry?
I'm buying it.
It's... it's got rust.
"Yeah, of course it does."
What car this old doesn't have rust?
"Tom, can we take it out?"
"What was it, Tom?"
"""Nice smile, mentally stable."" Ssshh."
I don't want to listen to another word.
Previously on The Fosters...
I gave the money to Ana so she'd change her story.
- You bribed her?
- I'll tell the DA.
"- I want $10,000."
- That freaking woman.
I could kill her.
You are gonna stay as far away from that woman as possible.
You saw Ana Gutierrez in an argument the night that she went missing?
- Is this the guy?
"- Yeah, this is the guy."
- Donald isn't my dad?
- Not according to the birth certificate.
"Ifyou don't tell me whereJeffrey is, this is your funeral."
Throw this garbage away.
- Give me the money!
- Are you sure you still got bullets?
You wanna bet?
"Jeffrey said, always save one last slug."
"Either foryourself, oryour enemy."
Hurry!
Turn around!
Goddamn it!
Get him!
Promise me one thing:
"If I don't make it, take me to a hospital."
Have them save my corneas forJenny.
Ifthat's impossible... organize my money and send her abroad for surgery.
Don't think like that.
It's the first decent thing I've ever done.
Will you help me?
What's that noise?
"Who is it,Jeffrey?"
Sidney.
Here's your money.
I fought for it like a man.
This is my last tribute to a friend.
"Sidney, you didn't have to do this."
He said I was a dog.
Now I'm not sure if I'm human or a dog.
"Sidney, nobody can call you a dog."
Sidney!
Sidney!
Sidney!
Am I a dog?
- He had killed them both.
Do not listen.
Addons
- Do not think about and ...
- Back to the cabin now.
Addons
- Or your lovely wife will die.
- No!
Addons Back in the cabin or I cut off your head.
Do not listen.
Stop!
"Addons I want to see again, this video."
Addons Before you die.
Addons I think that at least once to feel ...
Addons That you are guilty.
"Addons But it seems that I'm asking too much, final quality of your account."
I remember him.
He went by himself.
Addons Lucy Turner.
Addons Age: 15 years.
Addons You were there.
Addons you all.
"Online Addons, see what happens."
"Addons you must beat all the competitors, and Gwen are the worst."
Addons A false holiness.
A hypocrite hiding behind religion.
Addons Dave really enjoys his suffering ...
Addons and ridiculed it.
"And when it decided to publish it,"
Addons friend Rory also commented.
Addons This kid has a big mouth.
Addons now calmer.
I took care of his...
Why did you want to kill Serena?
I didn't... get...
Why?
Hey.
"Hey, hey."
"Listen, look at me."
Look at me.
Why such a frowny face?
We just beat fate's ass to the ground.
Guy on the motorcycle...
"DeBray could have a partner, and the partner could have shot him to stop him from talking."
"Hey, Cupcake!"
Tell the lady what you just told me.
We tracked the bike.
Registered to a David Loquasto.
He was in here earlier today to I.D. the jewelry.
His sister was the fifth victim.
I've never seen either of these.
"We couldn't stop the man who killed his sister, so he took care of it."
See?
"You still holding me, Captain?"
Case closed.
What'd I tell you?
Not a partner.
Revenge.
My baby's gonna live.
Yeah.
Long enough to turn into a teenager and make you wish otherwise.
Don't forget about Mimi.
She didn't die.
No.
Yes.
- Who is she?
- Gohar's daughter.
"No, the one I'm talking about is a poet."
What's your name?
Can't you tell me?
It doesn't matter.
"Okay, I'll recite a poem to you."
It will occupy us while you milk.
You won't answer me?
Go ahead.
I was saying that...
"""ln my nighh, so brief, alas"
"""The wind is abouh ho meeh hhe leaves."""
Do you understand that?
The two are meeting.
It's like when you went to see Yossef.
At the well.
At the well?
Bravo.
"""My nighh so brief is filled wihh devashahing anguish."
"""Hark!"
"""Do you hear hhe whisper of hhe shadows?"""
Do you understand the shadows?
That means darkness.
"""This happiness feels foreign ho me."
"""l am accushomed ho despair."
"""Hark!"
Do you hear hhe whisper of hhe shadows?
"""There, in hhe nighh, somehhing is happening."
"""The moon is red and anxious."
"""And, clinging ho hhis roof hhah could collapse ah any momenh,"
"Daddy, are you coming to eat?"
- Hold on.
Why do I have to deal with replacing them 3 weeks after the show opened?
"Okay, bye."
Cups.
We got a new announcer today.
Slava Silkis.
He was a very political broadcaster in Leningrad.
"I think they're afraid of taking the risk, so..."
You're not even listening.
I'm listening.
"Slava Silkis, was a very political broadcaster."
"Now I want the lemon, please."
Cut her some lemon.
I'm doing the rice.
"Anyway, Slava Silkis said to tell you he saw the show."
"He hardly understands Hebrew, but enjoyed it immensely."
Let them wait.
Yes.
But I said I was coming.
Bye.
So you spoke with Slava Silkis about the show.
I'm not talking about that anymore.
But you said he saw the show.
- It doesn't matter now.
"Okay, it doesn't matter."
"Goni, the salad."
You have to mix it well after you add the lemon.
It's been mixed enough.
No!
- Goni.
Ora.
I know you told Serena you love me.
Serena heard wrong.
Last year you told Nate.
This year you told Serena.
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is gossip girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip girl can be right about you all she wants
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
Chuck Bass...
I love you.
I love you so much...
It consumes me.
I love you...
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me
Then everything we've done--
All the gossip and the lies
And the hurt
Will have been for something.
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Oh my gosh.
Do you remember the casbah?
That concert?
Barely...
In the best way.
Now I understand why that ACP let me go.
So that the Boss can kill you?
So what are you waiting for?
Come on kill me.
Not even your father...
Don't speak about my father!
Because I can endure anything.
But I can never endure anyone abusing my father.
'I can endure anything.'
'But if anyone abuses my father.'
'I cannot endure that.'
Brother!
I'm your brother.
I want to hug you bro.
But... the rascal on the left keeping an eye on us.
Look.
Dad.
The Boss has Shiv in his grip.
Yes.
He's too good.
Now play along with me.
But I can't act.
That's the problem with you new-comers.
That's why I've come prepared.
Look.
Take a good look.
Look.
- This is the lion's paw.
- Yes.
If that's a paw... then I have a strong hand.
And when I pound someone with this... he never gets up again.
Strong arm!
You're damn straight I did.
"I endorsed your reinstatement, Ranger."
That means you shit the bed and I gotta clean the sheets now.
"Thing is, sir, captains don't endorse reinstatements."
- They don't?
- Nope.
"I don't know who the hell you are, but you sure as shit ain't Chance Holbrook."
[laughs]
"Well, you got me there."
"Déjà vu, Rinche?"
You son of a bitch.
Holbrook was a good man.
"Ooh, are you sure about that?"
Because he was going to finger you for Tony's murder.
[grunting]
"- Come on, come on..."
"- Hey, hey!"
"- I wouldn't do that, Kate."
- Scott...
Agh!
"Holy shit, you shot me!"
[grunting]
Let's go!
Come on!
[grunting]
"- [pounding on door] - [Carlos] Open up, rinchesito!"
"It's too late, Carlos."
Your boss already took the key.
It is useless without the map.
"Hand over the bonds, because I am not leaving without them."
"Well, then I guess you're not leaving."
[loud grunt]
- So I'll call you?
- All right.
- Is Stanislav at his work?
- Yes.
Too bad you didn't bring Irishka.
I've missed her so much!
Your glasses gave me a fright.
Thought something's wrong with your eyes.
"No, I'm all right."
"To hell with them, take them off!"
"Here, Shurka sent you a note."
She had a baby at last!
A swell boy!
Could hardly deliver him.
It's about dress patterns.
And she wants a necklace for the New Year.
"- Here, have an apple."
"- I don't want it, mama."
"- What about you, young man?"
- Merci.
What's the matter with you?
"Oh, what are you doing, mama?"
Why did you have to smear it all?
I smeared it all!
Goodbye!
"The general, we rode together."
Handsome man!
Came to inspect exercises.
And in my compartment was the chief engineer of a fishing factory!
About my age.
"I nicknamed him ""a man with a mustache""."
He got a mustache like a cube!
"Well, you can't."
You can't just ask her like that.
- Why not?
"- It would be terribly rude, asking someone if money is theirs."
That would be so embarrassing!
"Rubbish, Basil."
"Hello, Fawlty Towers."
Polly Sherman?
"Yes, certainly, I'll get her straightway."
Hang on.
Polly!
"Terry, where's Polly?"
In there.
- She saw you with the money!
- What?
She saw you counting the horse money!
She's just coming...
"oh, hello, dear."
Here she is.
Found her in here.
"As I was just saying, Polly, my wife would like a word with you about a slightly delicate matter."
"It's not delicate, Basil."
Don't be silly.
He thinks it's embarrassing for me to ask you about that money I saw you with earlier on in the office.
I wondered if someone had handed it in.
Mrs. Richards has lost some.
The money?
In the office?
"You were counting it, weren't you?"
Did someone hand it in?
"Oh, no."
"No, it's mine."
"Cover him, Ria."
Mr. de Vries... you're a doctor.
Mr. Reve!
Calm down.
What a shame we have to meet here.
Tension gauge.
Life takes strange turns.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
That's why matters of life and death interest me.
Bloem!
"Thinking of death I cannot sleep, remember?"
How is he?
How's Herman?
- He's in very bad shape.
- Dead?
Yes.
A friend of yours?
A relative?
The fourth man!
I told him but he wouldn't believe me.
"Doctor, the liver."
"Now Herman can go into a vase too, he can..."
- Enlarged but intact.
- Normal reflexes.
- She's done it again.
- You've had a lucky escape.
But she's done it again the fourth man.
She takes him like a spider a spider also fucks her mate and then devours him... dead!
Quite a shock for you.
"Keep on talking, it'll settle you down."
"She's a spider, a witoh."
She leads men to ruin.
Hey.
Constantino and those trucks are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
"20 minutes, give or take."
"Tell me you have a plan, a really good one."
"Hey, I need to borrow your tank."
It won't fire.
"I told you that, right?"
There's not a single round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
"Uh, the throttle's there on your left."
"And to steer, you're just gonna..."
Hey.
This is not my first time.
Jake.
Good luck out there.
Yeah.
"You, too."
"Any minute now, huh?"
Yeah.
"I'm, uh..."
"You know, he's here, watching."
"You know that, right?"
They still doing the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
"Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop."
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
"But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss."
Is...
Something wrong?
Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I... which is why this is gonna hurt."
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles... you make a good Batman.
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please... you have to tell him.
"It's okay, your baby's fine."
Not...
The baby.
He killed Sean.
"Honey, the police know."
They don't...
They didn't see it.
I can do that?
Why not?
I'm Executive Producer.
"Yes, you are."
[funk music playing]
Mmm.
"Oh, yeah!"
"So I said to him, I said, uh, ""So what's your angle?"""
"Talking 'bout, ""Why I gotta have an angle?"""
[laughter]
"I said, ""Because you one angling motherfucker, that's why."""

"If I buy a girl a drink, it means I want to fuck her."
"You paid for my entire haul of liquor, plus money owed."
"Cards on the table, Barton, I'm not that good a fuck."
Not according to your current business model.
What do you want?
"I want what you need, a business partner."
Hm.
"I saw this, uh, nature documentary."
It's about buzzards.
They can smell their next meal from a mile a way.
- Hm.
- A mile.
"But from ""Niggerville"" all the way up to Sunset Boulevard?"
[laughs]
What?
Fucking what?
"When I was leaving the bar that night, all I could think about... was the time you tipped over the Porta-Potty while I was in it."
W...
Okay.
Fuck me.
I was an asshole to you when we were kids.
"But we're not fucking kids anymore, Pete."
I could lose my fucking career over this.
"- Yes, you are."
- What?
- Still a kid.
- What are you...
What?
I might have slashed your tire.
"That's shitty, but it's what I did."
What I didn't do was make you beat the piss out of that kid.
Who are you?
[door opens]
What the hell is wrong with you two?
Nothing.
It was all a misunderstanding.
"You're family, for Christ's sakes."
There's nothing in the world more important than that.

- Fucking animal.
Eddie:
Marius?
Eddie?
Wait a minute.
How'd you get a phone?
I told Karolina if I didn't talk to you that I was out.
He sees you and loves you.
Where is our mother?
Don't you know yourself when you have to urinate?
We can't help you with that.
Hello?
Untie me.
Now clean the bed.
Take the sheets off.
"Come on, get them off."
Elias?
Where is our mother?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
All right.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play the game again.
I will talk again to Lukas.
Lukas will live again.
"I'll make breakfast for the both of you, ready your clothes."
"We do everything again, as before."
But you have to believe me that I am your mother.
And you honestly want to do that?
I promise.
Elias ...
It's not your fault that Lukas died.
The accident was not your fault.
Do you really believe her?
She's lying.
Let her prove that she is our mother.
What do I do now?
What is Lukas now doing?
But I can't see him!
- Where?
I can't see you.
Come down to the beach and walk to the left.
Left?
Towards the inlet?
"Yeah, turn left and straight on."
Hurry up.
"Okay, be right there."
You told him to walk down that way?
"Yes, in the meantime we should go back to our rooms."
It feels so weird.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
I see nobody here.
Keep on walking to the end of the beach.
All the way to the end?
Yeah.
It's so wonderful.
I'm hearing so much about films from Director Kim.
Keep on walking and you'll see us.
"Alright, wait for me."
Okay.
What is it?
A splinter?
I think so.
I'll poke it out where there's light.
"Yeah, thank you."
Let's tell him that I vomited.
That I got a bad stomachache.
And we had to run to the pharmacist so that's why we missed each other.
Are you worried?
"Okay, we'll do as you say."
"Rose, I came by your office today for lunch, but you weren't there."
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.
"Rose, he's a friend of mine, but you have to watch out for him."
"Believe me, I'm not his type."
He has trouble controlling himself.
- Oh.
- What?
What?
What?
- Did you pull something?
- I think so.
Right here.
A little lower.
Lower.
Closer to the spine.
There.
"Oh, yeah."
Lean back into it.
I thought you might like to meet me in Europe after your classes end.
We never had a honeymoon.
That's right.
I would love that.
- Would you?
- Mmm.
- Am I pressing too hard?
"- No, but I'm all sweaty."
And I have to floss.
"When you've got to floss, you've got to floss."
"Claire, I don't know how to ask for it."
"We're so polite, I feel like we're roommates in a charm school."
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
"Oh no, no thanks I'm cool."
You smoke too much Jivers way too much.
What?
It's all natural Organic.
No chemicals.
Is this new?
It is.
It's about a girl.
Who's it about?
That blonde?
Blonde?
No.
No blondes.
"There ain't no words that I can say, cause words would just get in the way."
"But it is written in the wind,"
"This is where it all begins,"
I've been dreaming you right.
I've been holding every night
Now you're wanting me to stay.
Keeps getting better everyday.
Everyday.
I'm so happy I could cry
I think about it all the time.
I'm so happy I could cry
I just can't get you off my mind
I found the reason for living
I found the reason for love.
I found the reason for living
Later.
So how is Jill's wedding coming along?
Um it's pretty good.
There's a bit of drama though.
On the double!
"Well, at least the search is on."
- Is that everyone?
- One more.
Stiller.
He's bringing the mail from Pasco.
He knows to keep his eyes open.
Got about two hours of light left.
What a mess.
Then let's go down the cliff.
- Why do you do that?
"- We can't make it, that's why."
Those wolves are gonna hang around.
"Anyway, we were dead the minute the engine quit."
- I didn't wanna say anything.
- Why talk that way?
- It's the truth.
- It ain't.
It's what you think'll happen.
- You made a snare and shot a rabbit.
- So what?
I'd rather be trying things than sitting on my butt.
All right.
All right.
Let's go if we're going.
Take what you need.
I was thinking more like a couple of sweaters.
See?
I told you I grew up with boys.
Jesus.
- Do you live by yourself?
"- Yeah, that's right."
No smoking.
No smoking.
We need fitness if we're gonna get this job done.

"Give us a hint, Ray."
"A bank, payroll, armoured car, what?"
"Give us a hint, Ray."
"A bank, payroll, armoured car, what?"
You'll know when you need to know.
You'll know when you need to know.
"Hey, fellas."
Ray.
"Flannery, what are you doing here?"
"Hey, fellas."
Ray.
"Flannery, what are you doing here?"
Thought I could lend a hand.
Thought I could lend a hand.
"Wheelman, second gun, whatever - I'll do anything, mate."
"Wheelman, second gun, whatever - I'll do anything, mate."
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
We're just getting ourselves fit.
We're just getting ourselves fit.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
"I'm already fit, mate."
Yeah?
"I'm already fit, mate."
- There's that one.
- Is that a pentagram on the wall?
"Hmm, it kind of depends what you mean by pentagram."
I think he means this five-sided witchy-shaped thing here.
"Oh yeah, it is a pentagram."
I think we'll take a pass.
OK.
This building's on fire!
I'm 25% sure that fire has been put out.
Next.
[ sigh ] Oh!
"Well, what about this one?"
This one looks kind of perfect.
Yeah!
It does.
Can we see it?
Can we see it now?
Well...
I'll just get...
another one.
- Please.
"- Eat, eat."
Maybe we should wait outside.
"What if the police come by, and"
- I'm not there to be arrested?
"- Face it, Babs,"
They're not coming.
"Now, let's go play some lawn darts!"
But this is so unfair!
Why won't the police arrest me?
They're just not that onto you.
"- What's worse, I spent all that money on that bomb-making stuff."
-Okay.
"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
EMERSON:
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here. I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
-No fun.
-Company man.
(GUNSHOT)
Hi.
-How you doing?
-Good.
katherine:
You should have seen your face back there.
EMERSON:
What?
katherine:
"When I didn't get off the train right away, you looked like you were about to have a heart attack."
-How was your weekend?
-Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
"- ""stupid record's"" uncalled for."
"- okay, i cannot do this anymore."
i cannot do this anymore.
- what?
!
honey!
what?
!
- i've had it.
- what are you doing?
!
"- look, we need you."
but we need 100 % of you.
- you've got it!
"- no, we don't."
"- baby, please, don't -- - come on."
- don't go.
i'm -- i'm begging you.
- looks like he loves her to me.
"- [sighs] that is pathetic, bob!"
- we're gonna go stay with my parents for a while.
- it's christmas.
- that is so wrong.
she knows how bad bobby felt when our daddy left us on christmas.
- i don't want to leave!
i want a christmas here with everybody!
"- honey, it's okay."
just come.
- i don't want to go!
[sniffles]
- we're just gonna go with grandma and grandpa for a little while and have christmas over there.
you got to make a choice -- it's either her or me.
You boys get him down off this slope and somewhere safe before dark.
Fitzgerald.
Glass is to be cared for as long as necessary.
And a proper burial when it's time.
He's earned it.
I understand.
You hurt yourself?

(JIM SCRAPING FLASK)
Ree done that to you?
I'm just asking.
"Yeah, they done it."
They took their sweet time with it.
"At the start, I didn't feel nothing."
I just heard the sound of the knife scraping against my skull and them all laughing and whooping and hollering and whatnot.
Then the blood came.
It was cold.
"It started streaming down my face, in my eyes, and breathing it in."
Choking on it.
That's when I felt it.
Still using cooking as therapy?
yeah.
Ooh.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
"Good morning, everyone."
"Oh, look at all of this food."
It's obscene.
You okay?
How are you feeling?
Can I get you something?
"Please, everyone, relax."
What I need is
For the people who love me to treat me like they always do.
Has anybody heard from Chuck?
"Yeah, uh, he's-he's sorry he couldn't make it."
Charles has the right idea.
"If he were here, then I'd really worry."
"Anyway, one thing I'll say about William's treatment..."
Is that I have not lost my appetite.
I want waffles.
Music to my ears.
Dad.
What's he doing here?
I invited him.
Hmm.
"Looks great, Lil."
Really great.
So I hope you'll all join me
For this doctors without borders gala tomorrow at Columbia.
"I must admit, I feel a bit silly about the whole thing."
"Clearly, Columbia's run out of alumni to honor,"
I thought it was an apron.
"And this is supposed to be the new me, doing things properly."
Beggar!
No - this needs more than a beggar.
This needs a bugger.
Bugger!
"Oh, heck."
Oh... oh... oh...
"# Overweight, overwhelmed"
# I've overstepped the mark
# Help me out
# I'm whistling in the dark
# But something I saw in you
"# Gave me a sense, a clue"
# To what I had lived without
# The sun came out
# You think a heart can never melt
# You don't expect a thaw
# But feelings just accosted me
"# And sort of, well, defrosted me"
# And left me in a puddle on the floor
"# No choice, to see it through"
# I couldn't turn away
# From what I glimpsed in you
# That day. #
"Letting them stay all night now, are you?"
What?
"We saw your fancy man come, but we didn't see him go."
"Hey, Mam!"
I'm doing me hair like Mr Kirkby's.
You're not going.
Get upstairs.
But I'm so close.
Okay.
Do I need the thing to get out?
"Oh, great, you're here."
Let's go down.
Look at this.
"Wow, that's amazing."
Were you able to talk to Patrick about the maintenance?
"Yeah, we spoke this morning."
"Well, it really is amazing."
It just looks so real.
Like this wrapper.
It looks like a real hamburger wrapper.
"- Oh, that wrapper is real."
- What?
Yeah.
I always throw in a few real things.
Kind of cast a glow over the plaster objects.
"You know, kind of bump it all up a notch."
Did you do this at the MoMA show?
"Were there real things in that show, or-"
"Oh, yeah."
Course.
This is mine.
You got it from the staff kitchen.
"No, I made that."
This stuff is really good for your skin.
It has like all these minerals in it.
- Let me see!
- Let mejust finish!
- It doesn't match at all.
- It will.
There should be a cross passage about three yards from there.
"Tac Team leader, bring that *** down by agent Mei."
Guys...
It's Sara's.
We got a heat source.
"Wherever the reading's coming from, it's not on the blueprints."
Let's go.
"All right, we got something."
It's about five meters down the access shaft.
Hold your 20.
Lin's team will be on the flip side of the shaft in three minutes.
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
Can't read you.
We're going in.
There's our heat source.
That looks like a piece of her dress.
She was here.
Check it out.
Cover!
"Alpha, this is Staging Command."
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
!
"Kelton, answer me, damn it!"
Monroe!
Where's Kelton?
I couldn't get to him.
There was too much debris.
We can't get through.
Roof collapse.
"I repeat, we cannot get through."
"All right, call in Search and Rescue now."
His traces only exist in the past.
Like a ghost hunt.
Ghosts have a soul.
He does not.
"From a technical point of view, A mind is a soul."
"This is not funny, Bishop."
I've seen them kill.
Suicide would be the best option.
"If you're afraid,..."
I get it.
Just put me in the right direction and I go alone.
We must find Cage.
That's not my style.
Not like a hiding place.
Cage is a man!
An old and nasty fighter.
With many weapons.
"He lives four days walking, Inside the death zone."
No human is so crazy.
"I did not say, that is not crazy."
Come.
I know the way
"Hello, guests."
My name is Sara.
"Sorry, my husband is not there."
Will come back later
We wait.
"Cookies, that's milk."
"I can see that, Sara."
Where do you get them?
"I made them, of course."
They try my husband better than his mother's cookies.
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does yourdad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my fatherwas a commanderlike you."
He died in combat in southeastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up yourass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone yourown size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
He's the birthday boy.
He's just like his father.
Nice kid.
I'm so hungry.
Dump your rubbish here.
Dump your rubbish here.
You can go.
We'll make a short tour through the Efteling Park.
"Finally, we can sit."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
"That's only for laughs, mom."
What's this?
What does Queen Beatrix want with that comedian?
"One moment, sir."
"-It's from last week, mom."
"No, last week's one was about Martine Bijl and that tall man."
What's his name?
From that comic duo.
"No, that's Prince Pieter, who can't play the piano because of his hands."
Terrible... cancer in your hands.
"-Yes, terrible."
Money can't buy happiness.
"-No, but it's nice to have."
We'll buy this one.
"Look, Marco Bakker will never sing again!"
With a record!
-We'll play it on the stereo!
Fantastic!
-We'll get this one too.
Anything else?
"-No, that's enough."
I see it.
And I make every effort to prepare them for what's coming.
"Well, I think I've heard enough for today."
What exactly are you trying to tell me?
Are you trying to tell me I'm going to die soon?
Is that it?
I told you everything.
You know everything.
Go fuck yourself.
Hurry up.
Sam.
"Sam, hurry up."
Bring that over.
Hurry up.
"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
We need a neck brace and a splint.
Get that here.
Look straight into the light.
Don't move.
The smell of the ghosts.
Follow the smell of the ghosts and you'll find the flower.
"What did you say, sweetheart?"
It's a cactus.
"It makes a flower once a year, at midnight."
Only once.
"At 12:00 noon, the flower dies, and it smells like ghosts."
The flower smells like ghosts?
"Yeah, but it's real nice."
Mommy says ghosts smell good.
The Night Blooming Cereus.
"Yes, I remember."
Mommy told me about it too.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
For a few days.
"We've, um..."
[Sighs]
Had this emotional connection for some time... and we just want to see if there is something else there.
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
- Sandra?
- I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm...
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on.
"You, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or... you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter.
- Who is he?
It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do?
Go arrest him?
[Laughs]
Sandra.
Later I find out it's not.
I've been conned.
- What are my options?
"- Just drop it, right?"
- I'd say so too.
- Aren't there any legal measures?
- I'll look into it.
- I'll treat you to dinner.
Oysters?
- Oysters are just fine.
Call me.
- This weekend.
Mia's got a bag.
- Mia hasn't got a bag of oysters.
- I didn't buy them.
- You get them in a basket.
- You don't catch them in a basket.
"No, but you sell oysters in a basket and clams in a net."
You're confusing them with shrimp.
Way to go!
- Good morning.
"- My, fresh rolls and everything."
- Thanks for a great night.
"- Well, thank you."
You were great.
"It was mind-blowing, Frank."
"- Yes, I performed my magic."
- I've never felt anything like it.
"When you told me flat out, I was hurt, I have to admit."
- But Casper knew this little trick.
- You talked to Casper about it?
Yes.
"It's not your problem if I get sick, so mind your own business!"
"Tell my mother for all I care, she won't say anything."
Oh shit!
Come on everybody!
"What time do you call this, Mr Boglio?"
I'll let it pass this once.
"You, recite your homework."
Andre Nicole
"Ok, that's enough."
Bring me your exercise book.
"Boglio, show me your weekend homework!"
Is oat grown in your area?
Your answer... yes.
"Beetroot, yes!"
"Rice, yes!"
"Tomatoes, no!"
There are no tomatoes?
What about fruit and vegetables?
"Yes, gladioli!"
"Tell me this, are you trying to be funny, saying there are no vines?"
Is that what you call homework?
!
"I didn't do it, sir."
Who did it then?
Maybe the Dad did?
Maybe!
You have to come to school.
The teacher wants a word with you.
"Come on, the change will do you good."
Carry on without me!
Where do you think you're going?
Hop on the back.
"Yeah, I do, too, but don't cling to it."
It'll make you lazy and angry.
- Your work will suffer.
- I'll keep that in mind.
And I don't believe you need to exacerbate these instincts in yourself more than you already do.
You got it.

"Ah... now, your room's out the back."
"I, erm..."
I have to go to the city for a couple of days.
- Do you think you'll be all right here?
"- Yes, I do."
I thought so.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hello?

PHILIP:
Hello?
Are you that kid?
"You're the caretaker, Melanie?"
Dad mentioned you might be here.
"So, this comes as no surprise."
"Not to me, no."

Beautiful sunset.
- Productive day?
- Not particularly.
I'm glad that he's replaced himself with a younger surrogate to handle the forlorn moping.
I'm glad it pleases you.
He'll be back in a few days.
I know.
AUDIENCE LAUGHS
Do you have it on your mobile phone?
Do you...
Yes!
When you ring your mobile...
"Yes, yes, I do!"
What I'm interested in is how you got on in our reasonably-priced car.
Oh.
This is very embarrassing.
Shall we find out?
Richard's lap.
TYRES SCREECH
Here we go...
You're putting a lot of effort into this.
Knackered.
This is where he said don't brake.
I've got to.
Quite smooth... quite fast.
Ish.
And into the last corner...
That's a nice line.
Well.
We have the time.
And I'm afraid it's a sad day in Top Gear history.
And a sad day for Harry Enfield.
AUDIENCE:
No!
Richard Whiteley is the slowest man ever with a time of two minutes six seconds!
Enfield is going to be absolutely apoplectic.
His proudest boast to date was he was so slow and you've beaten him!
By miles!
"Frankly, your life is now ruined."
But we're not supposed to leave.
Miss Pearl made that very clear.
You gonna stop me?
I didn't think so.
- Anna.
- Surprised?
I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Change of plans.
"I'm sorry, I thought you'd be psyched."
"No, no, no."
"I mean, I am."
Of course I am.
"All right, then."
Step aside.
Heh.
Don't be grumpy.
It can't be that bad.
You'd be surprised.
"My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom."
Let's get hammered.
Let's.
- Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
At least they're having fun.
They're drunk.
Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after homecoming?
"- Oh, my God, yes."
- We were wasted.
It was the first time I got drunk.
I blame Matt.
Her parents got seated at the next booth.
It's too dangerous to go on.
We should return to Puyo.
Sayong's right.
Guys with grudges will hunt you down like a mad dog.
Mad dogs are best when avoided.
"Let's turn back, Miss."
I heard they still call him commander.
Commander?
But they're bandits.
- That's nonsense.
- It's not that simple.
(Oi) They train harder than soldiers do.
They're willing to die for their commander.
(Mari) No wonder the soldiers are no match.
(Hyupbo) This is bad...
Captain.
There's no point in pushing forward.
We should go back to Puyo.
He's right.
Talk to Sosuhno.
"Actually, I want to go to Gosan no matter what happens."
But Sosuhno is our leader and we should wait for her decision.
Come with me.
Where to?
To the bandits' hideout.
What?
What for?
I want to check them out.
Cap...
(Puyo Palace)
What do you want?
"(Yangjung, Hyunto governor) We're going to attack the Southwest Yi."
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
"Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay."
"Oh, a survivor."
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
"Well, we have ways of making you talk."
Where are your rebel friends now?
"Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!"
All right!
Are you all right?
"I'm proud of you, Sheriff."
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door.
It's open!
We're free!
"Woody, we don't know what's out there!"
I'll tell you wha...
"They're gonna eat us, Buzz!"
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working.
I recharged it before I left.
It should be good for...
You idiot!
You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
-Get away!
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
I'm going to love you and hold you and feed you and dress you
- and cling to you...
- Yeah...
Hang on to you and smother you with my love.
- Yeah...
- Forever and ever and ever
- and ever and ever...
"- You know, it's gettin' a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I might go get some air."
"Oh, no, you don't."
"Oh, no..."
Not without your umbrella.
- Come on!
"- Here, let me get that."
Wait for me!
"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"You know, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah!
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
"Sure, I can."
I'll be right back.
"♪ Gingy, Gingy ♪"
"Run, run, run, as fast as you can if you wanna remain a gingerbread man!"
Oh!
"- Oh, Gingy."
- Whaa...
I don't understand.
Nice.
Where'd you get these things?
- How do I look?
First I gotta know where you got 'em.
I see.
You'd rather look like a tramp than accept something from me.
Take 'em back where you got 'em.
Got that?
Then maybe I should just leave too.
Maybe you should.
"Where'd you get these things, Cilly?"
A girl gave them to me.
I won't ―
I'm telling you:
Watch your step.
"Don't be angry, Franzie."
"None of us are angels, are we?"
Enough!
Let's get down to the bar!
- You really mean it?
- Why not?
Stop pestering it all the time!
And you get out of here with that cigar!
The air's bad enough.
You're nuts!

So what's the story?

"Well, I want Biberkopf, and that's that."
"Well, I won't help."
"I want him, and that's that."

Where did you get the money to buy this car?
My dad gave me the money.
--And who's your dad?
--A lieutenant colonel
Which division?
"Oh, whatever."

"--I don't know when they woke up --The rope you hid from him, where is it?"
--Oh...it's here in the kitchen --Give it to me.
--Here --Thanks
You're welcome.
I am so glad you arrived.
You spoke so strangely on the phone.
--I must inform you in advance...
--No need.
"See, Sasha speaks of you in not so flattering terms."
One breakfast like this could end all the day worries.
What an easy remedy.
As simple as making it everyday.
You'll have to come and make it.
I'll do it for a reasonable price.
Where will you say you stayed the night?
What is the matter?
Will you lie?
Nobody will ask me.
Where did you meet mom?
At college.
And had you met other girls before?
Yes.
Specially one.
What was her name?
Why do you care?
"Come on, tell me."
If you tell me about your writings.
That's blackmail.
Then I'm not telling you her name.
Her name was Amelia.
Was she pretty?
No.
"But she told me that she liked me, and that she was feeling good with me."
Are you and mom still arguing?
Much less now.
Poor Clara...
"Why do you say ""poor Clara""?"
-It's just a manner of speaking.
She says the same about you.
Is that right?
You're sad.
Yeah.
That would be best.
I want to...
"It's my job, Chief."
We're going to get these sons of bitches.
I'll be waiting on you.

"Oh, Wednesday night."
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.
"Well, Earl had to get back to work, and I'm starting a new job next week."

He hired me on the spot.

"Well, that's good."
"Well, congratulations."
"Thank you, Dale."

"Whatever's going on, whatever trouble he's left us with,"

"No, Adam!"

Anyway...
All the comforts.
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.
Do you know the area?
- Is the house yours?
- I wish.
We have fans available if you need them.
- Whose house is it?
- The owner lives in Valencia.
"She hasn't come in years, she's very old..."
- Who rented it last?
- I don't remember.
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.
I was here yesterday and I saw three people enter the house.
"Nice, very pretty."
You're hurting me!
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?
I don't know who rents it.
You rent it and you don't know to who?
I rent it to him by the day.
He calls me right before and puts the money in an account.
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?
Who is he?
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
Nothing.

So we're going to tour around?
Whatever you like.
"You wanted to, didn't you?"
For your work.
I don't have to tour for my work.
No.
I wanted to have a chat with you.
A long chat.
- Privately.
- With me?
There's nothing I can tell you.
I'm just an ordinary boy.
I always write about ordinary people.
"As I said on TV, the ordinary man is my central theme."
All of him.
Above and below the belt.
"Yes... you've been on TV, haven't you?"
"And on the radio and in the papers, sure."
- ls it true what they write?
- What?
- All the goings on in the studios?
- What do you mean?
"Why do not you ask me there, man?"
I'll see you soon.
OK?
"Hi, honey."
Let's go to my camp.
It is located in White Creek near barracks where they took your family.
Follow me.

"Toni, come here quickly."
Here.
Use this.
OK?
Shoot him if exaggerated.

"Man, this is illegal."
"Yes it is legal, it took me the cell, not in the shack."
We can not be more legalistic.
No new evidence.
Really?
Why do not you arrest me if you have new evidence?
I like it here.
Is relaxed.
It seems to me that you are trying this trick before.
"If you think that this type of to break me,"
You've already seen it does not work.
-Yes.
What if I told you that your drug Lu Bates connected with the murder of Hastings?
"If Lu did it, arrested to me."
Do not worry.
We'll take you to the station.
Do not worry.
"Please, let me go!"
I can't stay here.
They told me to stick with him at all times!
Who?
The president of Yong Moon Plan...
I have to listen to him!
"Please, let me..."
You have to hide out somewhere that no one can find you!
"What bastard, in his right mind, stays home after stabbing a man?"
This is his house.
Stay here until things quiet down.
You...
- You can't call my mom.
- I don't even know her number.
I only stabbed him once...
Only once.
Do you think he died?
"What do I do now, Han Gyul?"
"Hey, how long will he be here?"
Suck it up...
You little...
Your phone.
You better never record me again.
Your voice recorder.
I gave that to the police at the station...
"Oh, is this it?"
The three million won you owe me?
Yes.
"Since you paid me back, aren't we done talking?"
Representative...
I'm a little scared.
Of what?
-Wait.
These are the guys I told you about.
"Theywere captured bythe Germans, and nowtheywant back to the Red Army."
-As we've agreed.
-And we didn't come back empty-handed.
We've released comrade captain from the Germans.
Comrade captain!
Comrade captain!

-Where is the girl?
- Overthere.
"- Let's go with us, Marek!"
"- No, I'll stay behind."

"Folks, may be we should leave the house intact, eh?"
Are these two Vlasov soldiers captured by our scouts here?
"Yes, they are."
- Have you terminated them already?
"- No, I haven't."
I return the favor.
They've brought me back.
Howwas it to be a prisonerwith the Germans?
"OK, let's make a deal while I'm kind."
These two boys are to be handed overto Malyutin.
- l do not have the right to do that!
-What?
And are you still croaking about rights!
- Not me.
Or through the rear window if you're brave enough to turn round.
It's so big!
We've passed the single tree.
And loads of others.
Two more up there. lt's beautiful!
I said we're reaching two single trees.
It would help if we could ask someone.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
We can ask them.
Slow down a bit.
- We may not find anyone.
- We will.
"This is farmland, they're out working."
We have to ask.
"Don't worry, we'll find someone."
I can see a black spot in the distance.
Over there.
He can't hear us.
"Wait, I'll go and ask him."
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Hello, ma'am."
"Hello, I'm honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"200 yards after the junction, turn left."
Thank you.
Good-bye.
"Look, it's behind the hill."
Wait till we pass that tree.
Look into the distance.
On the hill.
- Siah Dareh's over there?
- horrible!
Who's this?
"- My father, rest his soul."
They've done fireworks for generations.
Mattia does them too.
That's why the explosives...
He's tops.
And this is forthe curtains.
And I thought...
But I'm a little sorry that you're not sleeping at my house.
Who'II steal yourwaIIet now?
I don't know how to thank you.
- How much?
- What are you doin'?
- We did it in friendship.
- We don't even know each other!
We'II learn to.
I owe you one.
The curtains will come later.
There's the sea!
I hadn't realized.
"One of these evenings I'II invite you to dinner at the sea, to thank you."
"Okay, this evening."
- But you're our guest.
"- I can't, my back..."
"Why, you eat with yourback?"
"Whitebait omeIet, cianfotta, cecata soup and soppressata."
"Stuffed anchovies, fusiIIi with meat sauce and white CiIentan figs."
- What?
- You have to taste everything.
Why just taste?
Let's eat it all!
- What is it?
- It's people seen from above.
From the sky.

"If not, why would I last this long."

Fine.
Fine.
Speed dial.
I love it.
And I want his head cut off so i can hang it from my rear view mirror!
- That's just your anger talking.
- Yeah.
Dale.
"No, I'm good."
All right.
Don't got to worry about me.
"You say you're okay, I take your word for it."
Medical suspensions?
[Chuckles]
"That's for the fucking nanny state, and I don't play that bullshit."
But do me a favor.
Put the glasses back on.
You're giving me a fucking headache.
"So, what's the deal?"
You got a spot on this card for me or what?
I can find a spot for you.
It's in Fresno.
It's only a week out.
It's not a problem.
Okay.
- Who's the guy?
- Local kid named Vargas.
He's aggressive.
"Not a lot of skill, but he's a tough motherfucker."
- 155?
- Ish.
"If either one of you's a few pounds over,"
I'm not gonna dock you.
I'll make it.
Even better.
"Unfortunately, though, not a lot of money."
I just want the fight.
All right.
It's a deal.
I'm excited.
Your father and your uncle and your grandfather are fools.
"Thank you, Leena."
- You're welcome.
"Thank you, Grandma."
"Enjoy your food, my darling."
"Why are you hitting me, fatso?"
"Liyova, take another meatball."
"I'd love another one, thank you."
Daddy.
What?
They're waiting for you to finish.
- What?
They're waiting for you to finish.
How long can one eat?
What did you say?
- Never mind.
I take it he doesn't want any dessert.
I'd love some dessert.
The Rustaveli Theater is coming to do Richard III.
"Can you get tickets, Yitzhak?"
No chance.
It's not some little operetta.
Does he have to do it now?
He'll just kick up dust.
"Yitzhak, why now?"
Why now?
Ask your mother why now.
It'll kick up dust.
"Tell her that if it kicks up dust, I'll clean up."
Why does he always have to ruin Fridays for us?
"Yes, every Friday."
Would you prefer another day?
Only that you keep saying you'll be sendin' over the ending'.
It's almost ready.
Well...
let me know when it is.
Goodbye Parfitt.
Mrs.Cole
Excuse me?
I bet...you know!
just this way...
Cigarette?
I've never seen much point in men.
Still I do hate to see you plaining.
Oh!
I'm not plaining.
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
"It's just the...when we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm in a sentimental mood.
"My landlady was killed yesterday,"
I could hear her husband crying through the wall...all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
"I was wondering on page 76, I say..."
Getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Did I...
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
It was supposed to prevent!
I was supposed to protect them!
I should have expected this!
It was supposed to prevent!
-Enough.
It was supposed to prevent!
It's okay.
You're supposed to stop it!
It's okay.
Okay.
"You're supposed to stop it, Bobby!"
Look at me.
You're a good man.
You're a good man.
"Come on, we have to stand up."
"If Ray came to the road, they will have to hitchhike."
We have to catch him before than catching a ride.
Listen to me.
"When you come to a fork road, turn left ."
This will take you back to the place where you took the family.
I doubt that headed for the highway.
I will go in that direction.
Take this.
I have one in my car.
Bobbi.
-What is it?
Are you in trouble about all this?
I do not know.
I do not give a fuck.
"I'm dying, do you remember?"
What the fuck!
Ti.
"in purple trunks, Stoker Thompson!"
- Give him a gun!
"- Hey, Pop, where's your wheelchair?"
And in this corner!
!
"at 198 and 3/4 pounds, in white trunks!"
!
that promising young heavyweight from Middletown!
!
Tiger Nelson!
"Yeah, Nelson!"
Let's get it over with!
"Don't hurt him, Nelson, he's an old man!"
"Okay, you know the rules!"
"I want a nice, clean fight!"
"No heeling, rabbit punching, gouging!"
Break when I tell you!
Go to a neutral corner in all knockdowns and keep them above the belt!
The customers came to see a good fight!
Shake hands now and come out fighting!
May the best man win!
"Don't bend, Pop, you'll never get up!"
"Don't forget, stay away from him!"
That's the stuff!
Stay with him!
"Oh, quit stalling!"
Let's have some action!
That's it!
"- Don't worry, I ain't gonna finish you yet!"
- You ain't finishing nobody!
"Let him have it, baby!"
Let him have it!
"Then, we can have... fun afterwards."
Let's do that.
"Enough, okay?"
"I'm really sorry, so let's stop."
I'm a bastard.
"No, I'm an asshole, okay?"
I didn't ask you to apologize to me.
Have I ever done this to you before?
You've done wrong today!
What's wrong with you?
Is that the restaurant you mentioned?
"Yes, it is."
Let's go in.
We'll eat and have a drink.
You must be hungry.
You should eat.
"Let's have a drink, okay?"
Let's go.
Let's have some sushi.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
"- We can sit over there, right?"
- Yes.
- There's three of you?
- Yes.
I thought about it as I was walking.
You're too opportunistic.
Why all the fuss?
You nearly brought tears to my eyes.
What about me that's so opportunistic?
"Frankly, it wasn't tears but disgust."
You were just trying to show me that you're a man.
Sleep tight.
Good night.
"Good night, Morten."
"Good night, Martin."
It will be fun to see what important thing I forgot.
"Yes, it will be lovely."
"As long as there's food and wine, everything will be fine."
- You're not nervous at all?
"- No, I'm looking at it as a test."
- Of what?
- Anna will marry many times.
The first wedding is always hard.
"With a little luck, it will be okay."
Jørgen...
Jørgen?
Yes?
"- Mother, aren't you in bed?"
- I can't get on line.
Don't speak to me like I'm senile.
Why can't I get online?
There's poker in three minutes.
Why did we have to get that damn wireless network?
But it's working now.
Thank you.
- Sleep tight.
- Don't stay up all night.
Sorry.
- Could we teach her to knock first?
"- I've tried, but she's senile."
Only when she wants to be.
- I'll send her to a home tomorrow.
- Do you promise?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
Shit!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
Hey!
How did you get up there?
From further up.
Is this the country road between Kamenice and Bournak?
- It will be when it's finished.
- And when would that be?
A year from now.
- More exactly?
- In May.
"Hold on, for Heaven's sake!"
"All right, all right!"
I'm all right!
But I don't really know the exact time.
Is it '84 now?
"It's half past four, if you please!"
"Just stay there, I'll fetch help."
1984.
"Floods in Italy, the Security Council is having a meeting..."
Everything fits.
Call the Central World Brain!
We have to wait for that.
Only Katya knows the password.
Let's try it like this:
Adam 84 calling CWB.
There isn't the slightest hope without the password.
Do something!
Can't you hear it's picking up interference?
Just search under the letter P. Quickly!
"Not that, that's Periodicals!"
Maybe the next one.
We said unobtrusively!
- Am I needed?
That's not the information I have.
I swayed them once.
I could do it again.
[phone chimes]
I doubt it.
You're no longer that guy.
[whirs] [scooter horn beeps]
"- Hey, man."
You're out of line.
"- That's all right, I know the boss."
"""Proletariat""?"
"Oh, I get it, ""Coffee for the people."""
Eight bucks.
"Rich people, I guess."
"- Who do we have to thank for that, Chip?"
- Karl Marx?
"You, man."
They jacked up the rent on all the stores down here because of that hotel you made us think we wanted.
"Look, man, I lost my store too."
"Look, what do you want, Chip?"
- Just a coffee.
- No.
Your money's no good here.
"- Thanks, man."
I appreciate it.
"- No, man."
I don't want your business.
"All right, man."
I'll...
I'll think about it.
You want change?
"I just wanna say a big thank you to those of you who came out to the funeral last Wednesday of my dog, Pinot."
He really is a coward.
Fortunately I can run very fast.
Biggie!
Biggie!
"Mr. Chiu, what's the matter?"
Ask her to help me get dressed.
Biggie!
You only read the script in this moment.
Why are you still hesitating?
Hurry...
"You see me as nothing, hurry..."
How dare you.
Collect the laundry fee again?
Came back here.
"I'm not pushing you, you can paid me few days later."
Clean my wife's underwear too.
Well...
You clean it or not?
"Yes, but my sister will scold me."
I will bit you.
"Huang, you'll meet your match!"
"Master Tam, you've got a visitor."
A visitor?
Our school's famous in Canton.
You're a wanted man.
"True, we're partners in the past."
But I don't want to be investigated now.
I think you better lay low.
I still treasure our friendship.
I've got friends in the opera troupe.
Why don't you join them?
And we'll find a way for you.
Bitter!
I thought you'd break my arm again.
"Kolya, you are so nice."
And amusing.
You are like a brother.
I used to meet a boy.
His name was Volodya.
He was a pilot.
I must have loved him.
He perished in his plane.
Just a day after he was kissing my hands.
"Then another boy Andrei, used to court me."
He was a scout and died too.
Then Vanya.
I began feeling fear.
It is dangerous to love me.
Do you understand that?
-You'd rather come back.
"- l'll be back, Olya."
"And we'll kill your sniper, that's for sure."
Take myword on that.
"I, Kolya Malakhov, give you this word."
We'll kill him.
"Astra, Astra, Carnation on air."
I'm at the door readyto enter.
"- Got it, wait for an invitation."
- Got it.
We are waiting.
"Go to our positions, afteryourfirst salvo Malyutin will advance to the hill."
"Yes, sir."
"Comrade mayor, Colonel Egorov is on the line."
"Yes, comrade colonel."
Pardon me.
What are we going to do about this Chummy individual?
We can't allow her to sing.
"The minute she opens her mouth, the ushers will open the doors."
"That's where you're wrong, Chowsky she'll be the biggest laugh in the show."
- But she takes it seriously.
- The audience won't.
Tell her her number's in.
[sighs]
Go on.
"Alright, dearie, let's try it."
Start from the first.
[piano music]
* Never felt so humbler to me
* So completely awed I couldn't speak *
* Never knew a heart could beat this way *
* When we meet this way
* Can I help
* But say
* You're an angel
* You're so understanding
* Think of heaven handing me
* A dream like you
* You're an angel
* You're an inspiration
* What a combination
* You're a sweetheart too
* Makes no difference where I look *
* You're all I see
* Close as pages in a book
* That's what we'll be
* For
Come on!
"Back then, they had no electricity."
The only light was fire.
Everything was dangerous then.
"Dinosaurs, mammoths, other tribes, but when the fire went out, it got dark and more dangerous."
"Since then, we associate dark with danger."
"Since then, we're afraid of the dark."
"They're dark, so we're afraid of them."
We won't tell them that.
So we split it up.
Who...?
"I'II take their statements, OK?"
I'II look around the backyard.
There might be some clues.
"Who's first, next?"
Go ahead.
- No.
You go Ducky.
- You go.
Who got here first?
Him.
Me.
polo's in his room with his toys.
Change the batteries in his walkman.
You'II find some in the top of his dresser.
"Name, age and profession."
"Bertrand JoyaI, 48, divorced."
I've worked on the Van KIee farm for 10 years.
You knew Mrs Lajeunesse well?
I sure knew her well.
tell me about her.
"C,duIie had an income."
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, did you..."
- Big time.
- Nice!
High five!
Wait.
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family, I'm pretty sure you banged my mom."
Mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You...
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney."
Let me ask you something.
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."
"Who's your ""guitar-player-biker who couldn't find mild salsa... that said 'Screw it' and went medium"" bad boy?"
Oh.
"Marshall, your hand!"
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad... but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no."
That's the cuff.
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers."
And the rotten-fish smell is getting stronger.
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
I see the light!
It's really attractive to me.
"Robin, are you alright?"
I'm perfectly alright...!
- ls that really you?
- Of course it's me!
Remember when you left me 3 years ago.
"No sleep at night, no waking up in the morning."
Couldn't eat at meals.
Why were you so cruel?
There are even crueler things!
"Your Excellency, may I present my fiancee!"
You son of a bitch...
Your Excellency!
You alright...!
"Stop it, I'm fine now!"
Do you know one another?
Know her?
Never!
There's little left of whom I knew!
The one I knew is dead.
My soul was betrayed 3 years ago.
"And 3 years later, her own soul is being betrayed!"
What's left is just a walking corpse.
For the world to laugh at!
What wonderful lines!
If Yeats could have heard you just now.
He would have saluted you indeed!
Fantastic...!
Thank you...!
Someone's fainted again!
Couldn't take your speech!
You've got three children.
Ah.
"Oh, if this phone could only talk."
"Well, it can if you want it to."
Everything you want to know about will is right in there.
"His friends, his music, everything."
"No, no, I-I can't invade his privacy that way."
I can.
"No, put that down."
Someone's texting him.
It's from Stephanie.
"""Did you tell your mom yet?"
"Did she freak?""..."
Freak?
About what?
What does he need to tell me?
"Well, find out yourself."
Pretend you're will and text her back.
I shouldn't do that.
"But as a mother,"
"I need to know what's going on with my son... by any means possible, right?"
- Indeed you do.
- Absolutely.
Okay.
"""How should I tell her?""..."
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that."
I just totally violated his privacy.
I am done with this.
"Ooh, she texted back."
"""Why are you texting like an old lady?""..."
"Ah, you shouldn't have spelled everything correctly."
Oh.
Say the rest.
I need to hear it.
I love francis more.
What's this?
Open it.
It's blank.
it's nothing.
She let me decide.
"It's odd, isn't it?"
That your mother was the one
To show me what was truly in my heart.
You.
It's you.
It's always been you.
Does this mean you'll marry me?
Yes.
We must protect sebastian.
There are those who will punish him
For reaching for the throne.
Of course.
I'll make sure of it.
I am sorry for the way things have gone.
But the outcome is this.
You need to leave here
And never come back.
"You've reached for the crown,"
And you failed to get it.
You'll be seen by many as a threat.
"The crown was never in my grasp,"
"But I had mary, and it galls you."
I was going to disappear in exile.
"That's your goal now, if you want to survive."
Are you in his apartment?
Are you on the bed?
No.
I'm not on the bed.
- Is he there?
- No...
Not exactly.
Is he taking a shower?
He's getting take-out for dinner.
And this call's becoming very 1-900.
"To talk to a hot English teacher, press 3."
Call ending now.
- Tomorrow?
"- Yeah, tomorrow."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"- Sorry, it took so long."
- It's okay.
Looks like Rose of Sharon has been discovered.
Big crowd at the take-out counter.
I meet your dad tomorrow.
I know.
I was thinking this is gonna be a bit more complex than the usual parent-teacher discussion.
"I mean, I can see your mom as a colleague, she's safe."
But your dad is your dad.
Which is complex.
"You will like him, he'll like you."
Just be your normal incredible self.
What is he after?
He's probably just what he says he is.
A nephew cleaning up after a distant relative.
Probably?
"Believe me, Freddie, we're agreed on that."
"Shut up and listen, Harry!"
Your debt is useless to me.
I can't sell it on.
No one will touch you.
So I'm calling it in.
- What?
- You have three days.
You do realize that's a completely insane request?
"What's going on, Freddie?"
OK.
Take this as a down payment.
You must know some powerful people in your line of business.
You should ask for a favor.
"He's arrived then, eh?"
The new DSI?
Yeah.
I worked with him a long time ago.
Interesting guy.
Long night?
"No, no."
I turned in early.
I was whacked.
What's Orwell got?
Body dragged out of the Thames.
Young woman.
No ID yet.
"You didn't really have an early night at all, did you?"
"You don't have an off button, do you, Suri?"
I just believe in the redemptive power of sleep.
Clears out the molecular garbage in our brains.
Molecular garbage?
I'd rather make sure the kids are tucked in.
They might have a nightmare and throw the covers off they could get a sore throat.
Wait.
"Give them something, Bruno."
Here...
Is all I have.
"Your wallet, Bruno!"
You punk.
Dirty little bastard!
Whas with this chick?
Just spreads her legs and stares at the ceiling...
Son of a bitch!
What are you complaining about?
"You got off, didn't you?"
Like screwing a piece of meat.
Get up now.
He needs to rest.
Look at this dumb chick!
No panties!
Hurry up.
I'd like to go now...
Don't you like panties?
You going to answer me or not?
Look what your friend did to me.
You should take it easy.
What if I can't get it up again?
"Look, you bitch!"
You're going to be all right...
Is not my fault!
I didn't shoot you!
I don't give a shit about his car.
He your boyfriend?
"I mean, he's not anyone else's either."
It's just...
- We're not actually married.
I bought the ring myself in Woolworths.
- I see.
- In love enough to run away with him.
Just too proper not to care what other people thought.
"- Er, behind..."
- Better get moving.
Hilliard's looking for you.
Wants to discuss the stuff you wrote for Uncle Frank's death.
- What did you think?
"- Too long, obviously."
But apart from that...
"His final moments, believing Brannigan and Johnnie are the sons he lost in the last war..."
- Well...
- Hmm.
"""Such an age you've been gone."""
- Really.
- Hmm.
"I still think we need a little more in terms of... of, um, of back-seeding."
"Oh, I'm..."
"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Hilliard, but Mrs. Cole has a train to catch."
- What?
- She must go.
- Wha--
- It's...
- It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
"Well, will she be back tonight?"
- Let's get you into makeup.
- Hmm.
Police!
A policeman has come!
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
He got in and started threatening us.
The car being involved in the accident...
Ashwini having driven it...
The windshield of the car having broken...
He seemed to know everything.
He threatened that he had evidence for it all.
Ashwini and I...
Ashwini immediately pleaded guilty.
"Ashwini is an NRI, right?"
"Yes, Sir."
- Hit-and-run case.
"If an FIR is filed, she can't go back."
You must help us!
"Please, Sir!"
I ensure that a case is not filed.
"But if any of his relative create a problem, we need to silence them."
That will cost you.
"No, Manoj."
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my fault.
"Keep quiet, Ashwini!"
Sir...
What should we do?
Manoj.
Where is Ashwini now?
She didn't like me bribing the cop.
She felt guilty and left the same day.
I don't know where she went or what she is doing now.
Mush!
Mush!
"- What's up, Sergeant?"
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food... then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse when they found him.
- What's his name?
"- Well, we found these on him."
Name seems to be Blake
"- John Blake, San Francisco."
Here it comes.
"Say, it even looks like a raft."
Thanks.
I always wanted to join the navy.
"- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?"
"- I'm afraid not, matey."
- They'll have to run along the bank.
"- Very well, sir."
"Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs."
"Step right in, commodore."
All set?
"Shove off, cabin boy."
Ca-
"Toot, toot!"
Hard aport!
"Come on, Buck."
Come on.
"The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream... then we follow a creek that runs into it north."
Huh!
Never fails.
- Goodbye.
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Come downstairs!
Quickly.
"I am telling you ""come downstairs""."
Come here.
Come collect them.
I said collect them!
"Now give them respectfully and with your both hands, when you bring home money, put it with respect, like a real man."
"If you throw money in front of me once more, Iwill punish you!"
Excuse me.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Nice job.
Nice job.
"Well, tell me now whafs happened, what's wrong with you?"
"If I transport anylhing for Shemr, I won't do it for Zaer_"
Is it his crime to ask you for his transportafions to make you earning money?
"I have a vow to play ketfledrum, he is not allowing."
"Bashirou, he is not responsible for your vow, is he?"
- Hello Zahireh_ Welcome.
Please oorne in.
- Thank you.
Don't bother yourself.
I sit on the ground.
Don't bother yourself.
Thank you
Please have a seat.
Welcome to my house
Hope to have good news.
How is Zaer Kheder'?
New shoes?
Have you jogged in them yet?
Judging by your rash.
"No, you haven't."
No cream residue.
"You've been scratching, right?"
"It's itchy, doc."
"So I have to scratch it, right?"
"If I scratch, my itch will go away, right?"
Wrong!
"The more you scratch, the itchier you get."
The more your lesions will get worse.
"And the bedtime pill, you didn't take either, right?"
"If I didn't take them, you can tell?"
No.
But based on what you just said.
I know you didn't.
And how is your penis?
"Doc, you don't miss a thing, do you?"
I'm really upset.
What you ask is too hard.
It's like asking me to become a monk.
This...
Who sleeps at 9PM anyways?
"In my profession, it's impossible."
What I am asking you to do isn't hard.
It is hard.
Do you sleep at 9PM?
Or you work 24 hours?
Yes.
No weekends off?
Nope.
"God, you may have to give me the strength"
To slap the devil out of my daughter
If she ever talks to me like that again.
"Oh, let me read my word."
"Let me find that scripture about ""thou shalt not kill."""
That should work right about now.
Jesus.
Baby.
Daddy!
- You look wonderful!
- Thank you.
How's mom?
Not good.
"See, a lot has been going on since you've been away"
And none of it's making your mother a happier person.
"What, dad?"
"Really, is she okay?"
"Yeah, she's okay,"
But nothing around her is.
She's been out of work for six months now
- And even worse...
- Wait.
"What, daddy?"
I wasn't even gone for that long.
How much could happen in six months?
A lot.
You mother never really had savings.
She's been living at her means.
And she lost her car and all of the furniture.
The house is completely empty.
"- What, daddy?"
- Yeah.
Tell Daeso I'd like to see him in private.
"I will, Governor."
Trade with the Han will stop again if the King refuses Yangjung's demand.
"Daeso, you went to all that trouble in Hyunto."
I just hope it wasn't all in vain.
Father will make a wise decision.
Try not to worry too much.
No.
He'll never do anything to help the Han.
Things have changed since then.
Refusing Yangjung's demand will affect the salt situation... and Father knows we'll have to go to war over it.
This is stupid.
Why are we putting up with this?
That Yangjung keeps on bothering us.
Daeso.
Why don't I just kill him?
I know.
I'm just saying.
You wanna be president?
Just say it.
Say it.
I'll step aside right now.
Can I do my job?
Please.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- Hello?
"- Hey, it's Noah."
- Remember me?
The guy you used to work with?
- Yeah.
I just heard about your father.
"My, my. [Clears throat]"
- [Laughter]
"- Reverend Robin, the floor is..."
All yours. [Chuckles]
Holy shit.
I don't think I can marry you.
"Well, I don't wanna marry you."
I-I wanna marry her.
- [Men laugh]
- Man:
"Hey, good one, Rob."
I-I can't do this 'cause she's 16.
That's right.
The numerical inversion of my 61.
"According to the ancient laws of Jewish mysticism, we complete each other."
Gross.
Nate?
Do you wanna say something?
[Lowered voice] I'm so sorry I sprayed you.
"Whoa, now... now..."
now I'm an intuitive man.
I'm starting to get the idea that you two don't approve of this union.
"Now whatever happened to, and I quote,"
"""What is wrong with these backwards, pigheaded philistines?"""
"Oh, no, that's when I thought she was Jewish."
Oksana:
She is Jewish.
What got to do with it?
You are anti-semite?
No!
"I... hold... well, hold on."
Is this even legal?
Barry Neufeld?
So what's wrong with him?
"Besides the fact he looks like Gumpy, and he irritates the shit out of you?"
"- Gumby, not Gumpy."
- Gumby.
Why should that matter?
"I'm no great prize, either."
Don't say that.
You are a terrific person and a great teacher.
"The truth is, I think I've reached the point."
- What point?
The point that you know you'll never get married.
Married?
What's marriage anyway?
Oh!
Come on.
"A ring, a contract, fighting and compromising."
"No, it can be more than that."
I'll tell you what I envy about people in love.
I'd love it if someone really knew me.
What I like.
What I'm afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.
I think that would really be wonderful.
"Hey, sister-in-law, you having a good time?"
Yeah.
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.
- I can't find her anywhere.
- I'll go find her for you.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
"That was the frontier, sire."
Yes I know.
I'm sorry about last night.
No problem.
"I can ask her a question, Mr. Lloyd?"
Sure.
Why did not you ever show anyone the movie Typer chosen?
Dragan asked me not to do it.
And why?
He thinks the dark side of the moon should never see the light.
And do you believe it?
No.
But if I had to distribute the movie...
It would have destroyed it.
"Another question, Mr. Lloyd."
- Sure.
Did you pick up your finger?
Goodbye.
"This boat is a scrap, it's impossible."
For centuries it is not in the water.
What a scam.
I already have sea sickness.
"They did not have passports or money, so I bought a boat."
Not a very good one.
Are not there any ferries?
Are you sure?
He asked?
"- Yes, there is nothing else."
Look at it wet it.
- It's better than it looks.
Wood is rotten.
Look at how the wood is reduced.
What are they doing out here?
"Well, patrolling?"
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us...
CRAWFORD:
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember."
And your men tried to kill him at the exchange.
Maybe he just wants to return the favor?
"I say we find a different route, just to be safe."
(YELLING IN ARABIC) What's he saying?
Janjaweed.
Two jeeps.
Coming fast.
"If we press on, we hit that checkpoint."
If the soldiers are friendly we'll have more fire power against the Janjaweed.
STONEBRIDGE:
"Crawford, you drive, take it slow, but get ready to gun it on command."
What's going on?
What are you doing?
"It's a checkpoint, get your head down, we might need to blast through."
No.
No more guns.
"Clare, just keep low."
Crawford.
Latif's spy.
What's his name?
"Oh, Clare's safe now, is she?"
What...
(GRUNTING) Jacoub.
(ENGINE STARTS) Stay down.
(YELLING IN ARABIC)
It was tan.Sandstone.
- That's two different colors.
- Look...
"Listen,cross-reference Your locations with the word ""Windward."
- Excuse me?
"- ""Windward."
Why do you have to be so cryptic?
What are you working on?
Stop!
"Listen.""Windward."
"Pull up the list of parks,would you?"
"And check for ""Windward."
Sunset.
Sunset...
Sandstone.
***
There's only one Windward park or school.
"Oh,man,Windward elementary.That's close to my shop.I know those kids."
"Hey,Tanner."
You bored of me yet?
We've got a park to check out.
The park's clear!
Swept both playgrounds and the field.Park's clear.
Looks like your intel was off.
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes,mom.We're all over it."
- Watch your step out there.
"- Yeah,you too,Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
*****
Tell me that you're still at the park.
- When?
"When you do, that's why you never see me."
The forensic said it was a boat propeller.
Nobody in her family knew she was leaving town to work.
The girls had one just like it.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
These places aren't on the map.
We don't know where they are.
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?
What size are those?
Size big.
These places are hard to find.
Almost 500 pesetas.
- Five hundred.
- And the smokes.
For the ride.
"I told you, nobody lives there."
It's abandoned.
Want me to open it?
Looks like they left in a hurry.
They left when they found out their daughter had drowned.
They couldn't set foot in the house after that.
You know them?
"Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen."
Charlie's Angels.
The one in the middle is Quini.
- Hi.
- Hi.
His mother disappeared three years ago.
My husband gave her this cross.
She never took it off.
It's very pretty.
It's a gift.
"Don't be surprised, it's nothing special."
You want to reorganize the factory.
It will only be possible... if you're in charge.
Put it in the other room.
A bit further behind.
Djénéba!
We have to see each other less frequently.
Why?
I'm not afraid of gossip.
People stick their noses into other people's business.
Do you mean my husband?
Of course.
You'll regret... the day when... he catches you.
There's nothing to be worried about.
Sure there is!
He's already been divorced four times.
"Right now he loves you, make the best of it."
Enough.
I know what I want.
Don't get angry.
Let's change the subject.
What are you doing on Thursday?
I don't know yet.
What's your plan?
Come over by my house.
I won't be able to.
Sing to Fakoli!
Praise his majesty!
Fakoli's worthy descendant.
Great Griot!
I need to...
I don't...
I've got...
I need to go...
Out of my way!
It's a panic attack.
That's all.
What?
It sounds like you're having a panic attack.
"I can't breathe, I can't..."
Maybe it's because you wanna fuck your sister.
What?
Do you want to fuck your sister?
No!
Jesus!
It's just people say panic attacks come from some deeply repressed sexual urges.
You know?
What?
"I was just testing a theory, see."
"Actually, I'm talking shit, cos it turns out a panic attack's just a fuckload of adrenaline mainlining into your heart."
It's just how we deal with danger.
"Fight or flight, they call it."
Right?
I don't know you.
"Are you a fighter or a flighter, Tony Stonem?"
Cos depending on your answer... well...
A lot depends on your answer.
I'll see you around.
"Hi, Effy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
There isn't going to be a place to live.
There isn't gonna be a honeymoon...
... becausethereisn't gonna be a wedding.
Okay.
And one other thing.
No little girl of mine is gonna be named Eudora.
[WOMEN gasping AND giggling ]
vin:
I figure it's been a while since you boys were in Texas.
YATES:
That right?
Yeah.
Texas is thataway.
Just shut up and ride.
EZRA:
"Here we go, gentlemen."
Here you go.
"Hey, I need me another drink over here."
I was not made for honest labor.
Inez:
Then let me do it.
Do what?
Tend your bar.
And clean and make repairs.
Until you and I really get the place going.
By then you'll make me your partner.
"Listen, señorita."
"Uh, I am not looking for a partner."
And you certainly cannot tend bar here.
And you can?
You see that gentlemen at the end of the bar?
He'd eat you like half a sandwich.
I do.
Nicole?
Nicole!
Nicole...
"- This better be good, Conner."
- I have a heart failure patient.
"- You've seen my face, right?"
- I'm sorry?
Beauty rest.
"It's the only shot I got, Conner."
She had a loss and she...
She just collapsed.
"Short of breath, complaining of pain in her chest."
"STAT echocardiogram suggests acute heart failure, ejection fraction is 20 per cent."
"Oh, and I got your email about Dallas."
"- They sucked you in, did they?"
- Looks like it.
"- This patient, she's..."
"- Yeah, look:"
"you and Peter Cutler, you're doomed, Conner."
And then where will you be?
"You'll be in Dallas, surrounded by strange,"
Dallas-like people who don't understand you.
"Sir, the patient is an EMT and her wife died"
- and now I think she's had a heart attack.
- An EMT?
- Nicole Foster.
- Book an angiogram.
I'll be right there.
"Mel, we need to talk."
Are we OK?
"Actually, I'm not so sure."
"–Hey, hey!"
Everything all right?
Yeah.
Just a little spring cleaning.
Let's ride.
I thought this was about I.D'ing somebody.
"Actually, we're more interested in the kidnapping charge... that was filed against you in 1993."
That was a misunderstanding.
"–You were 35 at the time, right?"
–Correct.
–And your girlfriend was in high school?
–She was 18.
And you took her away on vacation for two weeks and never told her parents.
I know.
"In hindsight, it was just a bad judgment call."
But Amanda was an adult.
You're 17 years older than Marcy too.
"You like 'em young, Bob?"
Yeah.
They just...
feel right.
Did Kayla feel right?
I wouldn't know.
–I know how you feel.
–Excuse me?
What'd your partner do?
He's not backing me up on the shooting.
–If that guy costs me a promotion...
–He's not backing you up?
–After all I've covered for him.
–You covered for him?
–What did he do?
We just got back from the Balkans.
What was the artifact you found?
A metal box.
An Ark.
The Ark of Solon?
Atticus thinks so.
But that's incredible.
The Ark of Solon is like the Loch Ness Monster of archaeology.
People think it's a legend.
Isn't it supposed to hold the Torch of Truth from Atlantis?
Don't know.
We haven't opened it yet.
This came off a scratch on the side.
"Can you analyze it for me, please?"
Sure.
I'll run some tests in the lab.
Thanks.
Would you like to carry my books?
"Yeah, sure."
What a madhouse.
How do you stand the noise?
This is the rush hour.
You should be here when it's really quiet.
It's enough to drive you batty.
Kelly!
I'm so sorry I missed your lecture.
It's impossible London traffic.
"Hello, Simon."
"Oh, do you remember--?"
MacGyver.
Professor Carson.
"You were at Thera with that buffoon, Atticus."
I'm going.
Dylan?
"Beka, tell me you are not onandromeda."
I am not onandromeda.
Except i am.
I'm looking for spare parts.
Am i missing anything?
We've been boarded.
Make your way to my quarters.
We'll take back the ship.
"So lock ourselves in and fly to where, exactly?"
"One step at a time, beka."
"Rhade, beka is on deck 41."
We're going to meet at my quarters.
"Beka's back on board, huh?"
"Well, not working out"
"As the greatest plan you ever devised, is it?"
"If you've got a better one, i'd like to hear it."
"See what i mean, rhade?"
Rhade?
They've kept us alive.
Merciful and incompetent.
Really?
Is now the time for insults?
I always wanted you two to bow down before me.
"Hey, guys, what's up?"
Take them away.
There's a class b asteroid
In the abbott belt.
It's hollow.
You don't say.
It is a tesseract generator.
"Yeah, it's Ollie and Danny."
All right.
Never mind his eyes.
What about an airway?
Is he breathing?
"Do you copy, Ollie?"
What else have you got?
Is he conscious?
I don't know what to say.
"His eyes are open, but..."
"It's not the same thing, Ollie."
"Yeah, sorry about that, Kingdom."
We've got a multi-trauma.
Major head injuries.
"He's breathing, dazed, but conscious, probably shocky."
"Minimally responsive, compound fractures to the ribs, both tibia."
Fracture to both ankles.
Looks like his pelvis is fractured as well.
But it's hard to tell.
We've got multiple head injuries.
"BP is 78 over 44, it's going down."
"Respiration is, I'm going to say, 32."
- He's tachy.
- Heartbeat clocking 140.
Make that 150.
"All right, get a line in him, Danny."
Colour?
Saturation?
"His eyes are open and he's still looking around, but..."
There's Ollie the ophthalmologist with more eye data.
Got the line?
Line's in.
Move!
"Sasaoka-sama, open the door, please open the door!"
"Yoshikuni-sama, Yoshikuni-sama!"
Yoshikuni!
Yoshikuni!
Yoshikuni!
Yoshikuni!
You are always looking at me with those eyes... those eyes!
Treating me as a fool!
You will eventually end up in hell anyway!
Yoshikuni!
"Kayo, I'm coming now!"
You are supposed to be protecting me.
Old... mas...ter...
The way people think and the way demons think are different...
I beg of you...
I beg of you!
"I beg of you, I beg of you, I beg of you, I beg of you!"
Think of something!
"Odajima-sama's request, together with this..."
I am left with no other choice.
"Come forth, the Makoto and the Kotowari is known!"
The sword... shall be unsheathed!
What!
This... you let me see this?
You deserve it!
It is best that everyone dies!
"Good, good... cat... you are a good boy..."
No!
Save me!
This is the past.
"Please show us everything, until the end."
"That's you, Frank."
I'm a wild horse.
That's what makes us such a great team.
- It's so unfair.
- What?
"- It's boring, but I give it my all."
- The idea is for her to get off.
- Why don't you lick the alphabet?
- Why?
So she thinks I'm clever?
Haven't you ever licked the alphabet?
"First you lick an A, then a B, C..."
The variation really turns them on.
Everybody does it.
- You never have?
- Never.
- Nicolaj Kopernikus taught me.
- Does he even know the alphabet?
"He told me he'd gotten complaints, so he'd adopted that technique."
- Thanks.
- Cheers.
- Are we going to the office?
"- Yes, but..."
"One, two..."
I can't drive.
Will you give me a lift?
We have to stop by the home and pick up the Gimp.
- You have to meet the mouth painter.
- Right.
But you're using your hand.
Listen...
"The picture you sold me, you painted with your mouth, right?"
"She drank too much, that's all."
"Oh, yeah?"
What about Marseille?
When will you realize nothing's going on...
Too much garlic...
"Let's give her a few days and then, Shai, you go talk to her."
We stressed her out.
You mean I stressed her out?
- I didn't say that.
- Then why did you look at me?
Butt out.
Who asked you?
You're right.
"- Ricky, what are you doing?"
- Going to have some fun.
How did you know my size?
I asked Ricky.
You're tough on him.
"I didn't tell him to come, and you butt out."
Did he cheat on you?
- Did he hit you?
- Are you crazy?
Then what is it?
"You're just like Aunt Rosa, always hiding things."
"That's right, like the adoption thing."
You even hid it from Morn.
Why can't you share?
- None of your business.
- We can help.
How?
You want to be a surrogate mother?
You're such a hypocrite.
"- Let's go make our vision real, dude."
"- Yeah, no, my vision."
"- Yeah, I know, but we're sharing it."
"- Yeah, no."
We're not.
"Get out of here, man."
"Do you even know what friendship is, dude?"
"Does it have anything to do with taking all my money, my drugs, and apparently trying to share my girlfriend?"
- She's not your girlfriend.
- Go.
Get out of here.
"- Go, go."
Get out of here!
"- 'Til next time, Conner."
You need help.
Hey.
"Griff, get out of here!"
Griff!
"- Griff, what..."
"- Natasha, listen to me."
One of the greatest regrets of my life is that you and I...
- No!
"- Natasha, I have so much to tell you."
"- Griff, my boyfriend's upstairs."
- So leave him up there.
- You're high!
- I have important news.
I am no longer clean.
- Listen to me...
"- Griff, I haven't used in months."
You're taking out the recycling in the middle of the night in your pyjamas.
"I mean, what happened?"
What's it like?
The truth?
"Uh... well, you become a supporting character in your own life."
[both chuckle]
"Hey, can I ask you something?"
"I, uh..."
I need an objective opinion.
- Sure.
"- I have this friend, Aaron,"
I love him.
"We go way back, but I'm not sure if he's good to have around me and my family."
What do you mean?
"Well, it's not that he's a bad guy, he's just, uh, misguided."
I'm sorry.
I'm not quite following.
"Wh... if you had to choose between a good friend and doing what's best for your daughter... you're gonna be a father, so what would you do?"
"Well, family always comes first, right?"

Thank you.

Yes.
So what went wrong?
Let me ask you more personal questions.
I need to find out more.
What's your favorite food?
Shrimp dumplings from 7-Eleven.
Your favorite food is from 7-Eleven?
Nothing else to eat at night.
And it tastes good.
They also have rice balls.
Are you joking?
I'm not joking.
They really have them.
"Then on your free days, what do you do?"
Whoa that's hard to answer.
"No, it isn't."
"How about movies, music, the mall, and the beach?"
Nothing?
Everything you said is a waste of time.
How is that entertaining?
"Go to the mall, to do what?"
To buy clothes?
I don't buy any.
You don't buy any clothes at all?
I can still wear my old ones.
We need to talk to you.
Sit down.
- What's going on?
- Don't say anything.
- Just watch.
- (tender music plays)
Baby pictures of Luke?
More than baby pictures.
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.
Why are you doing this?
To get all the crying out of your system so you don't melt down at the graduation.
It's like when you drink too much and your friends get you super-wasted so you never drink again for the rest of the week.

Jackson.
What?
When?
Is Flynn all right?
What can you tell me about Viktor Karp?
I don't know the name.
Karp was moving lithium out of the mine you and mom ran.
ETU raided the offices last week.
He started as a drug runner.
Now he transports weapons.
Is Musa planning an attack?
"- I mean, is that what the Purge is?"
- I...
I don't know.
I never met Karp.
Only your mother dealt with him.
"So Mom dealt with Karp, what did you do?"
I had other business.
I also maintained the family unit.
I took my job seriously.
That part was always real.
Guy's got nine lives.
Got away with just cuts and bruises.
And a hell of a hangover.
We sure it was just an accident?
Doc says his blood alcohol level was 0.23.
"Deliberate, then?"
Because of his wife?
That and he's battle-bent.
Came at me pretty hard yesterday.
- What do you need?
- Just general stuff.
- You guys go and be in love.
- See you back at the house.
What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon in the air?
Would that count?
Sorry.
"No, I should have signaled or honked."
My fault.
"I guess it was inevitable, us running into each other."
- It's a very tiny community.
- I guess so.
- How's the diner?
- It's still there.
Yes.
I knew that.
"I'm able to empirically, with my eyes..."
"- Hey, Luke, do you think we could..."
- I got to get back.
Okay.
Right.
I'll get it.
"- Hi, Grandma."
"- Hello, Rory."
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
I'm thrilled to see you on no notice.
"So tell me, what's this about?"
You were so mysterious on the phone.
I wanted to talk to you about something in person.
"Well, come in."
It's an English tea service.
One of the advantages of our having an English maid.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did."
"Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story."
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Sorry.
"So, what was this advice?"
I might need to plagiarize myself down the line.
You told me that I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"So you've managed to do your own thing, then, huh?"
"Yeah, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities.
"But still, um... you took an interest in me when no one else did."
"That matters, so... thank you."
"Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is uh... that you're happy."
"Are you happy, Sam?"
"- (SIGHS) Well, got another one."
"- Oh, boy."
What's in the box?
(EX CLAIMING) What's in the box?
What's in the box?
What's in the box?
Right?
(LAUGHS)
Brad Pitt?
Se7 en?
Nothing?
you ditch wayne for a rich guy or something?
- nope.
wayne bought it for me.
- where did wayne get that kind of cash?
- working.
i know. go figure.
- huh.
scooch over.
i don't ride back door.
- compromise?
- come here.
ohh.
- [chuckles] [grunts]
[engine turns over] [squeals]
- when do we get our presents?
- your butt's your present.
- your mom's butt's your present.
"- your mom's butt's both of our mom's butt, so shut up."
"- guys, can we make this christmas not be about butts?"
"- well, my butt's out of here -- no presents, no brandie."
- hey!
you sit your butt down!
down.
we're having christmas together if it kills us.
- when's mama coming home?
"- it's christmas, buddy."
she'll be here.
"- yeah, bud. don't worry."
- i always wondered what it would be like on a brand-new harley under a beautiful tree.
[engine shuts off]
- no. keep it on.
"- say we lose these for a couple hours, huh?"
We don't want to be tripping over each other.
I don't know of any operation.
You recognise this guy?
No.
Is he American?
Don't know.
He's not in our database.
- You mind running him for me?
- Sure.
No problem.
Appreciate it.
- How long you been stationed here?
- Six months.
"- How do you like Vancouver, so far?"
- I love it.
You're with Organised Crime?
I'm the director of the OCU.
I've got a question for you.
Maybe you could help me out.
We just started an operation on a biker gang up here.
Got a long reach into the States.
Maybe you could share some intel?
You're talking about the Disciples?
A guy named Dante.
Dante Ribiso.
They're some bad boys.
I'll put together an intel package for you.
Let me see what I can find out about this guy.
- Give me a couple of days.
- Sounds good.
There she is!
- Show me what you got.
"Ah, you mean Monsieur Chopin."
How clever.
"It's very rare to hear him play, you know."
The Duchess d'Antan is having him for a whole fortnight at her house in Angers.
I couId only wish I were a fly on the wall.
Except that they already have crowds of files down there.
I do find the provinces beastIy.
- (applause)
- Monsieur Liszt will play next.
"- Ah, George."
I read your...
- In a minute.
George!
"You'II want to sit over here, my dear."
The respectable people are over there.
- could you point out Monsieur Chopin?
- Chopin?
But he left.
Don't you know him?
He's frail as a holy wafer.
Look at those hypocrites.
They've shunned me all evening.
I'm thrilled not to be one of them any more.
Their lives are so boring.
You see?
Every single one is throbbing for him.
They know perfectly well why I ran off with him.
For his teeth.
(plays theatrical piece)
(shrieks excitedly)
charles?
charles!
I wiIIjust come back.
Dont hang up.
Good morning!
Here are the papers and here are your90 Iakhs!
Come in!
"please, come in!"
Come in!
"please, come in!"
"Man, how did you know that I will.."
..definitely make a deal on 90 lakhs?
"Dhanraj, I know how much each man is worth!"
I know pressure points for everyone!
Take this.
You know there is a saying in our Gujrati.
Dont make a deal with a man to..
..whom you dont understand!
But I am making this deal because..
..I can get you guys!
Because its profitable for me!
Take this.
Just tell me one thing.
Does your boss want to start a price war?
"No, he is planning totally different!"
He wants to throw down those who are at the top!
Good day!
"And enjoy your self, please!"
The money has arrived!
The money has arrived!
Its tune is soothing!
Its tune is soothing!
The money has arrived!
Coming!
"Hi, sweetie."
"See, why did you just call me ""sweetie""?"
- We always call each other that.
- Why?
"All right, look, I wanna say something, okay?"
"We call each other ""sweetie"" all the time."
And we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours.
I washed your hair for you after you had shoulder surgery and everything.
And it's like we're together.
- I know that I've been...
"- No, hold on a second."
Let me finish.
I think maybe this is my fault because maybe I wasn't clear about exactly what I want.
So let me...
Let me be clear.
I love hanging out.
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just...
I want both.
I don't know what happened or why we stopped.
I don't care.
Okay.
- What?
- Okay.
"No, I'm talking about really doing this."
Like a full-on relationship.
Right.
With me.
Yeah.
A bunch of gay people put you up to this?
Stop talking.
DEVON:
I'm so thirsty.
Life is so wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
"I'd like to introduce my friend, Count Casanova."
Let the count sit down.
"Count, these are three prize-winning beauties of Pankow."
Let me talk to my friend a minute.
"My dear Reinhold, I'm always so happy to see you."
You need another man?
You'd need a radiator to thaw that one out!
"- Shall I tickle you, darling?"
- Give us a smile!
- Pay no attention to them.
- You're quite the ladies' man.
"Scram for a while, girls."
These dames mean nothing to me.
"But at home I have a real pearl, a treasure, a jewel."
Why don't you bring her along?
"No, better to leave her home."
No need to drag women everywhere.
Of course!
What do you think?
Those crooks steal and cheat.
- Crooks?
And Franz frightens me too.
Franz?
He's done time too.
Tegel.
Four years.
Prison.
That's right ― Franz.
"I tell you, she's wonderful."
Let me help you.
Funk the groovin' thang whistlin'
As I rip my rhymes
Time and time again struttin' and in the summertime

What's going on?
"We're in Birmingham, Alabama."
Are we supposed to be here?
What's going on?
"- Why did you bring us here, dude?"
"- What do you mean, why did l--"
"You were supposed to be following the directions, asshole."
- Someone's desperate for a diet coke!
"- No, Simon's been attacked by a kid..."
Here?
"What did he do, headbutt him in the knee?"
No.
"Kicked him in the cock, actually, but listen..."
Please say you aren't asking me to protect you from children?
"Hmm, a bit."
"All right, Cholmondley-Warner?"
Is this your bird?
Nice to meet you.
You're just like Will said you was.
- Right.
I hope that's a compliment.
"- Oh, yeah it is."
"You wouldn't mind having a quick word with our boss Jim on the old blower, OK?"
- Please don't.
- New friend?
- From work experience.
A colleague.
- Jim for ya.
"Ignore everything he says, it's bollocks, I promise."
Hello.
Right.
"No, I'm not his girlfriend, no."
"No, we didn't have sex."
"He did, did he?"
"No, that didn't happen."
"No, I'm not a porn star."
"Charlotte, listen..."
I was working in a garage.
You don't understand what it's like.
The Lord is against you.
And cursed is the fruit of your womb ...

The knot's interesting

"Chicago Massacre of 1930, no lift!"
There is a friend of Mickey's.
"Come on, it burns."
"You must go, now!"
"- Relax, man!"
"Gary, Gary, can we please just get out of here?"
Please?
What the hell?
Sorry I lost my temper back there.
"No, it's okay."
You were just defending my honor.
I don't feel so good.
Get you a glass of water.
"I know people say you're a jerk, but... they just don't know the real you."
I'm just gonna put this here.
You're gonna need that.
And a truckload of aspirin.
Get some sleep.
Hello?
So this barbecue on Saturday...
- Yes?
- I was just wondering if there was gonna be a smoked brisket involved.
Wait.
So you'll come based on the meat?
Yes.
"Yes, that's the deciding factor."
Done.
So what's up for tonight?
Not much.
Just a quiet evening at home.
You?
Not a lot... just getting my daily dose of jazz.
You hear it?
Love that one.
Crank it up.
You've got something right here on your...
"Put it down, put it down."
- Let it go.
Put it down.
- I'm taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't work with this guy.
You can't work with me?
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
"I've been here for eight years, and you're just another untalented pretty face."
"- Billy, calm down."
- Untalented?
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up!
"It has nothing to do with you, you moron!"
"Billy, I've warned you before about your attitude."
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
"No, no, fired?"
"Wait, no, don't fire him."
"Look, see, I'm moving it."
I'm moving the cable.
Get him out of here.
"- Stan, don't do this."
"Please, not now?"
"- Come on, I'm sorry."
"- It's too late, Billy."
"Joey, can I ask you a question?"
Do you like my shoes?
Yeah.
Why?
Just wondering.

Who is she?
Her name's Lin.
Her father was chief of the Hang Pham Province.
Until he refused to cooperate with the Viet Cong.
- And then they killed him?
- They murdered him.
And her little brother.
In a most hideous way.
That's their style.
Besides being one of our top models she could be most helpful to our government.
"Are you trying to tell me something, colonel?"
That gentleman seated with her.
He's a double agent.
He works for us and for General Pham Son Ti.
"Then tell me, colonel who will she be helpful to?"
[SINGING]
"Colonel Morgan, there's a big buildup around Camp A-107."
It could be the real thing.
They've requested tac air and a flare ship.

Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.

SEAN:
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired of feeling slightly terrified all the time.
It's not like I wanna be.
Empty.
Empty?

It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"[victor] sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself
And walk along the ledge.
"[Letha] Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.

Look what you've done.

Never seen him.

Sorry to... bother you.
My name's DC Edwards.
I'm from Hackney Police.
Do you recognise this man at all?
"Er... no, sorry."
No.
We'd have a better chance getting Clifford's mates to tap-dance than co-operate.

You can drive.
I nearly bust a stitch going down those stairs.

Look at me.
Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
there was 30 billion a year in cargo and we tried to steal every bit of it.
we grew up near the airport.
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over it.
They would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out.
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble
Paulie'sunionpeoplescaredthem  with a strike.
I did not say anything.
"No, we are not allowed to say."
He said not to talk assignment.
Thi What did he say?
"No, no ..."
Nonsense!
I do not believe it.
- To think about how to get out of here ..
- Thi-thin mouth!
Damn.
He told me to ...
I can not do what I asked.
You must stop this.
"No, no, please!"
"- Room, microphone ..."
Move!
- Are you sick!
If you do not see us or hear us ...
This will end the game.
Do not trust anyone but yourself.
"Sitting or hit you, you fool!"
Duties ...
I can not do.
You know what to say to me?
To kill anyone when you ask me.
Do not you understand?
"Do not want to kill us, want to punish us"
Do you think it will be a loved membiarakan If you follow the rules?
- Are you an idiot Dave.
- Are you crazy?
We can not do anything with it.
We must do what we were told.
"Go, go, go!"
Everything ok in there?
I thought I heard something.
It's fine...
Dolores.
- How you've been?
- I thought I heard somethin'.
"You know, I did too."
Sound it's like coming from the upstairs again.
I was sure it was coming from here.
- Did you try next door?
- Are you sure everything's okay in there?
Yes.
"I really should go now, Dolores."
You take care.
- Well ain't...
- Dolores!
Dolores...
Take care.
- Couldn't get it right... go!
- Go!
"115th precinct, Officer Minocha speaking."
There's something wrong in the apartment down the hall from me.
"We're going to take care of him too, you know."
I know.
- I think we should do it now.
- Why?
He's sleeping...
it will be merciful.
"Oh I thought, we're out of bullets again."
"We are, but I can run out and go get some more somewhere real quick."
We couldn't even do it now even if we had the bullets.
Okay.
"Al this hour, we'd have to add the daytime fee, too."
What do you mean?
If checking in before 11 PM we charge both the daytime and overnight fee.
What a rip off.
What're you doing?
It's my first bed in so long!
Feels nice and soft.
You stink.
I haven't bathed in over a week.
Huh?
Are you homeless or something?
"When I have money, I get a room."
When you don't?
Shall I pay first?
"It's okay, you already paid for food and hotel."
But that doesn't include sex.
Are you a saint?
Most guys usually expect sex.
"One time, a guy expected sex for buying me lunch."
Bunch of assholes.
"Right, bunch of assholes."
"Anyway, you should take a bath."
Okay.
"Wow, a jacuzzi!"
Hello?
How is it?
Nabbed a high schooler.
Underage fetches top money.
Make her fall for you.
"Leave it to me, I'll reel her in."
You better.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Do you want me to stay?
I can sleep on the couch.
I've done it before.
"No, I have to learn to be alone."
Hello.
"- Hello, everyone."
- Good morning.
Washing her hair?
What do you think?
- How was the night?
- Normal.
"Give me that, I'll do it."
I'm off.
- So long.
"- Bye, Matilde."
It's so hot!
We should cut her hair.
Cut it short.
It's more practical and comfortable.
We'll leave it like it was when she arrived here.
So it won't look different if she awakes.
"After four years in a coma, it would be a miracle."
I believe in miracles.
And so should you.
- Why me?
- Because you really need them.
"One could happen to you, and you wouldn't even realize."
"God, it's so hot!"
I bought something in the drugstore to help stop the perspiration stains on my uniform.
Your armpits don't sweat but the rest...
That's S.L.
Hello.
"Yes, I'm Babette."
So are we going?
Are we staying?
"No, we have to go."
"Fine, okay."
Good.
If you're looking for me.
I'll be here.
Bye.
Where did you pick up the little one?
Blonde angel.
She just appeared.
How come that doesn't happen to me?
You are too pretty.
Should I make myself ugly or what?
Disguise yourself.
Take a look at this.
You know what this looked like before?
No idea.
I do.
What do we do now?
Do you want me to retrieve the file?
"If you ask me, It was a Halloween prank by a couple of kids from the tattoo shop."
"From earth, the sun and the moon appear to be the same size."
Is it coincidental or physical necessity?
This is good.
"So tell me, what kind of quiz show is this?"
Sauerbruch...
Who would be interested in that?
I don't want to discuss it with you now.
- Where's Ted Carter?
Right here.
Let's stop that corny music and do some serious dancing.
- Those are good records.
- These are new ones.
- I brought some mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?
"- Hang it high, will you?"
- Only if I can kiss Betty.
"Tonight, nobody is safe from me."
"- Hey, Christmas is eight months away."
- I do my Christmas kissing early.
- Hey!
- Where's the punch?
- It's over there.
"- Oh, good."
- Add the old family formula.
"- Now you're talking, Rod."
My mother wouldn't want me to...
- Don't tell me she's here.
"- No, she's at the movies."
Put the booze in the bowl.
That's the one thing she made me promise.
You want to have a party or not?
- You can't fight city hall.
- Put the liquor in.
Forget it.
I know 10 other ways to make a party successful.
"Now, first, we gotta make the atmosphere a little more intimate."
"Rodney, aren't you the one."
- Evening.
- Good evening.
Come to our house to eat.
She's right.
You ought to quit being such a stranger.
"Now, I'd like to propose a toast."
- To Vince Hardy.
- The best Captain of Homicide ever.
Vince Hardy.
How about we drink to my mother?
"She was a Hardy, too."
"And Jimmy, let's drink to him."
It'd be fitting here by the river.
Uncle Vince is dead.
"They're dead, too."
Drink to Jimmy!
- That's enough!
"- No, It's not enough, damn it!"
- Let go of me.
I'm all right.
- You don't belong here.
"- Me and you, Eddie."
- Anytime.
The best day of the year.
Better than Christmas!
- Are these policemen all relatives?
"- No, they're just criminals."
How did they end up on the force?
"Part of some nationwide negative gene pool, I guess."
"- Don't do that, okay?"
- What?
That thing where you're not really talking to me.
- That's not the answer.
- It'll do till the answer turns up.
Mm.
"Well, you're on medical suspension, so if this shit's in California, it's shady as hell."
[Locker door closes]
[Sighs] Does Alvey know?
Doesn't matter.
I'm taking the fight.
"Okay, then."
See you out there.
[Knock on door]
How you feeling?
Lisa:
I'm so tired I can barely move.
What did the doctor say?
"Apparently, feeling like shit is perfectly normal."
[Door closes]
"You know, if I could carry this child for you, I would."
Really?
Yeah.
You're amazing.
How did I ever find you?
The universe fucking loves you.
[Laughs]
You see me work with your girl?
I did.
What do you think?
Honestly?
She doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.
She got some talent.
What's her story?
She's had a few fights.
She's got a shitty record.
"She's bounced around a bunch of gyms, and she had a falling out with Marco over at team elite."
"Now, I think we`re moving further--"
"Good shot, Audrey."
"Dad, I forgot."
Why aren`t we flying?
Because getting there is half the fun!
You know that!
"I turned off the water, the stove, the heat and the air locked the door, notified the police, stopped the papers."
I called to get the grass cut.
Did I put the timers on the Iiving-room lights?
Don`t forget the mail....
So long!
"Drive careful now, clark!"
Watch those freeways!
Good-bye!
I know I`ve forgotten something.

"It's late, why do you come?"
"Miss Shui, Chan Mon-gut is a real creep."
"I've followed him for decades, he treats me badly too."
Don't you think he will be nice to you instead?
Any other thing else?
Miss Shui...
You are old enough to get married.
Take this piece ofjade.
Come on.
Go in and get some clothes.
"Follow me to Hong Kong, will you?"
You...
No?
"It's a long road to Hong Kong, take this piece ofjade with you."
"If you meet the bandits, you still have something valuable, thus they won't kill you."
"It's late, better go now."
Take care.
Master.
Where is the guy who sold this piece ofjade?
"None of my business, I don't know shooting."
I didn't kill!
I didn't kill...
I didn't kill!
Go!
I am innocent!
Go in.
Foreigner?
You murderer!
"Uncle, what did he scold me?"
No...
Help!
Are you going to torture me?
That's platinum.
"Oh, no wonder it looks so different."
"Well, there's nothing wrong with your watch, sir."
"You have 11:00, too."
"Yeah, but it should be five minutes past eleven."
"I always set my watch, you know, five minutes fast."
"You know, you're always racing against time 24 hours a day."
"Excuse me, sir, are those men members of your crew?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
They're with us all the time.
Good.
I think I'll have a word with them.
Thank you very much for everything.
"Excuse me, sir."
"Lieutenant Columbo, LAPD."
I wonder if I can have a word with you?
MAN 1:
"We're gonna have the hotel in the shot, right?"
MAN 2:
Everything.
"On the master, right?"
"In the master, right."
Okay.
This is where...
He comes up right here.
Can I ask you this?
What now?
This is just the way we discussed it.
This we do on stage...
"This is on stage three, right?"
Right.
I didn't mean to do this.
She suddenly attacked me.
I'm the victim here.
Wipe your mouth.
So you didn't mean to?
Who took off your pants?
I didn't go near her at all!
- Please believe me!
- Shut up!
Have a good time.
Sorry?
Am I allowed?
Sure.
You can even have her for a month.
Hurry on.
Wait!
Make him feel at home.
- Yes!
"- Hey, hey!"
Sir!
A month?
What am I supposed to do for a month?
What the hell's this?
What the?
Is she crazy to get married?
What the hell's going on today?
Excuse me?
Hello?
She's so good.
She takes after her mom for making men go crazy.
"While citizens are in a state of fear, policed discovered the identity of the axed woman found near Nam Mountain yesterday."
"Police said the 25 year-old victim worked at a drinking establishment, and presumed that the brutal murder was enacted out of revenge."
Ah!
That's it!
That's it!
A loudspeaker in the shop!
Just like they have in supermarkets.
-
- Where are you going?
-
- With regular announcements to customers.
A speaker pointing that way so it'll reach the people in the street.
Where's he going?
Come back.
Don't leave me here.
"Look, don't..."
Will you...
Don't!
Aghh!
Don't leave me!
"Granville, get me that yellow screwdriver."
Don't worry about it.
It's only been two or three days.
You'll be walking fine in a couple of years.
Don't know what took you so long to get me out.
I've got a business to run.
I can't afford to spend time opening errand boys!
(GRANVILLE GROANS)
There you are.
Think where your trendiness has got you.
I brought you up to be a normal lad and suddenly you go bent.
I know you're trying to talk me out of it.
I'm not going to be talked...
Ow!
"Oh, that jail had a particular smell."
- Like lilacs dipped in urine.
- Nice.
- Yeah!
"- Oh, no."
This is the best day of my life.
Who knew you were the black sheep of the family?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
- I'm proud.
- Shut up.
"- Give me a high-five, Mom."
- No!
God.
"- So, what's up?"
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.
Holly's going to the board to try to overturn your decision
- not to counter on the vineyard.
- That woman is a nut job.
I'm backing her play.
You're what?
"I think the opportunity's right, the investment is right and I think it's what Dad wanted."
I'm voting with Holly.
- What happens now?
- We go downstairs.
Then what?
"I'm going to my office, check my e-mail."
Do whatever you want.
- About you and me.
- I just covered that.
"Office, e-mail..."
"I mean, if you don't think that this is going to work, then I understand."
And you felt as if they were coming after you?
- And I started to run...
- But?
And then...
I don't know what happened.
You did something.
I think so.
GUARD:
"This way, folks."
Come down this way as quickly as you can.
SECOND GUARD:
"All right, folks, calmly."
This way.
"Quickly as you can, please move down."
Just follow them.
Thank you.
Right through the barricades there.
That's right.
Do you wanna know what I'm worried about?
I wanna know who's gonna feed my cats.
We'll all be out of here soon.
You'll be home to feed them yourself.
And what if that doesn't happen?
"Relax, Dorothy."
The aliens'll feed 'em.
"Yeah, they're old friends of your cats, right?"
What?
What are you looking at?
"You really think if you're cruel enough to other people, all your own misery will go away?"
No.
Just keeps my mind off it for a while.
RAY:
- What are you doing?
- What?
"Well, the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan."
"You know, not to hopscotch down memory lane."
- I was just trying to make conversation.
- Try less.
Caroline.
Katherine.
"I'm sorry, you have the wrong person."
"Elena, come on."
My mistake.
- How's everything going?
- Matt's cheating.
"No need, I'm awesome."
Stefan Salvatore.
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's great.
So you haven't seen him before?
"No, there was nothing familiar about him at all."
Let's call it a night.
Send Matt and Caroline home?
"No, the whole point of tonight was to not have to deal with this stuff."
We need to get through one night.
One normal night.
You sure?
"No, I'm not sure."
But I don't know what else to do.
"Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow."
We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Okay.
That's them.
Come here.
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the treehouse.
But he's a savage!
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
"Come on and get this boat out to sea, you lazy lot!"
"All right, all right!"
You'll be kissing the daughter before too long!
We're off to sea while the tide's still with us!
"One, two, heave!"
"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
- We've all had our fill of jacob moore.
- I know.
So I'm ceasing this ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below!
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Hub sheets!
Hands to the jeers!
- Stow the prisoners!
"- Aye-aye, sir!"
"Ah, lookie here."
Dr. Dapper in the men's room with the carbon fiber knife.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"How we doing, McGee?"
"Good, boss."
Bishop and Jake made their flight.
And I actually got a text from Tony.
"Apparently, Senior... missed his flight from London and neglected to tell him."
So Tony didn't have to be there?
Nope.
But he's gonna go back tomorrow.
Senior-- he never disappoints.
"And as for our giving thanks, would anyone care to join me for a celebratory cocktail?"
"On me, of course."
"Oh, then I'm in."
"Me, too."
Me three!
Me three!
Gibbs?
"No, wait."
Before that...
I have a better idea.
Snow angels.
I'll give you one.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Ladies and gentlemen
We'd like to welcome you on board.
We're going to take off shortly.
Please turn off all electronic devices.
Fasten your seatbelt.
Put your seat back upright and return the table to its locked position.
I'm fed up with pinnies and vests.
They can seriously interfere with your social life.
I'll deal with you in a minute when I've f--finished shaping up this sharp fingernail.
Get on out of it!
And d--do your shirt up!
You're too short for that sort of thing!
People will mistake you for a very tall man with his flies undone!
I'm sharpening it!
I'm supposed to be b--blunting it!
-
- C--Cover your chest!
-
- I prefer to show me dangler.
You wh...
You what?
And take them g--glasses off.
You look like Secret Squirrel!
-
"- What is that thing, any road?"
-
- It's temporary till I find a proper one.
-
- Wh--What is it temporarily?
-
- It's a cocoa tin lid.
It looks all right from a distance.
"Is that what you want the world to say of your dangler? ""All right from a distance""?"
"Dear, dear!"
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Oh, Granville!"
"Hello, Julie!"
Oh!
"Can I see your driver's license, please?"
But I don't understand how that happened.
I just...
- You lose something?
- A few hundred pounds of baby food.
- Now are you gonna help or what?
- Sure.
Okay.
No problem.
Call Caltrans.
Tell them to get a unit to clear this up.
And will you take over here?
We're supposed to be at central for a court call.
All right.
Okay.
"When you get reloaded, just make sure that latch is secure, okay?"
Yeah.
I'll sit on it if I have to.
I'm sorry.
I could have sworn I locked her up.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
We're late.
Getraer gets nervous when I'm not on time.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, what's he gonna do?"
"I mean, you're already on probation."
Yeah.
"If he had his way, he'd put my whole family on probation."
"Honey, look."
It's gotta be worth at least 40 bucks.
Chippies.
"To save you from making a terrible mistake try, Mike."
"Just come to the hut, and talk to me."
- Prepare for the money.
"- Mike, give me Bella!"
Wait a second.
- Why are we going?
It came to the new.
- It's about right.
I did not love.
- So why do we are going back?
- Just in case he.
- How did that happen?
- Sculpture Mike'ta.
I have no doubt.
- Do you have any idea where that is?
Diamond had left outside his home to watch.
This morning I was riding in a taxi with his sister.
- Diamond followed them to the hotel.
"- So, Do you have any idea about the statue where you placed?"
- Who knows?
Can be anywhere!
"- Jade, tell me, hell no!"
Bringing me there!
Why not?
Been a long time.
Do not worry.
I take care of him.
I trust to do.
"commonwithme if youdid ,wouldbethesmartestmove."

"Yes, I did my Sultana"
İbrahim Paşa is not in his room
I knocked the door but the door is locked
"If you want to say something important, you can say it to me and I'll have it delivered to him"

I'll bring him to your knees
"Anything to make you smile, my Sultana"
We have been riding for long days.
Won't you rest my Bey?
"- Just take it easy, take-take it easy."
"- Justin, don't!"
- Don't what?
Do this?
This is what happens when people don't follow orders.
"Luke, chairs, bring them."
Do it!
"Justin, I don't know what it is you think we've done but really, you've got this wrong, all wrong."
We haven't done anything.
- You need to stop this.
"- Gemma, quiet."
Eleanor!
Gemma!
Take a seat.
"This is it, isn't it?"
This is why we're here?
I said take a seat.
Luke!
Their hands.
Bind them.
"No phone calls, people."
Use some bloody common sense.
"Luke, bring over the other chairs."
Snap to it!
Then collect up their car keys and their mobile phones.
There's a lock box on the workbench.
Chris...
"I know you're waiting, mate."
Picking the right moment.
This is not that moment.
I'm quicker than you and I've got a gun.
"And, uh, I absolutely won't miss."
Bullshit!
He can arrest you!
"I'm gonna tell you something, but you have to promise never to repeat it, especially to Shane."
- Tell me what?
"- Swear to me, never to Shane."
Fine.
Peter and I are technically...
We're...
What?
We're married.
I know it sounds crazy.
"It kind of is crazy, but sometimes you do crazy things when you have no choice, and I had no choice."
"It's a business arrangement, pure and simple."
I know what you're thinking.
I loved your father.
I still love him.
"This has nothing to do with Judah or marriage, really."
It's business.
You married him.
"Silas, I know how strange this all sounds."
- It's Dad's birthday!
- I know.
"But he's dead, so what difference does it make?"
Stop playing the dead-dad card!
The wrong parent died!
And you know what?
Tough shit.
Get your ass back there and watch Willy fucking Wonka!
"Go, go, go!"
- Clear.
- Clear.
There's three.
Four.
I love you.

- That was really sweet.
I just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night.

- We broke up.
But everything was so perfect.
Turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.
Like everything on the upper east side
"Thanks, Mum, but it's okay."
"No, really."
I want to go to McDonald's.
"You know, I'm not really hungry."
Come on.
Are you telling me you couldn't murder a Big Mac?
Mum!
"Okay, another time."
Any time.
"I'll be around a while, you know."
By the following Christmas things were back to normal.
Before you came...
Every man is an island.
And I stand by that.
"But clearly, some men are part of island chains."
Below the surface of the ocean they're actually connected.
"So you're going to marry my mum, then?"
Don't know.
Why?
You think she's up for it?
- I used to want him to marry my mum.
- You serious?
Yeah.
But that was when she was depressed and I was desperate.
"Thanks, mate."
Cheers.
How do you use this blender-thing?
You don't.
I used to think two wasn't enough.
Christ.
Now there were loads of people.
And that was great.
- That's enough.
- I thought you quit smoking.
- The gum didn't work.
Who's she?
- That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know about that?
"- No, why should I?"
Coming back to the force?
See what you're missing?
Tommy!
- You want to get some dinner?
- What did I say?
- I just invited him to dinner.
- Go up there!
- He hasn't changed a bit.
"- Yeah, that's the problem."
- What do you know?
- We just fished out the body.
Don't play games with me.
I want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear it.
It's the same guy.
- The same guy?
As in Polish Hill?
- Fair hair.
Good bodies.
"These women were shot, not strangled."
They had neck bruises and were bound wrist and ankle.
- Eiler told me you know this girl.
- A lot of guys knew her.
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to solve this case."
"You know, ever since I was 16, I crushed exams."
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
"Man, I gave up everything."
"You know, I gave up fun."
I gave up sex.
I don't think you gave up sex.
- Okay.
Maybe not sex.
"- Yeah, you didn't give up sex."
"All right, all right."
"Not sex, but..."
It just annoys me that the one thing that is stopping me from going to Harvard Med is money.
"You know, tuition fees and living expenses alone cost over $300,000."
"$300,000."
It's outrageous.
It's astronomically high.
I get that.
"You know, I just thought there was more to life than just money."
"Well, look at the bright side,"
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
Thank you.
"- Happy birthday, honey."
"- Thanks, Mom."
"Thank you, love."
Kisses.
Make a wish.
- Make a wish.
- Okay.
Bravo.
"Congratulations, Benjamin."
"No, we gotta have a Negro."
This guy right here.
"Negro, front row."
"- Mr. Nixon, sir."
- Yeah.
We-We all knowthatyou have builtyour career... on smearing people as Communists.
"And nowyou are building your campaign on the divisions in this country, stirring up hatred and turning people against each other."
Whatthe fuck's he doing?
He's making a speech!
- Cut him off.
- I can't.
This isn't Russia.
He sounds like a negro.
He's saying all these negro things!
- What's he doing?
- He sounded white when we screened him.
He doesn'tsound white now.
He sounds like Angela Davis.
When are you going to tell us whatyou really stand for?
- Puton a commercial.
- There are no commercials.
- Go to commercial!
"- You boughtthe whole half hour, baby."
- Are you going to take offthat mask...
- Shit!
And show us who you really are?
- [Man] Shut up and sit down.
I - okay.
Okay.
"- It's a high hard one, Chief."
"- Okay, okay."
- Park it.
- Never heard of her.
- You will.
She's in trouble.
Impossible.
It must be a mistake.
(Sighs)
A bomb...
"Yes, a bomb would do it."
"A bomb would blow him and his records and the barge to kingdom come, yet it wouldn't hurt anyone else."
Yes.
But where do we get a bomb from?
"Well, if you only want a little one you'd have to go to Ireland."
Honestly!
"Bomb, indeed."
Get the whole mad idea out of your head.
Ireland...
That's it!
(Irish accent) Ireland!
You remember that old villain at the Dublin show.
He was still at it.
Get me a sprig of that stuff they wear in the buttonhole.
What is it?
- Shillelagh.
"- No, shamrock, you twit."
"And book me on the first plane to Dublin in the morning, right?"
(Sniffles and sneezes)
Henry?
Henry?
Please don't ask any more questions about that storm.
An orphan of the storm has just arrived.
- What?
- Your girl.
We'll make you a winner right here.
"You're not a New Yorker, are you?"
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
Huey Long country.

Thank you so much.
Lovely evening.
"Kevin, give me a call in the morning."
I need some stuff for the New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
- Let me assure you...
- The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
"MacNeil-Lehrer, Friday night."
Zapatti's bullet killed the child.
It wasn't the cop.
That's it!
That's what passes for good news these days.
I'll take it.
I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"Exemplary, but an odd thing:"
It's front-loaded.
- With who?
- With supervisory personnel.
But it's signed off on by an honest judge.
- Judge Walter Stern?
- If you need anything else...
Yeah.
"Actually, um, is there any reason why people would be uncomfortable with me being here?"
No reason.
It's great.
But I'm swamped.
I should go.
"No, no, please."
"Really, I feel like I have spinach in my teeth and nobody is telling me."
We all just really care about the senator.
"Personally, I think you make a really cute couple."
Couple!
C...
Couple?
No.
"No, no, no, no, no."
We are...
That...
No.
There's no couple.
I'm just part of his communications staff.
- There's no coupling.
- I get it.
You want to keep it on the down low.
I don't want to keep it on the down or the low.
I don't want to keep it anywhere.
There's nothing to keep anyway.
- I arranged for you to go to his ranch.
- For the day.
For the day.
It was one day.
It turned into just a couple of hours.
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
- What did your father say?
"- Nothing, what could he say?"
- Is he dead?
"- Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
- Doesn't he come to see you?
- No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Well...
What's your problem?
Me?
None.
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
- It wasn't that special.
- It was.
Very special.
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
-It is not possible!
-Following.
How you are called?
-Mukendi Ngalula.
-Mukendi what?
-Mukendi Ngalula.
What do you want?
A skull.
In order to have dinner tonight.
Take care well.
"Doctor, is a call for you."
Following.
It says?
"Hello, Laura."
"Yes, you tell me, you tell me."
"I assure it to you, one is the Disease of Addison."
You do not worry.
"If it is cured in time, it does not pass anything."
"You hear, is a human case."
"That poor man is counted everything to me,"
"He does not have family, not even it has Social Security."
"In agreement, agreement."
"It hears, Laura, now I have class, already you understand to me..."
"Yes, I understand."
This one case does not interest to you.
"Well, I will do that they enter position to him."
"You do not worry, I will not take to the clinic of Ciotti."
"In agreement, yes."
Goodbye.
"-God mine, I am bad."
-What happens to you?
I am bad.
This is it.
Someone must have knocked this over.
No!
It's not here!
No!
It's not here!
My engine!
I've just completed it!
It's gone!
"Please stay back, Mr. Mac Bain."
It's too dangerous.
The engine was just completed?
No...
It can't be.
The efforts of a lifetime have been...
We understand how you feel.
"Mac, please get a hold of yourself."
"Chief, one of our fire trucks has disappeared!"
That's impossible!
Keep looking!
I made some hot soup.
"Please have some, it'll make you feel better."
You're welcome to stay here if you'd like.
Thank you very much for your kindness.
"Oh, dear, I don't think you should give up just because the engine..."
No!
There's no hope whatsoever.
It's all over!
Your wife is correct.
"I think it's too early to give up, Mac."
Spare me your empty words of comfort.
"I am giving you no such thing, sir."
They have flown over the White House.
It is an unbelievable moment down here.
People are going wild.
And Emily Cale is undoubtedly a beautiful hero of the day.
Emily Cale is a little hero.
This is an unprecedented moment in U. S. history.
That search you requested came back.
"Emily, can you believe how many people have seen your video blog?"
It's not a video blog.
It's a YouTube channel.
Howmany?
Seven hundred million people.
Daughters.
Jesus!
"Oh, my God."
Are you okay?
Honest Abe.
My wife got this for me.
For the inauguration.
Are you kidding me?
You got shot in the wa..?
What I'm telling you is that good old Abe took a second bullet for me.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you did for Emily.
"It's my sacrifice, right?"
"Yes, sir."
Yep.
"John, listen."
This isn't over yet.
Walker had no prior contact..
"with any of the terrorists, but someone else did."
"Wait, wait, wait."
(Footsteps)
(Engine starts)
"Beautiful night, Constable."
Beautiful night.
"Excuse me, sir, you got..."
Oh!
Oh!
You.
Mr Creeping Alopecia.
No you don't!
There's something fishy here.
"There'll be something even fishier soon, sir."
We're going to stay here and discuss this very quietly.
"""Mystery explosion wrecks peer's car""!"
"Well, Henry?"
What's going on?
Come on.
Out with it.
I'm cheesed off.
"If it isn't police or reporters, it's you."
Just a couple of minor accidents and a girl I'll never see again.
(Knock on door)
"Miss Melissa Right to see you urgently, sir."
"So, we're off again."
"Show her in, Maria."
Show her right in.
"Bathing again, or is this a dry day?"
"Good morning, my dear."
How very nice to see you again.
My husband was afraid we'd seen the last of you.
I have a feeling you won't be needing your frogman's flippers today.
- You shouldn't have come here.
I will wait for you.
Some people are born to wait.
I will come.
But I will be late.
Okay?

"his passions, his pursuits?"
- He has a smart little pointer...
- Where is Allenham?
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.
Lady Allen is the name.
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.
Come in.
"Good morning, Brandon."
- How is the invalid?
"- Thank you so much, Colonel."
Why set your cap at Willoughby when you've already made such a conquest?
I'll not set my cap at anyone.
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits.
For he's to inherit.
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.
I'd not give him up to a younger sister for tumbling down hills.
The man himself.
Come.
Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.
Thank you so much for calling.
Marianne.
The colonel and Sir John are leaving.
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.
"- How do you do, Colonel?"
- Are you lonely?
- Yes.
I have no expectations.
Nothing.
We should earn the real thing without any help from others.
But I think I still want to get it through people.
I know I shouldn't expect it of them.
- A real pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.
"Me, too."
"You know my intentions were genuine earlier, right?"
"Yes, of course."
You never quit.
So strange.
I wonder what's so fun about it.
They're just enjoying themselves.
Why did Nature have to divide us into male and female?
I'm so sick of it.
"You're a male, yourself."
You know that.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's why I'm like this.
Want to drink some more?
"Yes, well, as you like."
As I like?
So you want to drink more or not?
"Really, do as you like."
"If you want to drink, then do so."
"Okay, I'll go buy some more."
"Moonsook, I need to ask you something."
Can you come over here?
Sure.
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I'm scared.
There's no reason to be.
Everything's okay.
I could have been a better person.
I could have done more.
You did enough.
Stay with me.
It won't be much longer.
I'll stay right here.
- Let me see.
- I think I singed my eyebrow.
I need to see.
You thought it was a good idea to put kerosene in your barbecue?
- I thought it was lighter fluid.
- It doesn't look burnt.
I'll check for corneal burns with an ultraviolet light.
I need everything documented.
Worker's comp.
- You're a chef?
- It was my summer office party.
"Oh, I don't think that counts."
Any word on the air conditioning?
- Yeah.
They think it'll be fixed by winter.
- I can't work like this.
- You want a Big Stick?
- No.
- Why did I buy these shoes?
- Because they were cute.
- Some help here.
"- Yeah, what is it?"
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln Park.
(TRAIN RATTLES BY)
Where is Cameron?
I haven't seen Cameron for two years.
I don't know what you expect me to tell you.
"No offence, but I think you do."
"So, you were at art school together?"
Well...
I was at art school.
He'd hang around the refectory.
"Sort of, you know talking art."
LUTHER:
Did he ever talk about this?
(LAUGHS)
Spring-Heeled jack?
Yeah.
About ten zillion times.
"Yes, it was his childhood obsession."
Spring-Heeled Jack's in the cupboard.
"Spring-Heeled Jack's waiting at the bottom of the garden, in the bushes."
He had to see somebody about it.
A psychologist or a psychoanalyst.
"Anyway, they teased him about it."
It made him feel like a freak.
"I suppose he was a freak, really."
Still is.
A freaky little freak.
Did Cameron ever hurt you?
No.
- Why did you hesitate?
- Because sometimes... he'd get this look in his eyes.
What look?
Like he wanted to.
"Should we take notes, or will there be handouts?"
There'll be handouts.
Now as I was saying...
"I'm gonna take notes anyway, just to be safe."
Brought a fresh notebook.
"Oh, boy."
What?
Is that who you were in school?
You were that person?
What person?
"""ms."
"Rinsky, should we take notes?"""
"You know, the suck-up, the goody-goody, the narc."
"Well, if we have to be here, mike,"
"I want to make the most of it,"
"And actually, I was very cool in school."
Okay.
I was.
Okay.
I was.
Am I gonna have to separate you two?
Please.
"Let's face it, to teenagers, old people are like"
Alien life forms from a faraway galaxy
They don't really want to visit.
How are things going in school?
You're... yo in...
"What, the second grade now?"
Uh-huh.
Eighth.
"I'm actually working on a really big science project right now,"
So that's why we have to leave
Oh.
"You made my favorite, mommy."
Alan?
I thought you were dead.
I am.
What's it like?
Lovely.
"Come with me, and I'll tell you all about it."
"Oh, wait."
Not yet.
There were lots of doors.
And... and...
Each door led to a different loved one from my life.
My mother.
Mom.
"And my brother, who died last year."
I-I moved easily from room to room.
"And I knew that there were many more rooms ahead that, in time, I would get to."
I wanted to go through those doors.
"Makes no sense, but..."
I feel that I will be going through them...
Soon.
And...
I'm looking forward to it.
Gosh.
"You have any more of that, uh... psilocybin lying around?"
- You serious?
- I want to see my mom.
You're just as likely to see zombies.
"- Well, I would love to see zombies."
- I knew you would.
"Don't you ever, you know, want to ha a spiritual experience?"
"Well, she's usually right."
She's been right about everyone else.
I lived a whole life with a woman I didn't even really like.
We traveled all over the world together.
And Ellen and I never even left the grounds.
"Well, actually I took you to the IMAX that one time."
"Yeah, but I wanted to take her to the Mayan ruins in Guatemala."
She really wanted to see those.
His picture's hanging here.
He got the license for this place.
Claire?
[Sighs] Gosh.
[Crying] Nobody told me anything.
- You just heard the news?
- When did he die?
- When did he die?
- He died a week ago.
- A week ago?
- A week ago.
My God.
[Crying]
"Claire, you were told."
You just don't remember.
- Pardon?
- You were told about it.
You just don't remember us telling you.
I wouldn't remember?
I must have been -
And we had a memorial for him here as well.
- When?
"- Uh, last week."
- Was I there?
Both!
Sir!
"Walk Silently, Where?"
Left or Right?
Left!
Your left or mine?
Papa!
Did she design bra and panty or car?
"She is doing business in car like you,"
"Nisha, mail it to Mr. Kumar and tell him that..."
Oh!
Madam!
Yes!
You're the same in photo?
Yeah!
Who are you?
"I am Laxminarayan,"
Hi!
"I am Layla, I was waiting for you,"
"Here we go, you deal in cars, Yes, I deal in cars,"
"And you know my nature, I deals in car too,"
Where you keep your stuff?
Stuff?
"Stuff, This stuff,"
I think you are desperate to watch?
"Since I've seen that picture, I can't see anything, What a design?"
"This stuff won't available in Chandni Chowk,"
If Khurana's will see then he will be jealous.
Are you ready to make a deal?
"Definitely, show me the stuff."
"You know my nature, I can't make deals without seen stuff,"
"Come I'll show you,"
[Sighs] You mind if I...
Record this?
"Oh, this is not an interview."
We're just gonna have a talk.
- I record everything.
- I'd rather you not.
Thank you.
I want to apologize.
- You really don't have to.
"- No, I do."
I reacted emotionally to your article.
That was a mistake.
"You know, these people are my family."
"I'd kill for them, but I shouldn't have said what I said about you."
Or my father's cunt?
[Chuckling] Your your father's cunt.
Got a little personal.
"Well, you got a little personal, too."
- I don't think so.
- No?
Came after me.
"Came after my gym, my fighters."
You came after my son.
How is that not personal?
I write about MMA.
That's all fair game.
"Yeah, but your tone..."
You came after me.
How so?
"Well, you were writing shit that wasn't fact."
"Well, um, Nate lost his fight."
Ryan looked like anything but a champ.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
"One at a time, if you please."
"Yes, you sir."
A whiskey?
"Why, of course."
Be my pleasure.
This here's our finest single malt.
Join you?
I'd be honored.
"To your health, sir."
[EZRA laughing ] I have an idea.
"About what, a bank we can rob?"
About food.
"I think we should offer something to eat, like the hotel does."
Try it.
"Muchas gracias, señorita, but I am drinking my dinner."
Have you lost your mind?
The sign outside says drinks for a penny.
What next?
Pay people to come in here?
"My God, at this rate you'll be broke in no time."
"Well, isn't that the object of your little exercise, Mother?"
Might as well help it along.
MAUDE:
"Oh, and that you have."
I have just come from the bank...
... wherel discovered that you paid your own money...
... tobuythisglorifiedshack.
"Well, who else's money was I supposed to use?"
Somebody else's.
Anybody else's.
-Right.
"-Ezra, rule number one:"
I didn't know his body was there!
I told you.
I followed you to apologise.
- I believe you.
- It's true!
Of course.
The transfer linkage you asked for.
About time.
Any news from the search parties?
No.
"No, there won't be."
"It was an unlikely idea, keeping out of sight for the length of time this ship has been in flight."
Not really possible.
I agree.
So who do you think it is?
- Mandrian.
- Why?
Instinct.
I discount Dr Kendall.
I thought you mistrusted instinct?
"I do, so I am probably wrong."
"It could be him I told you I heard him quarrelling with Sara, didn't I?"
"Sonheim makes me uneasy, too."
He would be next on my list.
The answer is here.
If only we could see it.
I knew you'd be here.
[DISTANT METEOR IMPACTS]
How far are we in now?
Halfway I can't be sure.
The detectors are swamped.
The force wall's eating into our power reserves.
Put mother on.
I have to talk to her.
"Listen, firstly I'm sorry."
"Then, my condolences."
"If someone asks for me, say you couldn't reach me."
They don't know I've hired a cell-phone.
I'll be back for the seventh day of mourning.
I promise I'll be there.
Don't talk to me like that.
This is the wrong time.
All right. ls there anything else?
Take care.
Hello.
Hello.
Why aren't you singing now?
You sing so well.
"Go on, keep singing."
I dare not.
But why?
You're down there and I'm here.
We can't look each other in the eye.
I can't see you.
I can see you.
What are you doing down there?
I'm digging a well.
You don't dig wells on hills.
- l'm digging a ditch.
- Why a ditch?
For telecommunications.
Why are you alone?
Working alone makes things simple.
"It's good, you don't have a boss."
Does she?
- Yes.
Your mother is very intelligent.
"If I get a chance, I would like to meet her."
For sure.
Tell me.
What will you have?
"I am good, sir."
I had breakfast just now.
"If you will call me sir here, you know what I am going to say."
I know.
I know.
Mother.
Anyway.
I saw your designs.
You seem very talented.
But why did you take so much time to express your talent?
"I didn't take time, Vivek."
"Those whom you trust a lot, they took time."
My designs were ready since a long time.
What do you mean?
Who?
I don't want to take anybody's name.
Fine.
Don't take names.
I understand a bit.
"But Gul, if I trust someone, I trust him completely."
What if somebody breaks your trust?
It hasn't happened so far.
"If it happens, I wouldn't want to see his face again."
Can you do that?
"- Yeah, of course."
I've done nothing wrong!

I met this car from Swampscott.
He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.
You could see his dirty undercarriage.
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.
They did give you your big break.
"Besides, it's in your contract."
"Oh, will you stop, please?"

She wouldn't see me.
No.

He just parks and into the scientific supplies store.
What?
Open the car.

- Shit.
- What?
He's buying a Geiger counter.

How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
"Look, you want to succeed in the life?"
Figure it out.
Work the problem.
And now what?
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna salt it.
With what?

Nope.

"Well, I paid to see it, sir."
"Ten cents, but it was worth it."
"From the shores of Borneo, sir."
"Could have been the mountains, I don't recall exactly, sir,"
- but someplace...
- Who cares for her?
!
"Well, a keeper."
He collects the money.
"- I don't know, she hardly seems to be..."
- What the hell are you two doing in here?
Show's not open for another hour.
"Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary."
But you still have to pay.
- Ten cents each you owe me.
- I've paid once already.
He hasn't...
- Who are you?
- Mick Travis.
Huh?
Your attitude makes me sick!
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you!
If you don't take any advice... you'll never solve your problems!
I don't have any problems!
"- Oh, yeah?"
- You have a problem!
Sure.
Typical.
You are the problem!
Your obstinacy is my only problem!
- How come?
- You aren't reliable.
I have to smooth things out with Gerd!
"Sorry, but you got yourself into it!"
I don't get it.
You don't want to change a thing.
You only want to be left in peace.
Make an effort.
You know what's really ironic?
That you can't stand your father... but you say the same crap as him!
What do you know about my father?
I just have to look at you to know everything.
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Leave me alone!
- You just want to hurt me!
- Then cry!
It's true!
You enjoy hurting me!
Ouch!
Are you crazy?
Look lively.
"A gent in box F wants you to serve him, and Old Prouty says you're to do it."
"Oh, he does?"
I'll tell him it ain't my business.
But he wants a bottle of the boil.
"Oh, bubbly."
Why didn't you say so?
"Hey, lvy, me love, how about some fish and chips after the show?"
How about a dozen oysters and a pint of stout?
What about a glass of champagne?
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
"- Hello, lvy."
"Watch out, lvy."
"How's about it, lvy?"
"Over there, lvy."
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?
"Well, that'll..."
"That'll be half a quid, sir."
Half a quid?
"Yes, sir."
Half a quid.
Here.
"Here's a sovereign, my dear."
Keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
"Oh, but you're not going?"
"Oh, no."
No.
"After all, you brought two glasses."
Two minds with but a single thought.
"My, what a nice beginning."
Sit down there.
On your feet.
Hold on just a second.
Where are your manners?
"If you try something, I'll kill her!"
Don't make it worse for yourselves.
Come out with your hands up.
We won't hurt you.
"Aldin, I'm here!"
Don't worry anymore.
Your Renato is here.
You're gonna ruin everything!
"Renato, I want to go home!"
Don't worry.
I'll take you home.
"Shut up, for God's sake!"
Get him out of here.
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Don't get so excited.
I'll keep still.
Tie him up!
Listen to me.
The dastards took a shot at me!
Ask for a plane.
In exchange for what?
For that.
For that thing?
Would you exchange a plane for that?
"A child, a woman, a priest, yes, dut that?"
Pretend I'm not here.
It doesn't matter.
You have two minutes... or we'll open fire.
"Come and get us, you dastards!"
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
Next day...
I woke up and... both my... my eyes were swelled up.
What did the doctors say?
... andthatallchargeswill bedropped upon return of Mr. Wingo's cuff links.
-Agreed.
-Agreed.
I think we've made some sort of frontier history today.
"Until tomorrow, beautiful Maudie."
[SPEAKS in FRENCH]
MAUDE:
"Until tomorrow, Preston."
"Well, Mother, you're a free woman."
Go and sin no more.
"Ezra, you haven't done much to gladden my heart in your life."
I'm proud to be your mother.
"Thank you, Mary."
Daddy.
All those years.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
"I tried to, son, but I couldn't."
You had enough troubles...
... withoutcarryingthisburden in your heart.
No.
That made me sound too damn noble.
Truth be told...
... Ijustdidn'thad the courage.
And I didn't want you to think bad of your mama.
She was a brave woman.
"Yes, sir. lt was."
"And all this time, I thought bad of you."
"You got consumption, don't you?"
That's why I come looking for you.
travis:
Mr. Jackson has confessed his guilt in open court.
The jury is dismissed.
Make it Goldi-last.
"Better Goldi-lay off, before they find your Goldi-limbs in a Goldi-landfill, Goldi-literally."
Take her on a Goldi-lunch?
Maybe a Goldi-late suppers?
- Maybe she's a Goldi-lawyer.
- Ooh.
You think I'm Goldi-lyin'?
Enough Goldi-lip.
A Goldi-longshoresman will find your bodies in the Goldi-lake!
"Gentlemen, a question."
A query.
- An inquis...
- Pitter-patter.
Has Katy mentioned anything about me not talking to her?
- Can confirm.
- Major league.
- It's working.
- What's working?
"By not talking to her, she will form the conclusion that I'm upset with her and eventually ask me why."
"Why you so butt-hurt, Stewart?"
"- Well, she acts like..."
- Just kidding.
I don't give a fuck.
DAN:
Wait.
"So, you're upsets with her, and you wanna communicate that by not communicatings?"
Acutely.
"You are spare parts, aren't you, bud?"
Let me know if Katy asks about me.
Heads up!
Ow!
(MUSIC PLAYING)
A dead man.
A dead man at the lagoon.
We have to leave!
He's been into the grog again!
"Shut your mouth, will!"
"We all saw it, right?"
It's true.
I saw it with me own eyes.
- It rose up like a demon!
- Demon?
Get the women back into the stockade!
"First it attacked you, now it's come for me."
This place is cursed.
We're all cursed!
"Calm down, man!"
We have to find another island to get provisions from before it's too late.
"- It's a devil, sir."
- He speaks the truth.
"Right, you lot."
Load all the goods into the longboat!
Did you not hear him?
Move it!
We shouldn't have taken the ship!
"Shut up, man!"
You're giving everyone the jitters!
He must be sun-struck.
Let me help.
Right.
Just keep him away from the rest of the men.
Come on.
"Roll out the barrel, boys!"
Just put your shoulder into it.
"Yes, Sir."
"Yes, it was an accident."
A coconut fell from the tree at full speed and shattered the glass.
Repair cost me 4000 rupees.
This car?
Did you replace a damaged windshield?
- Yes.
How did it get damaged?
Some kids broke it while playing cricket on the streets.
Mohan.
"- Welcome, Sir."
I want the details of those who have changed windshields.
"Here it is, Sir."
A car from Dindigul has been here for a windshield change.
Let's enquire.
This is the number.
"Siri, call..."
"I'm dead serious in the middle of this,"
You are always poking the phone in my face saying 'Siri...'
Can't you even dial a number?
"Sorry, Sir."
I'm used to it.
"Yes, a minor accident."
So I changed the windshield.
I had even filed an FIR to claim insurance.
Do you want the FIR number?
It's okay.
Not necessary.
Thanks.
Are we taking the right path?
Only some places are left.
Let's hope for the best.
"Oh, God, I'm not pregnant."
I'm not pregnant.
That's ridiculous.
- Chug a beer then.
PAIGE:
"No, I'm not chugging a beer."
CATHERINE:
Chug a beer.
PAIGE:
"We're in love, you assholes."
"That's what people do when they're in love, they get married."
But you know what?
"Not everybody gets married, you know?"
There are many people who never get married.
"Well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk."
What she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
Right.
Tons of people make the choice to be alone.
They're happy.
Look at Al Pacino.
"Never been married, happy as a clam."
Would that...?
Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
"No, Bethie, we just..."
We want you to be happy.
"Well, then you should have rethought the coral."
LAURA:
"Oh, her face."
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.
I'm sick of these coral jokes.
We will find the way to arrive at the next embassy in Belgrade.
First we find a bathroom.
I really need to recharge the batteries.
What we need now is food.
"What's up, Louise?"
"- All right, thank you, sire."
Is the kebab good for you?
- Perfect.
His Majesty.
Good morning.
- Mr Bulut.
"Mr Moreau, I recommend eating fast."
I'm here to get you back to Istanbul.
"I'm sorry, sorry we will be grateful to accompany us to Brussels."
"Mr Moreau, let us avoid a useless scandal."
"Mr Bulut, I think she is out of his jurisdiction."
A knocking king will not prevent Turkey from entering Europe.
I understand your concerns...
"- I do not mean to lose the job,"
After thirty years of loyal service.
This does not apply to you Bulgarians.
"Back, back."
Louise!
"Strength, let's go!"
What is going on?
- The Turks!
Our suitcases!
"Ludovic, passports."
I have passports with me!
Where is your house?
My home is in Belgium.
In Belgium.
So we can write some handwritten letters to each other
While you're away.
That is so romantic.
"Maybe if we become famous writers one day,"
"They'll publish 'em after we die,"
Like Sartre and De Beauvoir.
"Maybe, but don't let that stop you"
From writing some of the dirty stuff.
Just a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
"Not, uh, not if you don't go."
You're gonna be late.
You don't want to be late to meet your new boss.
Get out of here.
Thank you.
"Oh, hey, Holland."
Hey.
Have you seen your mother?
No.
I think she left.
Oh.
Is everything okay?
If Dr. Van Der Woodsen loves your mother
"As much as he said he did in that speech,"
Then maybe there's something she should know about Rufus.
"Listen carefully, s."
Holland has a tale to tell.
"Apparently, her upstairs neighbor"
Has been coming downstairs.
Good night.
Good night.
Take care.
"Bankers' conference, Vienna."
Sorry.
- You couldn't tell me any sooner?
"- Sorry, I forgot."
Okay.
Let's go outside and talk.
What is this?
It's quite noisy outside.
What silent kind of a conversation do you want to have?
"We talk a lot, don't we?"
But we don't listen to this.
I think they are both conspiring against us.
We have no control.
So what now?
"So now, let's leave them alone."
They are acting smart.
"It's all about trust, right?"
So let's see what they do when they are alone.
One week.
Away from each other.
And what if they don't mend their ways?
Next level?
Do you really have to go?
It's good in a way.
"If you don't fast, you don't enjoy the feast."
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""This helpless soul awaits you."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""This helpless soul awaits you."""
Why are you laughing?
I'm sorry.
"This sounds silly, but I was just thinking..."
How could I marry someone that I've never even...
You know...
Oh.
Kissed.
There's one thing I have to say.
I promised your sister I wouldn't.
"You love Claire, too?"
You just slept with her?
- You want to?
- I don't even know her.
It's about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...
I think that's kind of great.
- I thought you'd be upset.
- Why?
You picked me.
"Actually, I found you through this charming woman on TV..."
"Well, well, well..."
Ha...
So?
Gregory just proposed to me.
Do you need a Valium?
"I know you don't respect my opinion, but I don't trust him."
"I mean, where's the attraction?"
He's not attracted to me.
He doesn't want sex.
He wants to be companions.
What sane person would agree to that kind of marriage?
It's not natural.
Let's go!
Follow me to a place.
Where?
Don't ask!
Just follow me.
- No way!
"- In case the baby is born, didn't you think about how miserable its life will be?"
You can not keep this baby!
- But what will happened to you?
- I'd rather be prisoned.
Absolutely not!
- I can not ruin your life!
- Shu Yawang!
"I will be prisoned, for 7 or 8 years at most."
"If you keep the baby, you will ruin the life of three person!"
"You, me, and this baby!"
I knew you would come.
"Qu Weiran, if just I'm not a soldier,"
I would have killed you.
Good then.
"When you kill me, Shu Yawang's unborn baby will be the bastard."
You bastard!
Good.
Kill me.
Go kill me.
Go away.
"Qu Weiran, live longer."
Make sure you do.
"Once you start a happy life,"
I will come to make sure you never can do it.
It is raining.
What date is it?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Bye.
Dad!
"Serena, I thought you left."
Um...
Is everything okay?
"Not really, no."
"I heard what you said in your speech,"
"And if you want to fight for mom, then you should do it."
Ahem.
Hi.
I think you girls got some misinformation.
I will be attending Columbia in the fall.
Oh.
"Well, that's awesome."
We have an extra room in the apartment.
Maybe you wanna move in with us?
No.
I don't live with the help.
"Oh, and you wanted to see a Blair Waldorf takedown?"
"Well, cross me again,"
And you'll experience one firsthand.
Hello?
"Hey, it's Jenny."
I want to talk to you about Lily.
"Obviously, I'm not a doctor,"
"And it's kind of a long story how I know this,"
But there's something weird about her medicine.
Elliot's the perfect mix of smart and fun.
"He speaks three languages,"
"But he has a subscription to ""People"" magazine."
I could not contact her either.
"Seeing everything that is happening now,"
I'm worried about her safety!
"She should be safe, Manoj."
Is Ashwini's number?
7599... 44... 7333?
Yes!
How do you know it?
We will explain.
If we need to find Ashwini...
We need some details about her.
Since when do you know Ashwini?
Recently...
Not too long ago...
She came to see my sculptures.
We became friends.
You said Ashwini was an NRI?
Yes.
From Singapore.
She has some ancestral property near Nagercoil.
She had come to sell it.
Was she staying with you?
At first she was staying outside.
As we got closer...
She came here and stayed with me.
I was happy every single moment that I spent with her.
She loved me as well.
But everything turned up-side-down in one night.
Maybe Ashwini has gone back to Singapore.
Do you have that contact number?
"Her E-mail ID, Facebook ID, or something like that?"
No.
"She did the same, too."
She said she loved me but betrayed me since I got sick.
Rotten bitches.
Dirty bitches.
All sluts like you should be wiped out for this country and society.
I'm doing a good deed for making a just society.
I'm a servant of pure justice.
I'm Wonder Woman.
15 minutes left!
Hurry up!
Why are you so slow?
Then carry her instead!
We have no time!
What'll you do if something happens to her?
Hey!
Wake up!
Please wake up!
Are you alright?
Where's Mr. Hong?
You shouldn't be here.
Hurry and run!
I was misunderstood because of you.
"Wait, why are you giving it to her?"
If she eats his liver...
We've waited for a thousand years!
How could you do that?
"Dad, one of us has to sacrifice because of him!"
Right.
I've lived long enough.
Take care of the youngest.
We have no time.
Hurry and start.
Exactly!
Everything about her is an action replay of my wife!
My heart says that too!
Get me my Laxmi!
Please!
"If Aunt gets to know of this, she'd be really offended."
Not at all!
D'you know what she threw at me today?
This!
The box?
That would break my head!
She threw a rose at me!
Did that fall on you?
"On my heart, actually."
Now look; suppose you're walking down the street...
But I'm standing here.
Just suppose so!
And a crow flying overhead drops excrement on your head.
Just suppose so!
"Will you fall for the crow, too?"
What a rotten joke!
"A crow and Laxmi, eh?"
I'll throw you out!
Just listen...
She's terribly angry with Durgaprasad which is why she threw the rose at you.
Durgaprasad?
Now who the hell is that?
I'm trapped...
"Her brother-in-law, eh?"
Not her brother-in-law.
He's her husband.
She said she was alone!
... ifyoufollowthatkind ofthing .
Recently divorced.
"But not too recently. I've already had my rebound, transitional relationships."
-So no worries there.
-Good to know.
"Actually, it wasn't so much a relationship..."
"... asa caseof mistakenidentity, but I think it still counts."
-Okay.
-And...
"... asyouknow,Ilive with Charlie..."
... whomyou'vealready....
-Met?
"-Yeah, let's go with met."
"Alan, is my having dated Charlie gonna be a problem for you?"
"No, no, no."
A little.
"Okay, look."
Charlie and l--
"We had a very brief, superficial relationship."
Okay?
"And to be honest, it was mostly about sex."
Great.
"My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those, those shallow relationships..."
... Iwashavingwithguys like Charlie.
"I wanna be with a man who can be sensitive and caring, nurturing."
"You know, somebody who can make me laugh, make me think."
"You do realize I'm straight, right?"
"-See, you really are adorable."
-Thank you.
I tend to bring out the mothering instinct in women.
"-Oh, really?"
"-ironically, not my mother."
"You married up, Son."
Everyone knows you married up.
"My son has committed a terrible sin... against you, Clara, and you, Amy."
Against those innocent little boys.
Against his own mother and father.
"And against the Lord, our God."
If God can forgive us... then we should forgive the mistakes of our loved ones.
"And it was a mistake, David."
"A thoughtless, self-centered mistake... of a weak man."
"You can do better, Son."
We all know you can do better.
I forgive you.
"She forgives you, Son."
Clara forgives you.
And I forgive you.
"- Thank you again for supper, Clara."
- It was lovely.
I think those Colombian meatballs are my favorite.
"First thing tomorrow, you have to fire that home wrecker."
"- You haven""t fired her yet?"
"- This isn""t Lisa""s fault."
- She has three children and no way...
- Daddy.
Please.
"It""s dark."
You forgot to turn on my nightlight.
Look at this boy.
March right down there.
Yes!
- Buddy.
"- Come here, honey."
Thank you for coming.
"Oh, God."
Patti Nyholm.
"- Well, look at you."
- And you.
Poster child for Motherhood Today.
"You have no changing tables in the restroom, Will."
- It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
"- Yep, doing our part to suppress the birth rate."
"So, I need some legal advice on my contract."
"Oh, my God, wait."
You can't practice law any more.
What was I thinking?
"No, thank you."
"I'll be right out, Michael."
This'll take a few minutes.
"That must be really hard on you, Will, just sitting around watching all these lawyers while you're, what, surfing the Web?"
- Clipping coupons?
"- What's up, Patti?"
- A lawsuit.
- Really?
Which one?
A new one.
"It'll be great being on opposite sides again, dusting it up..."
"Oh, wait."
Darn it.
You're not a lawyer any more.
I keep forgetting.
So sorry I'm late.
Here's my lawyer now.
"Ms. Nyholm, I believe you know everybody."
I think I do.
Hello.
Ariel?
Where are you going?
"Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?"
I'm going to see Ursula.
"[Gasps] Ariel, no!"
No!
She's a demon.
She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But...
"But, I..."
Come on!
This way.
[Creatures moan]
"[Gasps, grunts]"
[Pants]
[Ursula] Come in.
"Come in, my child."
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.
One might question your upbringing. [chuckles]
"Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow."
Not that I blame you.
"He is quite a catch, isn't he?"
"Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple."
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
[Gasps] Can you do that?
"My dear, sweet child."
That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
"To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to."
"Just like this, a guy came to help."
The penalty I paid for it is 20 lakh rupees.
To whom did you give?
Inspector Arivazhagan.
What do you mean?
!
That who he said he was.
"Last week, my girlfriend Ashwini and I had gone for a drive."
Go away.
Just one kiss like this.
Fraudster!
What do you call this then?
This was just a rehearsal.
"Suddenly, she thought she saw someone standing on the road and she swerved the car away in one quick movement."
Ashwini!
What happened?
Ashwini!
Ashwini!
Where are you?
What happened?
What happened?
"I killed a guy, Manoj."
"Come, Ashwini."
Let's go.
I convinced her somehow and got her home.
All this happened because... some idiot had placed a scarecrow in the middle of the road.
I consoled her that it was not her fault.
But she kept crying.
We couldn't sleep out of fear.
The calling ball rang at 5 AM.
"Who is it, Ashwini?"
At this time?
Untranslatable.
That's why it's Yiddish.
I didn't know you'd taken up the language.
Abe laid it on me.
Abe's a good man.
"You're a good man, Pappy."

Good morning.
Where's the mayor?
He had to go to Washington on convention business.
"This rates an inspector's funeral, and that includes the mayor."
The mayor's absence in no way diminishes his concern...
... forMrs.Santos and her children.
Where'd they get all that stuff from in the newspapers?
"At school, they tell my girl her daddy was a drug dealer."
We'll get our press people right on it.
What about internal Affairs?
What are those clowns doing?
Where you going?
-City.
You'll be recruiting Resistance on your own until the troops land in Dieppe.
- Please don't let them take me again.
- It's all right.

"S02E04 Last Man, Last Round"
How many guns on this rotation?
"Eight rifles, three, four, MP-38s."
You think Major Stirling is in there?
If he survived.
Two years since they were captured at Dunkirk.
None of them are going to be in good shape.
"If we're gonna build an army, we've got to start somewhere."
Two watch towers.
Six hundred feet of exposed no man's land.
What about that hill?
It's not guarded.
It's covered in land mines.
So is that path.
No problem.
What about a blind spot from the tower?
- There isn't one.
- No time to tunnel under.
- Patrols?
- Twenty-four hour rotation.
- Like a Swiss watch.
No gaps.
- Efficient bastards.
Maybe we don't need to break into the camp.
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?
No.
I think that I know her family...
"No, no."
She's a teacher.
"Hi, sweetheart!"
Ready for cyberspace?
I just got in a very exclusive chat room.
A friend has just arrived.
She's an Internet virgin.
You do this every night?
No.
On Thursdays I eat at my mother's... then I come home and take a Valium.
Wouldn't you rather meet someone live?
In a real place?
Like at the beach?
And compete with those teenagers who live at the gym?
No.
Thank you.
By any chance... do you meet live people in real places?
No... but I don't want to meet anyone.
Everyone wants to meet someone.
I already met the person I was supposed to meet... and I married him.
Are you divorced?
No.
Widowed.
I'm sorry.
"No, Nadine."
It's not like I'm some traumatized madwoman.
"Okay, but I am."
Must be Gary.
My daughter isn't depressed.
"Well, you mentioned her father and the separation."
You think I should take her to a psychiatrist?
No.
I think we should wait and see what happens with the Ritalin.
I think that's the answer.
-Okay.
"-Let's wait two, three weeks."
All right.
And the lies she's been telling?
"That's part of it, huh?"
-Lies?
-Like saying her bed's shaking.
That stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear?
-To use obscenities?
"-No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar-
- Similar to things like her lying...
-...it's uncharacteristic for her.
-I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddamn cunt."
"Babe, this is Austin Elektra."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"So, I just invited your girlfriend up to my place later."
Ready to rehearse.
You're more than welcome to join if you want.
"Oh, that sounds naughty."
I love naughty.
Ready to rehearse.
Got to go.
See you ladies tonight.
Absolutely.
Are you kidding me with this?
"Oh, come on, sweetie."
All's fair in love and murder investigations.
"What, do you think this is a game?"
As hot as it would be to see you two fight...
Especially after that kiss...
We need to work together on this.
It is in all our best interests.
All right.
We'll work together.
For now.
Wow.
This is actually gonna work out great.
"While you and Kendall keep Austin distracted,"
I'll search his house for proof that he's The Phantom.
Membership in the GDS is as good as mine.
"Oh, yay for you."
What's wrong?
[Sighs]
Was it the kiss with Kendall?
What?
I'm already married.
"No, you're not."
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
You had to buy the ring yourself in Woolworths.
"When times got hard, he tried to send you back to Wales, and he's disappointed in you?"
"He's a stupid bloody fool, but he's not as much of a fool as you."
"He changed your name, for Christ's sake!"
Where's your fucking self-respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
- I know you deserve better.
- You?
You're the better?
Catrin-
- I-
- I--
I think-
"- Look, I think you're mustard."
And I think...
"you're a drunk, squalid bully."
Come and get out of the water.
- Hush!
You were speaking of Flight Lieutenant Lundbeck.
Ah.
You know he only did the film under orders.
"""They told me it would be good for Eagle Squadron recruitment, sir."""
"He's desperate to get back in the air, poor boy."
"- Tea, sir?"
- Thank you.

"This way, sir."

GIRL:
"You're still going to Justin's thing tonight, right?"
Yeah.
I'll probably get there around 11:00.
Depends on how much wine Mr. and Mrs. Hiller drink at dinner tonight.
Can't believe you get paid 15 bucks an hour to sit on your ass all night.
"Well, occasionally the baby cries, and I have to go check on her."
"But, yeah, I, uh, pretty much just watch Netflix."
Whatever.
(chuckles)
"So let me ask you something, does this outfit look too trashy for tonight?"
"Well, on, like, a scale of from"
"Taylor to Miley, you're, um... you're at a Kardashian level of trashiness right now."
Which one?
Does it matter?
Ugh.
I'm gonna change.
(chuckles softly)
Text me when you're done.
Okay.
Lates.
(air conditioner clicks on)
(baby crying over monitor)
(baby continues crying)
Because this property is sold.
And any trespasser will be executed.
You get that baby.
Yes.
Excuse me Vishal.
But our film's just begun.
Oh!
Let the film's begun... then the hero's got to hold the heroine's hand.
Leave my hand Vishal.
Oh so sweet.
Or else?
Move.
Move.
Move.
I hit him.
Watch out.
Shiv are you okay?
Ankita this is a big problem.
The real problem will start when brother finds out.
Come on.
Come on keep walking.
Why bring us here sir?
I tried explaining nicely but you wouldn't listen.
If you go against Minister Pradhan and... roam around like a big oaf you'll be put down like a dog.
There's just one way to save yourselves.
Kill me and escape.
Don't try to run from death.
People have a wrong notion about death.
Its life that makes you suffer.
Garbage cleared.
My record's also cleared.
Mr. Pradhan your job's done.
-But it's a scientist.
-And what's his name?
-Doctor Yansky.
Hallo.
This is attendant Zero.
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
I repeat.
"This is attendant zero, barrier 173."
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
You caused this.
What a mission!
-You are an interplanetary bungler.
-Let it go.
"Look, everybody drives, but we are going on foot."
This way we will never look like people.
-And would you like it?
"-Well... they are better, prettier."
Look at me.
Never in my life have I looked better.
"In contrast to it, out there at home, how do we look?"
It's better not to speak about it!
The ridiculous antennae.
Horror!
"I'm telling you, I'm considering whether or not to stay like this."
All right.
Normally we look hideous.
That's a fact.
On the other hand we can travel where we want.
Yoohoo!
Come for a ride!
All over space.
And that's a fact too.
Congratulations!
She's a great...
Yes.
I've heard so much about you.
- Likewise about you.
- We all ought to...
"Had I known you were this good-looking,"
I'd have answered the ad for myself.
Congratulations.
She's the best.
"If I were a man, I'd be all over her."
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll both be very fascinating to watch.
"Rose, isn't it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years?"
- I know what you mean.
- I can't believe it.
And the dust!
This place needs a good cleaning.
We'll take care of that.
I made room for your books.
Need any help?
Everything's put in its place.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.
To sleep...
"In order to sleep, you go to the bed for sleeping."
- Unless you want to do something else.
- What?
I wasn't going to say anything.
Do you want the bathroom first?
"- No, I can wait."
"- No, you go."
His blood was full of that shit.
And there were tons of dried mushrooms at his place.
You really believe that?
It's what the results said!
Didn't you ever try those mushrooms as a kid?
Hell no.
"All I know is, mushrooms don't do that to you."
You saw that poor guy.
Mushrooms would never make you that way.
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.
"If everyone's talking about him, there's likely a good reason."
What the hell?
Power's gone out again.
Fuck.
I keep telling the Captain to get that damn wiring fixed.
Never listens!
What the fuck!
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?
"- Outside, that... fuck!"
- What's your problem?
"What is it, man?"
You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
"Yeah, fuck you, man."
Hi.
Hi.
Goin' out?
"Twenty dollars for me, five for the room."
No.
"Fifteen for me, five for the run."
How old are you?
Twenty.
You'll catch a cold in that costume.
Nah.
Where's the room?
[Distant shouting]
You probably know the rules.
"Five dollars a half hour, five dollars each additional half, ten dollars deposit,"
I'll give you back five if you're out on time.
"Clean sheets five bucks extra, five bucks deposit on the sheets."
You want the sheets?
Yeah.
You want the sheets?
"Oh, yeah, yeah, we gotta have the sheets."
"Uh, what does that all add up to?"
Twenty-five bucks.
"These are clean ones, huh?"
Have a good time.
"God, what happened to you?"
Who did this to you?
Is that what you want?
"Dirty stories, is that how you get off?"
No.
But what kind of person would do a thing like that?
Some guy took me to a chicken place.
- A sadist?
Yeah.
I will take that.
Ohh.
"Sorry I got annoyed, but [clears throat] you were interrogating me."
I just want to know what's going on in your life.
"Yeah, and then get mad about the parts you don't like."
Some guy I've never fucking heard of is taking you to the Getty.
You're wearing expensive lingerie.
"All I have is expensive lingerie, Jay."
Who else are you sleeping with?
"I mean, should I be wearing a condom?"
- Excuse me?
- Are you fucking this guy?
Don't talk to me like I'm at your gym.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
That was crass.
Are you fucking this gentleman?
- Ugh.
"- ""Ugh."""
You're a pain in my ass.
- Oh?
- Uh-huh.
His name is Paul.
We lived together for five years.
The house is his.
"And, no, I'm not fucking him."
He's just paying for you?
No.
Just the house.
And he's taking you to gala events.
"-What you've always done, sweet boy."
Just what your mother tells you.
I was gonna mail it.
Yah!
Giddyup.
Well?
I have a message for you from the bride.
It seems to be a poem.
"""With apologies to Robert Herrick."

"P.S. Thank you for the lovely carriage. """
What a woman.
It's breakfast and you're eating a piece of candy?
It's dessert.
There is no dessert with breakfast.
Maybe not where you live.
Will you at least take your vitamin?
"My God, you're a time bomb."
[Sighs]
"What you got goin' on there, bub?"
"Before I swallowed the vitamin, there was a lifesaver in my mouth."
Wow.
You're like the evel knievel of sucking candy.
Wish me luck.
I got it.
"And welcome back, butterscotch goodness."
[Spits]
"Very reasonable in here, don't you think, Joyce?"
Are you all right?
"Oh, I thought I'd walk to the supermarket today for a change and somehow twisted my ankle."
- It looks nasty.
- I'II be fine.
I only live about four miles away.
Four miles?
You can't walk on that.
Let me drive you.
Oh.
I couldn't impose.
Ooh!
Ooh.
"well, maybe some of the way if it's not too much trouble."
- Come on.
"- Oh, how kind."
Barbara.
Barbara du Prez.
Joyce HazIedine.
"pleased to meet you, Joyce."
I know most of the faces around here but yours doesn't look very familiar.
- We've only just moved here.
- Ah.
How do you find little Stempington?
"Oh, you know."
Doesn't sound like you're enamoured yet.
- Not exactly.
- I felt exactly the same before HRT.
"No, no, you don't understand."
"Oh, you poor dear."
Sorry.
I don't usually burst into tears in front of perfect strangers.
"Ken, the kiosk man. """
Amazing.
Too bad this guy didn't run a hot-dog stand.
I'm here for allergies.
These things are pushing me over the edge.
Can you get rid of them?
Or give them to someone a little more deserving.
Who saved flower boy's foot and moved more patients than anybody today?
"Me, that's who."
"You' re gonna miss me too, because I'm out of here."
"- Banker's hours, Pratt?"
- Only if they work doubles.
"Hey, Carter."
What's up with your boss?
Is it true she was crying earlier?
- Weaver?
- Yeah.
Bad breakup or something?
- Been pretty moody lately.
- Lately?
I'm sorry!
I think this man needs immediate attention!
- You gotta help my pops!
- What happened?
They came in the ambulance entrance.
- I saw he was diaphoretic.
- Not asking you.
We were playing ball.
He grabbed his chest.
- When did the pain start?
- An hour ago.
- Thought it would go away!
Helen:
Okay.
Are you really serious about this?
"I told your dad, Grandpa was gone, but now you coming into our lives and digging up this case, well, that was the last time"
"Dad and Duval were ever civil to each other, so now I think he might still be here."
"Just holding on, something left to do."
All right.
Come on.
Both of you.
Fingers on.
[Sighs]
Thank you.
Close your eyes.
"Sheriff James Pritchard, if you are here, make your presence known."
James Pritchard.
Are you with us?
[Door slams]
You.
Outside.
Right now.
[Door opens]
They sure do this a lot.
Maybe they like it.
"When we were kids, your grandpa would take your dad out there when he was in trouble."
I can't imagine Dad in trouble.
Yeah.
They'd stand there just... like that.
Duval:
Why are you here?
I told you to stay away from my house.
You'd only come if you had leverage.
I'd only come?
"All three families lived within several miles of each other, but we never crossed paths until Lou's funeral."
- Do you remember this guy?
- Hell of a man.
"- Sure, I remember him."
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
"20, 40 times."
Who knows?
"He was a cab rider, strictly cab rider."
"- Yeah, he didn't drive?"
- Never.
He used to sit in front.
- He sat in front?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
- Yeah.
"That was your dad, world-famous architect."
"Yeah, that was your father."
- Do you remember him at all?
"- A little bit, vaguely."
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
- Vaguely.
He loved the women.
"Not the young ones, but he loved the women."
Do you remember what he looked like or...
His face was pointed.
"Yeah, and his hair was..."
"his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond."
- Like a what?
- Like it was blond.
Yeah.
"Oh, blond, uh-huh."
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
I'll manage.
I told the cleaning lady to come twice a week too.
Absolutely not.
The way things were was fine.
It won't be the same.
What?
Dust?
I can dust.
I have to get the money from the account that Grandpa left.
We have to go to the bank.
Okay.
"Besides that, I'll arrange some more money."
I don't need you to arrange for me.
I need you to sign as a guarantor on the contract.
Did you notice that the bathroom light is flickering?
Yeah.
"It's like a discotheque, it needs to be checked."
I'll handle it.
Good.
Can I take this?
Of course.
You didn't forget anything?
I have everything.
You're sure?
- I'm sure.
"No, no, I'll take the dishes later."
Are you not feeling well?
"No, I'm fine."
Do you feel sick?
- It's nothing.
Want me to get you some glycerin?
"No, I don't need any."
!
Yes!
Good!
Then I'll have to go it alone.
You work here?
I wanted to tell you...
You're here in this bar?
Toni promised that he wouldn't steal you away.
You're ruining the hotel!
I should have known.
Where is Toni?
In his office.
"Franz, we had no contract."
I said that I would help you.
But you never paid me.
That's why.
Is that the only reason?
Among others.
You did steal Nora away!
You might as well hire Tom!
Then we'll all leave and you can build your luxury hotel  or your recreation center or whatever!
You've already prepared contracts?
Where are they then?
"Calm down, Franz."
Is that loaded?
You promised me that you wouldn't take Nora away from me.
And you gave Josphine money so she'd leave?
!
You're pointing a gun at me?
We're cousins right?
As far as Nora is concerned...
She applied at the bar.
It isn't rare to find destructive even criminal behavior.
"Hey, do me a favor, will you?"
Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed.
"If it's a lesion, in a way, she's fortunate."
All we have to do is remove the scar.
-Let's move her.
"- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?"
A little more.
Good.
"Regan, I'm just gonna move you down on the table, okay?"
Let me do this.
It's okay.
See?
There we go.
It's just for a short time.
You're doing fine.
Very sticky.
Good.
"Now, Regan, you're gonna feel something a little bit cold and wet."
Okay.
Now you're gonna feel a little stick here.
Don't move.
Good.
Okay.
You're gonna feel some pressure here.
"Now, don't move."
Hook up.
There's nothing there.
No vascular displacement at all.
Do you want me to run another series?
I don't think so.
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting center... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply foran exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
The noodles slide into such a long and deep tunnel
Noodles
"I want to eat them, too."
I'm gonna eat!
Hold on.
Motel
You shouldn't hang such a thing here.
"It's my favorite, so it should be beside me."
"Oh, my!"
Oh goodness.
Where are you running off to?
You won't get far in a motel room.
"Well, my business isn't doing so well lately."
"Business, my butt."
You call hidden cameras a business?
"Wait, so you recorded me with a hidden camera?"
- Is that it?
"- No, I didn't."
I told you to pay up last week.
"Give me a few days, and I promise I'll pay."
- You rotten bastard!
- What?
You said you're a poet.
Where's your camera?
Hand it over now!
What camera?
"No, there's a camera, but you saw already."
"It was covered, so nothing got recorded."
- Shut up!
- Put on your underwear.
You're not wearing anything.
It's embarrassing so hurry.
-Cooperate.
I like your reason.
Do you like my uniform?
I purposely prepared a white dress.
"If I let down my hair and wear heels, I'm really pretty."
More than the bride.
How is it?
So the concept for today is...
"You know if from first sight, right?"
Is it a virgin ghost?
It's an angel.
Let's go.
So what you're saying is that the person that Myeong Joo's father approved of is you?
Yes.
Please wait here for a moment.
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.
"So you are saying Sergeant Major Seo, Myeong Joo and you were a love triangle?"
Yes.
Hold my hand.
And it's still valid?
- Yes.
- Then how about your opinion?
Why are you curious about my opinion?
When was it that you dumped me...
I am just asking.
I am just asking.
I am not curious about your opinion.
Your earlier facial expression seems very curious.
Sit.
Hold on tight.
And don't fly away.
"Today, you are a downpour from up above... that drenches all my heart."
A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
Rhino.
I'll close the restaurant.
Mom wants you home; you leave.
Okay.
"Sorry, sir."
We are closed.
Someone named Varun...
I'm Varun.
And you are?
Your eyesight?
I had lost it earlier.
After a surgery now...
"Sir, who are you?"
Do you remember Deepa?
Sir!
I'm her father.
Why did you let us down like that!
"Sir, what do you mean?"
Didn't Deepa come now?
Where is Deepa?
"She told us happily that you offered to help us with the money, that all our problems will go away..."
- It's not gay.
Just take your shirt off.
- It's not gay.
"Why can't I just get, like, all excited and passionately rip it off in the moment?"
- Why can't you just take your shirt off for us?
- Just drop it for now.
"All right, all right."
"Uh, maybe you should punch something."
- There you go.
"- Yeah, you should punch something..."
Why don't you punch this board?
Okay.
Hold it steady for me.
- Watch your eyes.
"- All right, come on."
Oh!
"Oh, that's..."
- That looks like it stings.
"- Oh, my God."
- What's that made out of?
"- It's a board, so it's, you know, made out of wood."
"- It's, like, particle board."
"- It's, like, harder than wood, dude."
- No.
- It's actually softer than wood.
"- Yeah, it's a lot softer than wood."
- Petrified wood.
"- What happened, man?"
I thought you were...
- I don't know.
- I wasn't drunk enough.

She used to do seances and the table r--rapping and all that.

- That's where I must get it!
-
- What?
I sometimes think I get little periods of precognition.
Do you?
It's just your plugs oiling up.
Don't worry about it.
-
- I'm being serious.

- So was your cousin Ethel.
"Oh, yes."
Night after night she used to try.
"Then one night, out of the b--blue -- well, out of the b--black, rather, suddenly there came this kn--knock."

Some might call it a d-minus.

You did worse?
"Well, I was confident going in."
"Eh, well."
What are you gonna do?
This is nuts.
What do you think happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Ms. Rinsky is what happened.
She's just a bad teacher!
Mm.
Could be.
"She intimidates people, mike."
I experienced it firsthand.
You can't do math

Probably.

My family pulled up roots in Pennsylvania.
We spent every dime we had on a plantation in South Carolina.

True?
He put them there so I'd agree to marry him.

I have my sources same as you do.
I don't see how any of this is your business.
The three of them returned to the embassy last night.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I have no desire to stir up an international incident.

"Yes, Your Majesty."
LOUIS:
We leave within the hour.
Why would the General's aide choose to meet somewhere like this?
That's a good question.
- Let's go see what's inside.
- D'ARTAGNAN:
I'll wait here.
(GRUNTING)
GRIMAUD:
Aramis is back in Paris.
What's going on?
He has been summoned back by the King.
"They are going on a pilgrimage, (CHUCKLES) to the Royal Mausoleum."
What about Porthos and d'Artagnan?
Marcheaux assures me they continued with their journey.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Perhaps it would be better to reconsider our plans.
No!
It's too late for that!
How many guards are with the King?
"Oh, Aramis, alone."
Then wait for them outside the Mausoleum and kill them both there.
(SCOFFING)
You...
You mean the King as well?
(CHUCKLING) We cannot kill the King.
We have to.
What's the matter now?
I think Grandma would like it not too spicy.
May I start eating?
I'm really embarrassed.
Grandma puts her hands together to worship what I cooked.
- And it was really delicious.
- That's true!
We're all counting on you from now on.
Look at this.
What is this?
"To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii, I talked about Suzujiro today."
Then Grandma started to remember the names of her brothers.
"""Tetsutaro."
"""Dozaburo."
"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."
"""Nabe."
"""Kane."
"Kyoko. """
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane. "" So this is our Grandma, right?"
- Eleven!
- Eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
We're talking about the perfect dream of a school.
- Okay.
- Animals instead of science.
Chickens and mice and iguanas.
"This is pretend, right?"
"No, angel, this is real."
I am going to find you a school with trees and frogs and eggs to gather.
"And maybe just a little bit of math, because you do need that, too."
"But... not too much, okay?"
It's Auntie Mara.
Can I say hello?
Of course.
"I miss you, Auntie Mara."
"I miss you to smithereens, little one."
Are they torturing you to make me do an interview?
With hot needles.
"Tell them three minutes, no questions about Tom, and, I'll call it an exclusive, tell the rest of the world to suck eggs."
- Mommy!
Language!
- Acceptable!
Borderline.
I'm on my way.
- But after I make these cookies.
"- Okay, bye."
This tough cookie.
You...
Maybe we should just eat the batter.
That's my favorite part.
What do you think?
"Hey, Ruby Tuesday."
It's me.
Come in.
"He's not feeling well, kids."
I have to call it quits!
That hurt a little on the way out.
- What's this for?
- Careful!
You're going to break it!
"- Don't pull it like that, son."
- What's it for?
For balance.
Maria works with us in the circus.
"No, no."
"From now on, Maria doesn't work anywhere."
"She will simply study and play, right?"
What kind of work?
"She walks along a high wire, way up in the circus ring."
That was in the past.
This whole business about Maria in the circus is all done.
She uses this parasol to help her balance on the tightrope.
Are you her mother?
"No, I'm her godmother."
- What about you?
- I'm her godfather!
Take our picture.
"Right, that's enough."
"Can you walk for us, just a little bit?"
Walk!
Walk!
"Just a little bit, Maria."
Please.
Do you want to walk?
Want to walk the tightrope?
- Who likes magic here?
- We've got to go there.
- How?
Take a bus?
- We'll go in this.
"- Tia, the tires are flat."
Come on.
"If it doesn't start cooling soon, the chain reaction will start."
You hear that?
"In ten minutes, this place is going to be a hole in the ground."
"Now, let's be reasonable."
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.
And the balance is on the way.
It's a deal.
I do not compromise.
"- Hey, what are you guys doing?"
- Nothing!
Nothing!
We're doing nothing.
"Hey, kids!"
How did these children get past security?
"Sir, the people destroying the furnace kidnapped my brother."
"If I could see him, I might stop them."
- She can do it!
- She can do it.
- Do what?
"Impossible, they're inside the room."
They've sealed the door somehow.
- What part has to be fixed?
- The emergency cooling system.
- Where is it?
- Five levels down.
But it's too late.
Does anybody want coffee?
- What theory?
- Regular or decaf?
- Regular.
- I can make cappuccinos.
Would you like cappuccinos?
"Greg, why don't you help me?"
- Why don't you put the coffee on?
- I made dinner.
You put it on.
"I've raised two daughters, buried a husband, I've made my coffee."
Alone at last.
I've heard a lot about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.
- Oh.
You've been seeing a lot of my daughter.
I hope you don't mind my asking...
What are your intentions?
My intentions?
What a lovely meal!
You're a good cook.
- I didn't oversell myself?
"- Not at all, but the trouble..."
Of course I had to go to that trouble.
It was your birthday.
"What are friends for, but to give each other presents and stuff..."
Happy birthday.
Open it up!
I really hope you like it.
- Dice?
- They once were dice.
"- Now, they're cuff links with..."
And I never left.
Yeah.
"You know, I understand."
You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.
"But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?"
I fell in love.
- Oh.
- Yep.
- Corvette?
- No.
I fell in love with this.
Whoa.
Look at that.
"Look, they're drivin' right by."
They don't even know what they're missing!
"Well, it didn't used to be that way."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist."
Really?
Yeah.
"Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way."
How do you mean?
The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.
"It moved with the land, you know?"
"It rose, it fell, it curved."
- Mornin'!
"- Nice day, huh?"
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.
They drove on it to have a great time.
"Well, what happened?"
The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
Traitor you get your hands off of me!
I can't breathe!
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the Führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind?"
It was not to be cherie.
"You bastard, I'll get you for this!"
"Indiana Jones, adieu!"
Nooo!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Oh my god this whole place is slithering!
Indy!
"Aow, Jesus!"
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
Where the hell were you
"- Watch it, watch it!"
What are you doing?
Helping the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
"I'm working on it, I'm working on it!"
"Whatever you're doing, do it faster!"
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
Just get ready to run whatever happens to me.
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
What?
- Don't you dare.
- What would you have me do?
- What would you do?
- Not this!
That's not an answer.
That doesn't help me.
I cannot let this fail.
It just has.
You're wrong.
"You've got what you wanted, so you can stop now."
It's OK.
"It's all right, you're all right."
You returned what you stole.
Your sentence is commuted.
Justice and mercy.
This is our law.
"You know, we're totally confident."
I've looked closely at the vaccine research and it's impeccable.
There's nothing at all to worry about.
And I'd like to thank you for your courage.
We're not the only ones.
There are survivors everywhere.
"People live, you know?"
The thought of Davy being alone.
That finishes me.
The rest...
It's a good life.
Thanks.
We'll bring the car back.
"Looking for her son Peter, 12 today."
There's an estate called Waterhouse.
Then...
I'll go with someone else.
Don't forget to pick me up!
Didn't you say that you don't like movie?
"I did, but I didn't say I will not go!"
Xiaotian!
- Has the class over?
"- Yes, why are you here ?"
Didn't you say you have no vacation?
The brigade dispatched us here to borrow equipment.
"I just want too see you, so I asked for one day off."
But I have to report the task at 7 a.m tomorrow.
It just one night?
Many things you can do in one night!
Well...
"The key car, it's for you."
"There is some clothes for change, too."
"Inside the packet of clothes, you'll find something you need!"
What is it?
I'm feeling uneasy to tell it!
Isn't it distracting?
It is.
You may take that off.
- Xiamu...
- It's 6 p.m.
"Yes, it is."
6 p.m?
Sorry!
Sorry!
I forgot.
Come here immediately!
I can't go now.
- Who?
Why is this man threatening my husband with a gun?
- Do not allow...
- Shut her up.
"-Get down, you Nazi bitch."
-No no!
"Cookie, Cookie, Cookie!"
No no no no!
Cookie!
Do not!
Do not!
Please do not leave me!
It's a bad plan anyway.
"The best strategy is, to destroy the enemy from within."
He must defeat himself.
"Do not be an enemy, Bishop!"
The personification of the devil is a symbol of all evil.
In the form of humanoids.
"That's you, black blood!"
"Let me go, black blood!"
I'm going to kill them all!
"Just wait, I'll kill you!"
Keep your breath and keep the peace with God.
Shit!
What do the Noids know about God?
You are raised as rats in the laboratory.
Is the color of our blood so different?
Are not we all children of God?
God did not create you.
-We did.
You are an abomination without a soul.
- I am sorry!
I work right across the street.
Yes.
We work right across the street from it.
Did you ever own a firearm?
I already told you no.
"No, I've never owned a firearm."
Why are you hassling me?
Just call County.
- Where'd you say you were?
"- You know, I told you where I was."
- What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a med
- I'm a med student.
I'm a med student.
What difference does that make?
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I told you what I am.
"Look, we brought you in because you match the ID."
Because I match the ID.
What?
"Young, black and handsome?"
That's
"- No, that's ridiculous."
I'll send them over immediately.
Jerry.
- Do we have photo IDs down here?
"- Yeah, bottom shelf."
Messenger off personnel face sheets for Pratt and Gallant to Area Seven Headquarters.
- Really?
Why?
- Just do it.
"Susan, Sean Simmons is being discharged to home hospice care."
What's this?
I'm the Boss after all.
I always carry my portable lobby along.
Sit.
Where do I sit?
Here.
Don't sit there you fool.
It'll crack the eggs.
So there are eggs inside?
No.
There are nails.
They'll pierce through.
Yes Mr. Thakur.
How can I be of service?
Are you going to kill Shiv in jail?
Why are you being so eager Thakur?
I know all about you.
First you clear the garbage and then your record.
Thakur.
If kill him in your jail... won't there be an investigation on you?
The media's been showing your footage with that boy... and boring you to death.
If kill him won't you be blamed?
He's right.
Then what do we do?
It's simple.
We won't kill Shiv in jail.
We'll get him out first and then...
Superb.
Let him escape.
What do you say Ayushman?
Let's make him flee from jail.
Stupid fool.
Let's get back to the 'Beast'!
How will I benefit if I succeed?
You'll become a nameless hero.
I said how will I benefit?
The League of Nations will thank you!
What benefit is that to me?
The whole world will love you!
That means I don't benefit at all!
More than that.
There's half a million!
- Japanese Yen?
- American dollar!
American dollar?
Where do I find the American?
Cafe Casablanca.
Take him to Room 44 here.
What does he look like?
Wearing a white suit and a pink rose.
"When you see him, just say:"
You want woman?
Worth's half a million.
"And he'll reply, 'Get some sort of toys'!"
Good. I'll go first!
"- Hold on, I'll go first!"
- Why?
So that I don't have to pay.
Tips?
"Book says don't give anything today, especially tips."
What a miser!
White suit and pink rose?
What a coincidence!
"Mister, you want woman?"
Here.
Any time.
Thanks.
Uh...
where do I start?
The first step is admitting to someone that you love and trust that you're powerless before your addiction.
That's not going to be easy.
"No, it's going to hurt like hell, but the program works, it really does."
Hi there.
STONETREE:
So how do we know it's the same killer?
Similar MO.
Kills with the victim's... choice of drug.
"Uh, Lewis..."
mind if I bum one?
Thanks.
If the killer knows their addictions...
He knows them pretty well.
"Maybe very well, if you know what I mean."
When?
Fairly close to the time of death.
After the meeting?
Yep.
How about the last victim?
"Uh-huh, that's why I checked."
Okay.
Well...
"Let's make some connections, uh..."
"Do we have the, uh... members' last names?"
"Yeah, and the telephone numbers."
Sign-in sheet from the meeting.
"Though, I got to tell you, I feel a bit like Judas."
"Oh, good for you."
Not really what I expected.
"Well, who is, huh?"
"You, for example."
No one had you down for such a cunt.
I see.
"90,000 Euros for this gentleman here, 95!"
95 thousand Euros here!
"Now, do I see one hundred thousand Euros?"
Get it out!
One hundred thousand Euros!
One hundred thousand Euros!
Gone to the man in the fine spectacles and now to the most coveted soprano in the world!
You got him to talk yet?
It won't be long now.
Mrs. Clios...
Are we nearly there?
We'll wait until the Service gates open.
Enter the property from both sides.
Hello.
Are you crying?
No.
So?
Boy trouble?
Not exactly.
Why don't you come back to the party?
Your brother's doing a very fine job.
I just lost out a dance with a beautiful woman.
"Maybe, I could have one with you."
"No, thank you."
Hmm.
"Well, surely there is something we can do to cheer you up."
"Die, you sucking pervert!"
"Dr. Corday, hi."
We need some Haldol here!
- You think that's necessary?
- Yes!
"Doctor C, looking good."
"Thanks, Malik."
"So, what's the GCS on this motorcycle trauma?"
"- Sorry, I didn't do the ride."
- Oh.
"Well, have the X-ray tech..."
- ... come down for portables.
- You got it.
- Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
"- Hey, welcome back."
Thanks.
So do you know any of the specifics?
"Sixteen-year-old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole, no helmet."
Carter's bringing her in.
- What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
- What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?
"Have the rapid infuser primed and ready, draw her up 100 of fent four of Ativan."
Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
- It's like you never left.
- Yeah.
Vital sign.
- We need some O-neg.
- She got a rhythm?
- P. E.A. to agonal before arrival.
- Decreased breath sounds.
Intubated for agonal resps.
Didn't know you were back.
No.
"Young man, how much cash do you have on you?"
"It's not a girl after all, it's a boy."
Who would've guessed?
"Fine, have it your way."
(BLADE GRUNTING)
"Noah, hurry up!"
"I've prepared a stronger dose, which I'm hoping will make it last longer."
"The problem is, you're developing a resistance to the retrovirus."
"Fine, fine."
"Enough talking, old man."
Just do it!
(GRUNTING)
(GASPING)
BLADE:
Stop!
"Get out of here, little girl."
Shame on you.
"Not very sporting, killing your prey in his sleep."
Let's let him rest a bit longer.
No?
"He's a hybrid, half-human, half-vampire."
What they call a Daywalker.
"The drug helps suppress his thirst for blood, but the side effects are excruciatingly painful and get worse every time."
Coffee?
"No, thanks."
(CHUCKLES)
"You know, I've known Eric for along time."
We first met on a night much like this.
"Dover, England"
"I'm sorry, mister."
I had to.
But they do not know how to wait‎.
Thank you‎.
"Hey‎, what's wrong‎?"
We have to take an alternative path for Saint Andreasberg‎.
"So we get to ""emptiness"" and go‎."
"Sorry‎, gentlemen‎."
We were told that the bridge is broken‎.
So we have to divert another way‎.
I do not mind the trip‎.
It is actually pleasant‎.
"But here we have a guy on the other hand‎, it ‎.‎.‎."
I'm not sure who likes shortcuts‎.
"You can go in the cabin if you want‎, sir‎."
I'm Lieutenant Goss‎.
Sergeant Jesse Owens‎.
"A pleasure to meet you‎, Lieutenant‎."
"Jesse Owens‎,‎.‎.‎."
How Olympic medalist Jesse Owens‎?
Exactly‎.
"Must be nice to confuse you with him‎, I guess‎."
‎
- Looks like a good guy‎. ‎
- Do you think‎?
‎
"- The man won 3 gold medals‎. ‎- 4 medals‎, sir‎."
Four‎?
It broke a world record‎.
I did seem to others as fools‎.
I can be liked‎.
¡Going‎!
"Danny boy‎, do you have gum‎?"
‎
We would have met him coming in.
Fantomas could not have escape.
Let's be coherent.
Where do you believe he's hiding?
Guess.
Guess?
Instead say you know nothing.
You made us lose enough time.
You would be better looking through the floors.
Useless.
Fantômas has not left these four walls.
This is absolute madness!
"Mr Nanteuil, would you please do me a service and draw plans of this floor?"
I can not draw.
Do your best.
Fine.
If you insist...
"I will prepare the ink and paper, Mr Nanteuil."
But what are you doing?
Oh!
I brought a little snapshot:
These prints are identical.
And these are the fingerprints of Jacques Dollon.
What is this story?
This is madness!
Mr Juve.
This is a journalist's trick!
It would be easy to make another print from my finger.
You'll see I'm not Jacques Dollon.
No need.
I saw through your act a second ago.
The hand of Jacques Dollon.
She left
I'm scared
What do you know?
I'm scared too
See that bird?
He can fly across a continent and never land once
"It must be wonderful, gliding through the sky"
Hey...
Balloons
Shall we go?
Will you give me the Swiss knife again?
"Yeah sure, baby, sure"
Don't speak to me like that
"Ok, baby"
Juve!
Juve!
Mr Thomery is waiting for the Baroness.
You could have told me earlier.
"My dear Mathilde, this portrait of you is beautiful."
This little Jacques Dollon has talent.
"We can clearly see the influence of Tamara de Lempicka, but you're a greater influence on him."
Oh!
What do you think?
Jacques is 25 years old.
"Since I've read ""Cheri"" by Colette..."
How is it going in Santo Domingo?
Very well.
I just bought 2 acres of land.
I was able to extend my sugar cane plantations.
"Sure, I have some problems with indigenous people, but..."
"Production increases, this is what counts."
"You'd think if it had been anybody else's dog,"
It'd have barked or done something.
"My god, the dog's a monster who must weigh 125 pounds."
"Boy, I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to try to strangle anybody"
With that critter around.
No one saw or heard anything?
"Uh, nothing."
It was a total blank.
And the guy was by myself for only three minutes or less.
We timed the trip back to the tennis court.
"Doc, are you absolutely sure he was strangled?"
You want to come see for yourself?
"Oh, no, no."
There is another thing.
The victim apparently fought back.
How is that?
The knuckles on his right hand were bloody.
"OK, Doc."
This one I've got to see for myself.
Let's go.
[Cat meowing]
HESTER:
"Well, young man?"
RICHARD:
"Oh, yes."
Ms. Ramsey.
I was just looking for...
HESTER:
Snooping around?
"Uh, spying, I believe they call it."
"No, ma'am."
Nothing like that.

"""Governess frozen in pond."""
Gotcha!
"Got it, sir!"
Get in here!
Take him downstairs.
"Body frozen in a pond, the snow gets a good long look at a human being, like a full body scan."
Everything they need to evolve.
Pond.
"Good point, Clara."
What are you doing here?
Madame Vastra wondered if you were needing any grenades?
Grenades?
She might have said help.
Help for what?
"Well, your investigation."
Investigation?
Who says I'm investigating?
Do you think I'm going to start investigating just because some bird smiles at me?
Who do you think I am?
Sherlock Holmes.
"Don't be clever, Strax, it doesn't suit you."
"Sorry, sir."
"I'm the clever one, you're the potato one."
"Yes, sir."
Now go away.
Yes...
Mr Holmes.
Oi!
"Shut up, you're not clever or funny and you've got tiny little legs!"
"OK, just tell her you're leaving, you're not going up."
- How we gonna get there?
- Walk.
"Feet, did y'all hear what that man said?"
"- When my man appears, send him up with my luggage, will you?"
"- Very good, sir."
Show Mr. Wooster to his room.
"This way, sir."
Mr. Wooster just arrived.
I've given him room nine.
Good.
Keep me informed of everything he does.
I'm Mr. Wooster's man.
What room shall I take his things to?
- Mr. Wooster is in room nine.
- Thank you.
"- What's the matter, old man?"
Don't you feel well?
"- I'm very well, thank you."
- Have you got wasps in this hotel?
- Wasps?
Of course not.
- I feel certain I've been stung.
- Possibly your imagination.
"Possibly, but not probably."
- I'll carry that for you for two bits.
- Two bits of what?
That's a quarter— 25 cents American money.
"No, thank you."
I don't need your aid.
What an extraordinary language.
Two bits!
"Well, Jeeves, you were right again."
- I'm not hungry
All right.
Don't eat.
How am I bothered?
Eat it
I told you.
I'm not hungry.
Come on now.
Eat
What did you say?
I got carried away
Never mind.
"In big places, such small things happen"
"You were right, Senorita."
The spirit of adventure in this barn... you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?
"No, not Zurich."
"Tomorrow evening, we entrain at Berne."
Tomorrow morning... we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything
"Now, nothing can go wrong"
What's that?
- Life
Aren't you ashamed to drink in the presence of a lady?
Better than dying before the lady!
"If you wish to live on... you too should have a bit, Senorita."
- Don't you dare come near me
"All right, don't"
I'll see you tomorrow morning if you're still alive.

You are with me because this is your first night.
From tomorrow you are on your own.

I'll go first.
How much money should I ask for?
"2,000 rupees don't settle for less."
Drink up!
"Go on, have another swig."
It eases the pain!
Move aside.
Time to get to work!
Looking for fun?
- Yes!
How much will you pay?
- Let's bargain on the way.
There is one!

- Better call Saul
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
You are under arrest.
I'd better call Saul!
Hi.
I'm Saul Goodman.
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!"
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, I know."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.

I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, Doctor!"
"- Your medication, Miss Porter."
"- Thank you, Gunther."
"- What book are you reading, miss?"
"- Oh, it's Edgar Allan Poe."
- Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"- The tales may be dark, I know what you're saying, but... through them, he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he... holds up a mirror to our own lives."
- You're a very thoughtful woman.
"- Thank you, Gunther."
- If you ever need anything ever you just let me know.
- Ah!
- Isabel.
"- Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
- Calm yourself.
"- Oh, thank God."
There's a man in there!
There's blood everywhere!
I...
I just...
- Dr. Lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"- I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
- Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
- No.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
He's got a thing about... clowns.
That's okay.
Lots of people are afraid of clowns.
"Oh, no, no."
He's not afraid of them.
He likes them.
Like a fetish?
"[Sighs] Oh, good Lord."
I-I haven't verified it yet.
I still have to speak with one of his exes.
Okay.
"Keep me posted, will you?"
"Ryan, that is excellent."
Thank you.
"Now, just hold off on giving it to LAPD just until morning."
We have a plan to expose who's behind this.
[Sighs] Or get ourselves killed.
Having second thoughts?
About having a ménage with a trophy-taking serial killer?
No!
What could possibly go wrong?
"Look, this the murder weapon."
All you have to do is distract Austin long enough for me to find this knife.
Let's just hope we don't find it in one of our backs.
Right.
[Alarm beeping] Oh.

Wow.
Ooh.
Sorry.
I was setting up a few counter-surveillance precautions.
We're right behind You.
The promising claim.

Captain kris is forced to go Back to the drawing board.
That means we're not Working tomorrow.
That's what that means.
"It pisses me off, man."
That's life.
"Man, I can't win."
It just seems like I can't stop.
From getting screwed over On a daily basis.
"Under the command Of captain kris,"
The kellys have secured Second place on the scoreboard.
Today is our first Day of mining.
"Go find us Lots of gold, zeke!"
It's gonna be fun.
You need to come up Immediately.
Now I'm starting To get worried.
I can't see over here.
"Take my hand, zeke!"
I am a miner!
[buzzes] [faint infant crying]
[crying continues]
[London] Chip!
I can't.
It won't stop crying.
- She.
She won't stop crying.
"- Yes, ""she."""
I'm not cut out for this.
We made a huge mistake.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, what could possibly make you upset in a paradise like this, right?"
"He could find a way, trust me."
But stick around.
He shouldn't be that long.
"Besides, seeing you will make him feel better."
"Ah, well, I doubt that."
- You got that whole lease thing.
"- Right, right, right."
"Welcome, Kisan."
"I'm Charles Greane, assistant general manager."
- Great to have you.
- Indeed.
Appreciate it.
"What up, man?"
You ready to make us look good?
"Yeah, man, better than you already look."
- And you a handsome man.
- ( chuckles ) My dude.
"Hey, hey, hey."
You dandelions gonna run some drills or you gonna stand there circle jerking?
"Man, I was born to run, Coach."
You know that.
- My man make you say Bo looks slow.
- ( snaps fingers )
Why are we still talking?
You should be running.
Lace them the fuck up.
"Come on, I'll show you the locker room."
Let's go.
- Right.
- ( phone buzzing )
Why did you take so long?
I have been expecting you.
I will explain...
I will explain the reason for my visit.
Reasons do not matter.
I only want you to answer some questions about...
It will be best for you to ask nothing.
Can you pour me a drink?
a...drink?
Double?
If you like.
Double.
I only want you to answer one question.
Would you like it if I told you...that I like you?
What do you know about her?
"Oh, you are refering to the murdered girl."
The same.
I know many things.
Tell me.
"I know she was a model, who came to a swimsuit designer's convention."
What else.
And that she was murdered.
The only thing I don't know is who did it.
Are you satisfied?
"No, I am not."
"Surely, you will be."
S.O.S.
he is in the elevator.
its stoped on the second floor.
"Open up, Laura."
Need something?
I want some info on the murdered girl.

Hello?
"Ted, change of plans."
You left her with Barney?
"Ted, will you take it easy?"
I'm your bro.
You're an animal.
"And even though our bro-lationship has suffered its setbacks in this area,"
I assure you I will be the perfect gentleman.
Oh.
Thanks.
"By the way, I really like those overalls."
You have 10 minutes to get down here or the window's closing.
- 10 minutes?
- But it still works.
- I don't think so.
- And if I sweep the cakes off the table?
Would that help?
"Tilde, we belong to each other."
- Go away.
- Stop it!
- Are you listening to me?
- Go away!
"Tilde, it..."
Let's go home now.
May I look?
- We're not going to make love.
"- No, I just want to look."
"- You may touch them, if you like."
"- No, I just want to look."
- We've never dated anybody else.
- No.
"Remember, when we sat in the old truck   peeling each other's clothes off?"
How old were we?
- Twelve... thirteen.
"- Eleven, I think."
That's pretty advanced for two 11-year-olds.
It's as if the world got bigger with you.
Everything was more fun.
More entertaining.
"If you don't stop shooting up, you'll die."
"No, I won't die."
The drugs are keeping me alive.
"You need to take a break, or you'll die."
You're my break.
It's you.
it's your uncle bob.

"- okay, i got this crazy note from her."

[cellphone beeps]
- bob.
Now get ours.
That ship's not taking off without us.
You got that?
- Halt!
"- Oh, please don't shoot!"
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell are you doing
"- out here, lady?"
- I was being held captive.
By Nazis?
"No, worse."
- Your helmet.
- What about it?
I've seen it before.
"Paper, do you have paper?"
Something to write with.
"Lady, I think you're in shock."
Please!
Yeah.
"So if it wasn't Nazis, who were you running from?"
I need your helmet.
Now!
"I'm sorry, my love, but this game is not over yet."
"Despite my wishes to pursue Savage alone, it seems that you're all intent on seeing this thing through till the bitter..."
Oh!
Speaking of bitter.
You knew.
You dropped us off five months later
- because you knew.
- Knew what?
"You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister."
- I'm afraid that that...
It ain't worth it.
I'd have done it for a tanner.
(Laughs)
Your moustache...
"Oh, yes, sir."
"I got the creeping alopecia, sir."
"It crept all over my lip, it did, sir."
"Yes, sir."
- Fetch Mrs Ransom.
"- Yes, sir."
I'm sure Mrs Ransom was after local colour for one of her romances.
Local colour is one thing.
Asking a publican for a Mickey Finn is another.
- I don't know Mr Finn.
"- Knock-out drops, sir."
Drugs.
"Oh, my goodness!"
"Then hurling abuse at a police officer, and giving a false name."
"- ""Lotus Blossom."""
- Good gracious.
- She had been drinking.
"- Oh, never."
"No, Mumsie is totally teetotal."
"She was on port and lemon tonight, miss."
"Well, I'm sure she's very sorry indeed."
She's been under stress...
I shall write to my MP!
"You haven't heard the last of this, not by a long chalk!"
- Flora!
- Sit down.
Masquerading as civilians.
That oaf who arrested me hadn't even shaved!
No!
You gave me your word!
Come on!
There might be more of those bastards inside.
"No, you mustn't go out there."
They'll kill you.
Stay here!
They're going to kill you!
Leave her.
"She doesn't need a priest, she needs an executioner."
Or are you trying to tell me that you hope these bandits will go to heaven?
- Be careful.
- I will be.
Don't worry.
Come on.
Get them all out of there.
- I hoped they'd catch Carrasco too.
- We were told he wasn't among them.
Too bad.
"But if they've got any captives, we'll make them talk."
"We've got the whole gang, Coronel."
- Let me speak to your commander.
- Be quiet.
- You lied to me.
You gave me your word.
- What's all this shouting about?
They were in that hospital over there.
- There.
- Have they been identified?
- Some.
- The corpses must be burnt.
"- You're Padre Julio, aren't you?"
Fine with me.
"Tony, stay with McGee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smelled like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dirt, sweat... and sandalwood."
ZIVA:
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant, so I used yours."
"No, you didn't."
"Yeah, we're partners."
What's the big deal?
A hair!
TONY:
"Come on, you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ground radar techs didn't show till dawn.
McGee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very Brokeback Mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."""
How romantic.I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well, I can show it to you on my new phone it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
ZIVA:
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
Not really.
- What?
- I...
- Hurry up and say it!
This office...
The person who is renting and using this office...
I was... doing something here...
- On the side.
- What did you do on the side?
Something similar to a detective agency...
What the heck were you going around doing?
You don't have to worry too much.
I... saw the faces of our suspects.
What are you talking about?
I saw two guys running out of here.
"I know who they are, so we can go and catch them together."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Wait one second.
"So... these guys that you know, were in your office..."
"And they murdered a guy, that you know... and ran away."
"But on their way out, they happened to run into you?"
"Sir, this is the place."
Get ready.
Open the door!
It's the police!
- Open the door!
- Who is it?
- It's the police.
Open the door!
- What's going on?
My arm!
My arm!
Hold on a second!
She sounded so happy...
But you were seen no where.
I kept telling her we should leave the city.
But she did not listen.
She was confident that you would come back... and asked me to wait.
How many days do we give excuses?
The moneylenders have kidnapped my daughter.
They are threatening to kill my daughter
If we don't clear all our debts.
What do you mean?
I want my daughter back.
Alive.
Alive.
- Sir...
Please get up.
Please.
Don't cry.
We will rescue Deepa for sure.
They are very dangerous people.
If we go to the police...
They will not think twice to kill my daughter.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Give me a day's time.
Please.
Come.
Have a seat.
How much do you owe them now?
Going to have your morning coffee with Sadhana?
I have to invite my close friend.
I will be able to meet him only if I go now.
So...
Bye.
Careful.
Don't worry;
I know my cousin's greed all to well.
He won't let that land slip away.
Fourteen thousand and three shekels!
Eighteen thousand shekels!
you can't afford it.
but he doesn't. want to see how you get yourself out of it.
Eighteen thousand shekels going once!
eighteen thousand shekels going twice!
And eighteen thousand going...
Eighteen thousand and one!
Boaz?
your charity has no end.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
I'll bear any burden.
Your worries will be my own.
I've been blessed by your care.
for you are my home.
and stone only make a dwelling.
It's you that makes this house a home.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
Heaven smiles on us both;
for you are my home. ( end song)
Good morning.
You're up early.
- You worry too much.
"All our patients get VIP treatment, Bick."
God is blessed.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- Ah.
Owen.
I heard you were here getting your second cycle of temozolomide.
Yes.
"Yes, I finished my last fraction of radiation one month ago."
And look at you.
You look terrific.
"Well, uh..."
The therapy is working beautifully.
Uh... the last brain scan showed...
no tumor enhancement.
"- That's wonderful, news."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Now, is there any dizziness, fatigue,"
- No.
Weakness... seizure activity?
No to all three.
I feel like a new man.
"And if I, uh, may ask, h-how's the, uh, reconciliation going?"
"My son, Peter, he's forgiven me."
I plan to use every day I've got left to make up for the ones I wasn't here.
"Okay, now, as a fellow doctor, you'll be interested in this."
We have a new medication that we can add to your treatment regimen.
What is it?
It's experimental.
Valganciclovir.
The antiviral?
Mm-hmm.
It's not staph.
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
Which I would have seen in your MRI.
Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Let me see the MRI.
There was no abscess on the image.
"Let me see it, then."
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
That soft spot could now be an abscess.
"If it was staph, you'd have a fever."
Which you don't!
101.6.
What idiot gave you that?
Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
Triangle.
This one?
Uh... circle.
Next.
"Foreman, why aren't you answering?"
Is there a problem?
"Uh, s-square."
Tell me your date of birth.
Is that House?
- Yeah.
Next.
A square again.
Why is he here?
Because my neurologist is having surgery.
Thought I was just another patient.
"You didn't believe that crap, did you?"
Date of birth.
Cover page?
Manoj.
Why is he sobbing like this?
How many shocks in the truth can he bear to hear in a day?
He will be normal in a while.
You left him to sob alone?
- What do you want me to do?
He is crying by himself.
You should be the one to console him.
Go.
- Not again!
"So, she has been selectively cheating blind men."
They have to be blind...
They must believe her stories.
Must be ready to give the money she asks.
She targets those people.
in the name of love...
And made a clean sweep.
"If my instincts are right, even now... she should be cheating someone..."
Call Priya.
Priya...
Where are you?
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire."
"You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass."
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire"
"You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually."
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
It takes a lot more than this rain... to wash away their sins.
Be sexy in the rain!
Thank God!
Aleluia!
Aleluia!
You know what we need?
- The lightning machine.
- Lightning!
Lightning machine?
Let's get out of here.
"Maybe we should stick around, get lost then start to move faster!"
I'm freezing.
Call me a cube.
"This is unbeareable, cube."
"I can't believe they're making rain... for the photo shoot with, water from the Hudson river!"
They're crazy!
We're all gonna get typhoid-d!
"Listen, we gotta take off these clothes."
We don't wanna get pneumonia.
Do you think they'd mind if I wore something from the wardrobe?
No!
Go for it.
It's too jay.
"These things are supposed to be worn, not framed."
- I'm swimming in it!
- Hang on.
Where's your head?
Hang on.
"That's it, that's it."
There you go.
What's that?
Hang on!
Thank you.
Do you remember the day my grandmother died?
Jenna?
Remember how they let me in so that I could kiss her goodbye?
"There was this pain in my heart that day that I had never felt before,"
and that I've never felt again until now.
I feel like I'm mourning the death of the single most important thing in my life.
Us.
"But we're not dead, Jenna."
"We're not dead, baby."
We just have to go back.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.
Please love me enough to let us go back to the way things were.
"I don't think I can, Michael."
"Well, then, we'll start something new, but we have to try, right?"
How can we not try?
Jenna?
Jenna?
Western grip?
Western grip?
Correct.
Just like holding hands.
Holding hands?
Like this?
- I don't know how.
- I don't know how.
Yamete kudasai.
Ah?
Please stop doing that.
- Can't hear you.
Stop!
Francis!
Bash!
Stop!
Stop!
"Please, stop!"
You don't have to marry him!
It's all over!
"My mother, nostradamus,"
They say we can be wed.
What do you mean?
There is no prophecy keeping us apart.
"Please, listen..."
Does it matter?
"Mary, nothing needs to change."
We can still be wed.
"What do you mean, no prophecy?"
Even nostradamus will tell you.
Your fate is your own when it comes to who will you marry.
Him or me.
I knew he would get to you in time.
"Did your seer tell you that, too?"
Is this a game to you?
Nostradamus told me the prophecy was fulfilled.
With clarissa's death.
How can I believe you when you have so much to lose?
"oh, god, what are you doing?"
"Do nothing, and I will die."
"Watch me, if that's what it takes"
To convince you I'm not putting
My life ahead of my son's.
I never have.
What is his name?
Just write it down!
I don't know.
You know that.
I've told you this story so many times.
"You know he would've loved you, but..."
"What is his name, for christ's sakes?"
!
Go to your room!
That is not okay!
Have you ever tried to look him up?
No.
"He told me that his name was saxon banks,"
Like mr.
"Banks, the dad in ""mary poppins."""
Mm-hmm.
"But i googled him afterwards, and..."
We met in a bar.
"He was funny and sexy,"
And we were both pleasantly drunk.
We got a hotel room that overlooked the ocean.
It was beautiful and romantic.
"Ahem, and then he..."
Changed.
What do you mean he changed?
He became extremely aggressive.
It was like he was operating
Some piece of machinery or something.
It was just so rote.
"I tried to resist, but..."
He was way bigger than i was.
I eventually just stopped resisting because...
What a Christmas treat...
What a treat!
..if you would bust some moves to give us a...
CHEERING
"I mean, guys, anything."
"What tempo would suit you, Rhys?"
You want upbeat.
They can do upbeat.
They do nuclear.
They go very fast.
Have you got any Jive Bunny and the mastermixes?
There he goes.
FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYS
Wow!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thank you!
Are you on medication?
LAUGHTER No.
Everybody loves Flight of the Conchords and I loved Murray.
Your character was sublime.
Will we see more of him?
Well...
I would love to say yes and I certainly can't say no.
I'd hate to think he wouldn't be done again.
Was it something that the boys...?
Do you need half an hour to catch your breath?
"Well, you saw what I just did!"
I did that and then straight away with another question!
"""Tell us about your mother."""
All right.
"The Conchords, it started off for most audiences here as a radio show."
Yeah.
Inter-planetary.
"So take him, Stanin."
"Look, tell me, do you love me?"
"Look, do you hear?"
Will you write to me?
"Tell me, do you love me?"
Will you write to me?
Manya?
Let's beat it!
Look...
We're just naturally loose!
"We can't broadcast this to our planet, nobody would believe it."
And why not?
"Because if they get to know this on our planet, then everyone will want to fly here."
And we don't have enough flying saucers for this.
It would be the end of our civilization.
You get it?
Hallo.
Hallo!
What do you think?
Should I write to her?
Don't pick it up!
What will you report to them?
This just isn't possible.
I'll adjust the message a bit so it won't be so shocking.
What do you think about this?
-No.
It's concealing facts.
-I know.
But it will be better this way.
Believe me.
I'll only a little bit more...
So because you won't stand up to your boss...

Not a thing.
KELLY:
"Mrs. Dupree, we'd like to come by and ask you some more questions."
Tomorrow morning.
Can I send the detectives by?
"No, Mr. Fuentes, we wanna talk to both of you."
"Well, when will she be off?"
Tomorrow morning?
We'll be there before noon.
Thank you.
"-Kelly, you're up."
But he will tease if I tell him.
Which is why...
You are a friend who knows him well.
He will not get a better partner than you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
"Siri, time?"
"Siri, call Deepa."
"Hi, Deepa."
I'm waiting for you.
Where are you?
'Sadhana Calling'.
Deepa.
What happened?
Is something wrong?
I can help you only if you tell me.
"Please, Deepa."
Tell me.
What's it?
My sister fell in love with a guy.
His family is quite well off.
"But, they still accepted their wedding."
Since it was my sister's wish...
My father spent more than he could afford
He got her married in a grand way.
She is happy with her life.
Finished measuring?
Anything else?
Choose the material.
I'll take the one in your hand.
Cloth-cutting.
"Murderous tailor, I've guessed your real game."
I've done nothing to offend you.
Why do you want me dead?
Sifu Tam is angry with you.
Taking revenge is a poor way to solve the problem.
Please pass on this message to Sifu Tam.
I want to be friends with him.
- Foon.
"- Yes, Sifu?"
- Get him a new pair of scissors.
- Yes.
Still dirty.
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
"More money, more money..."
Ruined another one.
Help!
"Get a grip, you coward!"
"Sister, it's you!"
I thought it was that painted face!
Nothing to worry about.
You were born without courage.
Why are you afraid of a painted face?
- I nearly died from the shock.
- Go and dry the clothes!
Give me a minute to recover.
"I told you before, you only use two fingers to squeeze."
Why do I have to squeeze with two fingers?

He's crazy in love with you.
Not a chance!
"We were togetherfor a year, this is all I have left."
Why did you break up?
"He never says no, not even to his mom, he neverrisks anything."
I got mad and put him to the test.
I told him I'd asked to transfer.
And what did he do?
"Nothing, sir!"
- Mr. VoIpe?
- Mr. Director.
What is it?
You want to report me again?
Why don't you talk to yourmother?

Alex.
What are you thinking?
I don't wanna go home tonight.
I think you probably have to.
No.
All I have to do is decide to pay the consequences.
- And?
I have to find the way to touch the hearts of people.
"What does your heart say, sire?"
Carlos?
Mr. Lloyd?
But look at it as well.
It's beautiful.

Now focus on her femininity.
It is madness.
We can not do it.
"- I agree, but it was decided."
"We have no other choice, now or never again."
"But Sire, we can not leave without protocol and security."
"In fact, Sire, it is undeniable that there are dangers."
"The dangers are everywhere, always."
- But Mr. Lloyd will not come with us.
"Mr. Lloyd is the architect of our escape, Louise."
It is very creative.

Yes or no?
- Give it to me!
- Call me Sister!
How can you bite me!
Let go!
"Xiamu,"
I have a question for you.
"You still remember, don't you?"
The last time you saw your mother face?
Good!
"You may cry, scream and hit me!"
You're not a dummy anymore!
I knew you are scared.
"Every night you scared, aren't you?"
But have you even thought about... if the way you are now is what people want to see?
"As of today,"
Sister will accompany you.
You cannot just stay in this house.
You have to try going out.

We can't take back the warhead under this circumstances.

Ok?
Let's go... 1... 2... 3...
Male!
Are you ok?
Male?
Male!
It was done?
No...
Just...
Destroy the TL immediately!

You are going to roast a warhead.
Yes.

I'm going to disable the GUNK's launcher.

I'll report back when the launcher preparation is ready.
Hurry up Male!

"Before that, please, destroy the main gun!"
"Sorry, was in trouble."
I'm in a blind spot here.
Let me see if I can do something...
333...
A number that ends with 333.
Details of this number?
You said the the victim of the accident got calls from a number?
Is it the same number?
Let me check.
Yes.
It's the same number.
"The number we got from the lodge, Manoj's number, and this number."
There's some connection definitely.
Sir.
"Moorthy, how are you?"
- I'm fine.
Did our car met with an accident?
Why do you ask?
"The cops are torturing me, Sir."
"They are accusing me of that accident, that I drove the car."
What did you say?
That I am no longer working for you.
I told them that the lady with you drives your car.
How did you...
Why did you blabber all that?
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir!
Fool!
"Manoj, tell us the truth at least now."
Who was with you?
What actually happened?
Who is it?
The same cops who came yesterday.
Tell me what happened.
I did tell you that nothing happened.

"You know that Emily's out there, right?"
Why?
- It's a long story.
Just do me a favor.
- Sure.
Keep an eye on my parents.
Make sure they don't disrupt anything.
My mother doesn't behead anyone.
My father doesn't snore too loudly.
- They won't do anything like that.
- Haven't you met them?
- Why would they do that?
You're not wearing them?
"Difficult, considering... was it you?"
Earrings?
Tip of the iceberg...
Why tonight?
"Because, to have a fiancé who is 50% shit is too much."
Why me?
Because tonight...

Thank you.
You do that again and I'll take you across my knee.
"Well, are you ready?"
Thanks.
"Well, thanks very much for lunching with me."
- I'll call for you in about an hour.
- Thank you too.
- I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
"- Oh, just a moment!"
- What do you want?
I'm in a hurry.
I wouldn't annoy Miss Lowman again if I were you.
What right have you to interfere?
Are you a relative?
- No.
"- Then I have just as much right... to speak to her as you have, old boy."
"Nevertheless, I'm warning you."
"If you interfere with her, you'll get into trouble."
"Oh, I see then."
You're one of these government fellows.
Clever aren't you?
"Well, just keep away from her."
We Woosters never get enmeshed in the official dragnet.
- No?
"- Oh, no."
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- How about your legs?
- No.
I can't feel them.
"Gallant, need a hand here."
We' re talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?
I'm on Psych rotation.
I really shouldn't be helping you.
"- Haleh, this is a dead body."
- You ought to go to med school.
Can't take her to the morgue yet.
We' re waiting on family.
Why am I not exploding?
No movement below the umbilicus.
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?
You might have bruising to your spinal cord.

Hate them.
No.
See that?
They're trying to escape.
"They hate me, too."
Your books don't hate you.
"Rory, my brain is full."
It has reached capacity.

- You have a very active head.
- I cannot ingest any more information.
- Take a break.
- I don't have time.
"Close your eyes, clear your head."
Clearing my head just means that... all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out.
"In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff."
It's a very vicious circle.
I'll make some coffee.
- I hate finals.
But i ain't got the money to pay it.
Josie... nick... she's a gilt-edged corporation.
"Mr. Boyd, we can get through to the hospital now."
I got a carriage for the colonel.
"No, i don't want any carriage."
Got a golden chariot comin' for me.
I wonder if those gates are really made of gold.
"Right, then."
Go straight to the office...
Don't dawdle on the way
Don't worry
I'll call in 30 minutes to check
"Oh, hello Fujio"
"Is your mother here, too?"
Why are you outside?
It's no fun listening to women's talk
"Well, why don't we go in together?"
I'm fine out here
"Right, you wait out here"
Aunty!
Tell mom...
"If she's not out soon, I'm leaving!"
I'll tell her

Blood?

He knew martial arts
Have you heard of anyone who was stabbed here and didn't die?
Who is that man?
"My friend, why're you so rude?"
Release me first
"Oh, my waist!"
T ell me quick!
"Y es, yes!"
That man was covered by blood
But he could still survive!
My Master asked him what happened
And he tried to chop him up
I sensed something was wrong so I kicked him
"Go on, speak"
"Okay, it so happened that I kicked him"

He gave out a loud cry!

Who was that?
My husband.
Your husband?
"Relax, we're not married anymore, we're just good friends."
He lives down the hall.
"Oh, come on, let's get out of here."
Where to?
I'll change my dress and I'll show you the town.
Which one?
"Oh, I don't know."
You're a better judge at that than I am.
This is my new one.
"Say, that's pretty."
I'll get into it.

"Märchenbrunnen, Friedrichshain."
There you are!
What are you gonna do with the barrel organ?
- Were you a soldier during the war?
- Of course!
- What is your name?
"- Biberkopf, Franz."
- I'm Sonja.
- Are you from Poland?
"No, Bernau."
But then your name wouldn't be Sonja.
It is based on my appearance.
- Are you allright?
"- Yes, sort of."
"- You're not getting any pension, huh?"
"- Sometimes I get some, but not regularly."
Will you take me along?
"No, I'd better not."
What's the matter?
I'll take you along.
But your name is not Sonja at my place.
Your name will be...
It's better to sell them than to eat them.
You're a degenerate.
All of Naples is degenerate.
Why did you bring me here?
So I can feel as degenerate as you?
We didn't start this war.
We don't sell our bodies for a pack of cigarettes.
A pack of cigarettes?
"Maam, what will you give me for that?"
Right.
With this and a pack of cigarretes I can get bread... for a large family.
Would you like some maam?
- Here
- Thank you.
- I brought you here because...
- Because everyone can be cruel.
- Are we even now?
- Yes.
- Do you need anything else from me?
"- No, no."
Jimmy?
What did I do to you?
It's not my fault if things didn't go well for you today.
"What's wrong with you, Jimmy?"
- Here.
- What's that?
Try it.
"Here, like this."
Are you crazy?
I already have hair.
Did you bring this filthy thing from the US?
"No, not at all."
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
*****
"Guy,ready?"
"Hey,buddy.How you doing?"
Where'd you come from?
Get back!
"Move,move,get out of the way!"
- What's going on?
- They're under the ground!
- Look out!
- They're under the ground!
"All units,all units,be advised."
Air support en route to pine street park.
Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.
Bomb squad on scene.
"Oh,this does not look good."
- You were actually near where...
"- um,yeah,no,it was just right there."
- Was it over here?
- The south side.
Okay.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.An l.E.D.maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
- Holy crap...
- It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past,there were multiple occasions.He's not finished yet."
- So you know this case?
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
what do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only h have one shot?
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
"And that whoever you do not shoot, will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground."
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather 'round me here.
Captain taylor.
Mr. Crusoe!
I thought you'd forgotten us!
Are you gonna be leading us?
- I'll leave that to you.
- Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
It's coming from the jungle!
"Lancaster, unshackle the men!"
"Come on, pick up the muskets."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sods!"
They're in disarray!
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Reload!
No!
Hold your fire.
"Get in line, sir."
"--What do you want, boy?"
--An eraser.
5 cents
--You?
--The complaint book
And a pen.
You may be from Venus.
But I am not from Mars.
Think I'll give you a pen so you can write that I never gave you one?
I request your attention!
"I was not given a pen, so I will express it orally"
"Vladimir Nikolaevich, if you do not instantly cancel your order to halt garage demolition then I am instantly going into retirement."
I am counting to three
One!
Two!

"No, it is!"
I am counting.
Two Two and a half
Three!
Three and a half...
"Pavel Ivanovich, nobody can take away your right to your lawful rest..."
Pavel Ivanovich...
Pavel Ivanovich
Our car is over there...
--Where to now?
Back to work?
--Home?
"--I have no home, Bobylev"
How about my place?
- What did he have to drink?
- A bit too much vodka.
- It's Tuesday afternoon.
- We were celebrating his grades.
- You must be really proud of him.
- We certainly are.
"We are, too."
I'm taking you home.
- Get better soon.
"- We'll phone tomorrow, babe."
What are you at?
The last one sort of didn't work.
Alex went diving.
- Come on.
"That's not X, it's coke."
- I said I didn't want any.
You never want anything.
DRUGS
I started using drugs...
Somebody offered me some.
"Everyone does them, so I did too."
When we use them...
nothing can stop us.
"Drugs are a way of escaping from your problems, yes."
My world without drugs Emptiness.
Coke makes you cooler because you are part of the crowd.
You feel you can do anything.
Nothing's impossible.
You can have whoever you want.
Nobody's better than you.
"The line between life and death, right?"
That's the best high of all.

You on a break?
"No, we're done."
You lost?
They said that my marriage to Mustafa was valid.
No.
"You don't have to go back, do you?"
"No, I divorced him."
I gave back the mahr.
The money from the villa.
Divorced?
Just like that?
"Oh, Islamic law has some interesting wrinkles."
"So you and I, we're not really married?"
We can be if you take this.
My mahr.
Your phone card?
There's almost $12 on it.
It's all I have.
"Yes, I will marry you."
"You know, it still may take some doing to keep her in the country."
"Well, she's officially an adulteress now so she can't go home."
That strengthens our asylum claim.
"Well, I give you exhibit A."
"Judge sees that, can't hurt."
"Here you go, gentlemen."
So what are we drinking to?
Women who appreciate the truth.
Let me know when you find one.
Is she wiping her tears?
"If it's evening now, Om must've changed into casuals"
Yes Ma...
Om...
Jai sends you his regards.
May he be happy
"Anyway Jags, I can't write anymore."
Any more of this and I'll cry
Take care of yourself.
My regards to everyone
"Jagadish, tell him I'll mail him his money soon"
What else did Jai write?
"Ma, the letter is over"
Are you forgetting something...?
Om... girl... wedding...?
Come on
"Son, you won't refuse me, will you?"
"Refuse what, Ma?"
I have chosen a girl for you.
What...?
No refusing
She will see you tomorrow at the club
"You will see her, won't you?"
After my life
Isn't he looking cute?
Give me that hand
"What are you upto, Ma?"
Are you here to see Shanti?
Yes
Ma ends up choosing this one for me?
I was shocked when I heard your name
You too aren't what your name suggests (Shanti:
- I shall call the police.
"- No, cos your part's over."
The end of your scene.
Back to the dole for you.
"Five lines, thank you and good night."
"Well, I must say, this looks very interesting."
"She's crying, you know."
"That, Eddie, is the biz."
It's a tough life.
"It's a tough life, dearie."
"I mean, look at Arthur Mullard."
She used to be quite attractive.
- I still quite fancy her.
"- Yeah, hur-uhh."
"Well, I must say."
This is very interesting.
Must learn to read sometime.
Right.
Sod all this health food.
"When I eat, I like to dice with a heart attack."
Let's have a good English roast and a coronary thrombosis.
- Right.
Let's make a shopping list.
- Yeah.
Four hundred pounds of oven chips.
"Right, that seems simple enough."
Better check the larder.
"Waste not, want not."
- Remember the poor children.
"- Oh, the little poor children."
Yes.
With their cosy little terrace dwellings.
(girl grunting)
She's tethered!
Someone is hiding her here.
"Travis most likely, sir."
Alright.
You must have stumbled upon her lair.
You approached her.
"She felt threatened, so she attacked you."
Should I bring her back to the cells?
"No, no."
The Toronto Asylum under Dr. Ogden's care will be best.
Right.
"Do you think she's the killer, sir?"
Certainly seems capable of it.
I'd have to agree.
Alright.
(Fen grunting)
"Fen, I'm going to put you to sleep for a little while."
(indistinct chatter)
(Dr. Ogden exhales.)
My goodness!
Hard to believe it's the same girl.
Her persona was very much exaggerated.
Her hair and body unwashed...
That's quite a scar.
Yes.
From an animal attack some years ago.
Mr. Travis claims that she was mauled by a wolf.
"It's quite possible, William."
Her teeth have been deliberately filed down into points.
I took an impression.
It matches our victim's bite mark.
But it's pretty!
This for a party?
Mi?
"ka, you won't look good in this."
How can you say that?
I've got something to go with it...
A different material!
"I wanted to, but there wasn't anything."
Hardly anything at all.
But this is nice!
Then I'll hurry...
And now this.
So how do you want it?
"I don't know, you can advise us."
One meter twenty.
How much did they give me?
"One meter twenty, but double width."
- That's enough for the whole dress!
- From this?
She'll have one more dress.
Isn't it some mistake?
Good evening.
What can I bring you?
Good evening.
Looks nice here.
"Good wine and good prices, if only we had hard currency to pay for it."
We've only got ordinary crowns.
Bring us some good cheap wine.
"Two Martells, please."
And seven decilitres of wine.
Just a moment. I must know what it will cost.
"Grenadine for my daughter, please."
"My strong advice, sir, would be to appoint some of them to the jury."
"It would be not only prudent, but fair."
Fair?
They was gonna hang that man without a trial.
"All right, Litefoot."
You're appointed prosecutor.
Tell Sheriff Stains I'll pick some people for the jury from Eagle Bend.
"It's unorthodox, but I want this trial to be fair for everyone."
You can also tell the sheriff we're on the job here.
"That he will, gentlemen."
That he will.
Good day.
Can I have a cell like that?
-Ma'am.
-Nathan.
-Ma'am.
-l'll get you some blankets.
Make it real comfortable for you.
Daddy?
"Daddy, you all right?"
Fine. I'm fine.
Look at you.
Grown into a fine man.
After I knew you made it north...
... Iusedto dreamaboutyou...
... livingasafreeman.
"Daddy, you didn't have to stay."
You could have come with me.
I would have slowed you down.
"-You, uh, want some supper?"
-After a while.
All right.
"Right, cover me."
"Fuck, they're in the hotel."
We don't need the sniper anymore either.
Go inside.
See the colonel.
"Over here, laddie."
Arm yourself to the teeth.
Don't touch that.
Emma Gee is mine.
That's what my father used to say...
'A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay.'
Come along.
"Chop, chop."
Big Sally.
"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
Forward.
Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."
Dodged a bullet on that one.
I'll cover you.
You go around them.
"Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!"
Jolly good.
"Hold on, wait."
Help me with the cripple.
"Retreat five paces back on my command, laddie."
"Spasibo, Yuri."
My quarters are actually up there.
Ok.
"Let's wait 2, 3 weeks."
All right.
"And the lies she's been telling, that's part of it, huh?"
Lies?
"Like saying her bed's shaking, that stuff?"
"Have you ever known your daughter to swear, to use obscenities?"
"No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar...
"Similar to things like her lying, it's uncharacteristic for her--"
I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her..."
Goddamn cunt.
I can't believe it.
Oh.
"Now, she-- you don't think a psychiatrist?"
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
Ok.
"So, in the meantime, try not to worry."
No.
Marius ran.
Leaving you with me.
Maybe I should thank him.
You know?
Well?
"Well, what?"
"Well, isn't there any part of you that has a bad feeling about this?"
You thought Lance was cheating on you with some lady named Victoria.
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
Victoria's a character he created
- to scam Grandma.
- Do you have any idea how fucking preposterous that sounds?
That doesn't make it untrue.
"Carly, move it!"
"Lance claims to have lost more money than Audrey on that deal, yet he's buying a boat."
Where is he getting the money from?
"For fuck's sake, let's ask him."
"Ask a question, you get an answer."
That doesn't necessarily get you the truth.
I can get you the truth.
I just need a day.
- That's it?
- That's it.
And one more thing.
[door opens]
Can I help you?
Ex...
Ex-ex-ex...
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
This is private property.
- Bullying this poor lad!
-
- I saw him leading him by his ear.
-
- Ought to be ashamed!
Get this lot off me!
"Hey, Granville!"
"Get this lot off, Granville!"
He said he wanted people in the shop!
"Funny lot, women, when you look at 'em."
And I often do.
It took me all me time to calm that lot in the shop down before I could start selling.
Then I believe there were one that got away!
"Oh, God, don't say I've started slipping."
"I don't mind wearing glasses, Lord, or even a hearing aid."
"But if it's all the same to you,"
I'd like to stay young and very muscular when it comes to the acquisitive instinct!

So Trajan was wrong?
Shit!
I do not give up!
"Hatta, let's flank it."
You're hurt?
Of course not...
I can not say the same thing about Trajan's partner.
Bill Carson.
"You found old Bill, huh?"
He was a Spartan-5.
And a friend.
"Establish a perimeter, we'll camp here."
And give him a decent funeral.
Ash has something special.
I have something for him.
"We walked together, side by side."
He waited to see me fall.

"Well, if you'll remember, the first five hours"
"Today, we didn't shoot at all."
It wasn't your fault.
"Yeah, but food is not determined,"
"Like, by how footage we shoot."
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]
It's usually determined by how long the day goes by.

- Shh.
They're on their honeymoon.
lsn't it romantic?
The manager of the pet department at Harrods has just telephoned.
"Apparently, it is very difficult to tell the sex of a parrot."
I'm sure parrots don't make a mistake.
"The manager did, my lady."
He sent you another male parrot.
Really?
"Oh, dear."
"Well, they seem to be managing all right."
"Here you are, Mrs Lipton."
It's the last one.
Oh.
Perhaps I...
I better purée some tomatoes and put them in.
"Ooh, don't use real tomatoes, you'll spoil it."
"Who is coming, exactly?"
"Well, there's Mr Foster the works manager,"
"Mr Barnes the foreman, and that Scotch chap who's the union secretary."
I hope he doesn't make a scene.
"Always envious, those sort of people."
(Ivy) Ooh.
Madam!
Why is this house locked?
Who are you?
Whom do you want to meet?
"Gardener, why is this house locked?"
Where is sir?
Who?
Mr. Kumar.
"Oh, you mean him?"
He was really nice fellow.
Its been long since he has left this place!
Where did he leave for?
"I dont know, sir."
But afterthis mansion was auctioned..
..nobody saw him around here!
Auction?
"Yeah, now Mr. Dhanraj owns this mansion."
Dhanraj?
!
And what about his family?
His brothers?
They were not brothers but rather brutes.
And now they have become quite rich.
They have started factory with help of those auction money!
Both of the brothers have taken away all the money.
Mr. Kumar and his younger sisterwere..
..thrown out of this house!
They have left this house as if they were leaving this world!
But why did he agree to all this?
Why did he put up with their dishonesty?
Why did he leave silently?
What could he do?
You're under arrest!
These guys are clearly well trained...
Welcome!
Huh...?
!
Welcome...
May I take your order?
"Actually, I think this is all you need!"
See ya!
W-What do you want...?
You lose!
Yikes!
Over there!
I can't read this stuff!
Come and get me!
Shall we get down to serious business?
Won't you tell me what you did with the girls you kidnapped?
We should be arriving in Hunan Province about...
"So, we got no reply from the Foundation before departure."
But they've agreed to a conference.
"Doesn't that mean they are interested in the proposal from you, Commander?"
They'd better be.
Huh?
Aren't villians dressed like that supposed to be easily defeated?
Thanks!
You saved my life.
Why were you being chased by them?
"Well, I was just using them to pass the time."
But... is it really okay for me to come in here?
This ship's fine.
Here.
Go on in.
"Sulu, our communications are being interfered with."
"Now, get this straight:"
Do anything you think necessary to protect the ship.
"Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything."
Clear?
"Clear, captain."
But you...
Never mind about me.
Protect my ship.
"Yes, sir."
"Photon torpedoes negative, captain."
I'm warping out of orbit.
Good.
Contact me when you can.
Kirk out.
"How is he, doctor?"
He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.
They're moving.
I've got to get to the captain.
"I've locked on to the enemy, captain."
They're moving toward the high ground.
They've locked on to my tricorder.
Very ingenious.
They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
We'll see how ingenious they are.
"Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher."
Lang!
Any word from the Enterprise?
Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
"They got Lang, sir."
- Did you see them?
"- No, sir."
"You had promised him to tell me after the wedding, right?"
You've known for five months.
"I want to let it be for now, Helene."
You don't have the time.
What are you going to do?
Anna and the boys must not know before it's absolutely necessary.
Are you listening?
Not before it's absolutely necessary.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
We'll figure something out.
There's always a solution.
There's always something in America...
- There's nothing to do.
"- Yes, there is."
There's nothing to do!
- There's...
- No!
"- There's nothing to do, understand?"
- You can't die!
"We don't get to decide, damn it."
Let go.
Get out.
Get out of the damn car before I throw you out!
Shut the door!
- How long will you stay there?
"- One week, only one week."
- You'll come to my birthday?
"- Yes, of course."
I wouldn't miss that.
I promise.
"Shut up, you'll be next."
I will reassess.
- I will signal in the usual way.
- No.
Absolutely no further radio contact.
You have to take photographs.
Deliver them personally to the Führer.
- Personally?
Why?
- He says he trusts you.
- He wants to hear from your own mouth.
"- Well, I'm flattered."
Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat to pick you up off the coast of Scotland.
That's nice.
Have you been carrying this around?
Yes.
Why?
- Let's go.
- We'll get them both.
What's this?
Storm Island.
Two miles from the rendezvous.
- The U-boat will pick me up when?
- When you signal it.
From six in the evening until six in the morning.
Six in the evening till six in the morning.
Beginning when?
"A week from today, and for a week after that."
And you.
How will you get out of England?
I'm supposed to get to Liverpool somehow.
If they capture you and torture you?
- I have a suicide pill.
- What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"- He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about 2 years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to twenty.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me you'd better get out of here.
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step.
It's slippery.
Thank you.
- How long?
- About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
- Try that diner over there.
- Any good?
How are you?
How did school go?
"You OK, Grandma?"
"Yes, I'm fine."

"- Yes, darling?"
I'm coming to live with you.
Isn't it a good idea?
I don't know.
"Yes, a very good idea."
But it's not possible.
You have a mum and dad who'd be sad if you left them.
"Sorry, Mum, there was an accident just as I was leaving."
Weekend emergencies.
And the boss came 2 hours late.
"I sent loads of messages, you didn't answer."
I lost my phone.
And the landline...
- Have you eaten?
- I can't stay.
I have appointments very early.
Chun-su!
"Chun-su, are you home?"
What's your business?
I didn't expect you here.
Where is Chus-su?
What do you want with a man in mourning?
Mourning?
Oh...
His old man was weak with asthma for a long time.
"Well, would you give him a message?"
He must pay his taxes without more ado.
Taxes?
Did you say taxes?
"You took a man and beat him to death, and you want to collect taxes?"
Are you accusing me of murder?
The whole village knows that he was dying of asthma!
What?
He died of asthma?
!
Say that again.
"Say that again, you bastard!"
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you and kill myself!
Chun-su!
Get out of there!
Don't aggravate a man in mourning!
Very well.
I'll go.
But he still has to pay his taxes.
If it is not receive within five days...
Get out of here this instant!
"Men, let's go."
"Heather, there is a doctor here to see you guys."
I cannot believe you're calling in outside help when I'm right here.
"♪ I like the way you do it, honey ♪"
♪ Especially when we do that... ♪
Oh.
"Oh, I get it, yeah."
Okay.

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Matt, Chad..."
"- Mm-hmm, yeah."
my three boyfriends before that.
None of them had steady jobs.
And all of them were these dreamers addicted to romance.
"- Yeah, you really do only date your father."
- Yeah.
You guys only got me for another 18 minutes.
You want me to dance or anything?
- Um...
- Can you unload the dishwasher?
(sighs)
"Anyway, I've done some soul-searching, and I think I've finally figured it out."
- I haven't told anybody this...
- HEATHER:
I think that sounds like a natural stopping point right there.
So great to catch up with you.
- (Stephen) Yeah.
- So he predicted Jerry Lee Lewis's career.
(laughter and applause)
- (Alan) He foresaw it in a prose poem.
- (Stephen) He foresaw it in a poem.
"Called ""Great Balls of Fire"", or, ""Goodness Gracious""."
"- Stick to ""Great Balls of Fire""."
That's what...
- A meteor.
- His theory...
- (Alan) Cigarettes.
- What's the theory?
The theory?
- (Julia) Relativity.
- The big bang.
- (Stephen) The big bang.
Thank you.
- I'll give you a point.
Well done.
- (applause)
Edgar Allan Poe believed that all matter had once been concentrated into a single particle which then expanded to fill space - a theory not accepted by science until 1931.
"""Eureka"", his prose poem, goes on to predict the general theory of relativity, parallel universes, and the structure of the atom."
Pretty good going for a poem that doesn't even rhyme.
You know the word rhyme?
There's no word that actually rhymes with the word rhyme.
- (Alan) Lime.
- (Julia) Time.
Apart from those two.
- Slime.
- Three.
- Grime.
- (Rich) Orange.
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was-stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
I need a sergeant by dawn.
"I'll never make a proper sergeant, sir."
So?
I'll never make a proper officer.
"Indeed you will, sir."
You'll make a grand... killing officer
Killing officer?
"God love you, sir."
I thought you would have known.
"There are two kinds of officers, sir."
Killing officers and murdering officers.
Killing officers are poor old buggers who get you killed by mistake.
"Murdering officers are mad, bad old buggers who get you killed on purpose."
"For a reason, for a country, for a religion."
Maybe even for a flag.
"You see that Major Hogan, sir?"
That's what I'd call a murdering officer
Teresa!
"Oh, that Hogan."
He's a murdering officer all right
"Damn it, Hogan!"
I wish I were down there.
So do I.
So do I. But our first duty is to protect Mrs Parker.
"That's my girl, Teresa."
Mmmm!
"Rica, huh?"
Tengo otra muy buena para ti.
Jesus!
No!
"Mr Sharpe, sir."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
You take that one.

"- Thank you, Mr. Scott-Padget."
Press gang!
Stop him!
Catch him!
Don't let him get away!
- Press gangs are busy tonight.
"- Yes, probably ours."
We're a few men short.
"Well, a few dozen."
Things get worse.
The English sailor's lost his taste for fighting.
Maybe he's lost taste for the conditions in which he fights.
- Must have discipline.
- His Majesty's Navy uses a heavy hand.
"At times, perhaps too heavy."
"Apart from finer feelings, it could be dangerous."
The lower deck's like a prison.
"No freedom, irregular pay, and food that even rats won't touch."
- I speak out of turn.
"- True, every word."
We've enough trouble without provocation.
"Still, that's for the Admiralty to settle."
"About last night, I'm ashamed"
I misbehaved with you
I wanted to tell you something else
What...?
- This
Run
"First come, first served"
Hurry!
The train is about to leave.
- Where did I keep my money?
"One minute, I don't know how to count this currency..."
lots of small change
"Can you tell me one, two's, eighths...?"
Stop
Train's gone?
The train is gone!
"Don't cry, Senorita"
But you just stopped crying
It's raining!
"Don't cry, please!"
"I'm with you, I'm here!"
Look
"Okay, I'm gone... gone!"
Here's your bell
The next train is very late.
"To catch up with the train... at Zurich tomorrow morning, we can either take a bus or hire a car"
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car?
Where's she?
"Ever since you met me, you've been harassing me"
What are you saying?
- All along the trip... you've been chewing my brains.
"Honey, that""s not nerves."
"That""s intuition."
"And that""s a blessing."
"Do you know when women suspect their husband of cheating... they""re right 85% of the time?"
Men are only right 50%.
"Oh, my God!"
"Lt""s the Lucky at League City."
- No.
- No?
- How do I know if my husband is cheating?
"- The wife""s the last to know."
"The co-workers know, the mailman knows, the dog knows."
"But not the wife, because it could be right there... underneath your pretty little nose, but you don""t wanna see it."
Signs of cheating.
Number one:
Changes in personal appearance.
Is hubby working out?
Shopping at The Gap?
Suddenly strutting around like Mr. Sexy?
Changes in phone habits.
Sneaking off to make calls.
Hiding the bills.
Computer obsession.
"Ask yourself, honestly, is hubby spending every waking moment..."
"logged on, so to speak?"
"Hi, honey."
Sexual changes.
From complete lack of interest to the bastard wanting sex now.
New positions.
Role-playing.
Foreplay with condiments.
"It""s really not funny."
Sam:
Let me guess.
"Alonso wasn't a big fan of portion control, was he?"
No.
"During a routine treatment, he almost killed a client."
He sucked out too much fat.
"I demoted him to kitchen duty -- no human contact, just fat from a jar."
"But he said the more I deprived him, the hungrier he got."
[ Sobbing ]
And now three people are dead.
My husband...
[ Sobs ]
Where's Alonso right now?
The -- the basement?
That's -- that's where he spends most of his time now.
[ Sniffles ] What about her?
"Well, till we figure out which side she's on, she stays put."
I am on your side.
Okay.
Then how do we kill him?
[ Sighs ]
[ Grunts ]
You and stupido have no chance.
The fat makes us stronger.
Your sister didn't mention that when she ratted you out.
You're lying!
[ Growls ]
[ Grunting ]
[ Panting ]
"I guess after you killed her husband... you were too monstrous, even for her."
[ Grunts ]
[ Both grunting ]
"We shall test each other's courage, and then... and then we shall see."
Let's get on with it.
"As you will, sir."
"Honor will be served, eh?"
"Oh, wait!"
"As the one challenged, I claim the first shot."
We shoot together.
"It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded..."
All right.
Captain...
"And now, Captain, how do you have the expression?"
My fate is in your hands.
You've ruined everything!
The machine.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
Subspace interference is clearing.
Try to contact the ship.
The remarkable treachery of this species.
"Go on, Trelane."
Look at it.
It's over.
Your power is blanked out.
You're finished.
You've earned my wrath.
Go back.
"Go back to your ship, all of you, and prepare."
"You're all dead men-- you especially, Captain."
Trelane?
"Everyone, we're getting out of here, and now."
This is the captain.

Thank you so much!
- Mom really did that?
"- Oh, she did!"
Wow!
I did not see that coming.
What about you?
- Are you OK?
"- Oh, I couldn't be better!"
Even with the town not getting behind the mosque
- Like we thought they would?
- I'll bring them around.
"And you getting arrested for that whole non-bomb thing, plus Fred Tupper trashing you on the radio?"
- I couldn't believe that!
"- Look, remember when I came"
- To Mercy five years ago?
- Uh-huh.
"Those exact same things happened to me, and look how that turned out."
- It turned out pretty well.
- I think we're right on course.

Charles called.
My cell battery died.
I'm waiting for him to call back.
Have you been waiting here all weekend?
- Yes!
"- Oh, Ann!"
Why does he have to live in Ottawa?
Why does he have to be engaged to somebody else?
Why is he such a stupid jerk?
- about Carlos Mejia?
- Anything I told you.
"- No, I have not."
- You sure?
Yes.
"- Bryan, I'd never..."
"- Well, they found out somehow."
- Who found out?
Found out what?
- Mexican Government.
"- Okay, wait."
Slow down...
- Probably the cartel too.
And you think that's because I said something to someone?
- Not even accidentally?
- Like at the hair salon or something?
That's not what I meant.
I thought we understood each other.
Respected...
No.
"Actually, I thought it was quite a bit more than just that."
I am the one person who understands what you've gone through at the hands of this monster Mejia.
And now you're accusing me of betraying you?
- Not betraying me.
"- So what, then?"
"I had to ask, Asha, and I know you know why,"
- so don't act like you don't...
- I'm not confused.
I'm upset.
You immediately suspect me.
People at your job knew too.
They keep secrets for a living.
"No, I work on Saturdays."
Big shoplifting day.
I catch dozens of punks like you.
Thas wonderful.
If everyone were that dedicated...
Bet you're an ace at Blackjack...

I know you inside out.
Lots of guys like you around.
They stick to you like flies these days.
Looking for trouble?
"No, just like a pair of jeans..."
Is my brother's birthday.
"Down there, on the right just past the television sets."
I'll frisk you later.
"Hey, look!"
Must be your first paycheck!
Not a chance.

She's hooked on me!
Ursula's very generous.
Congratulations!
You don't need that badge your hair tonic gives you away!
You're lucky I'm in a good mood today.
Me too.
Life is beautiful.

"-Hello, boys."

"-Ezra, may I speak to you for a moment?"
-Of course.
I just got this wire from a certain Preston Wingo.
He owns the Cattle Baron Hotel over in Snellville.
It concerns your mother.
"Oh, Mother?"
Are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of Preston Wingo?
I know a fat little weasel called Preston Wingo.
-What about him?
"-Well, this Wingo has slandered you."

-He never does.
How's the virginity barometer?
No change.
Right.

Yeah.
She used to say things like that when I was down about something.

Sorry.

They're not going anywhere.
They don't have anything better to do.
- Will they come over here?
- No.
You did OK.
It's good.
I can understand your point of view.
Now listen to mine.
Someday the world will be entirely populated with bureaucrats such as you because real people will do away with themselves out of frustration.
I myself do not want anything out of you.
They do.
They wanna be rescued.
This is what they would say if they could speak themselves.

- Which is...?
- Prostitution.

I'll lead you.
It was to discover your thoughts.
You didn't answer me yet.
Well... it is yes.
Yes?
You mean...
"Yes, yes really?"
Yes.
I agree to become your wife.
Now let me.
Come and get me shortly.
Do not be afraid.
Sleep.
Sleep.
"In the violent effort made by the thief to snatch the necklace and earrings from the princess his fingers, pressing on the neck of Princess Danidoff, left a slight trace of sweating."
I spilled the silver nitrate on the princess' neck
You see the results.
Effectively.
The print is very clear.
It needs to be indentified.
We are not at the end of our inquiry.
"Wait a moment, my little Fandor, you have not seen everything."
Look at the details.
"The small scar, on both shots."
These two fingerprints are identical.
Absolutely identical.
And where does the second impression come from?
The anthropometric file.
The name.
The name of the culprit.
- I don't think so madam.
"Lawyers won't even get office space, then how would they get house?"
"- Hey fast-food, tea for both of us."
- I want milk.
"If you drink this tea, you won't live to drink milk tomorrow."
-How much is your commission?
- Why?
"Don't you know it is 10,000?"
"- OK, find out that girl's profession."
- Alright.
- What?
- What is that girl's profession?
- Lawyer
Seems like I am gonna lose the money!
"She is a software engineer, it seems."
Your accent is wrong.
It is software engineer
Yes you got it.
I must change my house now.
Check out his profession.
- What now?
- What is that guy's job?
Lawyer
"- Manager in some marketing sector, it seems."
"- OK for me, then ."
How long would you count the cash?
Give it.
"Now that you have successfully clinched your deal, won't you give me a treat?"
- Treat?
You want sambar rice from Saravana Bhavan?
- No.
I want booze.
Teach me secretly.
Training for the lower body builds strength and agility.
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force generated there ejects your fist like a bullet.
A vertical axis extends through your body.
The basic principle is to be aware of it.
"feel the axis, relax and with smooth, flowing movements take a fighting stance."
Then...
One more time.
Stand still.
Keep the axis straight and the body flowing.
This is the most difficult and important exercise.
Since when have you...
Since forever.
I have a question.
What?
Why do you Iike wushu?
I've always loved it.
It's never been a burden.
shaolin Kung Fu makes people happy.
But Shaolin Kung Fu is a fighting art.
You're wrong.
It's the art of protection.
It's difficult.
That's why I need to know.
My mission is to spread the art of Shaolin.
Here?
"Yes, here."
This is my home.
Everything starts here.
Home?
"Yes, a home."
- Order in the court.
- Everybody rise.
One minute with this court.
"Mr. Gargan, this has gone far enough."
Your system has blown up.
Two of your boys ran away tonight and had the gall to change their clothes in my office.
Look here.
Is that so?
"Well, sit down a minute, will you?"
- Go ahead.
Sit down.
- I'm gonna notify the board at once.
Don't do that.
You're holding up the court.
Sit down.
- You realize responsibility rests with you?
- That's all right.
Sit down for a minute.
"Go ahead, and you too."
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yeah.
"Well, what is it?"
He's guilty.
The court says you don't get no candy bars for two weeks.
Okay.
"Sit down, will you, kid?"
"Listen, fellas."
I wanna tell you--
Hey.
Hey.
"Fellas I wanna tell you, because I think you ought to know that you've done a swell job here tonight."
You've got everything down pat.
There's no time.
You sure somebody's not yanking your chain?
There it is.
Ssr.
Don't move.
Don't think he can.
This is it.
We got the stark stuff.
That's like the whole haul.
"Ease up on that, will you?"
I don't want to end up inside out.
We're getting promotions out of this.
Why?
'cause we answered the phone?
This got handed to us...
again.
Somebody's wrapping this up like it was christmas.
Christmas?
"Well, hey, who doesn't love christmas?"
I'm gonna call chief.
I want every single box checked and signed in.
"Careful with that, boys."
"Hey, keep it sealed off!"
You got it!
Who's our new helpful friend?
Jerome zandow.
He had an act in a sideshow at coney island.
Petty crimes here and there.
Probably just muscle for hire.
Even muscle knows something.
"He had his hands on an arsenal of stark technology,"
But he just sat there with it.
"-Frank, honey."
Lunch!
And your family.
"Senator, I guarantee this is nothing but a blemish on a great metropolis."
The party will never see that blemish in June.
"All it'll see is the Garden, the Plaza, the Waldorf..."
"... electricity,excitement,fun."
Catch the noon news in D.C. He's only magnificent.
Four extra classes graduate the academy this year.
Unions?
Did I hear you say unions?
Every municipal contract....
Harriet.
You watching this?
World Bank interest you more?
Want to read about the convention in the Chicago Tribune?
"Well, okay."
Okay then.
Wait till you see his performance on the 6:00 news.
When the train leaves the station...
"... theTimes,goodand graylady  that she is, will want to be onboard."
What happened to you?
I called you.
You were down in the basement.
I'm gonna get a washer at Orchard Supply...
... stopthemachinefromthunking.
I'll eat when I get home.
Okay.
Be careful.
Of course.
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain

Over here is even better
Looks cool

Thebaby.
Okay.
HekilledSean.
"Honey,thepoliceknow."
Theydon't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Please... no...
"I'msosorry,Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Yourimmunitymakes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
Lydia!
Jackson will be there seeking his next target.
- Are you lost?
- Yes
"Here, with you ... is not like a movie or in books, where everything is clear ... expected ... organized ... with a clear purpose."
"Everything is chaos, unexpected ... pain ... disorder ..."
"So I try to have them in the order, fans of my mother."
I am missing one.
- Do you want stories?
- No.
Why?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There is only war.
Listen.
I do not feel anything.
Close your eyes.
Marie ...
Marie ...
"You fly, my friend, cadrai you."
We prepare the fall.
Do you have exaggerated.
"If I were human, the kill here, immediately."
But I will not be human.
I have a word myself.
"I do not want you to hurry, but there is a theater in precise time."
"Even the mail, on the other hand ... for parcels ..."
I am sending them.
The exact delivery time.
I still have ... for new addresses.
And I am always me ...
Get a little 'of breath.
We must start now.
"Do not take it, Leon."
"There's some fucking guy, scientist or something."
Real sick bastard.
You listening?
Avidly.
"Says he measured out the remains, the cremated remains of a dead man."
"Measured out the minerals left behind, you know?"
"The iron phosphates, the..."
Whatever it is we're made up of.
Says he added it all up to the cost of $4.40.
You believe that?
"Yeah, I guess so."
$4.40.
"Burnt down man's worth less than a fucking Big Mac, all you can say is ""I guess so""?"
Says give this poor bastard what he's got coming.
Authentic?
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
Start the count.
"All eyes are on the newcomer, Rainer..."
Can I get you something?
Two shots.
Scotch.
Got money on the game?
"Nah, spread's terrible."
Here.
One for the road.
"No, thanks."
Been sober for three years.
Interesting career.
You do something long enough.
"You close your eyes, you just can't think of doing something else."
They found your accounts.
- Everything's fine up here.
- OK.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
"José, could you come here for a minute, please?"
- It looks as if a whole army is rolling up.
- These are just the supplies for the base.
"- Shouldn't we hold off on the attack, then?"
- No.
How do you know that those bastards won't shoot when we show our faces?
Plenty of people in the valley know that we're going to blow up the dam.
- Why did you warn them?
- Because it's them that I'm fighting for.
Are you wetting yourself?
Nonsense!
- You'll be relieved in three hours.
- All right.
"Soon, all hell will break loose here."
Now.
Watch out.
That's Moreno over there.
We can't hold our position much longer.
Understood.
Headquarters are going to send us helicopters.
"You should get out of here, with the other engineers."
Attention!
Calling position...
We can go down now.
Come on!
The rope!
"Hey, careful."
Don't shoot.
Everything is under control.
We have an unconfirmed report that resuscitation efforts may have failed.
It's always a danger up there in that copter in the Windy City.
"In a child with hypothermia, it can cause fatal arrhythmia."
She's right outside.
"- Jerry, turn that off."
- TV doctors....
Get Security to escort Dr. Mahoney to a less conspicuous place.
Let's get the life pack and drug box.
- Any sixes?
- Nope.
Go fish.
- How are you doing?
- My stomach hurts a little bit.
Get a CT of her abdomen along with the head.
Probably just a bruise.
- Where are her parents?
- Coffee shop.
"I get next game, okay?"
- Coming through.
Coming through.
"- Doctor, is he dead?"
"- Please, get out of the way."
- Dr. Greene can you confirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
- Not for a second.
- Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
Hey.
TRIS:
Hi.
MARCUS:
Son...
You can't ignore me forever.
"I know you're thinkin' about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
She died trying to hide something from Jeanine.
Something that was entrusted to Abnegation a long time ago.
"Marcus, stop."
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
Mind telling me what's inside?
A message from The Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
Divergents will destroy our society.
Unless we destroy them.
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them.
Every last one of them.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
MAN:
Go with happiness.
Go with happiness.
- Go with happiness.
-Thank you.
Go with happiness.
Go with happiness.
Why am I still alive?
I made a promise to your wife.
"""You killed her."""
- Do not.
That's what they want to make you believe.
Because you did?
Why did you take it from me?
Mara was my creator.
"She got me up, knew I was different."
She was my mother.
You do not have mothers!
The quarantine of the Federation did it for the test.
So that we begin to show genetic anomalies.
Anomalies that the superior command did not like.
Like what.
- Hair?
- Some of us.
"For others, like me, or more Advanced."
"We have developed the ability, to reproduce."
Your wife kept the secret for a long time.
"When she threatened, with scattering the secret."
The top command entered.
They wanted to keep it a secret.
At all costs
Stop!
They have no right...
Your investigation is over.
Dirty Noid-Bitch!
"No, you murdered her!"
I saw it with my own eyes!
I did not kill her!
I tried to save her.
"- No, I'm not going."
Sometimes you're a bit complicated.
"Go alone, I'm not going."
Shut the door.
"If you stay out late, I'll lock it."
You're sitting there with your golden kerchiefs... and your bald heads that signal that you're the bosses.
Your activities will be evident at the court...
You eat up all the public rights...
The police will catch you all.
- You're getting on our nerves!
- So what?
"Mec, get back to your place!"
Let me go!
Have you gone mad?
I haven't seen your money!
Let him go!
A drunkard won't humiliate me!
The bottle holds the wine.
Why can't you?
"Go and let off steam over there, not here!"
Calm down!
"He's not drunk, he's just insolent."
What's wrong with you?
You're bothering us.
Incredible!
Scandalous!
Let's settle the bill!
- Let's go home.
- No!
- I'll walk you...
"- No, I'm staying."
You don't look good.
We?
"Okay, who's been on the phone?"
Hi.
What happened?
Did you guys have a fight?
Ever hear of the earthquake of '71?
Who's been on the phone?
You're supposed to be reachable by phone.
- Nobody.
- You're supposed to be on court call.
"We're here all the time, sarge."
"Yeah, well, then why has the phone been busy?"
Move your feet.
No wonder nobody's called me all week.
"You know, Poncherello?"
I could put another Form 2 in your jacket.
"Hey, sarge."
What brings you out here?
Baby food.
Not here.
Did you guys cite a baby food truck?
"- Yeah, we did."
"- Yeah, loose load."
We almost got killed.
"Well, that loose load contained contaminated baby food, botulism."
There are two boxes missing.
Either they're out on the road or someone picked it up.
Do you remember anybody or anything?
I was seeing double from my steeplechase ride.
"Look, guys, think."
It's important.
That stuff's poison.
He was acquitted.
Until now.
I'm in the acquittal business.
"Look, it's my life's mission to keep the wrongly accused"
From being incarcerated.
"Yeah, like, uh, like that little girl last year, right?"
Was accused of killing her brother.
Yes!
Thank you for bringing that up.
One of my great trials.
Hannah miller.
"Evidence against hannah was, uh, was overwhelming."
Yes.
Until they found a pair
Of girl's glasses at the crime scene that didn't match.
"Now, obviously, that was left by the real killer."
And the jury agreed with me.
Yes.
How convenient.
"Ah, well, you know,"
I'm good at finding holes in the prosecution's case.
"I mean, that is my gift."
Your gift is planting evidence.
"Oh, wh-wh-wh-whoo."
Careful.
That's libelous.
About the enright case.
Fact remains that
"Those cuff links left a reasonable doubt,"
And you were the one that purchased 'em.
We have proof right there.
"Oh, I see."
We may be the only English ship in the Mediterranean.
- Do you insist on the rendezvous?
- I insist on carrying out my orders which are to escort a convoy.
- A French ship will be waiting.
- I can see it now.
- You've been proved right once before.
"Here, I feel you are wrong."
There will be no French ship.
Only the fear of one.
- Sir!
- Listen.
They're celebrating already.
- Sir.
- And why not?
There will be plenty of prize money for all hands with these two beauties.
- Pay attention.
- I've detailed the crews to sail them.
The third lieutenant in charge of the frigate.
"Good luck, Mr. D'Arblay."
- A pleasant voyage to Rochefort.
- Thank you.
- You must listen.
- Kellahorn's leading the merchantman.
I've given him a junior midshipman to assist him.
Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford?
- Take care of that ship.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get her back safely.
Pull away.
Hoist away.
I thought you wanted the boy onboard with you.
- Really?
"Hey, Rhino!"
Why did you use the room freshener?
"Boss, Sadhana is here."
"Taunting me, are you?"
You always over use the perfume!
That's Victoria Secret Line's Perfume.
"You bought it from the local store, right?"
Country attar packed in a fancy way.
This your Victoria Secret?
What about you?
You use the local ingredients and sell it as international cuisine.
Hey!
Don't make fun of my recipe.
I have won awards.
I was given the best...
Enter... something like that.
That's Entrepreneur.
- Exactly.
Forget it...
Let me come to the point.
You are one among the top 25 upcoming stars selected by a weekly magazine.
I wrote the article about you.
Let me read it out.
Chef Arun.
Age: 25
He lost his eyesight at the age of 15.
That didn't stop this self reliant man... from mastering the art of cooking.
Traditional Indian cuisines...
"To Italian, Mexican cuisines..."
"Chef, the food is superb."
- Thank you.
What are you talking about?
Please!
"Wait, give me a second"
What is this?
What the fuck?
We broke up
So she doesn't live here anymore
Where does she live now?
She lives in Tokyo I think
"Well no, for sure"
What do you mean?
"Officer, it's not like I was holding her in custody"
"She was over 20 too, so we were just living together"
Ok...
"Plus, I am a victim too"
A missing person's report was it from her parents?
Or was it these two?
Is it normal to be investigating together?
Not that it matters
This really doesn't concern me anymore
So it's a little annoying
You need to be more responsible
Hey...
What about me is irresponsible?
I'm mentally fucked up cause of her
She is the one who is irresponsible
How is she irresponsible?
Miyu was texting me about the violence she was tolerating
Miyu is the victim
What?
She was betraying me the whole time
What?
Yes.
He hung up.
"Apart from Sonia Danidoff, do you remember any other names in the list?"
"Yes, maybe Tom... something."
"Or ""Thomas""."
This tells you something?
"Without the name, it will not."
There were also initials.
Unfinished words.
I think this list is the calendar for Fantomas futur attacks.
"I'm afraid, Fandor."
These phone calls.
Someone wants to kill me.
We will survive.
I promise you.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"The convocation is at 4 pm, isn't it?"
"Yes, yes."
"Thank you for your call, last night."
It touched me.
I have not called.
"I beg you, Fandor."
Don't kid me.
"Despite the buzz, I recognized your voice."
What am I supposed to have said to you?
"Very nice things, very delicate."
And you asked me questions about the list again.
Someone imitated my voice.
Someone wanted to know what you exactly saw on that list.
You will not return to the hotel.
It's too dangerous.
But what am I going to do?
I came about Isabel.
- Is something the matter?
- Yes.
I fear she's being manipulated.
- Manipulated?
"- And the way they have her dressed, like she's some sort of common peasant..."
- Hmm.
"Roderick, I know what you're going through, with the loss of your parents, and now your sister, her illness."
And I understand that you've taken over your father's business entirely on your own.
Is that correct?
- I did not come here to discuss myself.
"- And I appreciate that, but you mustn't underestimate the toll the past few months have taken on your own psyche."
- I see.
"Thank you, Doctor."
"- Tell me, what is your name?"
- Isabel Porter.
- That's incorrect.
Where are you from?
- Worchester.
- Look at me.
That's incorrect again.
God!
Ah!
- Does that hurt?
Does that hurt?
"No, that does not hurt."
"When one is nothing, one feels nothing."
Okay?
Again.
I do this for your own benefit.
"Through me, you shall understand pain."
Now.
Casshern.
Devour Casshern!
Kill him...
Kill Casshern!
Devour Casshern!
Why?
What do you stand to gain by devouring me?
The Ruin cannot be stopped now.
"Kill me if you must, Casshern, but this body won't last more than half a year amidst this destruction."
What does that have to do with me?
"Casshern, he who devours you shall attain eternal life."
That's ludicrous.
"I don't know if it's true or not, but to die without even trying is too wretched to fathom!"
Die!
The Ruin cannot be stopped...
He who devours me shall attain eternal life...
Kill Casshern.
Devour Casshern.
Kill Casshern!
Devour Casshern!
Kill Casshern.
So you become fragile when you lose consciousness...
It certainly is a fragile world.
A world of nothing but robots.
Ohji...
"Ringo, you're awake?"
You know you need to sleep.
I know.
Devour Casshern...
What an absurd concept.
You'll gain nothing by devouring him.
It won't stop the Ruin.
The 20% drop in homicides and street crime last year.
"Also, Stern's record."
Hard-line.
"Good, Kevin."
Corporation Council?
We've commissioned a study that'll...
... provethiscityhas the toughest probation guidelines in the country.
Excellent.
Get Community Affairs involved.
Tell Parks...
... cleanuptheirplaygrounds.
"Hover, nudge, show we care."
And then we gotta do something concrete.
"Something big, something important."
Something that means jobs.
That means building BankExchange.
I won't let these shootings interfere with my program for the city.
I'm speaking at the boy's funeral.
James Bone's funeral.
That's a blueprint for trouble.
I don't care.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't think you'll be welcome there.
They got me anyway.
Let's go to work.
"Kevin, I need you."
So what happened?
Frank Anselmo and his real-estate cronies is what happened.
They want the subway stop to raise their land value.
The property around BankExchange?
And?
"Anselmo said, """"No subway stop..."
One not inclined to exaggeration.
What can this be?
Is Col. Brandon here?
- My horse!
- What's the matter?
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.
"Upon my soul, this is all very unusual."
"- Frailty, thy name is Brandon."
- Some cannot bear pleasure.
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.
Why?
"Everyone speaks well of him, but no one remembers to talk to him."
Nonsense.
He is highly respected at Barton Park.
- Which is enough censure in itself.
"- Really, Willoughby."
"Come, come, Mr. Impudence."
I know your wicked ways.
Reveal your beau.
No secrets between friends.
I'll winkle it out of you.
"I'll have you married to the colonel by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet."
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The Polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
Absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"Really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
Are we at a livestock sale?
"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
I expect they're dead now.
TARRANT:
It's a photocell lock.
Here's a key.
"Tarrant, wait."
Here's another one.
- What do you make of it?
- It's a Tangran code.
- That's what I thought.
- I wonder...
You just saved our lives.
- That other one must have been booby-trapped.
"- Yeah, that was a trick, tiny diffusers."
- Nerve gas?
- I expect so.
Let's just pray there isn't a backup system.
Ladies first.
You're so gallant.
In my hand I have an electrical contact.
"If it closes, it will detonate 700 kilos of glycerol trinitrate."
Put your guns away.
Put them away!
Nitroglycerine?
"It's a bit outdated, isn't it?"
It was all I could make with my limited resources.
And it is still a highly effective explosive.
"- You're not from the Federation, I gather."
- No.
Your surreptitious entry told me as much.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
"Come now, I may be friendlier than you think."
Who's going to bed?
"Uh, you are, tough guy."
- Come on.
- Ow!
Ow!
Child abuse!
Child abuse!
"Oh, you think that's child abuse?"
You haven't even...
How about that?
What about that?
What about one of these?
"Stand still, you little booger."
Ugh!
"I'm telling you, just give me the big knife and this will all be over."
"Harriet, dear, you have taken a tomato sandwich to school with you..."
With mayonnaise.
...with mayonnaise every day for that past five years.
Don't you want a little variety?
Nope.
Not even cream cheese with olive?
Yum-yum-yum!
Or how about pastrami?

Has the gold arrived?
- Yes.
All right.
When can we pick it up?
Today itself.
I am floored!
"Not exactly, Baby."
You're vanquished.

"I've studied it deeply, I think it's a case of mythomania complicated by a form of amnesia with a hysterical character."
I had a similar case in..
'23.
- In '23.
There had recently happened a.. a..
The March on Rome.
"- Eh, good times!"
"- Yes, good times."
- Honorable!
The march on Rome?
- Good times because we were younger then.
And this little one here was in junior high!
- Whoa!
Whoo!
Drink this.
Drink this.
"Now, just to be clear, these aren't steroids, right?"
"No, no, no, no."
Of course not.
These are performance-enhancing supplements.

This is the good stuff.
You'll feel it almost immediately.

The Conquest Of The Pole
The conquest of the North pole Fantastic aerial journey over north sea and north pole.
Fantastic film in two parts.
Part I
The scholars of the whole world meet to discuss a means for the reaching of the north pole.
A delegation of Suffragettes seeks to interrupt in vain the serious work of the meeting
"The meeting selects the committee, which will have the honor to take in the marvelous airplane of professor Klaps Platz"
"The professor demonstrates his flight apparatus, which is to reach the glaciers of the north pole"
But she forgot us.
The money we had borrowed for the wedding... led us... into endless troubles.
"To help my dad,"
I started working.
Even after 2 years
We couldn't clear even a chunk of the loan.
Dealing with the money-lenders has become a struggle of our daily life.
But...
Today...
Today?
Some thugs came home... and insulted us very badly.
They said...
"If you can't repay the loan,"
Ask your daughter to...
"Unable to hear such things, my dad..."
In a haste...
He promised to clear the loan... in 2 days.
I surely know that it's not possible.
Either...
We leave the city.
Or...
My family should...
"Don't be foolish, Deepa."
Even the man with a million rupees on loan is sitting happily.
"Please, Varun!"
You could have asked me.
No.
I just felt like sharing it with you.
"So, I did."
I have some savings.
I don't have immediate expenses lined up.
I will lend it to you.
"Hey, you understand that?"
"Hey, Hayden?"
Oh.
Oh!
It's...
"It's really, really nice to you."
So this is a great restaurant.
It's got lots of health conscious options.
Great.
Cause you know uh...
I take care of myself.
As you can see.
I...
I did notice your pecs just now.
Oh.
Hey!
Are you flexing?
Gwyneth Paltrow eats here.
Really.
"We need options for something low carb low fat, low sodium, high protein."
"Which is better, the bacon cheeseburger or the other?"
Is it wild caught or farm raised?
Do you have chicken fingers?
"Organic, vegan, non soy, gluten free..."
Do you recommend the mac and cheese?
Can you steam that instead of grilling I don't want any crudamites in my food.
I'll have the crab cakes with butter sauce.
Extra butter.
Are these Swedish meatballs kosher?
"You're right, but people really are vain here."
"I mean, I'm not."
I'm self aware which is like radically different.
Maurice:
The king plans to behead her within the week.
Francesca:
He's accused you of adultery.
"Clarissa, dear, listen to me."
I'm your mother.
Let yourself be loved.
It'll take us hours to dig her a grave.
There's no one around to check us.
Catherine:
Make the blow sure and quick.
Remember I've paid you extra.
I don't want my children
To see you hacking at me.
Don't break the clasp.
I've promised this to one of my ladies.
Prawns?
My youngest daughter can't eat them.
The flowers.
"Full vases, cascading bouquets..."
Where are they?
We were told by the king to save them
For the actual day.
I need to see their placement.
What about the wine?
"100 casks, flowing freely."
The nobles will expect it.
"Yes, let them drink and swim in my blood"
And wonder who among them is next
Once that bastard sebastian takes the throne.
"Come in, please."
I'm nearly ready.
"You'll lose Haley and Jack, screw this job."
You won't have a life.
I can't reach her.
"Morgan, I'm going to find the security office."
- Morgan!
- Right here.
- Looks like loading dock security.
- Should we evacuate?
"No, no."
We'd have mass panic.
Let's go.
Hello?
- FBI.
- FBI?
- Are these all your security cameras?
"- Yes, sir."
- What's this camera here?
- That's the roof.
East end.
"Morgan, I've got 4 guys on the east end of the roof."
- What's on that side of the roof?
Nothing.
No access doors to the mall?
Not unless you go through the air vents.
"Morgan,it's the air vents."
They're going for the air vents.
Don't move!
Put the devices down and put your hands where I can see them!
Gun!
"Police tonight foiled an apparent robbery attempt at the new usa mall, which presumably have marred an otherwise successful grand opening."
Haley?
"Hey,in here."
Must have been quite an impression.
You did research on me?
Are you following me?
That day you bought me a drink so now you want chocolates for free?
Disgusting.
You are such a big business tycoon.
- I'd think you'd be able to afford them.
- Afford?
I can even afford a car.
But then how would I enjoy this walk with you?
How will this work if you too keep quiet?
I am already the silent type.
Who comes to a party and...
Personality problem.
Mysterious smile?
And I want to make chocolates.
Have our personalities exchanged?
"You're damn strange, man."
It's hard to figure you out.
That means you are trying to figure me out.
"Actually, yes."
Yes?
I think we should do business together.
- What say?
- No.
But liquor and chocolates get along.
- They do.
- So then?
It'll be difficult to focus.
For you.
Doesn't that sound like a Hindi song?
"""A girl walking in the rain."""
I happen.
"Specifically, i hack in,"
"And you are locked out, maestro."
That's the last time.
Look at you.
You're going to pieces.
Do you remember when i said
Sooner or later you'd pay?
I'm cashing in.
"Sayonara,cyborgorita."
"Son of a... rhade, cockpit."
Targetandromeda.
They might have gone back to regroup.
No.
"Dylan, look."
It's harper.
He reconfigured the generator to do what he wants.
"Rhade, point defense lasers."
Pick those guys off before they come back in.
Dylan... i'm reading a massive buildup
Of zero-Point energy on sensors.
"Shut it down, now!"
I come in peace.
"Harper... right, now,"
"You're probably asking yourselves,"
"""Self, what's to stop these freaks from using us"
"As the little ball in their cosmic shell game yet again?"""
"The answer is me,"
Plus a relative application
"Of the golden rule,"
Mass times the square of the speed of light cubed
Equals a very bad day for them.
Let me get on the floor and beg
"That makes me look bad, so no"
"Anyways, the report please"
Yes.
Someone seems to be home since last night
Ok.
Please lead us there
Yes ma'am.
Please follow me
He's been on a stakeout since last night?
Of course
"If he stayed, this old beast may have attacked me"
I was so scared!
I'm so sorry
Don't look this way evil one!
Yes
The final battle with this party...
They're on the fourth floor
I'm calling the police if they aren't there
They're there
Their lights were on until really late last night
I was watching his door from across the street
Didn't stop you from going shopping
I'm sorry...
Lin...
Let's go in!
Let's persuade her and bring her back home
I've never been so nervous
Are you ready?
Mr. Sexual Demon?
Ready baby!
"Stop using that gross language, Anti-sex-ed-man"
Well you broadcast this alone.
Did you go crazy for her or what?
No.
I only wanted...
Sorry.
-Well not this at all.
-And why not?
"On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other, and they call it love."
Why don't you want to broadcast it?
Because they wouldn't understand it.
Love...
And why do you care?
We must deliver all available information.
"This information is available, but incommunicable."
-What do you suggest?
-I wouldn't like it if we caused panic on our planet.
I'll alter it a bit.
-What about this?
-Let me see.
"""On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other."" This is already better."
So broadcast it.
"But... ""attract each other""."
I'll omit this too.
-This is useless titillation.
-All right.
Broadcast it.
-And what about the gender?
-What about it?
"Wait, I have it!"
And this way it will be without consequences.
"""There are people on Earth."""
Right?
But I think you know that deep down inside.
Mighty soldier!
Our mighty States will not tolerate defeat!
"To ensure that, there's something you must get."
"With that, you will have the body of steel."
You want me to get on?
I'll do it.
But...
I don't want you to go on anymore.
Look at the state it's in.
I'll go.
"For you, too."
How could that be?
They blocked us from using Bout Dimension...
So the protection device is still disengaged...
Burning...
NO!
Blow!
Kuya!
Goddamn it!
You let Black Elk go out without orders?
"Over time, its body won't be able to bear the burden..."
Our mighty States will not tolerate defeat...
Right?
Ahhh...!
What...?
They're here.
"Multiple unidentified objects from outer space, are currently descending at a high speed!"
"They look exactly like the specter pattern, ""Exception."""
Is that related to that monster we fought in Narita?
Wh...
What the hell's going on?
- My lord?
- He did not call;
He's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
A most unhappy one:
"I would do much to atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio."
- Fire and brimstone!
- My lord?
- Are you wise?
"- What, is he angry?"
May be the letter moved him;
"For, as I think... they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government."
"- Trust me, I am glad on't."
- Indeed!
- My lord?
- I am glad to see you mad.
"- Why, sweet Othello."
- Devil!
I have not deserved this.
"This would not be believed in Venice, though I should swear I saw't:"
'tis very much:
Make her amends;
- she weeps.
"- O devil, devil!"
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears.
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
- Out of my sight!
- I will not stay to offend you.
"I do beseech you lordship, call her back."
Mistress!
"What would you with her, sir?"
"- Who, I, my lord?"
One more chance.
"See, to be Amity is to forgive."
Others.
And yourself.
"You're hurting, Tris."
And my heart goes out to you.
I know what it's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love.
But killing Jeanine is not going to bring your mother back.
I know you're angry.
But you're letting it consume you.

- JOHANNAI What is it?

JOHAN NA:
"Gentlemen,"
Amity welcomes you.
To what do we owe the pleasure?
"This isn't really a social call, Johanna."
We're looking for Divergents.
I see.
"Well, of course, anything we can do to help."
Gonna need you to volunteer your faction to be tested.

"Now that Jeanine's heading up the Council, the approval process just got a little easier."
You're exceeding your jurisdiction.
"Now, Johanna, what happened to that Amity politeness?"
Yes?
"Tat-chi, you have realized the secrets of Shaolin."
"Chief, I think Tat-chi is skilled enough to be our representative."
Amida Buddha!
The Shaolin and Wu-tang parties have both arrived as planned.
"If they can fight each other,"
Your Highness will surely have the advantage.
You'll be the ruler.
Will the two representatives please come out?
Remember to eliminate unnecessary doubts.
Please start the fight!
Stand back!
Shaolin monks say that the Wu-tang school originated from them.
Does the Shaolin still say that?
"Amida Buddha, yes!"
Wu-tang founder San-feng broke our rules and was expelled.
That's enough!
He was expelled because Shaolin was jealous of his ability.
We are the best fighters.
Nonsense!
Wu-tang is too proud!
We're only telling facts.
Please don't argue!
I trust this contest will decide which school is better once and for all.
- Yes!
- Yes!
Who will be the representatives?
Ming-kai!
Tat-chi!
Fung-wu?
Jun-kit?
You!
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me

This thing looks okay.
Very okay.
But there is a conviction.
Criminal possession in the fourth degree.
In the fourth degree.
A 4-C.
It's a probational offense.
Practically a misdemeanor.
"Kevin, there are 4-Cs, and there are 4-Cs."
You keep looking at that as if it weren't kosher.
A cut of meat is kosher.
A piece of fish.
Savory foods are kosher.
But a probation report is not kosher.
A probation report is merely a probation report.
"I am a good Louisiana lapsed Catholic, Abe."
Don't talk to me about kosher.
Give it to me straight.
What's wrong with this?
It's too kosher.
Translate that for me.
The Virgin looks pregnant to me.
Look.
The supervisor signed this.
So what?
That's a lot of weight for a 4-C.
So what happened to the original little probation officer?
Where is his signature?
Do you know this supervisor?
His name is Schwartz.
- A landsman of yours?
- Landsman landsman.
As long as I am still wearing a prosecutor's clothes...
I'll do everything to preserve it.
Choi Eung Chan.
Why would you you come here?
!
Our Prosecutor... became like this because he was following you.
Right?
City Hunter!
It's you!
At the site...
Because he was fearlessly running around trying to catch you.
Our prosecutor became like that!
You killer!
Hey!
By any means...
I will catch you!
"I promise you, I will catch you!"
Hey!
Let go.
Let go!
Seriously!
Aish
"I came because we lost a precious prosecutor, but"
I think I should just go
I found that Chairman Cheon Jae Man and President Choi Eung Chan have something going on.
"After the President assumed office,"
Hae Won got the bid to construct the bridge over Minja Expressway.
"For that, there was a controversy over the favoritism."
"Right before the presidential election,"
Haewon moved a pile of money.
And that was used for presidential election.
And that contract was the payback.
Did you talk to the Queen?
- I can not talk to the Palace.
And the Prime Minister?
- Still unattainable.
Do you want to be reached?
We are ready.
"- Carlos, what does he do here?"
We will not go anywhere.
- Why?
There is an emergency meeting.
- What the hell is going on?
All flights were canceled due to cosmic interference.
"Excuse me, one that?"
"- A solar storm, exactly."
"The satellites are dead, some are precipitated."
"For security reasons, you have to stay here."
Here in Istanbul?
"- No, here at this hotel."
All foreign dignitaries will be concentrated here.
How long will we have to wait?
"- One day, one week."
You do not know.
"Do you remember the Icelandic volcano, Eyjajafufukukul?"
Eyjafjallajökull.
- Yup.
I have to go back to Belgium right away.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
This situation is a disadvantage for everyone.
I had to receive a promotion this week.
"If we can not fly, we'll be in the car."
"By car, through the Balkans?"
- Yup.
Hopefully not too much to interpret.
Slept well?
For the first time since I've been here.
Good.
"Until yesterday,"
I was not permitted regular prayer.
We receive comfort from our prayers.
- We?
- Human beings.
I say something wrong?
You placed us on the same level.
- Aren't we?
"- Well, here..."
I am thought of as less than human.
"And in your Jihad, I am."
Gideon... what do you really want from me?
I already told you.
I want to understand you.
And if that is not possible?
Then that would be my loss.
It's almost time for your midday prayers.
May I return later?
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you.
Most of these tips are so new they haven't even been authenticated yet.
"Yeah, but there's nothing in the established information that's remotely helpful."
Wait a minute.
Anthrax.
- What?
- Genimmune.
A dutch biotech firm reported that they may have had a security breach
- involving anthrax last week.
REED:
"An Insectoid ship, sir."
You destroyed them?
REED:
They were opening a vortex.
They would have escaped.
The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
Sir?
We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."
If you'd explained to them why we were here... you might have avoided a fire-fight.
"With all due respect, sir, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."
ARCHER:
Archer to Major Hayes.
HAYES:
"Go ahead, Captain."
ARCHER:
"Report to my Ready Room, on the double."
HAYES:
"Aye, sir."
I'm relieving you as Tactical Officer.
ARCHER:
"From now on, you'll report to Major Hayes."
I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
-Captain!
-Dismissed.
"Yes, sir."
ARCHER:
Are you done with that translation?
Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.
Stop this.
I'll be beheaded if you don't choose francis anyway.
I'd rather die today
To show you that I mean every word that I say.
Is this some kind of trick?
Test me.
Ask nostradamus to explain
How the future he sees for you and francis
Has altered since clarissa's death.
"Oh, yes."
Be sure.
Be very sure.
"I would want every certainty, too."
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure about anything.
"I believe you, but..."
You don't know what you want.
I love them.
I love them both.
"Begging your pardon, your majesties,"
But the king demands your presence.
A messenger has arrived with news
About the line of succession of England.
Their queen...
Is dead.
And she has named me her successor?
"After all her deliberations, they say she died"
Suddenly...
In the night.
"But England is yours by bloodline, by right."
"You must claim it immediately,"
Or your cousin elizabeth will seize it from your grasp.
It's called angioplasty.

"Lynn got her tattoo in NewYork, right?"
"It was a Japanese master, in the classical style:"
Hiromitsu.
Classical style?
The classical era of Japanese tattoos was between the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Japanese have little interest in naked bodies.
The purity of virgin skin means nothing to them.
The Hiromitsu
He only did 12 tattoos.
This is Lynn's.
Number 3.
They are true works of art.
The Japanese passion for tattoos
led people to collect skin.
Collectors bought pictures from the living and waited for them to die.

"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater with a character like Stuart is repellent.
"No offense, Stuart."
None taken.
"Although ""repellent"" is kind of a... kind of a strong word."
"I'm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
"Um, again..."
"Stuart, please."
You're being rude.
Anything else?
I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
I'm listening.

Interesting.

Yes.

I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.

Bobby:
Son of a cuss.
Cathy:
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Um, I do have a question, though,"
"'cause I--my biggest worry is, you know, of course, my bandages and stuff."
But I've been taking a sh--
"I know I can take a shower, but I haven't."
But I thought maybe I could at least try to take a shower before you got here.
Is that okay if I just go ahead and do that?
"Oh, good."
Okay.
Bobby:
"Dad, can I come down?"
Cathy:
"Bobby, can we have a talk, though?"
"Please, please, please?"
Bobby:
Oh.
Cathy:
"I just need to have a talk, okay?"
"Because Grandma is telling me-- all the grandmas, all the friends are saying what a great boy you are."
And of course I know that.
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.
I've never been like this before.
"I just need us all to help each other, okay?"
"And I know that sometimes when we ask you to do something to help, sometimes it's 'cause you don't want to go upstairs 'cause you get scared."
"She comes, and she kneels down every day?"
Moses:
"Yes, because I'm a man."

David:
"Hi, Grandma."
It's David.
How are you?
I'm good.
"I'm still-- Yeah, I'm in New York."
"It's--Yeah, it's been really hot here, but I'm having fun."
"Uh, anyway, I wanted to call you, because, uh, you know my friend, uh, Nick, that I-- that you've met a lot..."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I know."
He's a very nice boy.
Uh...
"Well, I wanted to tell you that he's, um, not-- not just my friend."
He's--he's my boyfriend.
"Um, and it's something that I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I wasn't really sure how you would react, so I was a little nervous to tell you."
Um...
I-I love you too.
Yeah.
I love you too.
"And I'm hoping that-- that maybe you can love Nick too, um, because he's really important to me, so I'm hoping he can be really-- really important to you too."
Yeah.
"Well, that-- that means a lot to me."
Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
"I got it, i got it!"
Over here!
Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out...
But it does not really fit the personality
"And I can not play, For hard to reach."
*I never go anywhere* *without my money.*
I've got more money than money can buy.
It's the best thing in the world besides my Porsche.
"Bruce, you were great today."
Those jokes running under your editorial were a howl.
"Uh, jokes?"
Don't be so modest.
Money's the name of your gerbil?
That's funny stuff.

"Hey, Russ, now that I'm gonna have more free time, what do you say we spend it together?"
"I'd say, ""I don't think so, Jess."""
"Well, what's the matter?"
"Jessica, you made a fool out of yourself and you made a fool out of me."
You're just gonna have to excuse me.
"Yeah, you don't call me."
I'll call you.

"You're gonna get it now, you little Yank."
"Bov, you wanna make up for what you've done?"
Get my brother's family out of here.
Tommy!
"Don't you want to finish me off, then?"
"You're already finished, little Petey."
"The NTO will take care of you in a minute, you mug."
"We didn't kill your son, Tommy!"
You did!
"You should have protected him, mate!"
He was your son!
- Don't you talk about my fucking son.
"- He was your son, Tommy!"
- Get in the fucking motor!
Get in the car!
- Get Pete!
Only a poor little Hammer!
His face was all battered and torn!
He made me feel sick!
I hit him with a brick!
Now the cunt's not laughing or singing No more!
"- He's not laughing or singing-- - No, Tommy, he's had enough!"
I'll get us out of here.
Go.
- You can't leave him.
- Pete!
Pete!
Fucking help him!
Pete Dunham's life taught me there's a time to stand your ground.
His death taught me there's a time to walk away.
I would never have the chance to thank him.
But I could live in a way that would honor him.
She liked it.
And you get to know the people.
Both my sisters lived in Grand Rapids there.
Janet O'Donnell and who else?
Eleanor McDonough.
She's got the place in Charlevoix now.
Her husband died a couple years ago so she's got - her parents own a house over there.
"So what was the island like back then when you came back you rented first, right?"
"Oh yeah, I rented for years."
"It was okay, it was good."
"A little busy, like you say, all the time."
But you still knew more people.
"Now, know more up at the hill at the cemetery."
"Like I said, nine of us graduated in '59."
Threw a 50th party here in July.
Who were those nine that graduated together?
Four of us lived here.
"Eleanor Moony, O'Donnell's wife."
"And Beverly Cantwell, now."
"That's Richie's sister by the way, the fireman."
Myself.
And Loretta Slader.
All four of us lived here.
Then we have Caroline [?].
She was Johnny Paul's sister.
Next to another Johnny in my class.
Jeanie [?] lived next to Archie's place.
And Sally Martin
"She would be Margie, up at the old convent there."
Be Little Ernie's aunt.
"Let's see who - Jeanie, and Sally, and"
Caroline
"-Anthony, not all French men are gay."
That sounds a little bit racist.
"-Okay, well, earlier today, he was doing some really questionable things."
"This is the living room, and I'll show you--"
Why are you holding my hand?
-Why would I not?
-Not gay!
-What?
-Not gay!
-What are you doing?
-Looking at gay porn.
"-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay."
"-Anthony, you can't be so racist."
Just because his culture is different it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.
-He was looking at gay porn.
-And who doesn't from time to time?
-True.
"-Dude, I gotta go."
I've been looking for French fries for the past five hours and I can't find them anywhere.
-(Pierre) I want to be... [knock on door]
"-(Anthony) Hey Pierre, are these your friends?"
They look like Richard Simmons.
"-You idiot, that's the Italian mafia."
-What the hell are they doing here?
-I have a lot of gambling debt.
I just can't say no to naked Twister.
"-Okay, it's time to eat s--t and die, sillies!"
-Yeah!
"You've messed with the wrong Italians, Pierre."
-I'm so scared right now.
Hold me.

"We did a MV Reaction, and I wanted to listen to again to see if I could like this song."
"And that's what happened, I really like it."
"The choreography is weird and cool, the song too."
"The lyrics are weird, it's about the wisdom tooth, and I mean they compare the wisdom tooth to their first love."
I thought that the lyrics were so crazy that that's why I liked Rum Pum Pum Pum.

"Same as she did, OK."
You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear.
Volunteer:
"0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4."
I think you left out the number 3?
AB:
That's three.

"For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries,"
I have one more question for the audience.
"By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?"
"If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand."
"Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first."
"What year was it, first of all?"
That's why I pick a gentleman first.
Audience:
1953.
"1953, and the month?"
November what?
23rd -- was that a Monday?
Mister Morton grew.
Mister Morton was very shy.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does."
"The subject is a noun, that's a person, place or thing."
It's who or what the sentence is about.
"And the predicate is the verb, that's the action word that gets this subject up and out."
Mister Morton wrote Pearl a poem.
Mister Morton wrote.
Pearl replied in the afternoon.
Pearl replied by a note.
Mister Morton was very nervous.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does!"
The cat stretched.
The sun beat down.
A neighbor chased his kid.
"(""Come here kid."
"Come on!"")"
Each sentence is completed when you know what the subject did.
Mister Morton knocked on her door.
Mister Morton knocked.
Mister Morton sat on her porch.
"Yes, he just sat there and rocked."
Mister Morton was a nervous man; when she opened up the door he ran.
Mister Morton climbed up his stairs.
Mister Morton climbed.
Mister Morton rhymed pretty words.
Mister Morton rhymed.
Mister Morton was lonely.
Mister Morton was ... until Pearl showed up with a single rose.
Who says women can't propose?
No.
"Look, I'm telling you the truth."
"You've gotta trust me, Pete."
"Mate, you've put me right fucking in it."
If I don't convince those boys... ...that the head of their firm was not just taken by a fucking Yank journo... ...the GSE is done.
So I'm gonna go out there... ...and I'm gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong... ...and that you're one of us.
And I had better be fucking right.
"So, Bovver... ...is there anything else you wanna tell us?"
"Listen, Tom, please."
This is how it's gotta go down.
"You're the only one going down, little Bovver."
Grass.
Fuck.
This shit with Bovver could tear this firm apart.
"Mate, I need you."
"Stay with us, just through Millwall."
I'm not gonna help you.
"I made a promise to my wife and kids, all right?"
And I'm sticking to it.
"You know, there comes a time... ...when the best reputation you can have is the one where your family--"
- What is it?
- Get down.
Get the fuck down.
"Hello, boys."
Jesus.
Pete.
"Pete, come on, man!"
"Hello, Terry."
Fuck off!
Terry.
Terry.
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey after all these years.
"I beg your pardon, but when is today?"
I don't care about today!
It's boring!
Every day - it is today.
How do we cope with that?
Can it be that one day Time will stop and we will say:
Yesterday is every morning.
Life is awfully boring.
"Life is awfully boring, Yesterday is every morning."
"Let tomorrow come today, It is where we hurry."
"Let the future come our way, - Then we wouldn't worry."
Don't you see that everything around belongs tomorrow?
Don't you feel the future has already come?
"lf the future had come, now it would have been... the New Year!"
The New Year?
The New Year?
Let it be the New Year!
"What, what New Year?"
The New Year doesn't come just like that.
You have to see it in.
Then let's!
"Let's, let's see it in!"
Let's!
"I'd say, why don't we really see it in?"
"It is so pleasant, my friends, to see in the New Year."
Very pleasant.
How?
How?
How shall we see it in?
"To see in the New Year, we need, first of all, a Christmas tree."
"Secondly, Santa Claus."
"And, last but not least, the Snow Maiden."
Yes I'm
I just want to be a boxer first
I'm so sorry
"Hey, fella."
I think you can help.
Coem with me
How'd you like to go to a movie premiere?
I'm hurt
[Light music]
Here I go out to sea again.
Sunshine fills my head and dreams hang in the air.
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes you know it feels unfair.
There's magic everywhere.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to hide and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
The sun's in your eyes.
The heat is in your hair.
They seem to hate you because you're there.
"And I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy."
Not stand here on my own.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in the sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
[saxophone]
"I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy, not so alone."
She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...
Baek Eun Jo.
How could you talk to your life saver like that??
That's alright.
It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
"In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways."
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
"See, I told you."
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.
Again?
You came?
"Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that..."
"Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?"
"Eun Jo, are you okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
How is Eun Jo?
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.
True.
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Oh Ki Dong."
It's a relief that everything is fine.
How is the building of your house coming along?
Is it doing alright?
"You know, it's a major pain."
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
"It'll all go well, I guess."
"Hey girl, turn the oven off in five minutes."
Let it settle a bit as I am getting ready.
Then let us make a nice package for it.
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ebru Hanım, we've got a mail for you."
I am so excited to see Kuzey.
"But, also nervous that I will see Sami there."
"I mean, I can't go in before or after Sami."
Since we have limited time.
I will have to see his face.
"I know, he will try to talk to me when he sees me alone."
"But, I will not listen to him."
Why would I listen?
"God forbid, I don't want to give him any hopes."
"If he gets some hope and throws his ring away,"
I would feel sorry for the woman.
Ebru Hanım?
"- Who received the mails today, Hasan?"
"- I did, ma'am."
- Who brought the big yellow envelope?
"- A courier, ma'am."
"Barış, get up!"
Barış get up!
"I'm telling you to get up, Barış!"
"What did you do, huh?"
What did you do?
What's going on?
"Calm down, what did I do?"
Celebrated for the end of Ferhat case.
And getting rid of the Burak problem.
Is this how you want to get rid of him?
- What is the matter?
I wrote a letter to him.
It's easier then speaking.
I explained everything from the beginning.
I told him you and me were too new.
Then I told him everything I feel.
"My emotion, my concerns, everything."
I poured my heart out to him.
I hope he'll understand me.
How are you?
Are you in the station?
"Yes, I am drown in paper work since I was called back to duty."
I thought that case was closed.
"I mean, the guy is caught."
It is over.
"A second Demet, please hold on a sec."
"Hello, yes Aziz?"
"Deniz Hanım, returned to the country a week after she left it."
- And she didn't leave again.
- So she's in Turkey for two and a half months.
"- Yes, abi."
"- Okay, thanks."
- Hello.
"- Hello, what's up?"
Maybe I should call you later.
There's a connection between Ferhat's daughter and the man who said he killed Ferhat.
"I need to talk to Mirza, please find a way."
"There's no way, Deniz."
If they see you with him... ... it will peril the plausibility of his statement.
Maybe he'll die even before the trial.
The last reports were very bad.
- Wish I could at least say goodbye.
- He doesn't want that.
"But you are still a baby, you are my big baby."
"Okay then, Okay, have some rest,"
Don't ever force your leg okay?
"If you need something, shout to us."
"Okay, I am lying down.- Bravo !"
Lie down!
"Mira, did you talk to Orkun?"
"Yes mom, is the third time you're asking today."
What does he say?
- He doesn't say anything.
"He went together with his dad to the fabric in Luleburgaz, they will be staying there for some days."
"See ?, he is escaping too.&amp;gt; Mom, don't please!"
"The owner of this wants his vehicle in some days, you have to take care of the instruments order right away on morning.Beeren calling"
"OK, no problem, I will solve it tomorrow!- Good bye! &amp;gt;Good night uncle!"
Yes?
Err...
"I called to tell you I am fine, maybe you are worried about me,"
It's me Berren...- Beeren?
Aa Beren...
So good you called me..
I was thinking of you.&amp;gt; Really?
Dad?!...
Daddy... &amp;gt; My sweetheart...
"Where were you ,i was so worried , dad..- I am sorry.."
I am sorry.
I will solve everything.
"I know my dear dad, i know..."
Shall I go and talk with him too?
No.. just let him..
It means he is suffering from love.
My precious boy!
He is growing up dear Ender.
"Let me see, where were you?"
Mert whispering: is that Mira?
Hello?&amp;gt;Just a second..
I will go so you can talk comfortably.
Your voice sounds interrupted...
Last night was left half.
"In fact we have to complete it. want to talk with you a bit tonight, but alone."
Okay?
Don't take Mert with you.
Only you and me.
"Look, girl!"
"I am telling you the last time clearly, I don't have anything to do with you and will never in this life."
"Did you understand it?-Ah..ah...-Ah or not, this is it!"
You will have nothing from me!
I'm telling you this from the beginning.
Do you understand me?
"Hey, talk properly !"
You're the girl that my friend loves.
"Be wise, be worthy of him!"
I am trying to explain it politely but...
"look Eylul, if you sadden that boy, I will break your heart, know this too!"
OK?
Did you get me?
You're out of your mind!- Whatever it is!
"Don't call me again, ok?"
"Or even say ""Hello"" as a human... or don't even greet me."
That's it!
Mert?!
I forgot my phone.
There is a girl at our place...
Err...
Giray's girlfriend... stupid... she calls me constantly..
"I was good, wasn't I?"
"So, it looks like a tough assignment."
Maybe you could give me a hand.
Or maybe both hands.
"OK, those who didn't get talent positions, there's room on the crew."
Talk to Patty.
I thought my tape was really great.
"Elizabeth, some people like yourself excel at the written word."
Not everyone's meant to be an on-air personality.
There's still room on the crew.
Get it together!
We've got a show to do here.
"Enid, did you get that?"
"(Todd) Man, Patty's really trippingon this director business."
"(Patty) People, please!"
Are you feeling any better?
Not really.
You're still *The Oracle's* star writer.
No one can ever take that away from you.
"I wanted it so bad, Todd, and I thought my work was really great."
"Well, what did Collins say?"
There's nothing he can do.
"If you ask me, they should change the name from *Oracle On-Air* to *Airheads On-Air.*"
Hey...
"Present company excluded, of course."
"Hi, Liz..."
Todd.
Have you met Russ?
"Yes, I have."
"Well, just wanted to say hi."
Don't forget to watch me tomorrow.
Is it wrong to hate your sister with a passion?
"Well, uh, let's see, something wrong with the distributor I think."
Want me to give you a hand?
Thank you.
I sure appreciate it.
"Well, it doesn't look too serious."
Good.
( dramatic theme playing )
( phone rings )
I'll get it.
Hello.
"Uh, let me talk to your mother."
"It's for you, Mom."
Hello.
Hello.
Mrs. Pryor?
Yes.
"Now, you look, I've got your husband."
What?
"If you want to get him back you're gonna have to pay me $100,000."
What are you talking about?
I guess you heard me all right.
Now you better start thinking about that money.
"For your information, my husband is right here at home."
"Believe me, I've got him and I'm not going to give him back until you pay."
"It's the first time I've done this kind of thing and I'm nervous about it, so don't kid around with me because I might hurt the man."
I don't know what kind of a sick mind you've got but I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
( dramatic theme playing )
Cheyney...
did you make the call?
"Cheyney, did you make the call?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, what'd she say, Cheyney?"
Nobody's in it.
"Um, I think there's only one floor with any people on it."
[Anthem playing in background]
"We're in the hotel room and, um, we've been told that they're bugged."
That they're listening to us.
I don't know if whispering is going to help.
That might be where it all stems from.
Hello!
Hello!
"Come in, Come in Tokyo."
"Hello, Hello."
"Hello, Hello."
We're here.
[Woman singing on TV]
"Right after we get there, we were taken for our first meal."
"The first time you eat in North Korea, it's kind of a sign of the very weird things to come."
[Girls laughing]
[Girl speaking Korean]
Is this where we go?
Here?
The table is over here.
We're in a big banquet room.
As you can see it's huge.
There's about 20 women who are getting ready for our dinner.
"First of all, they give you about 3 or 4 courses of absolutely inedible food."
It's just matter.
It's like fried matter.
"And you're kinda going, yeah, yeah."
"But you're waiting for every one to fill in, when's this banquet happening?"
When's the banquet?
There is no banquet.
Where is everyone?

You know we're gonna have to stop meeting like this.

- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal.
I've kept that my entire life.
Are you working for the Times?
- Yes.

They never found the bodies.
I don't understand.

"- What is all this about, Reşat Bey?"
- What do you mean sir?
Haven't you seen the local newspaper?
I am...
I am very sorry but I don't know what you're saying.
The party members have just read  your town's local news to me.
Explain to me what this rape scandal is about.
"They mention Selim's name in it, too."
You will tell me everything.
You will tell me what you did to Fatmagül.
Are you alright?
Back off!
They asked me to help the girl.
So I went to the hospital.
And I found out that the girl had an affair with Kerim.
Lies!
Don't give me bullshit!
Tell me the truth!
You just don't want to see the truth.
The real lie is what you see here.
This rape slander.
"When I was at the war front, he saved my life once  so I brought him back and treat him like my own son."
You've ruined his hunting game.
Let's go.
Now.
I'm so afraid. * sarcastically *
What?
A prince?
He is nothing but a thug!
You are unworthy of being here!
You there!
Take your hands off of him.
What have I done to deserve this?
Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?
Why you still...!
Take him out and lock him in the storage.
Yes sir.
"Is that you, Kwon-yoo?"
Please forgive me.
I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.
Please forgive me.
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.
What?
What are you worried about?
Don't worry.
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?
I was trying to broaden my view like  others by not focusing on study alone...
Was I really asking you that?
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?
Is it because of his daughter?
Only the Shin family...
She is the first one that I like...
Tommorow they're going to visit the school.
Why don't you accompany them?
(Daniela) Of course!
(Roberto) But MOM!
"(Berta) well then, it's all set."
"They are going to the hotel San Diego.IF you are going with them, then you can talk about your plans for tomorrow."
(Julia) I can do that.
And that is how Julio and I met Linda.
"Julio, you're not coming?"
"Now I remember, I can't."
Tommorow I have a soccer game and now I have to go to the gym.
"Excuse me, but I can't accompany you now."
"See you later, eh?"
Julio is a great player in the team.
He's a great athlete.
Benito Juarez Preparatory School
The following day my sister Daniela take Linda and her mom on a tour of our school.
I'm staying here.
I need to talk with the principal.
"(Linda) Oh, ok Mom."
Daniela is going to show me the school.
Perfect!
Then you can tell everything to your classmates at school.
Until I see you later.
You guys study English here right?
"Yes, but also their culture, history, and everything!"
And my school in San Antonio we study Spanish.
"The culture, and history of Mexico."
(also)
Our school have a lot in common!
"Look, there's Julio."
"Hi,"
He's dating Carla.
This's not good.
"First of all, I already told her I got a girlfriend."
"Second, you just put your bare lips on my ear."
How is it going?
I'm....
"JD, I know. he won't stop talking about you."
I'm Jennifer.
"Mmm, Jennifer."
Do you really spend everyday saving children lives?
Tell the nice lady.
I do what I can.
I know two things to be true about bars.
"One they are always packed the week of thanksgiving,"
"And two, put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth"
"I was laughing so hard, milk was coming of my nose."
I was tripped over IV and blood shot over everyone
A little got on my nose.
Every damn day saving those children.
Who wants margaritas?
"Dube, less blood, more fruity drinks."
Right.
That's the thing about Turk.
He hasn't changed a bit since college.
He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
"Dude, this girl's pretty hot."
"So try not to blow it,okay?"
Why do you say that?
"Because you're like a 24 convenient store , you never close."
That sounds a Fat Albert like joke
Don't worry about it man.
"I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying."
"""Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."""
(Whistling)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Marker.
I'm afraid to open any doors around here.
"And five, six, seven, eight."
- And one.
- Liberian Girl
You came and you changed my world
"You know, Whoopie, it'd be a blast if Michael asked me to dance."
Liberian girl
- It's the most stupid thing-- - He went on Oprah's show the next day.
He told everybody I was going to make him into another Michael Jackson.
Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
Two lovers in a scene
Then she says Do you love me
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"
Who's directing this?
Maybe we could have some rolled up with some kind of string... that I could like pull him up.
Liberian girl
"I know this is kind of loose, but do you know what we're supposed to be doing?"
All I know is that Michael called me.
"I guess when he gets here, he'll let me know what we're supposed to do."
- You won.
"- Well, hey-- Is Mike here?"
"No, but I think Bubbles is here."
That's one of the Cosby kids.

Western illinois University and University Television Present Spotlight
Beth Seaton:
Hi.
Welcome to Spotlight.
"I'm Beth Seaton, director of sponsored projects here at Western illinois University."
"We're here at Knoblauch Hall, where we are going to visit Dr. Win Phippen from the School of Agriculture."
"And hopefully, the director of the School of Agriculture, too."
We're going to talk to Win a little bit about a program that has been funded here at Western illinois University.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Win.
Win Phippen:
"Hey, Beth."
How are we doing?
Beth Seaton:
Good.
I wanted to come over and talk to you a little bit about your new project.
Tell me a little bit about your new USDA project.
It's so exciting!
"It's like a half a million dollars, right?"
Win Phippen:
Yes it is.
It's a quite a coup for the University.
Beth Seaton:
It is.
Win Phippen: ...and my research program.
I'm quite excited about it.
It's very unique.
"It's not a hard core, sort of, science research project."
"It's more plant-breeding education, and with a component of science related to it."
And the real neat thing about it is that is has
Tonight I am hanging out with Emily. woman:
Okay. man:
But I was planning on telling her exactly how I feel about her.
And then I don't know.
So I was calling my mother to see-- what should I say to this woman?
[woman laughing]
Okay.
I don't know.
"I just think that, you know-- just concentrate on the fact that, you know, you have very, very high feelings of esteem for her, that she's somebody that you've always admired. man:"
"""Esteem""?"
Is that the word I should use?
Esteem?
You think she'd like that? woman:
Yeah.
Whatever. man:
I just don't know if that's-- woman:
You hold her in very high regard. man:
Ok--I don't know if those-- woman:
She's a special person in your life. man:
Okay.
I'll try all that.
Hey.
I am on the train now.
This is my friend Emily.
[romantic music]
"Uh, hello, ""Life In A Day."""
"I'm still with Emily, and we're still hanging out in Chicago."
"Um, this is..."
"We--we just came out of this place, which was cool."
"But, uh, I'm gonna leave this thing on in case anything gets climactic."
man:
"Theresa, look at me."
"Madam Noh, please help me."
Please help me find my daughter quietly.
Do you know who took your daughter?
That...
You should know him as well.
The one who was killed as an insurgent.
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister!
Hong Gil Dong!
Is he still alive?
You must find her quietly for me.
She is the only daughter of the core of all power!
No one must ever know she is with him.
And everyone that is found with her...
Silence them forever.
Do you understand?
So the one who blocked the police was Hong Gil Dong?
Did the prince know this?
He told us that someone would block the police so that we can attack Choi Chul Joo.
I am sure he knew.
So the reason he gave up the explosives and stopped the ship was... ... because of Hong Gil Dong!
He has interfered with our plans yet again.
- Go and find the Councilor's daughter.
"- Yes, Madam!"
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister and the only daughter of the Second State Councilor...?
We may have found a better weapon than the explosives.
- Search the area carefully!
"- Yes, Sir."
- Search the empty houses too!
"- Yes, Sir."
Hurry!
Miss Eun Hye!
"For you, I will lay down my life!"
"That was that then,-"
- No!
It is ... another!
Hahahaha!
I am going absolutely crazy.
People were so excited about Grant's new product that he started getting requests
left and right for his glasses wipers and spray nozzles.
"So, he started to keep a"
list of everyone who would want a pair very soon.
"By the end of 1 day, 36 of his friends had begged him for glasses wipers and 11 of those people each said that they would also like a pair of nozzles to go with their glasses wipers."
"It's... the pop... from, uh, the pizza place?"
It's -- looks like a person.
He matches the color of the restaurant.
That is the coffee logo.
That is a parade elephant.
That is the Disney.
Those are... little... worms.
"That looks like an ""M""."
"But upside down, ""M""s are ""W""s!"
That is the Apple Store logo!
It has a bite of an apple in it.
"Ooh, looks like the 'merican flag."
A bell.
"Uh, outside space."
Looks like a shooting star?
With a planet.
An eye.
"Chili, and it has an ""S"" next to it, and chilis are spicy."
That looks like a beach ball.
Beach balls are very colorful.
The GE logo.
That's where my grandpa works.
"Oh, I get it."
"You wanted this anchor job for yourself, and this is your way of getting back at me."
You'd let your own sister go down in flames just to satisfy your petty jealousy.
All right... but this is the last time I bail you out.
You're the greatest.
"Afterwards, I'll tell Collins you wrote the stories."
"He'll see how good you are, he'll let you write all my stories."
Me in front of the camera and you behind.
We could be a team.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
Jessica.
Have you seen Elizabeth?
Nope.
"Ten minutes, people."
"Jessica, I need to proof your copy."
"Sorry, Mr. C. Liz is still Xeroxing it."
"OK, looks good, Camera One."
"Camera Two, zoom out."
Camera Two?
"Hello, Camera Two?"
"What is that, Manny?"
"Oh, sorry."
"Elizabeth, where have you been?"
I need my stories!
These are blank.
They are?
Silly me.
I must have mixed up the stories I wrote with the ones you wrote.
Is there some kind of irony here?
How can you stand there and pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?
Practice?
"You knew how much I wanted to be anchor, and you switched the tapes just so you could get the job."
There's a place where you throw in coins and make wishes.
I made many wishes.
First wish was 'Please let B.A.P have a hit.'
Second wish was 'Please let our hair designer get married'
And the third wish was 'Please let our make-up artist get married too'
"I wasn't going to say this but, honestly, I wished for many chances"
To see many BABAz.
I think I threw in coins worth about 5 dollars.
"Well most importantly, the MV has to come out well."
We have to finish off the concerts in
Korea and Japan successfully too.
Take this energy from Central Park...
This is awesome.
None
Americans seem to know how to appreciate the small things in life.
We're so used to internet and machines.
We should stop getting used to them
And become appreciative people.
"I will try, too."
We're going to Time Square now.
Yong Guk is filming his scene at Time Square.
I've only seen it on TV.
Like in 'lnfinite Challenge' kind of TV shows. or other entertainment programs.
I've always wanted to visit.
And I get to go today.
I'm excited.
"Yo, New York City."
"We're here, in NY."
There's so much to do.
"Hogwarts kid, move."
We're here in NY.
I said move Hogwart!
"On February the 4th, when the trial is over and you are free."
"I will hug you so tight, that... ... no one will be able to untie us."
Take care until that day.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
If you want to be my girlfriend then you won't hold a weapon again.
- Zeynep.
- Let us go.
I said let us go.
Do I stick it in here?
We'll leave a row empty.
Then we'll add 4 rows.
Okay.
- Am I doing alright?
- You're doing wonderful.
"""Don't wait for me tonight."
"It's impossible for me come."""
"Now do the turns, and finish the crossed parts."
- How does it look?
"- It looks beautiful, canım."
The idiot dropped it at the house when he was fighting Kuzey.
I forgot that I kept it so that it wouldn't get lost.
Then I found it again in one of the boxes as I moved to my new place.
So I brought it  thought maybe it's something important.
You did well.
This was my father's.
Atilla Sinaner's.
He had bought this specially to give it as a present to Güney.
That fool couldn't hold onto it.
- One more?
"- No, I will go."
- Where?
Bye.
Excuse me...
My brother?
- What's the matter?
- Where is he?
Tell me what's wrong.
I talked to the doctor and he told me everything was okay and he was stable in a coma.
Was his condition serious?
I haven't been told anything about a transfer.
"Shit, Malena."
- What's the matter?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch.
What is it?
I feel fucking fine.
What day is it today?
September 10.
"2001, right?"
"I mean I didn't sleep til 2007 or anything, did l?"
You were out for 2 weeks.
You know what?
I have a feeling things are going to get better from now on.
"Shit, this is the 21st century."
We can learn from what we did wrong in the 20th.
"Starting tomorrow, the world will be a better place."
Trust me and you'll see.
"Pablo, there's something I haven't told you that you should know."
THE APPEARED
We are just doing future value of annuities.
"And I'll show you now, why this is such a cool thing."
"And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do two examples, both for future value of an annuity."
And whats the other thing we do?
"Ah yes, yes."
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.
You did well.
Good Job.
"Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work."
So try it at least once.
"Eat it, okay?"
Okay. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I feel sorry towards Joon Gu... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm excited but nervous at the same time. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Will I be able to do a good job?
Oh.
Where did it go?
I know I brought it in.
Is this yours?
Mine.
You took it didn't you?
Dummy.
It was on the ground right here.
Who would steal childish panties like those?
I only wear them once in a while.
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.
Even the A Cup must be too big...
Did you stop growing after elementary school?
What did you say?
Hey.
"Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything..."
Isn't that a big problem?
Is it that fun to make fun of me?
"If you don't like living with me, you can just say it."
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.
I'm grumpy?
Yeah.
Why am I doing that?
When I saw Suraj I realised that he was your son.
Arun's son.
But when he mentioned his father's name I kept silent.
He still doesn't know that I am his mother.
Promise me that you will never tell him the truth.
He won't learn from me.
But if there is a God he'll surely learn of his real parents someday.
"Hello, mother!"
- God bless you!
Come in.
Suraj's mother has come.
Hello!
Please have a seat.
"Sit, my dear."
I'm pleased to meet you.
"Renu, fetch some tea."
"No, that won't be necessary."
Sit beside me.
It is customary to offer something to a guest.
I have come to meet you as it is customary to do so.
You are the girl's father and I am the boy's mother.
Both of us should consent to this alliance.
Times have changed.
In these times the girl and the boy decide for themselves.
The parentsjust need to give their blessings.
Our happiness lies in their happiness.
For the sake of their happiness we should set the date immediately.
It is my wish too.
She's feeling shy.
- She's a child.
"Vandana, Suraj's mother has come."
She is my sister.
He wants a lot.
"He has big demands, boss!"
He wants 1500 gm of gold.
"You don""t worry."
I have said yes on your behalf!
Fool!
Will your father bring 1500 gm of gold?
Go and bring breakfast!
Bring breakfast for 2 people!
I have come to meet you!
- I was waiting for you!
But sP is always busy!
I wish I was Tiger singh.
You would have then followed me thinking me to be a culprit.
Under this pretext I would have got.. ..the chance to meet my friend.
What do I tell you?
I had come to arrest Tiger singh!
And I myself have landed into trouble.
What trouble?
- A beautiful trouble.
Where did you find her?
- ln your city.
"I couldn""t stop looking at her when I saw her for the first time."
"When I saw her for the second time, I lost my heart."
"When I saw her for the third time, I lost my senses."
Where does she lives?
- ln my heart.
"When we were in London, you would never take.. ..any decision without consulting your friend."
And here you fell in love without informing your friend.
"Till the time I don""t fix the alliance with her parents.. ..how can I give her name to you?"
"Then give me the girl""s father""s name."
Diwan Dinanath!
I've seen many skateboarders since yesterday. our youngest Zelo also likes to skateboard.
"Board shop, board shop!"
"Here, it seems like a routine."
"Just as we go bike riding, people here seem to enjoy skateboarding."
Look at the camera.

"Since the U.S. is a really big nation, the roads and buildings are all big"
I can tell why Americans are so relaxed.
"I heard in America, people eat burgers and shakes together."
There aren't many people yet in Korea who eat like that.
"- Yes there is, Yong Guk."
"- Yes, Yong Guk eats like that."
We will give it a try today.
"At Shake Shack, they eat burgers and shakes together."
"Usually, people drink coke."
"Well, that's what they say."
Why don't you all try it too?
I hear strawberry shakes are delicious.
I felt this last time too...
The clouds in America are so beautiful.
I think I can see them more clearly because there aren't too many tall buildings. one two three.
We're in America.
"one more time, one more time."
"Hurry, one more time."
"oK, the red light is on."
I'm at a coffee shop.
"This is a mango smoothie, sold only in this store."
None
I don't know where everybody else went.
oh!
There's Zelo.
"Yo, what's up!"
Look.
Kundan is just a friend.
I never thought about him like that.
"Mom, dad, at least don't fight tonight."
"Bunty, who would you prefer to stay with?"
- Katrina Kaif.
"Bunty, I am talking about the both of us"
I am divorcing your mother.
- That's a lie.
Actually I am divorcing him.
"- Very good, very good."
"You guys have fun, I am leaving."
Bunty.
Bunty.
Friends.
To make this celebration of a 33 year old mistake memorable.. ..I request Mr. Kundan Lal to sing a song in twin voices.
"Come, come."
Ladies and gentlemen.
I made this song for my dear friend.. ..Mala for her marriage with Kishen.
So can we change the mood now?
Clap.
"""Now you can do it like this."""
"""Take it to the left."
"Or you can do it like that."""
"""Shake it to the right all my ladies &amp;amp; my man and my men &amp;amp; my ladies."""
"""All my ladies and my man and my men and my ladies."""
"""You can do it like this."""
When my mom and dad didn't have any love story.. ..then what was the theme of the song?
"""Shake it to the right."""
Which song would suit such an unromantic couple?
How would both of them look singing together?
"""You can do it like this."
"After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut."
-Baek Eun Jo  -No Ri.
Thank you.
My parents... are coming up on an evening flight.
Uhmm..
They must have been very surprised.
The doctor complimented you.
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.
"If you hadn't told me how,"
I wouldn't have been able to do anything
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.
I had no idea.
I really... had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.
I will call my dad.
He must be worried.
Oh Ha Ni!
"Ah, my cellphone and my wallet... where did I leave it all?"
"I, really..."
How old am I that I'm already...
You know..
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...
He explained everything to me already.
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.
I was afraid... that I might do something wrong.
"So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo."
Everything is alright now. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; It's the first time that I heard.. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;warm words from Baek Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Since my anxious feelings were all relieved... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My eyes and heart... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I cried so much they nearly melted away.
Hello!
Hi Eun Jo.
Omo!
You made it today.
The flowers smells good.
It's Oh Ha Ni again??
Dharamdas!
"Ma""am, not Dharamdas. l told you to call me DDT."
Where is your boss?
Fine!
Fine!
"I didn""t see boss going out."
"Which culprit are you searching for, sP?"
Who will be a bigger culprit than you?
You left me alone for 2 months!
Where did you disappear?
I and sister-in-law were waiting for you since a long time.
You should have peeped in your heart!
I see!
How was your journey?
- It was beautiful! open your suitcase and tell me what have you brought for me? open the suitcase!
And take whatever you like! - ls that so?
There are many things in this too! only saris in this!
I am sure this has something for me! only two suitcases?
"We didn""t get any time for shopping, Rajesh!"
"But since when did you take custom officer""s duty?"
You are searching it thoroughly.
I thought you must have brought many things for me.
"But I didn""t find anything in this. shekhar, I will leave now."
- No!
"Have tea! sorry, shekhar!"
I am on duty!
Nowadays you are so busy with your duty!
"What do I tell you, friend? lt""s all because of Tiger singh!"
"Bye, sister-in-law. see you, shekhar. shekhar.. hadn""t we brought 4 suitcases?"
"Yes, seema!"
I gave two suitcases to kaka.
Listen!
Then I would wake up and cry again.
I really couldn't go on.
"I swore to forget about Gil Dong, so that I could live."
What could I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not like he went somewhere I could follow.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I found myself being able to live each day.
Then someday I wouldn't even think about Gil Dong at all.
That's how I lived.
But you know...
I'm so dumb.
I forget sometimes that I'm not supposed to think about him.
"When that happens, my heart hurts really badly."
I can't go on!
I wish I'd just become really stupid.
I can't see you like this anymore.
Do you remember any big event twenty years ago in the fall?
"For example, a rich noblewomen running away with a daughter?"
- Twenty years ago?
"- Yes, the year the late king passed away."
How can we remember something that long ago?
This...!
This is Chunmyungdan.
Try it.
"Doctor Heo, please help us."
He's the son of the Interior Minister.
Please take him home for us.
We're short on staff.
Please?
The son of the Interior Minister?
He must be Gil Dong's older brother.
- I just want one more drink.
- Please be careful.
In Hyung!
"Welcome, sir."
You can go to bed.
I will attend to my guest myself.
"Of course, sir."
Good night.
"Wow, this place is super."
You like it?
I can't believe it.
Cemre must be stupid to leave this place.
"Yeah, and she left for another stupid person."
She turned her back on me because of stupid Kuzey.
"""My daughter, Cemre..."""
"""... if you are reading this letter..."""
"""... that means I gave my last breath."""
"""And that I left this world with a great guilt of conscience."""
"""Last time we spoke you said you didn't want to see me again."""
"""You were rightfully angry at me."""
"""I didn't have much to say back then."
"As don't have now either."""
"""After all those years, I know it is too late to--"""
"Okay, I'll read it later."
Thank you for coming here.
- It was my job.
- You did your job successfully.
Kazım Bey...
"I don't know what he told you and in what degree, but... ..."
I have never asked anything from him... ... for neither myself nor my daughter.
- I know.
- As I told him back then as well... ...
I wanted to Cemre for myself.
And that's the best thing I've ever done.
"No money, nothing could match it."
Don't mind him brother.
He is still a child.
His mind works like a child's mind right now.
"As a matter of fact, his mind doesn't work at all..."
I will take his mind in such a way that...
"And he is like this not because of his mind,  but because of electic shock and drugs..."
"Hey, pal..."
Let it go...
Come on...
My brother!
"Yaw Mustafa, see, you make us happy by splitting his head open..."
"Come on, my ram, don't leave us..."
Why don't you say something?
I am going to burst now.
"We went there, sat with him."
We saw him.
His treatment still continues.
Don't jerk me around...
I see Aslan Bey...
He is worn out...
"Take me there to see him, please..."
For God's Sake...
I swear...
"Ok, Bahar Hanim, we go one day."
"But, please be quite a little bit."
I mean... we don't want people to hear it.
"Just a minute Asil, my brother..."
"When Bahar Hanim visited Mustafa in the hospital,  didn't he have a fever and then went into coma?"
"If we take her there, maybe he will remember something."
Eh?
Isn't that possible?
I am his medicine.
Absolutely.
"What do you mean by ""work"", Keung?"
You won't understand!
I'm doing it for love!
Tell me.
I've became a different person ever since I met her.
I've do whatever she ask me to.
She wanted me to find a job.
I found a job.
I've ask her to marry me and she promised!
"Unbelievable, isn't it?"
"You just love her big tits, don't you?"
You jealous?
"Hell, I'm jealous!"
"In the past, I would have boasted myself so much... not anymore!"
I've something for you...
Organic Contribute Form
What?
It's out of your mind?
Read it first!
Ms Lee gave it to me the other day.
She looked at me in my eyes and said...
"""Keung, for guys like you who are in this killing business..."""
"""...life may mean nothing."""
"""But by completing this form..."""
"""...you'll be able to do society some good."""
"""You'll be saving someone's life even after you're dead."""
"""By doing this, you'll make your life worth living."""
This Ms Lee whom Keung's talking about is a social worker.
God knows what she sees in Keung that made her love him.
It's just fuckingly incredible!
"Here she is, doing her endless research!"
"Because well, it's very important!"
Come on...
We're going to Ankara.
"- Perihan, you get prepared, too."
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean you're not coming?
We should be there as a family.
- I am not coming!
"I can't lie, looking in their eyes."
You go.
What are you waiting for!
Go!
And you go find out if it's that journalist who put it on the Internet.
"Go, we're doing all this for you."
It's all in vain...
It's too late.
Everyone will know it by tomorrow.
I don't know how we'll recover from this.
Make a call and sort out the tickets.
So that we depart as soon as we get to the airport.
And tell Perihan not to talk to them.
"If they know we're going, they might refuse us."
"""It's on the news and Internet... ... we've got to talk!"""
They are gone.
They ran away.
"""Münir Telci Law Office."
We can't answer your call right now.
"Please leave your message after the tone."""
"God damn you, Münir Telci."
This is ridiculous.
Throw dirt and hope it sticks.
"You've been doing that to the Yaşarans for years, I know."
The Lord's so lucky.
Look at the things He's getting.
"Earlier, people would keep it in a covered platter.. ..in front of Him."
But now they're feeding Him.
Let Him enjoy.
It's your fault.
"Mumbai just experienced a slight earthquake tremor.. ..of 3.5 Richter scale, which didn't cause.. ..any harm to life or property."
See.
Heard that?
But a shop in the flea market has collapsed.. ..which was closed at that time.
Must be Mohammad's shop.
According to our sources.. ..the shop was registered to Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"It's really surprising, because.. ..there are other old shops in this market which are still intact."
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop has been completely destroyed.
"This is Shweta Tiwari, with cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News."
"Sister, switch on ABP News quickly."
We saw.
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
It's collapsed.
Pravin!
"- Calm down, father."
"No, sister."
Come there with the children.
I'm coming there with father and the others.
- Yes.
"Yes, we're coming."
We're coming.
The idols of Gods have gone underneath.
The shop is completely ruined
Doesn't seem like there was ever a shop here.
What are you saying?
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.
Admit Rajesh in the hospital.
"Boss, where is Jaggu?"
- I have killed him.
And you saved this enemy?
Have you decided to kill your men? - shut up!
The one who locks horn with Tiger singh.. he will be killed.
Do you know war has started in lndia?
This is the golden chance to become rich.
"Gold""s price is going to increase four times. so we will return to lndia today itself. come on."
"To save lndia, donate generously for defence fund."
"Today lndia needs gold desperately. kaka sir, we too need gold desperately."
"Mr. Anwar, come."
- Greetings. come.
"Have a seat. kaka sir, luckily there is a war."
And war is a good chance to make ourselves rich.
And our country is ready to pay any price for gold.
"That""s the misfortune, Mr. Anwar."
I am telling the truth.
I would have given you the gold.
But what to do?
"I don""t have the gold. kaka sir!"
You will get the gold.
Fix the deal with them.
Mr. Anwar!
We have gold worth 7 crores.
What price do you quote?
I am ready to give double the price! - okay!
"But we need opium, cocaine, marijuana."
Where are the goods to be delivered?
Near Lakhaidi island.
Bring the gold.
And take your goods.
I am very happy.
I have invested 14 crores in the movie.
If you had not brought her I would have been doomed.
Take these 10 lakhs.
I dont need 10 lakhs.
Only three lakhs is enough.
"Oh, you do not seem to belong to this age."
He is saying no to money.
I need to send this money urgently to Vizag.
Can you make any arrangements please?
When he is requesting us why do you stare with an open mouth?
Move now.
I will have it done.
Are you looking for Venkat?
- He is upstairs.
He is taking money from the producer for bringing you back.
He must have taken five or 10.. lakhs not thousands.
This is true.
I swear by my mother.
Dont try to cheat me anymore father.
You told me that he threw the ring down.. ..and I stayed away from him believing you.
Now you are telling me that he took money.
Even if he took money they would be the strong reason for it.
I will believe only Venkat and not you.
Why are you backing him?
Do you know how much trouble I took to make you.. ..a heroine?
Will you now go away with him?
What will happen to the movie?
Come with me.
Wait.
Leave her.
I left her.
"Find out what the favor she asked the official, and make sure it gets done."
I can't have another man have a flower that I can't have.
What's going on?
"The people you asked to help you, they came looking for you."
Really?
Sir!
Sir!
She's nowhere to be found!
She's disappeared!
Disappearing to where?
That doesn't make any sense!
"If she fell to here, she couldn't even manage herself properly."
"Now, are you aware of who you are?"
Who are you?
Don't you remember me?
We have seen each other in the palace grounds.
Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
I'm Seol Hye...
I was a colleague of your brother.
Brother Chun-Soo asked you to take care of me?
"Yes, that's right."
"After these events, he himself came to see me."
I think it will be difficult for Dong-Joo.
I'm sorry for delivering such news.
Forgive me for making such a hard request.
No.
I'm so grateful that you've come to me for help.
"If she's his sister, she's like my sister."
"Now, what can I do to help?"
Everything you need is in here.
"If Dong-Yi doesn't make it outside the city, then help that child stay alive."
"What am I gonna do, huh ?"
Broadcast her over the lnternet ?
- Yeah.
- You can do that ?
[ Scoffs ]
No.
I cannot do that to her.
"Jim, get some fuckin' balls."
"If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one ?"
"I don't like the kid, but he's got a point."
"See, even shit-brick knows you should do it."
All you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the 'Net... and tell me the address.
You can send me the address too.
I'll save you a seat.
"- How sweet it is to be loved by you, by you -"
- - I needed the shelter of someone's arms - - - Someone's arms -
"- - There you were - - - You were, oh -"
- I needed someone who understands my ups and downs -
- There you were --**
"Okay, that was good, but I want to thicken-up that solo."
"Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke."
"Yeah, I know, my timing's off."
"No, it's not that."
I think it'll work better as a duet with a tenor part.
I'll do it.
- [ Whispers ]
Dick.
- I'll do it.
Great.
See you tomorrow.
Hmph.
- Why are you doing this ?
"İnşallah, inşallah."
"I mean, I'm not getting out of your livesafter the lawsuit ends."
I told Meryem Hanım as well.
I see you as my family.
I hope our faces will smileafter the trial as well.
We're just leaving the house.
"No, we'll get there in time.Don't worry."
"Okay, will do, my dear."
"Your enişte is saying hello to you.He's already there, waiting at the airport."
- Take care sweetie.- Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Don't pout.You are going away from hell.
- May God be with you.- Have a good trip.
"- There you go, miss."
Your bill.- Thanks.
You're welcome.Have a nice day.
You too.
Doing as I'm told.What else could I do?
"As you said, we delayed the abortion.We'll do it tomorrow."
As if I don't have enough to deal with...
"But I am telling you, Münir.When this is done... ..."
I'll be done with this womanno matter how much money you offer me.
"Okay, okay."
I got it.
When is your trial?
"Okay, call me when it's over though."
You too.
"Who are you?Who are you, God damned man!?"
"- Stop yelling at midnight!- That bastard bought you as well, didn't he?"
God damn it!
You are Münir's man.God damn you!
Please leave this place.
Shailu is mine.
Bhadranna!?
I can die ten times for Shailu.
Can you die once?
"I am ready, what about you?...Are you ready?"
"Uncle, why are you supporting him?"
I called you from vizag to convince him not to support him.
Why are you being hasty?
I will talk to him.
Why do you interact with that rowdy?
What is the necessity that you want the girl he loves?
He wants the girl I love.
Have you seen how arrogantly he is speaking?
Do one thing.
Leave this city and come to Vizag with me.
I will not come.
Dont talk like that.
Why do you want to stay here.. ..and have a dispute with that rowdy.
Why do you try to scare me?
What if he is a rowdy?
What is his specialty?
I am also a rowdy.. .. if anyone tries to interferes in my matter.
Beat me.
I kicked my mother when I was a kid.
She never beat me.
I kicked my father when I have grown up.
He never beat me.
You shouldnt have leaved him brother.
You must have killed him there itself.
What is the need for that?
He only announced that.. ..he can die ten times for her.
"Not to mention, your Jedi friends caused an unspeakable amount of damage!"
The bill must be paid!
"Oo, I have an idea, how about we DON'T pay the bill?"
"Qui Gon, you old piece of shit!"
How are you?
"What's the matter, old buddy?"
You face is crustier than a patch of wookie butt fur!
Gross!
"Whoah, you look terrible"
"Maybe you need a Viagra prescription... ...to turn on your lightsaber, you know what I mean?"
This kid doesn't.
"Seriously though, are you losing your edge or what?"
You're absorbing more abuse than a hutt tampon!
(sorry)
The Qui Gon I knew would have been kicking my teeth in right now.
"Hey, I'm just kidding, it's all in good fun."
Put 'er there!
(laughs)
"Alright now get out of here, you old creep."
Why don't you take this kid with you?
I know you're into that.
"Seriously though, kid, watch out for that guy."
He uh... he has a past.
Look at him.
Such a... bumbling creature.
So foolish.
He's made of so much skin.
I will make him part of us.
Yes!
I will wear his face!
Look how much the others hate him!
Almost as if they wish he was gone.
"And only after that call themselves lndian! very good, dear!"
I am glad to see your patriotism!
Ms. seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. can I expect to have one more meeting with you?
"lf it won""t happen, then it will be my bad luck."
"You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question."
Thanks a lot.
"Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave."
"Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh."
Thank you very much for the nice food.
Yes!
"- Hello! sP Rajesh please! sorry, sir! sP sir is not here!"
There is a gift for him.
You can take it. keep a close watch on all the trucks.. ..passing through Dharampar road.
"What""s your name?"
- A patriot!
Hello!
Today I have nabbed you!
"- What happened, constable?"
You will find out soon! search the truck! okay! - come on!
Why is this truck empty?
"lt""s not a crime to drive empty truck, constable!"
"lt""s a crime!"
This truck is used to deliver goods.
"And it""s a crime to drive empty truck."
"Henceforth I shouldn""t see it empty!"
Got it?
"Let""s go!"
"When I signaled you to stop, why didn""t you stop?"
I am sorry.
"I didn""t see the signal. okay!"
We will find out soon! constables! search the truck and frisk them! sure! sure!
Hey!
"Come on, boy! boy:"
Woman! woman:
[chuckles] Woman!
"Oh, this is gonna be a long day, as most are. boy:"
[groans] woman:
He's always a bundle of joy when he wakes up.
"Come on, come get in the shower, get the day going."
"We got things to do, places to go. boy:"
Yeah. woman:
"People to see, futures to make."
[lighthearted music]
man:
I had a major heart operation.
I'm very thankful to the beautiful staff.
No job is too big or--or too small.
"And even down to a few minutes ago, just wiping my bum, because I had my first-- first poop... [chuckling]"
in about a week or so.
"So one of them came to the rescue and said,"
"""Listen, would you like me to trim that up for you, sir?"""
"So I said, ""Yes."""
"And a very--very, um, courageous young lady in my case,"
"I think, did the job."
"And just, uh, all in a day's work."
[chiming faintly]
"I'm very, very grateful for these people that have treated me like..."
Just treated me so well.
In a short--short while...
"I-I will be on the road to recovery, and I'll be out there again doing crazy things and enjoying life."
[overlapping chatter]
man:
"56, 56...57."
61 Rupees.
"I won""t marry!"
"I won""t marry!"
"Try to understand my helplessness, seema."
Love demands sacrifice.
"Love that doesn""t give sacrifice, that love is not true."
Even I am in anguish!
"But I am compelled to smile. seema, this is want destiny wants."
Forgive me.
"""ls this the reward of my love?"""
"""No, seema."
"Fate is testing me."""
"""Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love."""
"""But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"""
"""What""s my fault?"""
"""I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."""
"""Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."""
"""Who are you to take decision of my destiny?"""
"""lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!"""
"""But I can""t kill my love like this!"""
"""I won""t marry!"
"I won""t marry!"" cheater!"
Betrayer!
How dare you play this dirty prank!
Rajesh!
You were flirting with that girl and now you gave her to me!
"No, Rajesh!"
And you thought that I will marry her.. ..and shoulder your responsibility?
ls this called friendship?
Rajesh!
I can even lay down my life for your friendship!
This is what even I thought!
But now.. now I just want to ask you.. ..why did you thrust that girl on me!
- What?
Go with the police and immediately get shekhar arrested.
"No, no!"
"I can""t do this!"
Then be prepared to go to the prison!
"Ms. kitty, there are only two ways in front of you!"
You can choose any one.
Fine.
I will go with the police. very good! very good! shekhar!
I want my share!
- I too want it!
I too want it!
- I too want it! shut up!
"Tiger doesn""t listen to nonsense!"
And he is not a fool that he will hand over.. ..goods worth lakhs and crores to you all! so that you all fight amongst each other!
Everybody will get their goods when the time is right!
When will that time arrive?
I have been after you for 3 years!
"And you don""t listen to me!"
I made a sale of 15 million pound in your diamond!
And in return..
I will never spare you!
I will never spare you!
"Why don""t you give us our share?"
"Remember! lf our boss found out then he won""t spare you!"
And our boss will follow you!
"You don""t know!"
"He doesn""t like deceit!"
He will not spare you!
He will kill you!
Tiger kills people!
And gradually you will find out whom Tiger wants to kill!
How long has he been here?
You won't believe this but 16 years...
You can find people like him in these kind of hospitals all around Turkey.
Nobody asks about them or visits them...
You can't find their family or relatives if you try to search for them.
"If somebody doesn't take him out of here, he will spend his whole life here."
They get along very well.
Mustafa...
How are you?
It is time for the medication...
Duriye Hanim!
Did you see him?
"Yes, I did Yasar."
Look...
I know that you can't bear your brother's situation.
"In my opinion, he is fighting his conscience and trying to come to terms with what he has done."
And you should let him do it.
"And Yasar, you know this, too."
My brother will not come back to us as long as Narin doesn't come.
That's all I know.
"Yes, Seher..."
What?
My Mom?
Duriye...
What happened Duriye?
"Father, she suddenly fell down."
Seher found her.
"When I heard Seher screaming, I immediately came here Aslan Bey."
It seems to me that her blood pressure went up...
"My Duriye, what will I do without you?"
"Look, don't you play a trick on me!"
Don't...
How could you have come to that conclusion?
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.
Thank you.
I really thought that you hated me.
"Ever since high school, I have only liked you."
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche .
And I can't even cook.
"And I'm not glamorous,"
"But still, I'll try my best."
I'll know to always try my best .
Really?
I'm looking forward to it.
What?
You getting smarter for me...
I'm looking forward to it.
Okay.
"Since the midterms are not that far away,"
That confession...
I'll make sure of it with the test results.
Okay?
Midterms?
But I hate exams.
Is there anyone who likes exams?
"Then, can I get a C?"
C?!
What are you talking about getting a C.
Then C+?
"His words were as mischievous as always, but his smile was a little different from before. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; More than the day I gave him my first love letter, more than the day we first kissed, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I think Baek Seung Jo feels closer to me."
Thank you.
You even walked me home.
It's like a perfect date.
"I won""t let this happen! seema.. leave with the child."
"No, shekhar!"
"I won""t leave you alone!"
I will die with you!
Move her from the way!
- No!
Leave me!
Take her away!
- Leave!
I say leave!
Bhuta singh! shekhar!
John and Pinto have joined hands with kaka sir!
They are supplying the gold to our enemies.
Run!
"Don""t worry about me!"
"Don""t worry about me!"
Bhuta singh! kaka sir!
Prepare the biggest tube.
You will have to go to deliver the gold with John and Pinto.
Gold from all over the world comes in lndia.
"And lndia""s gold goes abroad. kaka sir, syndicate has come to an end."
"Now for which party do we have to deliver this gold? kaka sir, he is dim-witted."
"Till the time he doesn""t.. ..understand everything he won""t work."
"You explain to him. sher khan, the enemy country is paying double for the gold."
Got it?
We will earn four times the profit through international means.
Meaning they will buy weapons with this gold.
"And use it against us in the war. - sher khan! sher khan won""t do this derogatory act!"
"And he won""t let anybody do this!"
I tell you to obey my orders!
- lmpossible!
"This gold is our country""s wealth! our country needs it desperately!"
Some good waltz.
People could waltz.
Back when the older people...
Square dances.
I even knew how to square dance.
Not good.
"By any means, but that was one of the things that you did."
There'd be somebody who could square dance.
Uncle
John did.
That'd be Kay's grandfather.
Uncle John - last name?
Uncle John Gallagher.
And the step dancing - Who would be playing for the step dance?
That'd be Jule and Pat and they'd just
"liven it up, you know..."
Remember any other songs that they'd play?
No.
But the whole family would be there.
Things like that went on in the family. ...
The families were involved in all that kind of stuff.
The Gillespies?
"No, I meant, say you had 3 kids."
"You went with your 3 kids, and one would fall asleep, 3 years old, and the other would run him home or something like that."
It wouldn't be just the - you have to be 18 to go in there.
"Okay, it would be the whole family?"
Sure.
"Yeah, that's great."
It was a good time.
A good time growing up here.
"Riding horses, skiing behind the horses, skiing behind the Model As, the cars."
Sliding down the hill.
Who are you?
Why are you standing there and blocking the entrance?
Please come in sir.
Please have this seat sir.
"This is the house of a poor man, built with a lot of effort."
"Come here, he is Badri, a very famous man."
He has a very big heart.
He is the king of Telangana.
He does not go to anyones home.
He visited only ours.
"She is Shailaja, my daughter."
"Will you get some coffee, my dear?"
She is learning dance.
He brought that rowdy with him.
One scoundrel joined another.
You leave quickly.
What about the coffee?
I will take care of all that.
You leave now.
Otherwise you may not meet that guy.
Why did the young girl become an old woman?
"Sir, coffee!"
Please take it.
She is my mother in law.
But she is more than my mother.
Then why do you make her serve the coffee?
You should have asked your child to do it.
She went to the temple for her prayer.
She should have gone after an hour.
After an hour the priests will close the temple and leave.
My child has a lot of devotion for God.
There is a temple on the side and that side too.
Thank you sweetie.
"Happy birthday, sister.May your face always smile."
"Thank you, abiciğim."
I wish you a happy and healthy life.
Amin.
"- Fatmagülcüğüm, may your wishes come true, my child.- Thank you."
I am glad that you were born.
Thank you.
"Kerim Abi, everyone gave their presents.But we couldn't see yours."
He gave his present yesterday.
"Go on, cut your cake."
You see what happened to you because you didn't listen to me.
You'll do as I tell you from now on.What happened has happened.
It can't be helped.
Your blood will fade from the ground.
But you will be left alone.
It is already decided.Mustafa won't accept you anymore.
Don't cry.
Look.
Don't cry.
I was just outside for a minute.You know how everyone was staring at me?
Like this.
They're talking about you.
They say that it happened with your permission.
"You did it with your own will, they say."
- No...- Shh.
"- There were four people.- Shut up, someone will hear."
I know their faces.They were four.
Stop saying four.One was more than enough to ruin your life.
Mustafa can't help you.But I will.
"I will help you get up.And we'll go home, okay?"
You're not safe here.
"No problem we can do it later too, the important thing is that you know and don't object."
That's my work boat.
Your work boat?
"Very good, then pay it on your own!"
"Okay, Mert, we'll talk later."
"Yaman, come on son, today is the big day."
You are in the last level now.
Ah yes!
-You didn't eat anything.
I ate something
I think these frowning eyebrows are from exam's stress and...
I wish you good luck.- Thank you!
I am leaving!-Aren't we going together? :
"No, no need."
I can go on my own.
I don't want to go all together.
"It can't be, Yaman!"
I have to introduce you to the people from interview.
These things are important son.
Come on!
"I will take my jacket ,Coming..."
Madam we have to do the processing.
Please!
"No, it's impossible!"
"No- Look, don't cause trouble!"
"This can't be like this, you have to inform us first... there has to be done something before."
We sent you the notification.
I am doing my work madam.
Don't interfere please!
Don't cause trouble.
Permit us to enter in.
"Dad we are going to be late, what's happening?- Okay, dear."
"- I will kill him! son.. son, go and inform the police immediately!"
"Don""t let the smugglers escape!"
"Don""t let Raman succeed in his plan."
You all risk your lives!
But.. but.. but the police..
Father! shekhar..
I will go and inform the police.
"You won""t be able to do this!"
Because you all know a lot! so as per our law.. you have no right to live!
You are right!
And you.. traitors have no right to live!
You all are not humans!
"You all are traitors! shut up! otherwise I won""t spare you!"
"Even God can""t stop a person from speaking the truth! shut up!"
No! scoundrels!
"Even if time and law spare you.. ..even if people forgive you.. but God will never spare you! kaka sir.. let""s kill all of them here only."
Why should we commit this sin?
"Why don""t we send all of them to Mr. shebiro""s boat? so that they all will drown."
"There can""t be any person more evil than you!"
Remember!
Your end too will be like this!
You too will drown. shut up!
Take them! come on! come on!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave her!
- Leave her!
You people killed my husband!
Now you want to rape my daughter!
"I can""t see all this!"
Except for the stabbing pain in my side.
"So he was up all night with the high fever, cramping and crying"
Dude!
"My bad, punching the wall all manly and angry like, you know what I mean."
See you later buddy/
Poor Bambi.
Don't worry Carla will take care of.
Make sure he gets submitted right away.
"On the bright side, it will be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient."
You know people die here.
You are a good friend.
I do what I can.
Can I have your stuff?
So did you talk to any girls last night?
"Babe, I'm a attractive man."
We both know this.
It's just a burden you'll have to live with
One of many
JD talked some girl up
"Really, are you gonna call here?"
Not right away.
"Alright, showtime."
Clear out I can check him out.
You're examining me.
I don't want you to see my unmentionables.
I've seen underwear before.
"Actually I use the word ""unmentionable"" for my genitals as well."
68 year-old man respiratory distress and tightness in-
Save your breath.
"Hello, dad."
Never thought you'd call me that again after I left.
Dr. Cox!
We did all the work!
Older Brother...
"Thank you for protecting us, Older Brother."
Thank you for calling me like that.
Will you be... ... happy on behalf of my Hyun?
You're really weepy these days now that you're only half a man.
- Half a man?
"- He's missing half of his balls, isn't he?"
What's life anyway?
"Su Keon, you'll be fine with just half."
"Please take care of yourselves, Hwal Bin Dang."
- What Dang?
- We decided to call you that.
Because you helped us who were poor and powerless.
Hwal Bin Dang?
Is that our name now?
"That's so cool, isn't it?"
- It doesn't sound too bad.
- Let's make a flag with our new name!
Whatever...
Hwal Bin Dang?
How burdensome!
- But that's what people are calling us.
- Who cares what people say?
"- We're just thieves, that's all."
- But doesn't it feel good to have a name?
It does have a nice ring to it.
"Now that we have a name, let's go have a party!"
We have to get home safely first.
The police are still everywhere.
"When it gets dark, we'll scatter and leave the city."
We'll reconvene again in the mountain retreat.
I'm a public official.
I feel it's my responsibility to be as frank as possible
"You know, if this truth thing catches on###, I'm gonna be out of a job. are you going to continue having sexual cooper, even while she's still working for you?"
We've never had sex
Yeah right
No really it's true
I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman Ms. Cooper.
It's almost lunch time Paul
How are you feeling
Get out.
I'm over you
"You know, you want it"
"I've got a perfectly good egg salad sandwich, all right?"
It's got everything you want.
Except meatballs
"Okay, you're fine."
Don't even think about it
Put it out of your head###
Meat
Ball
Shut up
All of you shut up
"Look, sir, this is an easy fix."
All you gotta do is go back out there and tell them the truth
I told them the truth
"Yeah, but it wasn't the truth they wanted to hear, so to them it's a lie."
I lied? it's only a lie if you don't say it.
Say what the truth
Whose truth
Theirs
I thought I'd die from hunger.
Ha-seok!
I've something to tell you.
What?
Slow down.
I've got tons to say too.
"Let's eat first, then talk."
You said you were hungry.
Sook-hyun!
"Try this, it's great."
Once a fireman rescued a girl from a blaze.
"Everyone else gave up on her, but he charged in like a madman."
"The fireman and the woman, they survived against crazy odds."
"So the fireman and the girl started dating, right?"
"No, he dated her sister."
She was the woman of his dream.
Aren't you glad to see me?
"I keep doing sign language, so I forget how to speak."
"I remember how to say it with my hands, but not with words."
It stays at the tip of my tongue.
"But there are words that even if I remember,"
I can't say.
Maybe I just wanted to hear it from you first.
"I have something to say too, but not here."
"This isn't a sky lounge, and there's no wine."
I can't treat you like a princess.
Hey hey!
What's going on here?
You shouldn't use public equipment for these purposes.
Can our model fireman act in this way?
Give us an explanation.
"OK, stick closer."
Today we came to another airport.
We'll finish filming and enjoy our time in NYC.
NY fans are coming too.
NY style is supposed to be absolutely cool.
So we tried to be casual
Not to seem over-conscious.
This is NY.
It's unbelievable that I'm walking the streets of New York.
I can't believe it.
I received a business card.
He says he's a rapper in America.
He gave me a business card.
We finished off with a wonderful scene of America.
I was sitting over there and people started talking to me.
I couldn't understand them.
"We're in Manhattan, New York."
"The sun is shining, buildings are beautiful."
"I just really love this free, peaceful atmosphere."
"Most of all, the sunlight is the best here."
We wrapped my MV filming in NY well too. other members will film too.
I'm going to enjoy my free time.
I'm in NY.
"Wow, it's so great."
All the passersby's are awesome too.
The reason why filming is fun is not only because we show our new looks
But also because we come to new places.
It's awesome.
The sun just went down.
Boo hoo.
It really is America.
None
There are yellow taxies passing by.
I am coming....
Here.. drink...
I threw my beautiful daughter into the fire with my own hands.
She had so many opportunities!
I fell under the spell of this huge mansion.
"But, now, I am in pain inside."
My daughter has no more tears left from crying so much.
This fire is going to consume me and you..
"Look, Naciye... you look like this, but.. ... you are a mother, too."
How do I look?
Frizzy haired Naciye from Odakli Village..
"Look, idiot.."
"Pay for the soda, then leave... is this a charity house?"
Here.. if only your soda had some flavor!
"Rude, insolent!"
Idiot!
Thank you.
"Ya, Yasar..?"
Is he still not using anything?
"That is, Mustafa, in that condition?"
"Look, I am going to say something, but..."
"Maybe, Mustafa is faking?"
This is Mustafa Bulut we are talking about!
"Medicines, needles, mean nothing to this man!"
"Abi, I told you, I saw it with my own eyes!"
The man doesn't recognize any of us!
Don't you think I would know from his gaze?
Of course!
Why would he fake this?
"Well, maybe he is trying to guilt you all, because you put him in the nut house."
"It's possible, isn't it?"
"You can go tomorrow, and see for yourself, then!"
I paint the rhinoceros
"Si, you have sad eyes"
"And big lips, melting over the hot sand"
With one tear
"Yes and in your tear, another face"
"The Christ face, yes"
"For the zillionth time, Dad, I'm an adult."
You don't have to stalk me.
"Georgia, I said I'm dropping you off."
"Now, just take off that shell and get in the car."
"Dad, my costume is the business."
I don't want it to get crushed.
"You look fantastic, love."
I just don't want you walking around the streets on your own.
Do you have any idea how long it took to get this right?
I have to make an entrance.
What's that?
And what are you supposed to be?
An obese leprechaun?
Anyone can see I'm a stuffed olive.
Stuffed is right.
"What happened to you, Ellen?"
You were supposed to come as a cocktail sausage.
"Well, my mum said no, her being a vegetarian and all."
Jas?
Cheese and pineapple stick?
"Well, the cheese made me look fat and yellow washes me out."
I didn't know how to be a vol au vent.
But we said we'd all go as hors d'oeuvres to be original.
It was supposed to be a laugh.
But boys don't like girls for funniness.
"- Sorry, Georgia."
Whatever will happen will happen.
I don't care anymore.
Then everyone will know that it's an arranged marriage and you took money for it.
This and everything will be revealed to public.
And then not even my uncle and Münir Abi can save us.
Then we'll all end up in prison.
Kerim...
Do you have any idea what it means to go to prison as a rapist?
Who do you think is responsible for the news?
"Hey, could it be your Ebe Nine?"
Who else could have gotten suspicions and spoke with that newsman?
- Maybe it's Galip Usta.
- Of course...
- Galip Usta is good friends with Newsman Ahmet.
- And he hates us.
I bet it's your Galip Usta told him everything.
I bet it's him.
"Oh, Kerim..."
Don't know...
Maybe it's someone else.
"I mean, it can be anyone."
There were mixed thoughts regarding the incident.
- So it can be anyone...
"- Anyway, it's okay."
It doesn't matter now.
We need to be careful from now on.
"If they reach you and try to make you talk... ... you shouldn't give them anything, no matter how hard they try, you understand?"
"Or else, we will all be toast."
It'll ruin us all.
- Who is it?
- Vural.
Don't answer it.
- Find her quickly!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Try and stand up.
You should act more like a lady.
You got hurt because you involved yourself with thieves.
But it's fun.
You must think this is fun because you've never been hurt before.
But it's not fun if you're really hurt.
"Yes, I've never been hurt before."
Because I never got involved in anything.
Now you know that you can get hurt if you get involved in things you don't know about.
Just live like you normally live.
I let you do all this because I thought you knew where your boundaries were.
But you crossed that boundary today.
But I was worried about you.
That's crossing the boundary.
You can't come any closer.
Go back behind your boundary.
You're smart so you should understand.
Yes.
I understand very well.
Then go home.
Hong Gil Dong!
"Because of you, I hurt myself for the first time."
But I don't mind being hurt for you.
That's because you've never been badly hurt before.
I'm scared of the pain.
"But if I'm that scared, then perhaps I should stop."
- Don't come to the mountain again.
- Then come here in two weeks.
I'll wait for you.
For the last time.
- Mukaddes!
"- It's OK abi, no need to hurry."
"Sorry, my wife is coming now."
Good morning.
"I can understand how you feel, really."
I've met all kinds of people and situations in this profession.
I found cure to many wounded men.
"I will help you, too."
Yes.
I will help you.
"For instance, I won't file a complaint about you."
You broke into my house in the morning.
You almost suffocated me.
These are big crimes.
But I won't report you.
Thank you very much.
"Look, you go now and pull your mind together."
- And quit messing with Reşat Yaşaran.
- I am still not convinced though.
It'd be stupid of you to have him against you.
"- He is a man, whose hand you want on your back."
"- I'm fine, thanks."
You know what he said when he first heard of that incident?
"He said ""poor guy""."
"""Watch over him, don't let him ruin his own life."""
- What is it to him?
- That man works for this town!
Don't tell me bull shit!
"Look son, this man is so powerful."
Not only in this town...
He has a great empire in Istanbul.
You know how many people are working for him?
"One must not die, but kill."
One must kill.
He is not an idiot.
But he made me an idiot before everyone.
"Hey, dont cry."
It does not matter whether this coward lives or dies.
"You, old woman!"
Put the marriage mark on my face.
Hello!
Bhadranna!
Tell me what the matter is.
I am coming to Hyderabad.
If you make a single phone call.. ..I will send the entire Hyderabad to you.
Why do you need to come? - Because I need to kill a person.
Why do you take the trouble?
Tell me who he is and I will have him killed in an encounter.
No.
I must hack him to death in the open street.
"Okay, if you wish let it happen that way."
Before I finish my work and return to Warangal.. ..they should be no report of any activity in Hyderabad.
There should be no law and order.
"Okay, as you wish."
See you later.
"Look here DCP, for 24 hours.. ..ignore any incident that happens in the city."
- Ok.
"Hey, leave us."
Is it true that someone kidnapped her?
"No, that is not correct."
She twisted her ankle and was in hospital.
She will not give any interview now.
Go away.
"My boy, have you come?!"
Let's do it again.
- All right.
Last and final tour of the lmperial Drama and Comedy Theatre soloist.
What markets there used to be in those rich lands!
And now?
Nothing but freedom.
Got to pull in your belts under the new chief.
Orders are to trade and be jolly.
No peaceful sleeping these days.
"I'm telling you, my dears:"
Empty your storehouses before you have them emptied for you.
"Come and see, Granny!"
It's our last performance.
I'm just passing through.
I'm leaving tonight by the last horse.
"Back home to Odessa, city of songs and chestnuts."
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"I sing my songs, I think, alright."
"I sing to the left, I sing to the right,"
The public always finds My songs a delight.
And why so?
Because...
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"There's rumours afloat, The old women say"
You can hear the cock At break of day:
Cockadoodledo!
"I'm Buba Kastorsky, Maker of original songs."
"I see my cow, Nyurka, and a piece of paper on her horn."
"It said: "" Here's your cow, Aunt Darya."
Don't fear.
"We'll get the bandits! """
Their sign is the cuckoo's call and the cock's answer.
Awesome.
You'd do that for me?
"Yeah, I would."
"First you have to get your audition tape put together, and, uh, Mr. Collins has final say."
Don't worry about the camera.
"I normally only loan it out for a couple of days, but for you, you can keep it for as long as you want it."
Thanks.
Let me know if there's ever anything I can do for you.
Good luck on your audition tape.
I hope we'll be working together soon.
Count on it.
"What are you gonna do for your audition tape, Liz?"
I'm not sure yet.
Something with substance.
"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I want to be the director."
How hard can it be?
I choreographed all our best cheers this year.
I'm sure I can handle a little news show.
"Hello, future fans and news junkies."
Make room for Sweet Valley's new Barbara Walters.
Since when are you interested in journalism?
Journalism?
It's TV news.
"Easy, Babs."
You have to research and write your own stories.
"Details, details."
It's a small price to pay for having my face in every classroom.
"Hey, Winston!"
What's up...
Patman?
"Now, why so suspicious?"
"""Winston""?"
"That would work, as well."
Doctor?
How is Mustafa Bulut?
"He isn't very well, right now."
"But, it is still early."
- He will get better.
- How can he get better?
"Is the technology to make him well discovered in this world, yet?"
"For me, I think he has found the perfect place for himself!"
They should leave him alone.
"Really, it was because of you, Doctor!"
"Thanks, to you!"
"Really, thanks!"
You don't know what it is to live under those conditions.
We wanted him to go there for treatment.
"So, that he gets better and gets out."
We have no other agenda.
"Okay, my dear... drink this.."
Isn't it a hospital?
He is there to get well.
Your husband is going to get better and come home.
You can't carry on like this.
"But, Mom, what can I do?"
"How can I bear this, Mom?"
"Go to sleep, my daughter."
"Come, sleep."
Pray to God.. it will give you strength.
"Hey, Naciye... look for second.."
"Don't mess with me, Safiye..."
I will tear your hair out!
"You crazy idiot, aren't we from the same village?"
"I just called over to have you drink a soda, relax, tell me your trouble... come.."
Editorial staff.
"So those would, those would be my two concerns."
Yeah.
That's a good a good point a good tip.
And the opportunity to review is a good way to learn also.
Absolute.
As an author.
Absolutely.
So Yeah.
Yeah so.
Great.
Is there any parting thoughts or tips that you want to offer to the class?
"No, I think we've covered [laugh]"
Great.
"You're questions are so, you're questions are so good that you've covered everything that I might want to say."
"Thank you so much for, for taking the time to speak with us Gary."
You're very welcome.

I can't wait til Złotopolscy (boring soap opera)  comes back.
Or Big Brother.
In the morning I'd like to see  more people in public transport.
I understand that you have  different political views.
I respect that.
There should be more billboards  in the city centre.
Wow!
Those roads are great!
What happened?
What happened?
"He's saying, there are broken idols of God on that land.. ..so it's become inauspicious."
The place has become cursed.
"- Oh, God!"
No one will buy this land.. ..that's the rumour in the market.
Nimish.
"100 years later, when people find.. ..idols of God under that land, the prices will shoot up by 4 times."
Four times.
And people will construct a temple there as well.
lf anyone wants the buy the land he can.. ..otherwise I care a damn.
What now?
I've an idea.
"What are you doing, Kanji?"
Suicide!
"Sister-in-law, suicide.."
Papa. - kahan kahan?
Leave me.
What are you doing?
- Papa..
I am not a coward.
I will file a case.
Have you lost it?
He's gone crazy.
You will file a case against an insurance company.. ..worth 3000 crores!
I'm sure there are many others like you.. ..who have filed a case against the insurance company.
There must be others like me who might have filed a case.. ..but no ever filed a case against your Kishen.
I...will...file a case against your God.
"What are you doing? "" Who controls this world? """
""" Who's that sitting high up in the sky? """
""" Why are You hiding behind the clouds? """
""" Why are You afraid of being seen? """
That's fantastic.
"I'm gonna get a lovely frame on that,"
'cause Nina's got a frame like that.
[laughs]
"That's really cool, Jack."
Thank you.
"Now, you should be very proud of yourself, Jack, considering you almost got chucked out of school."
"You was lucky there, weren't you?"
"Yeah, you've matured, actually-- actually, in the last year or so quite good into a real proper lad, a real gentleman and a nice boy."
[engine turning]
"Thanks for that, Jack."

It has everything.
It is a giant library.

Why do you keep looking behind you?
- I look to see if anyone's following.
- Barış is right.
This has been an obsession in you.
You need to relax.
"Nothing as it look, Zeynep."
He still wants to kill me.
Who?
Barış.
He will not rest until he gets rid of me.
"Do you hear what you say, Burak?"
You don't know Barış.
He is so dangerous.
He killed Ferhat.
He's the one who put the gun in my car.
He also sabotaged my car.
Did you tell this to the police?
"No, because I need to find an evidence first."
"That is, if he doesn't kill me before."
"No, that will not happen."
"Don""t worry, sir."
Friendship is nothing compared to duty. very good!
This is what I expected from you.
Now you can declare him a criminal.
"And declare a reward of 50,000 rupees on his arrest. okay, sir."
- Thank you!
All the best!
How come you all are here today?
What has brought you here?
"What""s the matter, Mr. Diwan?"
- Where is shekhar?
I dismissed him a long time ago.
"But what""s the matter? shekhar has disappeared with gold worth 7 crores."
Gold worth 7 crores!
"Well done, shekhar!"
Great!
"You have served our country well! served? constable, our country needs gold desperately! our country could have got gold worth 7 crores! shekhar should receive a reward for this deed!"
"Bhuta singh, you too are misunderstanding!"
- How so?
You brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
But when did I bring it?
Just assume that you brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
- How will you make the payment?
By giving the goods.
- How much?
"For gold worth rupees 100, I will sell it at 200. so it""s a loss to the country."
Goods worth 100 came in.
"And goods worth 200 went out. constable, how can this be a loss to the country?"
The gold entered the country for free.
That is what I am asking.
Where is that gold?
"That is the problem, constable."
Think logically.
"Because logically.. - Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa."
What is this?
You were supposed to explain to Bunty about marriage and not logic.
"Don't change the topic, Tanya."
"Sir, you were saying something extremely important."
Please go ahead.
"We can.. - Yes, yes."
We can see the alpha Changeli.. ..which is four light years away from us.
We don't look at it the way we should.
But we look at it just as it looked four years ago.
Correct?
- Correct.
The star called Turios that we see.
We see it like it was nine years ago.
We don't watch it..
By the way.. do you look at your face in the mirror?
Yes!
Every hour.
That isn't fresh either.
Its 10 nanoseconds old.
Tell me.. if you get an opportunity to go back into the past.. ..which mistake would you rectify?
My mom and dad's marriage.
"Yes, Grandpa, this is the topic."
Marriage.
Now ask him why refuses to marry me.
"Yes, why don't you want to get married?"
I am scared.
It's just an excuse.
If you have the courage to fall in love.. ..then you should be prepared for marriage as well.
Logically you should marry Tanya.
Stop saying that.
I'll bet we could really swing down there.
Just the three of us.
You and me... and all that money.

"Hey, Frank, look."
"Watch yourself, Glenn."
"Look, Mom."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Frank, is he hurt?"
It might be a broken arm.
He's probably sprained his ankle too.
"Oh, Glennie, I've told you a dozen times about that wall."
"Come on, partner, you get a free ride."
"I'll, uh..."
I'll call the doctor.
No wonder the world is left with on more virgins.
I've more class than the rest of them all.
Very high sounding!
"Your figure isn't too bad, though."
I can see that you have a hard on.
Have you made up your mind?
"If you want to do it, act fast before my mon returns."
What?
You're telling me to do it here?
You want to do it in the corridor?
Stop pulling my leg.
Who's calling the shots here?
You'd better find out.
I've never counted how many wet dreams I'm used to having.
I come twice that night.
...which made it a bad night for me.
Set the toxic fire.
The net.
Chief...
"If you try anything else, I'll blow the whistle, and the little snake will take a tour inside, and then emerge from your head."
Do you think you'll be alive?
"Hurry, get them out!"
"Let us go first,"
I won't fall in your trap.
"If I let you go, you won't help me."
I don't trust you either.
"What about this,"
"let Master Tuan go, he knows no martial arts."
No.
How can I leave you?
"Don't try to be a hero,"
Find Xiang Yaocha to save me.
Last week.
"Look, I'm just trying to change the world, okay?"
I don't have time for a grudge match with every poser in a parka'.
Besides there's kids in that park so...
Here's one from dead-not-sleeping.
"Long time watcher, first time writing."
Blah blah blah blah.
"""You always say in your blog that you will show her the way,"" show her you're a true villain."
Who is her?
And does she even know that you're...
Laundry day...
See you there.
Under things... tumbelling.
Wanna say...
"""Love your hair"""
Here I go... mumbling.
With my freeze ray I will stop...
The world.
With my freeze ray I will find the time to find the words to...
Tell you how...
How you make... make me feel.
What's the phrase?
Like a fool.
Kinda sick.
Special needs.
Anyways... with my freeze ray I will stop...
The pain.
"It's not a death ray or an ice beam, that's so Johnny Snow."
I just think you need time to know that I'm the guy to make it real.
The feelings you don't dare to feel.
I'll bend the world to our will.
And we'll make time stand still.
What do you think she's makin'?
Looks like a dress.
"Well, that makes sense."
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Is there something I can help you with?
"Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor."
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
You can't wear this... old thing.
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.
And I'll make it for you.
No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!
"Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that."
It would be so much work.
This dress is fine.
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.
-But...
"-No no, not a word!"
I won't take no for an answer.
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you for your generosity, Rarity."
"Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
"Let me guess, Applejack."
You don't want a new gown either.
Gown?
Shoot.
I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
"You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!"
You absolutely must wear formal attire.
Two months.
He says the kid hugged you.
So?
Nothing but a lousy gardener.
But he's alive.
Pryor might not want a dead man on his conscience.
"Yeah, what does he care?"
What he did to me.
He sits on his pennies.
"Yeah, what have we got to lose?"
Some money is better than no money.
All you gotta do is make another phone call.
"Well, if you won't do it, I will."
"All right, all right."
"You're in luck, Frank."
We're gonna trade you in.
"Ordinarily, I wouldn't have asked you to drop by, Lieutenant."
Probably just a crank call.
Something else happened this morning that disturbed us.
"Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Pryor."
What was it that disturbed you?
"Well, we found one of our cars down the road."
"It was abandoned, the key still in the ignition."
Stolen?
"No, nothing like that."
Our gardener was bringing it back from town.
"Look, it's probably just a false alarm."
I think he got bored with this job and took off.
Frank would have told us.
He's a responsible man.
"My wife has great faith in human nature, lieutenant."
She should have been a social worker.
"That'll be ten marks, about t---"
"This scoudrel took off without paying,"
He just upped and left.
Sacramentum what a redhead.
He didn't take off.
I was just trying if your powder is the real thing.
Here's your money.
"Thank you, thanks a lot!"
"Just like that, excellent!"
Would you like anything else.
"Nothing else, thanks, except that you stop calling me a redhead behind my back."
"Goodbye, I'm off."
Goodbye
Come back again.
"Hey, redhead!"
"Here, take this suitcase to the teacher's apartment."
Now I'm out of breath.
"Oh my god, where did this brat disappear to."
That must have been a stone from under a car tyre.
The doorbell is ringing.
The doorbell is ringing.
"Oh how long I was waiting for you, darling."
Dear teacher.
My master dear.
Why do we meet so rarely.
How nice it is that school has breaks.
We can spend the entire break together.
"When we'll be together all the time for all our lives, we'll bear the good and the bad things together."
Take a seat on the sofa.
What a lovely sofa.
And now we'll have a cup of hot coffee together.
Are you tired from the long winter
Pictures come out incredibly well.
I want to use this for Jong Up's album cover.
This is the puppy from a little while ago.
The states sure do seem really good.
None
He's walking a dog bigger than himself.
Good.
The sunlight is definitely working it.
The sunlight is making me look 150% better.
"Right now, the sun is really high up."
I think I'll get to film when the sun's about to set.
I can tell you one thing.
My character's concept is to read a book while waiting for someone.
It doesn't really match my personality.
That's my concept for the shoot.
Let's go for it!
"Stand there, just stand there."
Stand!
Come this way a little bit.
That's not it.
I don't know how to use the camera.
This is just all picturesque.
I'm a celebrity but I don't like to get dressed up.
Usually...
I don't like wearing make-up I don't like putting on hairspray.
I don't like fancy clothing either...
I don't think I'm meant to be a celebrity.
None
I don't think dressing up is all that nice.
I'm not a foxy guy.
I'm more like a bear.
Nice.
A man came by here earlier today.
He said it was wooden buckshot.
"Told me if anyone got in our way,"
I'm supposed to shoot 'em.
What else did he say?
If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins...
I'm supposed to shoot myself.
What about me?
What did he say about me?
I'm not supposed to hurt you.
Are you sure?
Because...
These ropes are so tight that it is hurting me.
What can I do to help?
"Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me."
I can feel it scraping against my heart.
You need to get the pieces out.
Aahh!
What took you so long?
I've been hiding behind your witchy friends.
"And in squalor, no less."
Insulting a bunch of dead witches...
Not smart.
I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
"Well, you know the funny thing about the witches is that living or dead, they care about their own."
A hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents...
And I have no problem killing every last one of them if I don't get my coffins back.
"As we speak, my hybrid friend is prepared to end the Bennett line."
Now.
Please...
Show me the coffins.
Here we are.
Whose car's out front?
That's mine.
I'm Bonnie.
Your daughter.
"Hello, Bonnie."
How do you know this is going to work?
It's a process.
It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion.
The brain's like a muscle.
"The more you use it, the more it can do."
"A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing..."
Gratitude.
"If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why."
I was cursed.
"Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf."
It was torture.
Klaus took that away.
Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him.
"To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn."
"Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free."
But how can he turn?
It's not a full moon.
He doesn't need one.
"You're a hybrid now, right?"
"I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right?"
"Yeah, but I don't know how to just...Start."
Now you're making excuses.
You don't understand!
"When I turn, I break every bone in my body."
You asked for my help.
This is the only way.
How badly do you want your freedom?
Nah.
What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
"Okay, sure."
Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
Deal!
Look out below!
Sorry.
New trick.
Didn't quite work.
Idea!
"I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Outfit for the what now?
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
Oh!
And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.
"Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.
"Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business."
"Plus, fun!"
"Oh, I love fun things!"
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.
"So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original... ...amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies?"
And lickety split?
"Oh, Applejack."
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
"Thread by thread, stitching it together"
Twilight's dress Cutting out the pattern snip by snip
Making sure the fabric folds nicely
Bite its throat and suck up the blood.
"Suck up the blood, and you will be powerful."
"I heard that you've been wearing a veil, not letting anyone to see your face."
"If someone sees you, you'll either kill him or marry him;"
Is that true?
Yes.
Great.
"Now, remove the veil, and let me have a look."
"Hurry, if you don't,"
I'll strip you naked.
You're the first man who has seen my face.
"I could only marry you, since I won't kill you."
You're my husband.
So pretty.
"After I've killed him, and you can be a merry widow."
You saw that?
"If you dare to touch me, he'll kill you."
Who cares!
The Red Python is dead
Who killed it and sucked up all its blood?
I did.
Great.
The Red Python lives in the hills.
"It feeds on ginseng, and the deer antlers."
"After thousands of years, its colour has turned red."
"Whoever drinks its blood, exercises internally, and he will acquire ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
This is good news.
I know martial arts.
What are you laughing at?
"The ""Red Dragon Soul"" won't hurt me."
All I have to do is suck up your blood.
Then I'll be invincible.
You don't know him.. but..
"If his hand stayed still, his arm would not.."
"If his arm didn't work, his mouth would.."
Look at his condition...
I understand.
"It is difficult for you all, too."
"But, Mustafa Bulut has given up on the real world, even without the effects of the medication."
"This is the most difficult time for us, as well."
He will heal faster if those close to him come and spend time with him here.
"What are you saying, Doctor?"
"Of course, we will come!"
We are childhood friends!
"Everything we eat, drink has been together."
Do you think I would abandon my brother?
Why don't you sit down?
Why are you acting like a stranger?
Of course she is not a stranger!
Gulengul is our daughter.
Our big family... ... this is all we have...
"Ah, my son... look at us.."
My beautiful Mother... don't worry yourself so.
He is going to be happy again...
He is going to mess with us when he returns..
Just wait...
Hasan...
"Aslan Bey ordered somethings, Yasar Abi."
Enjoy your food.
"Come, sit with us..."
"No, my mother wanted somethings..."
I am going to go home.
The poor woman is by herself.
Let me help Hasan.. With your permission..
I have no idea.
Finch showers with his bathing suit on.
"I mean, uh--"
"As a matter of fact, it is true."
The guy's huge !
- Does he have a date for the prom yet ?
"- No, definitely not."
All right.
Thanks.
"Oh, man !"
"So I was thinking maybe you could give me some advice, brother to brother."
I thought you might know a trick or somethin' to make her--
- Orgasm ?
- Yeah.
- What's good here ?
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What ?
- How do you do that ?
"- Hey, never mind that."
"Listen, pay attention."
"Is that all that you're interested in, tryin' to get your girl into bed ?"
"No, it'd be good to be able to, you know, return the favor."
Be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
See that ?
That's good.
That's what I wanted to hear.
"Now, you qualify."
- Qualify for what ?
"- My man, you've just inherited the Bible."
"It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam."
And each year it got passed on to one East student who was worthy.
"Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff that guys have added over the years."
Nooooooo.... of course not!
"We like people with big hearts, not big houses..."
Like you all....
"But, we can't continue like this..."
"Yes, yes, you can... and, you are company for my mother, as welil..."
Don't let anyone trouble themselves for now...
"I am leaving, Mom."
"- If you need anything for this evening, call, okay?"
"- Okay, my dear."
"See, how well she is talking???"
She got her voice back!
"Bravo, Doctor, Bravo!!!"
"You couldn't take my son's life, but you took away his mind."
"Did you hate us, this much, eh?"
Mustafa doesn't even know his own mother!
Is your conscience clear?
It is normal.
"How can this be normal, Doctor?"
"It has only been a week, and my brother doesn't recognize any of us!"
"Right now, he is going through an intense treatment and medication program."
"Because, he refused to eat, we have hooked him up to an I.V."
We need time to see the results of the medication.
"So, what are we to do, then?"
"Don't worry, and be patient."
He is going to get well.
Don't reduce your visits.
Come often as possible.
Spend time together.
It will be good for him.
"Would you like to go to a doctor, Duriye?"
No..
I don't want to..
Everything I worked hard for is happening.
Isn't that part I'm supposed to be happy
Hail
Hey Daddy
First day of your sophomore year.
You're growing up too fast
"Brook, you start making your old man look old"
"Listen, when I get back, what do you say we stop by doctor you know just to touch base##."
It's been a while since we've seen him.*
"Daddy, I'm fine."
I don't need to say him
I stopped by the store on the way home picked up the requested item*
"Dad, I told you..."
I use the kind with wings.
"But these came with , i thought you'd like that."
How long are you gonna be gone this time?**
I'm gonna reorganize the clients' portfolio in New York.
I should be back on Sunday.
I left all the phone numbers with Clara*
I just wanted to go to my routine with you
Are you cutting classes?
My cheerleading routine.

"So Calvin, but hi, Brooke mutual admiration society is screeching to a dead halt*"

Quick recovery.
Thank Godyou're good.
Who's in?
He would not say who it is.
"I hope it is not a false statement,I woke up in the middle of the nightcome here!"
search and browse!
"We found it ,Mr. Prosecutor! bravo"
Issue an order to the police stationfor whoever rented this store.
"At your command,sir."
"Mr. Mahir,Did you see who shot you?"
"Yes, his faceis engraved on my memory."
Can you describe him?We'll find it for sure.
"It was dark, boy hasAbout thirty years cheeks and eyes, skinny, and his eyebrowsdark prominent."
That's it.
Right.Do you know this man?
I do not know...I can not remember...
Can you remembersomething else ?
"Mahir just woke up,"
"Leave it to rest,let it bother."
"Brother Yassine,There is another thing,arrest warrant."
I've seen...
"Mahir, all these peopleneed to put handcuffs on your hands,they have a warrant, you're under arrestuntil the court hearing."
let them dowhat they should do.
I apologize ..
"If we know somethingabout who shot you,we'll let you know. thanks"
"Thanks, Atif."
thanks
Who wanted to kill you?Who is this bastard?
Describe it to meI will find him and punish!
"I saw his face,"
"I said to myselfI know this man, but where..."
"But where,I can not remember..."
I am sure of that.
I can tell that Kazım Bey wants to do something for her... ... we appreciate it but.
We don't want it.
I think you shouldn't make your decision now.
Think of it as your father's last wish.
No.
We thank you but.
I can't accept that either.
Because he's never been my father.
"I just named this big void in my life ""father""."
I will never forgive him because he didn't try to fill this void.
I'll never forgive him for trying to ease his conscience with a piece of paper.
But I will not wish him ill.
So he doesn't need to worry.
- I can understand your anger.
- No you can't.
"This is not anger, mom."
"It's not hatred, disappointment or anything."
"- I know, sweetheart."
"- I mean, I never had a father."
And there never will.
Please you close this subject not to be opened again.
The decision is yours.
I feel much lighter now.
I won't have to lie to anybody anymore.
I can say my father really died.
My dear child.
Did I wake you up?
"No, I gotta go anyway."
"Oh, why?"
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
"No, I'll go to work."
Can I come in?
"- Our Father, who art in heaven..."
- Emily?
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs? - as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread...
"Emily, can you hear me?"
Let's get her off the floor.
"Alice, no!"
"You've suffered a terrible loss, Mr. Rose."
I know this is difficult.
So thank you for being here today.
"Sir, do you often read the Bible?"
"- Yes, I do."
- So do I.
What about the DSM?
The *Diagnostic and Statistical* *Manual of Mental Disorders*... ...commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.
- Have you read that?
- No.
So you're not aware that according to the DSM... ...a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
Objection.
"The witness just said he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor."
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose... ...are you aware that catatonic rigidity... ...specifically a locking up of the body's joints... ...is a known symptom of psychosis?
No.
I haven't studied these things.
Have you ever visited an insane asylum... ...or a hospital for the mentally ill?
Once.
My aunt was in one before she died.
Really?
So there's a history of mental illness in your family?
I suppose.
- Who is Münir?- Don't play dumb!
You did it just to keep me away from that trial.
- Gather yourself !- I wrecked my home for you!
- God damn you.
"- Stop it, you will wake everyone up!"
Get your hands off me!You sold out jerk!
Damn you!
"- Shut up or I will --- Go on, hit me!"
- Damned bootlicker of the rapists.- What?!
God damn you.
You killed meto save the lives of three rapists !
"Wait, wait..."
What?Who the hell am I saving?
Explain it to me.
"Hay Allah, ya...Those bastards tricked me."
Motherf*ers!
Are you any different than them?
How could you do this to me?
I swear on anything you want me to.
I didn't know about it.
I asked him many times.He said it was a land lawsuit.
He didn't tell me the truth.
That pimp!
I would spit on his faceif I knew the truth.
And would this take away the guilt from you?
Whether you knew the truth or not... ... makes you less guilty?
But the stupidity is on me.
"I let you trick me again,although I knew what you were."
Despite what you put me throughI fell for you again.
I apologize so much.
You shot me down really bad this time.
I don't remember feeling more humiliated in my life.
We gave people material for 5 years of gossip.
Does it hurt?
Slowly...
"Easy, easy..."
Slowly...
I can go on my own..
Okay.
I don't have a white horse but I saved you with my white car.
I am ready to help you whenever you want.- Thanks again!
"Use your mind, don't be stupid as me."
"It doesn't matter if he is handsome, tall..."
The important thing for one man is to have so much money that it would not end because of his stupidity.
This is my number.
Don't lose it please!
Let me know how you are.I will be worried...
"Okay, Thank you."
"Otherwise your life will pass decreasing, you look and you see that youth belongs to the past..."
Are you better sweetie?- I am very well.
I elicited to the girl.
"I told her she two faced hypocrite and so on... she took care of her friend all night, my flower."
She called me unbalanced...
"""Unbalanced"" ."
My sweetie.
"She is very beautiful ,even when she gets angry..."
Don't!
Open it!
Don't close it!
I'll lick the window and you will have to clean it again.
Don't do it man!
Eylül calling.
Yes.- I came to the building today but you took flights.
I got your phone number from the foreman.
What's her damage?
No damage.
"Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life."
"A girl that hot, that smart...Damage."
"Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags."
"Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day."
"Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count."
I guess you're right.
It's yours.
I wonder what my exes would call me.
Nothing.
They're all dead.
Hmm.
"Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent."
She dated the medical examiner?
Mm-hmm.
"Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent."
I think he's just dead.
What?
Murdered.
Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
"Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that."
"Well, red flag number two."
Who do you think killed him?
I don't know.
"But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect."
"What are you doing here, Klaus?"
Enjoying our stalemate.
What do you want?
"Question is, what do you want?"
"My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back."
"Well, ahem, see, Klaus..."
"Do not remain silent, and play it cold cynic when the mate is in sorrow"
But cheer him up
What can I say to him?
Anyway he knows the banality
What is this nonsense?
What in this pursuit for the new and not the this basicl?
He does not need anything new!He just needs attention.See that he not left alone with his own sorrow
That's all!
"I can be your friend, buddy."
Why are you so nervous
"Ok,let's make YouTube comments under in this video, the happiest place online."
Put in them the rainbows and the respect for each other
Write something like:
"For boys, that the girl no longer with them I suggest this and that"
"Or someone who reads the response, you'll have only good ... something like this ..."
We have fun and heal with words
(hydra roars furiously) Twilight:
I think we're gonna make it!
"(theremin music, Pinkie shudders violently)"
Pinkie Pie:
"Oh, lookie there."
It stopped.
"(voice trembling) O-o-h-h, th-e-e-re it is aga-a-a-in!"
(ponies gasp) (thunderous thud) (ponies gasp) (loud thuds)
Twilight:
(gasps) He'll be up here in no time!
Quick!
"One at a time, CROSS!"
(Spike yelps)
Spike:
"Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?"
Twilight:
Your blood must be coursing the opposite way!
This interest business really kills you!
Look at how much weight you've lost!
"Since the ship has not yet set sail, that Yi Nok must still be free."
Yes.
He is furious about his ship not setting sail.
"If there are complications, it will make things difficult for us too."
- Who is doing this?
- I think they're going underwater.
"If the river freezes, we cannot leave!"
Why can't we stop them?
They are attacking our guards.
This cannot be just the parents of the girls.
So who can it be...?
It couldn't be...?
It must be the parents who are preventing the Choi Chul Joo's ship from setting sail.
Someone must be helping them.
I heard that Choi Chul Joo is planning on seizing them tonight.
Will he kill the girls?
Can she not see me?
Or does she think I cannot see her?
She may be involved with the girls' parents.
"If I don't do anything, she may fall into danger."
Did you just drop my merchandise?
It's dented here!
Pay me for it!
How much is it?
"Don't, Young Master!"
Weren't you looking at it because you wanted to buy it?
"Well, not really..."
Then?
Were you trying to avoid me?
What aunty?
You are praising me a lot?
The state is facing a drought.
People have stopped giving loans.
And they are unjustly asking me to repay their money too.
Since there was no one else I came back thinking that.. ..my mother in law is my only refuge.
Am I wrong?
You will always do this.
Do you know that you have a marriageable daughter?
First address that issue.
Ha!
Ha!
My daughter is a princess.
Some prince will definitely come for her.
He will give me half of his kingdom as dowry to marry her.
This is ancient tradition and is not wrong.
"My dear, I know that you made fish curry."
Serve it to me.
What happened?
"Boss, the girl is here, in Warangal."
"Hey, cant you see what is happening?"
Cant you wait?
You continue speaking.
Her father is a useless man.
Throughout the day he indulges in drink.. ..playing cards and spends all his time at the club.
There is no habit he doesnt have.
It will be very easy to manage him.
"Uncle, for the first time in my life"
I had the desire for marriage.
And that was after seeing her.
Handle this case carefully.
Give the money.
Fatmagül doesn't want to talk to anybody today.
Not even you.
"Of course, that's what we thought as well."
Thank you very much.
Good bye sweetie.
She said you shouldn't leave home for a while.
It's bad if she says that too.
I don't get it though.
This was supposed to be a private case.
"Yet, everybody is talking about it."
You are right.
They are doing a great job twisting the facts and informing the media.
I'll go to the prosecution office and see what they can do about this.
"Also, I'll gave them a petition about what happened last night."
But it's not going to happen over night.
This'll take a while.
I just want to live my normal life.
"This is only the beginning, girl."
You can't go outside for a while.
You can't.
But what about Kerim?
And what about your job?
Your appointment with the doctor and all?
- That's enough.
- The moment you go outside... ... you'll have all those microphones in your face.
- Will you stop doing that?
- I wish... ...
"I wish they could go somewhere far away, for a few days."
But where.
That would be great actually.
What would be great?
"- Hey, abi."
"Everyone, in the bazaar, market, streets talking about it."
They know who cheated you.
"I am saying the painful truth, as your friend."
To make you bleed the poison out.
"She was smiling to you, but she loved someone else."
God saved you from the worst.
And they got lost.
Just leave it.
Who cares if the lawyer knows where they are.
They can go to hell.
You should focus on your own future.
Figure out what are you gonna do with your life.
But it's difficult to do it here.
- I know...
- It's best if you go away from this town.
You're a good seaman.
You can find a good job in a fine ship.
"- Of course, I can."
- Look for one that's going abroad.
Just sail away...
Some trips will take months.
I can't think of a better way for you to leave here.
"You'll make money, too."
You'll see a lot of countries.
You'll travel the world.
"And eventually, you will forget."
I will forget...
... that dark night...  ... and the smell of the ashes.
I will forget everything.
"Stop being stubborn, let's show your foot to a doctor."
At least eat your food.
You haven't eaten since yesterday.
Where is my umbrella?
What do I know?
You forget things!
And you ask me where your umbrella is!
Here is your umbrella!
Take it!
But how did it come here?
"- By plane! shekhar.. why do you always get so angry? seema, I am not angry."
You just feel so.
I am not angry. come.
According to you shekhar had 4 suitcases.. ..when he disembarked from the boat?
- Yes!
But I saw only 2 suitcases in his house. shekhar had disappeared for sometime.
"When he returned, he got frightened when he saw me."
"I think the matter is serious. sir.. if you permit, shall we raid his place?"
"Now it""s too late!"
"We don""t have any evidence."
Listen..
"I want tight security around shekhar""s house."
And remember.. no officer should sleep on duty!
"Got it? sir, I won""t let anybody sleep! okay! - spread out! keep a close watch. stay awake."
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake. keep a close watch. stay awake."
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"And today, a human has accused our God."
This is not a personal war.
"lnstead, it's a battle for all humans.. ..who have faith in God."
"So I've decided that l, Siddeshwar Maharaj.. ..and Gopi Maiyya, will go to the court.. ..to give that shameless human a fitting reply."
Down with.. - Kanji!
"Yes, it's a democracy, where everyone is treated equally."
"And now, even God."
Even God will have to stand in the High Court's witness box.. ..where the most dangerous criminals stand for trial.
"Strange, but true."
"I still say, think about it once."
I already have.
Today's the first hearing.. ..and the judge will decide whether.. ..such a case can be accepted or not.
It's a good omen.
Really nice.
Let's go.
Many believers are standing outside the court shouting slogans against Kanji.
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Many 'dharma gurus' have come to the court.. ..to give a reply of Kanji's baseless allegations.
Very few people have been allowed in the courtroom as well.
"Swami, give me your blessings."
"Move aside, no one will touch the swami."
"Move aside, move aside."
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!

"Look, my memory is perfect."
I can remember anything even if it was 30 years ago
And you can ask Sheheibar and Abo Doma
Who are Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
My children
You mean Sameh and Karim?
Isn't that what I said?
You said Sheheibar and Abo Doma
No I said Sameh and Karim
Are you sure you didn't say Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
Who's the one forgetting now?
"Ok Mr.Mahmoud, Thanks"
This case is closed for now
You may go
What did your dad just do?
We all know he doesn't have alzheimer's
Maybe the medication he's talking is affecting him?
"Talk, Shaker"
Didn't you say the medication would only make him unstable and confused?
"Yeah, that's the medical evidence we know"
"But with old age, maybe the medication has affected his memory"
You mean he actually got Alzheimer's?
Even if he did get Alzheimer's
That's what we wanted
Ofcourse not
"We just want to win this case, not hurt dad"
It's the same result
"You won the case, what else do we want?"
"You're right, that's the most important thing"
"If you're gonna empathise, remember prison and all that"
"Once you get the money, just cure him using it."
I accept this beautiful death.
"Don""t say that, Mr. Rajesh."
You still have to achieve a lot.
A police officer has to play with life and death.
All that is fine.
First finish your dinner.
"lt""s enough!"
"I have to do some work too. shall we, Mr. Diwan? of course."
"Let""s go!"
David!
"- Yes, sir. okay, sir."
Mr. Rajesh.. this is the area.. where smuggling takes place.
Police and custom have raided this place many times.
But no clue was found. one thing is definite.
The smugglers dwell here only.
Yes.
"I entirely agree with you, Mr. Diwan."
These people have ruined the economy of the country.
They smuggle gold.. and shake.. ..the foundation of the government.
But who are these people?
They belong to this country only.
"They dance on other""s tunes."
"And they are leading to our country""s downfall."
This is some big international gang. such people should be shot!
They are not lndians!
They are traitors!
They have no nationality and no community!
Why are you worried?
"As we sow, so shall we reap."
"You don""t know, mother. lt""s about our country""s honour."
lf I had my way I would force all lndian mothers.. ..to first explain national character to their children!
To teach him to lay down their lives for their country!
"I wouldn't [laughter]...thank you, thank you."
Joy:
Just lie down.
Joy:
That'll be $100.
Dr. Joy.
Star:
I was trying to figure out were you going to analyze him or teach him.
[laughter]
Star:
I didn't know which one.
[laughter]
David:
It's funny you would say that because [laughter]
"I feel like, I mean in some ways my life would be so much easier if I were just interested in sex."
"There's a whole...I mean, there's some things that I don't have to worry about."
But there's all kinds of other stuff that I do worry about
I mean I can always exchange one big set of worries for another big set of worries.
Elisabeth:
What about when you're dating?
Like if you're dating someone and you've had romantic relationships in the past is this something you come out and tell them right away?
Do you only date other people who are asexual?
"And if the person you're with is sexual, how do you match up?"
David:
I date people who are sexual.
I pretty much have dated people who are sexual.
Elisabeth:
You tell them right away?
David:
"Yeah, and I tell them."
They find out right away.
I mean it's...I'm pretty out.
He is escaping !
You take the short cut.
You take the long cut.
Go!
I won't spare him!
My cycle!
- I won't spare him!
Where am I skating?
My pajama !
I won't spare you !
Where is he hiding?
My name is Gorpade.
I have felled big time goons.
Manish is not here.
"Don't worry, Manish will come with the diamonds."
Where is Hira ( diamond)?
"- Sir, I am here."
"Not you, where is the diamond thief?"
Where are you going?
I saved my life with great difficulty.
"Nowadays, guns are fired somewhere, and bombs are blasted somewhere."
"It was difficult to live before ; nowadays, it is difficult to survive."
"That is why I am telling you my love, get married soon, have a honeymoon. . . sire children."
- You are always joking.
"No Shalu, if you get separated from me, what will you do?"
"Will you toss in bed, or sigh?"
- Neither!
"I'll just write love letters to you round the clock. "" If ever you get separated from me, what will you do? """
""" Will you toss in bed, or sigh? """
""" I will neither toss in bed, nor sigh """
""" I will just write love letters to you round the clock """
""" If ever you get separated from me. . . """
"Oh, I'm sorry to have bored you with such story."
[Seul Hye]
Do not worry.
I have heard nothing.
You've changed somewhat since I've seen you last.
"You were cold as stone last time, but now you're even smiling."
"Back then, there was a man I had my heart set upon."
"Even though I may seem to be cold, I have my integrity."
Back then?
You speak of it as if it were a thing from the past.
Yes.
He was someone who I could not be with.
"So, I ended things in a petty way."
Is that so?
"Then, you could stay by my side tonight, right?"
"Forgive me, but I already made a prior engagment."
A prior engagement?
Yes.
"A favor was done for me, thus I promised to return the favor by greeting him tonight."
You wench!
You're arrogant!
How dare you put excuses as greetings to disobey him when he's speaking?
That's fine.
It's her arrogance that intrigues me.
Seol Hye!
Come outside for a minute!
"Forgive me, it seems I am required."
Alright.
She's a geisha from the commoners.
"You can just order her, why are you just watching her?"
I don't know why.
"Somehow, I can't seem to give her up."
It is dropping down...
"Oh, thank God..."
"Yasar, could you please buy these drugs immediately?"
"Look at us, Serdar Bey..."
"I am trying to keep my family together, but..."
"But, I can't."
And mother's heart can bear upto some point.
"Whatever prescription you give me, whatever you tell me..."
Useless...
My only medicine is Mustafa's health... his goodness...
When I see Asiye pregnant and in despair...
When I think about the innocent baby yet to be born...
I am losing my mind...
Be patient...
He is being treated.
"Believe me, the things being done is for Mustafa's benefit."
Tell Narin... ...to see Mustafa.
Help us.
We are falling apart...
We are breaking into little pieces..
This mansion is collapsing onto us.
We are getting burried under its weight.
It broke my heart to see the woman in that condition.
She was begging so desperately that
"It broke my heart...She said ""This mansion is collapsing onto us."""
"""We are getting burried under it."""
We.. stayed burried a lot under those walls...
Nobody heard our voice.
She was about to have a stroke because of high blood pressure...
"Luckily, you were there on time, Serdar."
Mustafa didn't recognize anyone of them.
He doesn't communicate with anybody.
"Oh, he's my neighbor."
Gatsby?!
What gatsby?
Tom:
"Come on, daisy."
Why candles?
"In two weeks, it'll be the longest day in the year."
Do you always watch
For the longest day in the year and then miss it?
I do.
We ought to plan something.
All right.
What'll we plan?
What do people plan?
Look at that.
"My little finger, it's all black and blue."
"You did that, tom."
"I know you didn't mean to,"
But that's what I get for marrying a brute of a man.
A great big hulking brute of a man.
"Oh, daisy, I hate that word, ""hulking."""
Even in kidding.
Hulking.
How do you know which measure of center best describes the data?
Let's see.
"We have the mean, the median, and the mode."
But how do you choose?
"In this lesson you will learn how to summarize the center of data with a single number  by examining the mean, median, and mode."
Let's start by remembering how to find the mode and median.
Here's the graph about how many books sixth graders  at Taylor Middle School read this summer.
The mode is the number that appears most often.
"So, in this data set, the mode is two."

"- Mom, dad!"
I would've never married you if mother hadn't pressurised me.
You've always been the biggest geek in the world.
"You don't have any style of speaking, no personality and.. ..your outfits.. - Don't say anything about the outfits, Mala."
You dare not say anything about them.
No one washes clothes like I do in entire Lokhandwala.
I am talking about wearing and not cleaning.
"And that's what will say even after I die, isn't it?"
That buy a plain cloth to cover her body.
"Oh no, I know you will stand up, throw a tantrum."
"""Couldn't you get Kanjivaram?"""
"Exactly, you didn't give me anything during my lifetime."
I will definitely ask for something after I die.
I didn't give you anything as long as you were alive?
What did you give me?
Did you even buy me a dog?
All our neighbours have dogs.
But we don't.
- I am there.
"Then why do you need a dog to secure the house, madam?"
At least the dog will keep me company.
It will go along with me.
I will come with you.
- Let us go.
You dont worry baby.
Nothing will happen to him.
He is angry with me so he did not do.. .. the job I offered.
Ego problem.
And joined in this dirty job and now arrested.
As a man he should have some ego but not this much.
As your father I have to try something.
But how?
I have to fall at their feet.
I will directly talk with the home minister.
I think it is the correct idea.
Small influences will not work.
Since it is a terrorist case.
Hello!
Is it the home minister?
"Yes, this is home minister speaking."
What is the matter?
"Its me sir, Kona Ranga Rao."
My fellow is in trouble sir.
It will not be a big problem.
If you give the surety.. ..he can be released.
No problem.
When I said that my father arranged a job for you.. ..you laughed at me.
As a result we became the laughing stock.. .. for everyone.
A man should not have so much ego Venkat.
You are crazy.
You are fortunate to be released.
Otherwise what would have happened?
"Shailu, you dont understand."
This is the drama ploted by ..your father and that Bhadram to separate us.
"Put a zero, okay?"
Yeah.
"If you have a longer vector, than your diagonal is long."
Does it just take the first?
Yes.
[inaudible] it kills the excess.
"Yeah, remember, so these things over run over here."
And they run over here.
And it just goes this way.
Everything is lined up according to here.
"Oh so, so that bottom the negative diaginol the diagnol negative what ever it was it got rid of the first section of the vector."
Yeah right here.
So thinks about putting the vector down right here.
Says well okay you put the vector start it here go down and then come up again to show that it doesn't exist.
Okay and on the other side it gets rid of the n of the vector.
Yes.
Okay.
Or it could be actually I think that's wrong.
It's the other way.
It goes this way.
So.
"These guys, here. ."
Get stuff thrown out down here.
And this stuff up here gets thrown stuff up there.
Okay?
But same concept.
"So let's put this E2 in, cuz we just, created this vector with an occasional zero."
"And that guy goes right, here."
"If I do this,"
"Come on, come on."
Look at that.
Oop.
How is it?
Isn't it a good name?
Would you guide me to where you first entered this park?
It would be tough if another animals enters.
This is a place for repairing hunted robots.
"Anyhow, Doctor Ochanomizu, please take a look at that."
It's a very aggressive elephant called Zora.
Very aggressive?
All animal robots here are designed not to take people's lives.
"However, this Zora is different."
It kills people ruthlessly.
Why did you build such dangerous thing?
It's thrilling.
There wouldn't be any thrill if there weren't a crazy beast.
But this one is too dangerous.
I need your help.
My help?
Please rebuild this Zora to listen to what workers here say at least.
Do you think I'm going to help you?
"Please, Doctor Ochanomizu."
Visitors are also expecting a lot from Zora.
It sure leaves me some profit as well.
This is not right.
You are doing this for the sake of money...
That's right.
I became a scientist to earn money.
A man like you is not suitable for the world of science.
"Doctor Hura, a real elephant is shot dead near the spring."
What?
Is that true?
"There are real animals outside this park, right?"
Then there must be some place where they enter through.
You've heard of that?
"No It's quite alright, but a bit cold in...from October and into November."
So...
"""I like to pull pranks so much, tjomfallera, tjomafallera, hey!"""
I remember when
"I remember, I remember when I lost my mind"
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care
"Yeah, I was out of touch"
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
"Come on now, who do you"
"Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?"
"Ha ha ha, bless your soul"
You really think you're in control?
"Well, I think you're crazy"
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart
To live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
"Is thinking, I want to be like them"
Ever since I was little
"You can also begin to find out why they stick, if you want."
Why?
"What is so sticky , what is so appealing about this?"
"Why is this thought, this feeling so sticky?"
And hold this question.
Don't ask two / three questions.
Hold this question one at a time.
What is so enticing about this thought?
Ok?
"And you can see ,'Ok, because it promises that'"
"Ok, as you said before, 'that is going to bring me happiness'."
Ok.
That's the first thing you've identified now.
"Now, you find out 'bring happiness to 'who' exactly'?"
"Just this question, 'who's going to become happy?'"
"And initially, it's going to be a lot of blurring."
"'Wow, you can't see. wow', you know like,"
Something can't handle this question.
"'Who's , Who suffers?"
It's me'
No.
But don't just satisfy yourself with the assumed 'me'.
"Ask again, you know, 'who, who will, who's going to be happy?'"
And keep your attention still and hold this question.
And this stillness and focus of attention will begin to burn.
"It will begin to burn, all this noise."
Stay with it.
Stay with it.
You might find yourself going to sleep a little bit.
That's Ok.
Hold the question.
Even write it down.
And this is the prime communication tool for the congress.
"- We actually position us as European, as international."
"Of course Europe is a very mature market in terms of internet, so we decided to adopt .eu as the main domain of the company."
"- We felt hat if there was a dot-EU, we should clearly be part of it. - .eu Is used because it is a European congress."
- Europe has become an open space in many ways.
"- We are in the European Union, ... yes?"
"Why not use .eu, we are European."
"- In Portuguese, EU spelled e-u, means ""I""."
"- I would say that we are a Portuguese company, but we are also a European company."
We are not a global company - yet.

equation.
Do you know what that bunch of points will be?
It's a plane.
"If we have a linear equation, then,"
"fortunately, the graph of the thing, the plot of all the points that"
solve it are a plane.
These three points determine a
"plane, but your lecturer is not Rembrandt and the art is going to be"
the weak point here.
"So I'm just going to draw a plane,"
right?
There's a plane somewhere.
That's my plane.
That plane is all the points that solves this guy.
"Then, what about this one?"
Two x minus y plus zero z.
So z actually can be anything.
"Again, it's going to be another"
plane.
Each row in a three by three problem
gives us a plane in three dimensions.
So this one is going to be some
other plane -- maybe I'll try to draw it like this.
And those two planes meet in a line.
"So if I have two equations,"
"just the first two equations in three dimensions,"
those give me a line.
The line where those two planes
meet.
"And now, the third guy is a third plane."
And it goes somewhere.
"Okay, those three things meet in a point."
"Needless to say, camel blood is different."
The red blood cells are oval-- not round like a human's.
When water rushes in... the cells of most species rupture if they swell past 150%.
Camel cells can increase 240% without bursting.
A camel may drink more than a third of its body weight as it rehydrates.
In lands barren and inhospitable as any on the planet... camels do more than survive.
They race.
[gunshot]
[camels groaning]
Camels can hit speeds of 25 miles an hour.
The races are big business in the Middle East.
Racing stables in search of breeding stock import wild camels all the way from Australia.
"When it comes to survival in the desert, the camel wins by a nose."
Our first two animals survive storms at sea... and on land.
But flash floods can be fatal to anyone.
[thunder]
NARRATOR:
A storm in the desert.
Short.
Violent.
Sand soaks up rain slowly.
So water falls off hills.
Flash flood!
You can run... but you can't hide.
"In the desert, floods soon subside."
"For the animal crawling into number 8, the water is both life and death."
Desert ants make the most of the flood.
Drinking heavily.
It could be years before the next rains.

1 cup of sugar.

"You can do this in any pan, just need to cover with a lid."
Add sugar.
Water.
Oil.
And corn.
Also add a little bit of dye.
"Well guys, when the popcorn start to popping."
It's just pay attention and mix.
"It takes a while anyway, because it will still make syrup."

"What we make sure is that all these animals have been ""grass only"" for at least a year because we do buy some calves from places we're not sure how they're handled."
A lot of these are getting ready to go to slaughter.
"Yeah, twelve of them will go tomorrow."
And how old are those that are going?
They are probably 28 months.
They don't grow as fast as they would on grain.
On grain they would grow faster.
"But they don't require any tillage, and this whole thing works on real time solar energy."
You're seeing it here.
"There's no fertilizer, no tillage, no annuals."
And you're creating topsoil.
That's exactly right.
America needs more topsoil.
"Yes, you're exactly right,"
America needs more topsoil.
That's for sure.

"- I use it a lot, but it still can make spaghetti bindings."
"- We validate that, by the way, now."

- We validate.
"Even the bindings part, oddball expression."
"At least, it might be spaghetti, but we'll tell you if you have a bogus binding in the middle."
"Personally, I like WOOgnl, we use it all the time."
But I've talked to some people who thought it was harmful.

Oh Ha Ni..
Take care of Eun Jo.
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.
An intussusception?
"It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope."
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.
Surgery?
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.
But....
What to do?
"It's not a serious surgery. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo."
I understand.
Begin the surgery.
You came?
Yes.
Eun Jo is having surgery.
I heard about it.
How did it go?
It was as I had thought.
His intestine was folded into itself.
Did the surgery end?
"Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry."
"A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,"
And returned it to normal.
It has different legendary levels.
"It is very good, you teach me..."
"OK, I showed my dad a new game and..."
Yes...
You have completed your things!
I made my registration to the reeve here.At this house.
It was necessary like that for school.

When can I see my brother?

I promise!
Is there any development about that issue at least?
"No, unfortunately, it looks very hard..."
What's that Suzan?

The insurance people said that.. ..God has razed down my shop.
"Or, he's the One behind your shop's destruction."
"So, I said fine."
Ask God to compensate for my losses.
Case closed.
But why will God raze down your shop?
Fool!
Please.
Please come to the witness box and speak.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

Why will God raze down my shop?
"Exactly, why will God raze down my shop?"
He has other important things to do.
"So, tell the insurance company to pay me."
End of matter.
Why will the insurance company pay you?
You've agreed to the terms and conditions.. ..of the insurance company.

Right.

"Btw, another great medicine that reduces inflammation is aspirin."
S:
"Aspirin, I've heard of that!"
Dr:
It's a helluva drug!
"Again, there are side effects to aspirin, it can effect bleeding, but at the same time, it gives dramatic effect by lowering inflammation."
S:
Right.
"And that is the main side effect, it's an age-old drug, and it's a blood thinner, if you get a cut or you bleed while taking aspirin, you might bleed more."
Dr:
Right.
"Blood thinner is a funny word, I'm not sure what it means."
I keep thinking paint thinner when you say that.
S:
That's how I imagine it.
Dr:
"It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating, it stops them from working very well."
S:
It's more anti-clotting?
Dr:
Right.
"And platelets are one of the key components in clotting, and they certainly affect it."
S:
"So your blood will have the same viscosity, it just won't clot as easily."
Dr:
Exactly.
And you could certainly paint a wall with either one.
S:
That's a little morbid.
Thanks so much

Choi Chul Joo?
What kind of man is he?
He is a loan shark rumored to have a past as a bandit.
So Yongmun has business arrangements with such a man?

That's not perhaps.
It's definitely undercooked.
The basket...
What the [Bleep] is that? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A basket.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Bleep].
Uhh!
"God, I could scream."
The scallops are still raw.

"They really seemed offended by these creations that I made, but at least I went to the edge of my comfort zone."
I tried something new.
Here is another example
For example they want to insult you and calling you gay
Most probably you will be called gay in a rude manner
"Now then, You know you're not gay"
So it's not true
"Second, if in your value system there is nothing wrong with being Gay"
So there is no insult
"If however gay, is evil for you"
So you see only the first point.
You're not gay....
So who ever is insulting is lying
Now take the stormtrooper Come over here
"Yes, my dear"
"As you accidentally have learned from the episode ""vulgarization of the senses"""
Stormtrooper is gay
And now try to insult him
"Hey glasseyes, you Gay!"
Hope I've insulted
Want to hurt me?
Call me Natural
From this we reach the conclusion
The offender in this case is quite homophobic
"And he will not name the Stormtrooper,Natural"
Because in his value system it is normal
"When insulting,the offender just telling us from what he afraid of..."
Whomever he would not want to be
And He simply LYlNG.LYlNG and LYlNG
Only projecting his complex on us
"Ideally,in order not to disclose information about yourself"
Should insult so
"Hi Kostya,All II want is for yout to feel bad."
LOL I'm so evil ...
The coffee will always be black with that bitter taste
"O nation, flutter away"
And clutter the hill of coffee
Melt the dead hearts and make it soulful again
Because they have dreams like young beautiful girls
"O nation, it's enough black coffee for our hope"
I long to see the coffee defeated by your sugar
"Taste it, then kiss my sweetheart"
With your dream flavor
"O nation, flutter away and include me into your swarm"
"O nation flutter, as the sweet taste is your own secret!"""

After many travels
I met someone called (Gehad)
He was Lebanese
Who adores Egypt
He visited many places in Egypt
And camping there with my knowledge
I told him that people stop asking
"People used to ask before, but now, no one cares!"
"Then he told me:"" in order to be a good traveling"
You have to lose your feelings
So that you can feel the other things that surround you carefully
"Like mountains, sands, and the signer girl from Nubba"""
"Then I wrote (El Ghorba) ""the exile"""
"That exile, which mourn on that stranger"
Its call spreads between the wind &amp;amp; echo
"Crying,"
"Stray, and the wheel of sadness loss its scope"
"O exile, why your call lose its kindness?"
Why it doesn't have any kindness?
Or being loved ?
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
"We've had our doubts, but now we're fine"
"And I love you, I swear that's true"
I cannot live without you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bare my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
"I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow"

What would you do to solve an equation with a fraction as the coefficient?
I reached - after Nubba &amp;amp; upper Egypt -
All over Egypt
Because in every Inch in Egypt they have Folklore
"They also have their own songs ,their own culture"
"Fortunatly,our all cultures are audible"
We have 1 million kinds of singing every person in Nubba sings in his own way
They sing in every dialect they have (el-Fonn) the oven
The first upper Egyptian poem
""" I found my Grandma before the oven"
She was looking after its flame
She caught a sight of me
"She asked:""what's the wrong with you, son?"""
Why I see concern killing you?
Why I see sadness inside your eyes full long times
And your voice...
Is missing!
"I said:"" O mommy my body is ailing"
And my heart is moaning loudly
If my scream comes out
Will makes farms forget its green color!
Then I crouched
I crouched beside her as usual
And told her everything inside my heart
I asked her many questions
The answer
The answer
The sentry makes fun of the minister
But my conscious grandma understood my words
"Then she told me ""O son"
"It was me who marched out to ""Abdel Nasser"""
When he stepped down from authority
And today it is me also who calls on the cursed

SIMATIC
SIMATIC is the name of an automation system which was developed by the German company Siemens. The automation system controls machines used for industrial production. This system makes it possible for machines to run automatically. Depending on the needed function of the machine you have to upload the right program on your Simatic unit. This unit is kept in a control cabinet near the machine.
Function.
Simatic is similar to a digital computer which can store and run programs. The Simatic also has some inputs and outputs. The running program on the Simatic controls these inputs and outputs. Both are connected by electrical wires with the machine. That makes a communication between the Simatic and any machine possible. As the case may be the inputs and outputs are set on a “High” signal or on a “Low” signal by the program. These are different electrical definitions. Finally these signals are important if an action in the machine happens or not.

Black-legged dart frog
"The black-legged dart frog (""Phyllobates bicolor""), also known as the bicolored dart frog or Neari in Choco, is the second most toxic of the wild poison dart frogs. It lives in Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 1500 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
"The adult male frog is 32.1-39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.7-42.7 mm. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Young frogs have stripes on their sides. In some groups of this frog, the stripes go away when the frog is an adult. In other places, the adult frogs keep their stripes."
Poison.
Human beings who live where the frog lives have used the frog to poison arrows. The human can touch the arrow to the frog's back without killing it. Or the human can kill and heat the frog's body.
The poison in the frog's skin is a chemical called batrachotoxin. The frog gets the poison from the ants and other insects that it eats. So frogs kept as pets do not have poison.
Threats.
There are fewer of these frogs than there were. Scientisis think this could be because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans turn the forests into forms and take the trees for lumber. Human beings also catch these frogs to sell as pets.

What makes a fruit?
"A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower. Fruits consist of two main parts: the pericarp, or ovary wall, and the seed(s)."
"The pericarp has three layers: the exocarp (skin/rind), the mesocarp (bulk of the pericarp), and the endocarp (innermost layer)."
Berries vs. drupes.
"The two main classes of fleshy fruits are berries and drupes, or stone fruits."
"Berries have a fleshy mesocarp and endocarp, and may have multiple seeds."
"Drupes have a fleshy mesocarp, but a tough endocarp, and of course, a ""stone"" or ""pit"" at its center. Drupes typically have only a single seed."
Humpback whale
"A humpback whale (""Megaptera novaeangliae"") is a large baleen whale with long flippers and a knobbly head. They can be found in every ocean."
They can grow to 15–16 m (49–52 ft) long and weigh up to 40 metric tons.
Life history.
Humpback whales can live up to 45 years. They migrate between the places they feed in the winter and the places they give birth in the summer. They usually live alone.
Feeding.
"Humpback whales eat krill and small fish, for example herring, capelin, and sand lance. They scoop up their food in their large mouths. Sometimes they round up their prey by swimming in tight circles and blowing curtains of bubbles around them. They often hunt in small groups, called pods."
Whale song.
"The male whale is known to sing for up to 22 hours at a time. Because whales do not have vocal cords, they make songs by forcing air through their nasal passages. Every male has a different song. We don't yet know why they sing, it might be to call a female or scare away other males. The songs are made up of a pattern of low notes repeated over a period of hours or days. The whales slowly change their songs over a period of years."
Other sounds.
"Both the male and female humpback whales make other sounds, such as moans and grunts, to communicate with each other."
Slovak language
"Slovak is the language spoken in Slovakia, a country in Central Europe. It is a language from Slavic language family. It is very similar to Czech, and Czechs and Slovaks understand each other quite well when they speak their own language. Polish and Sorbian are also quite similar. All of them belong to the western branch of Slavic languages. Slovak is spoken by more than 5 million people."
Pronunciation.
"Slovak is written using the Latin alphabet, but some letters have special signs (called diacritics)."

"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough"
"John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (26 May 1650 – 16 June 1722) was an important English soldier and statesman. He lived through the rules of five monarchs through the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served the Duke of York through the 1670s and early 1680s. This gave him military and political advancement through his brave, clever skill. Churchill helped secure James on the throne."
"However, just three years later he left his Catholic teacher for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. For his help in the Glorious Revolution, William at his coronation made him Earl of Marlborough (pronounced /'mɔ:l b""ə""ɹə/). He served in the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was imprisoned in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money."
"His marriage to the quick-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's close friend – helped Marlborough's rise. He first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces. Then he became a duke. Later, he became the richest of all Anne's subjects. Although in the end he could not completely crush his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power. Through him, the country grew more and more rich through the 18th century."

RB Leipzig
RB Leipzig (RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V.) is a German football club from Leipzig.
History.
The club was founded on 19 May 2009 by the Red Bull Company. It was formed out of the SSV Markranstädt. Due to the regulations of the DFB the name Red Bull Leipzig for marketing reasons was forbidden so they were called RB (short for RasenBallsport). Also the logo was forbidden.
"The company was sure that there is a great chance to form a new club, because with the Zentralstadion (now Red Bull Arena) there was a good stadium and there is no club in professional football in the area. The club is now in the Bundesliga. Like in Salzburg many fans protested against this deal because they had the fear that the fanculture will vanish and football will be only a business. So they wanted a ""normal"" football club."
"They started in the Oberliga Nordost-Süd(5th level) and became 1st in the 2009/10 season. But the next season they failed to gain promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. So the coach was changed, the new one is the Austrian Peter Pacult. The first match under the new coach was a 3:2 win in the German Cup (1st round) versus VfL Wolfsburg from the Bundesliga."

Khrushchev's Secret Speech
Krushchev's Secret Speech was the speech in which Nikita Krushchev denounced Joseph Stalin after the latter's death. The speech was a spoken report to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 25 February 1956. Its title was On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.
"The report was known as the ""Secret Speech"" because it was delivered at a closed session of Communist Party delegates, with guests and members of the press excluded. Although the text of the Khrushchev report leaked almost immediately, the official Russian text was published only in 1989 during the glasnost campaign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev."
"The speech was based on an investigation of the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 XVII Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They were victims of the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. Estimates of Stalin's role in history were quite changed by the speech. Many in the West who had been Communist Party member, or at least sympathetic fellow-travellers, resigned their memberships and no longer defended the reputation of Stalin. Russian writers like Solzhenitsyn found they were treated with more sympathy. The speech was a significant turning-point in history."
"The speech caused such shock to the audience that, according to some reports, some of those present suffered heart attacks, and others later committed suicide. Many Soviet citizens were confused by De-Stalinization. They had been fed on praise of the ""genius"" of Stalin. This was especially obvious in the Georgian SSR, Stalin's homeland, where rioting ended with the Soviet Red Army crackdown on 9 March 1956."

Interpretations of quantum mechanics
"In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically. However, there are many ideas about the interpretations and meanings of quantum mechanics. There are no facts to prove any interpretation over the others, but there are some that are more accepted than others."
Background material.
"""Main article: Quantum mechanics"""
The main ideas of quantum mechanics are the postulates of Schrödinger and Heisenberg. The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the wavefunction of an object. The equation can be given by
formula_1
"The basic meaning of this equation is that a particle, such as an electron, is not ""just"" a point-like particle, but also a type of wave. The philosophical implications will be explored shortly. Another fundamental of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This bizarre theory is the idea that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be known. The greater the certainty of the ""position"" of an object, the less the certainty of the ""momentum"" of the object. The mathematical formulation of this is given by"

"A co-factor (or cofactor) is a chemical compound which is not a protein, but is attached to a protein. The compound is needed for the protein's biological activity. In most cases, the protein will be an enzyme, and the cofactor will help the enzyme work. If so, the cofactors are also called coenzymes."
"Cofactors which are complex organic molecules are often called coenzymes. If connected by a covalent bond they are a ""prosthetic group"". But if they are just temporarily connected then the cofactor is a ""cosubstrate""."
"Some enzymes need several cofactors. Organic cofactors are often vitamins, or made from vitamins. Metallic ions are often cofactors, but many cofactors have both inorganic and organic parts."

"But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June."
"Oh, well, we do not have that problem"
Early June.
"So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring."
It is almost like an early Summer for us.
"Oh, that is nice."
Uh-huh.
"We could use a little more rain, I believe."
"Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours"
Uh
"Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then it stops for three months.
"I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,"
I'd make some quick arrangements
That's true.
and I've told so many stories about the snakes
Uh-huh.
"you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that"
Yeah.
"I'm just,"
Oh.
"I don't know,"
Yeah.
What's the largest fish you ever caught?
"Uh, gosh,"
"I think it was only like three and a half pounds,"
and for me that's big.
"That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big."
"Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,"
I know they have bigger fish than that
"but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,"
"Oh, on a lake,"
yeah.
"On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read ""lake"" not ""like"""
"yeah,"
that's a good size fish
I would be impressed
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"So, uh, but"
"yeah,"
I'd love to go catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.
I've never done that.
Uh-huh.
"I, uh, know the name"
but I haven't been there.
"Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant."
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
"Uh, I went to the Naval Academy."
"Oh, the U S ,  Naval Academy?"
"And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty."
Uh-huh.
"And,"
"yeah,"
"we would go over there to, uh,"
"pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders"
"I think it was,"
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
"Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,"
"but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,"
"and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy"
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
"Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?"
"I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has."
"Yes, sir."
"My dad worked there for years, and years."
Uh-huh.
"That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando."
"So,"
"I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas"
"I didn't get in debt,"
so.
"Oh, that's good."
"I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can"
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
"Oh, uh-huh."
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that any longer
I know.
"I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,"
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
"My, uh, roommate does sew some"
"and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time"
"but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again."
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, see, some people are, some aren't"
"because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters"
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
"But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that."
"Yeah,"
"and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales."
"Uh-huh,"
"Yeah,"
I drink beer.
"have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ..."
"Yeah,"
whiskey is in liters.
Yes.
"And, and the next,"
"yeah,"
"point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,"
yeah.
"It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange."
Yeah.
What's a fifth of whiskey?
Yeah.
"I, I always wondered about that myself."
It was a marketing ploy.
"And, and they had quarts at the same time though."
Yeah.
"But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five"
"and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,"
Yeah.
"it's, uh, I find that interesting."
It's ...
"But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles"
Liters.
"and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational."
Yeah.
"It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop"
"and, uh, everything's still inches."
"Everything's still fractions of inches, or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ..."
Yeah.
"It's, it's hard to think  though."
Yeah.
"I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now"
Uh-huh.
"you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
there's not as much slapstick anymore.
"Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,"
so we may see more slapstick.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, that's true,"
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.
"Yeah,"
"it is, it is,"
"and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,"
have you ever seen any of the movies?
Excuse me?
The French movies that .
"No,"
"not really,"
"the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different."
"Um, he's, uh,"
"well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,"
and his wife's all excited
"but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,"
"but, um. O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,"
Um.
"it was a very famous, uh, popular movie."
"Norman Gray,"
Norman Gear.
"No,"
"but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, uh, it was something, a little different."
"It's a good experience,"
"it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, well, I've, I've been under that hood"
and I know what's going on
"but,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I think it's important that everyone know, you know, basically how, how the darn engine works,"
Uh-huh.
"it helps you figure out what's wrong with it, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"I've, I've been out with my sister before when, you know, her car died on the highway"
"and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all,"
Women?
"Yeah,"
"the changing roles of women, how roles changed"
and what do you see coming in the future.
"Oh, okay,"
that's not a broad enough topic
"Okay,"
yeah.
Sounds good.
I'm ready when you are.
"Okay,"
hold on.
Okay.
Are you there?
"Yeah,"
I'm here.
"Oh my goodness,"
I can't believe I did that.
"Okay,"
because she can't wear like my pants
Uh-huh.
but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
Ooh.
"Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"But still, she'll just take them,"
"and she won't even think about it,"
"and then, I'll like see her that day,"
"and she'll be wearing my clothes,"
"and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,"
I really don't.
So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
because she doesn't even ask me.
Stuff like that really
"like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like."
"Oh, yeah,"
I agree.
"Stuff like that,"
"when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that."
Uh-huh.
I was thinking like my mom.
"I know this,"
"she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff"
"Oh, yeah."
"we always just give her her purse, you know,"
and she'll get it out or whatever.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I was trying to think,"
"and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,"
so.
"Oh, yeah."
What part of California are you from?
"San Jose, California."
"Oh, really?"
I have a good friend there.
"Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs."
Yeah .
"A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole,"
we've only been here a couple of years.
"Uh, before that we lived in Colorado"
"but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable."
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense,"
"I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's
You know.
"And it, it's that kind of thing"
"and, uh,"
"That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,"
Yeah.
"We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things  of that sort."
Sure.
Do you have that where you live
"or,"
"Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,"
I'm an intern
and then I go  back down in May.
"did you vote in the last, uh, national election?"
"Yes,"
"we, uh, uh, I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote."
"Oh, that's good."
Did you get to vote at the last one?
I voted in the last national one.
"Yeah,"
I'm not sure *slash error; one utt with next
if I got the last local one.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be."
"Yeah,"
you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
"Right,"
"and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents."
"Right,"
"or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that."
Right.
"So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting."
"Yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And, it's, it's, they're,"
"and also they're fed up with the system,"
"and they say, well, why should I even vote."
"Yeah,"
"or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,"
Right.
"so they think, well, you know, why vote."
Right.
The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
"Yeah,"
"I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings."
"Oh, it's great,"
I mean.
"Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard,"
"because I, I always have it on you know,"
Right.
"and I'll get that, that message that says, uh, to, uh, um, you know, uh, end this call, press three"
Sure.
"and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard."
You know
"Yeah,"
you're probably right.
Yeah
"it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was you know,"
"but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted,"
"and then, you know, people asking for, for money for everything, you know,"
"I mean.  Exactly,"
I understand.
"I mean, I,"
it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations
"and,"
"and, you know, the policeman's associations."
"I know,"
they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus
"Oh, I used to do that."
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"I used to do that,"
"I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something"
Right.
There's always a
"and I, my, my pat answer now is, well, you just called me the other night,"
"Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. Uh,"
"here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up."
You're kidding.
Nope.
"They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company."
God.
"Well, if you,"
"I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,"
"but, uh,"
Not at all.
"especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated."
There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.
They don't even try to keep up with it.
No.
God.
Not a bit.
So you lived in Texas for a while.
Yes
sir.
Huh.
"I spent, uh, couple of years down there."
Moved down there in eighty-seven
and moved out in eighty-nine.
"Are, where you from originally."
"Uh, right here in Maryland."
"Huh,"
so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
"Yeah,"
Right.
Ran out of jeans
"I understand,"
that's funny
"So, does it change?"
No.
"Your dress,"
no.
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,"
Uh-huh.
"but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in,"
but that's for my husband's job and not mine
"Oh, I see,"
I understand.
"I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him,"
"but So,"
"Oh. Well, that's interesting."
"Let's see, uh, what else about this, uh,"
"it, it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two, like, two or three levels."
Uh-huh.
"That there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"I would, if you, if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research"
Yeah.
Or so it seems.
"I may just be paranoid,"
but that state income tax is just eating me alive.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
they have a state income tax in Maryland.
"But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax,"
"but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and, school taxes and property taxes,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Property taxes and,"
"Oh my God,"
ate you alive.
"Yeah,"
"well, Colorado, you know they have the state income tax,"
"but then they also have property taxes,"
"and they also have sales taxes,"
and they just get you every direction they can.
Yeah.
"And I just don't know, sir,"
but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.
"Yeah,"
"it sure does. Um,"
"there's, uh, some good books that I've read, um, that you might be interested in. Uh"
Oh yeah?
Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V
"and he's got seminars you can go to,"
"and they try to hook you into his organization, which costs about four hundred bucks."
But he's got a couple of books out.
"One of them is called, uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK."
I've heard of the book.
and my father works in films
"and such,"
"and I tend to, tend to be hypercritical of these things,"
"and then, perhaps, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I, I must admit I enjoy these movies"
"Yeah,"
right.
"and that's what they're for,"
"but I don't, don't remember them,"
"and I think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during"
"and then after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well because it, it had some, some meaning to me or something."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"exactly,"
"yeah,"
"there, there, there are several movies that hit home like that."
"Of course the ones I always remember are the, the older ones"
Uh-huh.
"I always like the musicals, and uh,  those ones, that just stick in your head."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"they leave,"
"yeah,"
"they leave, they leave some songs with you,"
I don't know what it is
Uh-huh.
"but it just,"
"I mean, I don't know if this is old fart talking here or something, because I'm not that old"
"No,"
it could be.
"you know, those old movies seemed to have had something that, uh, that was memorable somehow,"
Uh-huh.
I don't know what it was.
"now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,"
"but I get my kids to do that,"
"so,"
Oh
"I, I don't have to do that."
"And, um, and it really,"
and you mix it all up with
"there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,"
but it's so simple
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.
"Oh, yeah."
You serve it cold?
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah,"
that sounds good.
"Yeah,"
"it has to sit in the fridge over night,"
"but, but it's really good."
Um.
And I like that one.
Yeah.
"Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,"
Yeah.
"so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue"
Exactly.
"like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over"
"and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, that sounds good."
And it was real good.
You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way
and then people think they're eating steak or something
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.
"Yeah,"
"exactly,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"the, the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions."
These institutions of thirty thousand students and such.
"Oh I,"
And I see some freshmen wandering around in there
"and they're they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city,"
"I mean, they, they,"
Yeah.
"I don't see them getting,"
"I mean when I was undergraduate, I went to a, relatively small school for my first two years"
and then I transferred to a very large school.
Uh-huh.
And that worked out pretty well.
"I went from a, you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution."
Uh-huh.
But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was.
I needed to make friends.
I needed to sort of learn the ropes.
"You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more"
"and I needed basic, really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years."
"Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too,"
"so,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"and could call them,"
you go to their office anytime.
"I had some instructors that, uh, would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends, when I was having trouble with something"
Huh.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
you won't get that at M I T or virtually or anything like that.
"No,"
"no,"
"and that,"
"And you you know, and you can't blame the professors either, because you look at their job description,"
No.
"you'd you know,"
teaching is third down on the list of importance things
"and,"
"Right,"
right.
"Publish first,"
and the
"yeah,"
"and, and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time."
Right.
"So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers."
People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.
Yeah.
"But, oh, well"
"Yeah,"
"it's, there's a lot of factors that people don't ever, ever consider in, in their selection of a college"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe, I wonder if, if they enter these conversations that people have been having, uh ..."
what kind of fishing do you enjoy?
"and I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view,"
"and, uh what exactly do we, you know, do we see about this world,"
Um.
or why are we so fascinated with the other world.
Is it supposed to be better?
"The other world,"
yeah.
Sometimes I think we think it is.
We like those things that way.
"Um, I'm, I'm sure that it seems like,"
"it certainly would, would explain the preoccupation with ,"
but I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things.
"Well, it has."
"All the way through history, there's, I guess,"
if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever. It's always fascinated.
"I guess because we don't know,"
and there's no real way of finding out.
"Right,"
well.
There's only one way of finding it.
"Well did you ever see, um, FLATLINERS."
"No,"
"I did, uh, did not."
"The girl next to me saw it,"
and she really liked it.
"That's, that's, that's probably one of those ones that, you know,"
"it's on video now, I think."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"Probably, probably worth seeing on video."
"Actually we really enjoyed it,"
but it was also right along the same lines.
uh
I mean now
"no,"
"probably, well,"
"you probably wouldn't have,"
"I might,"
"the problem is I'm really into cars,"
"and so it's not a, uh,"
"for me it's, it's a real, it's a real consideration, uh, uh,"
"and, and, uh, the,"
but no
I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into cars
"it's, it's probably my main hobby."
Right
"because you always think,"
"I mean, I don't know,"
"maybe you don't,"
"but just like me, I always think well, you know, these things must be safe,"
"but that's just like,"
"I don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago, they said, you know, before they had the, like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist?"
Yeah.
"All these people were,"
"and, and it, it was on one of those kind of shows like TWENTY-TWENTY"
Uh-huh.
"these people were like paralyzed,"
"and because, it threw them forward,"
"but they were hooked at the waist,"
"and so it like, you know, did something to their spinal cord"
Yeah.
then they were like paraplegics.
"yeah,"
"you know, ROAD AND TRACK had a, had some articles on,"
"Asa de Águia is a Brazilian axé band from Salvador. It has been on top of the Brazilian charts since its inception. The band was one of the main acts in the Carnival of Salvador, which according to the ""Guinness Book"" is the biggest outdoor party in the world. The band has sold more than five million records worldwide."
= = = The Midnight Chase = = =
The Midnight Chase is the third album by Swedish hard rock band Crucified Barbara. It was first released in Japan and Europe in 2012.
"The album was recorded in the Music-A-Matic Studio in Göteborg, Sweden. It was produced by Chips Kiesby and mixed by Henryk Lipp."
= = = William Meschin = = =
"William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress."
"Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters."
"Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097."
"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold.

"Patrick Aloysius ""P.A."" McHugh (1858 – 30 May 1909), also spelt M’Hugh, was an Irish Nationalist politician. He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as the Member of Parliament for North Leitrim, from 1892 to 1906, and for North Sligo from 1906 until his death in 1909."
"McHugh was born at Annagh, Glenfarne, County Leitrim. He was the son of a tenant farmer, Peter M’Hugh of Leitrim, and of Anne McDermott. He entered a Catholic seminary, but left without taking orders. He went to Paris and engaged in journalism, and taught science and classics in the Athlone and Sligo Intermediate schools. In 1882 he married Mary Harte, daughter of a J. Harte of Sligo. She died in 1894. He became owner of ""The Sligo Champion"" in 1885. He was Mayor of Sligo in 1888, and again in 1895-98 and 1900. He was elected to Sligo County Council on its establishment in 1899 and became its first chairman."
"He was elected MP for North Leitrim as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist in 1892, winning comfortably over the Unionist candidate with 87% of the vote. He retained the seat unopposed in 1895. At this election he also challenged the Parnellite Willie Redmond in East Clare, losing by only 57 votes in a poll of over 6,500. In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing. In 1906 he was returned unopposed both for North Leitrim and for North Sligo, and chose to sit for the latter constituency, which he represented until his death in 1909."

"William G. ""Slicky Bill"" Greene, Jr. (1812–1894) was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and a businessman in Menard County, Illinois. Greene founded Tallula, Illinois in 1857, and Greenview, Illinois is named after him."
"Greene, along with his brother L.M. Greene, and William F. Berry, attended Illinois College in Jacksonville."
"By September 1831, Greene's parents lived 2 miles (3 km) southwest of New Salem; Greene, then age 19, was hired by recent arrival Abraham Lincoln to assist at Lincoln's mill and store. In early January 1833, Greene bought the inventory of Reuben Radford's store in New Salem for $400; Lincoln drew up and witnessed the mortgage. The same day, Greene sold the same inventory to Lincoln and Berry, now Lincoln's store partner, for over $600. When Lincoln had a debt judgement entered against him in 1834, requiring Lincoln to surrender his horse, Greene turned in his own horse instead; this horse was probably the one Lincoln had paid him with in 1833. Lincoln eventually paid Greene back after becoming an attorney."
"Greene was also an acquaintance of Richard Yates, and introduced Yates and Lincoln in New Salem; Yates became Governor of Illinois during the Civil War and Lincoln became President."
"Greene and Lincoln remained friends; though Greene was a Democrat, Lincoln, as president, appointed Greene as internal revenue collector for the Peoria district. In ""Lincoln's New Salem"", author Benjamin Thomas relates a story in which Lincoln introduced Greene to Secretary of State William H. Seward by saying that Greene had taught Lincoln grammar: When Greene later reminded Lincoln that all Greene had done was held the grammar book and checked the answers, and was not very good at grammar himself, Lincoln is said to have replied ""Well, that was all the teaching of grammar I ever had."""
"Greene had nine children. By March 1853, Greene and his wife, Louisa Green, lived on a farm near Havana, Illinois; their seventh child, Gaines Greene (1853–1918), was born there on March 3. Sons Carlin, McNult, Byrd, and Vance, and daughter Julia Greene, died before Gaines; sons Scott and Frank and daughter J. S. Noble outlived Gaines."
"Within months after the birth of Gaines Green, the family moved near Tallula, and William Greene spent most of his life in Tallula Precinct. Greene, along with Yates, J. G. Greene, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears, laid out the village of Tallula itself in late 1857. William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877."
"Greenview was laid out in October 1857. It was named after William Greene because he convinced the railroad to come through the town: located on the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis Railroad, Greenview was incorporated by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in May 1869."
"Greene died on June 30, 1894, aged 82 years, 5 months, 3 days, and is buried as ""W. G. Greene"" in Greenwood Cemetery (East) in Tallula."

"As early as autumn 1941 Latvian auxiliary police units, temporarily attached to the Wehrmacht, were first used in front line duties. This occasional employment continued until the 2nd Latvian Brigade was formed from six Latvian battalions, four of which had combat experience. At the end of April 1943 a three battalion formation fighting under name of Latvian Legion was withdrawn from the front line and renamed 1st Volunteer Regiment of the SS (Latvian), with a change of Wehrmacht ranks to those of Waffen-SS.

"One of his sisters married Dr. Caleb Hillier Parry, and became the mother of Sir William Edward Parry."
"Educated at Norwich School and Warrington Academy, Rigby was apprenticed in 1762 to David Martineau, surgeon, of Norwich, and then studied in London. Admitted a member of the Corporation of Surgeons on 4 May 1769, he married in the same year, and settled in Norwich."
"In 1786 Rigby took the lead in establishing the Norfolk Benevolent Society for the relief of the widows and orphans of medical men. In July 1789 he visited France and other parts of the continent, witnessing the storming of the Bastille. A practical agriculturist, he was the friend of Thomas William Coke of Holkham, he experimented on his own farm at Framingham Earl, about five miles from Norwich."
"In 1783 Rigby became a member of the corporation of guardians of Norwich, and promoted the economical administration of the Poor Laws.

Windham was elected, but Mingay's reputation as a Whig was boosted."
"Rigby died on 27 October 1821, and was buried at Framingham."

"Margaret Myrtle ""Mitzi"" Hoag (September 25, 1932 – February 26, 2019) was an American actress. Over the course of her career, she appeared in more than 73 different TV shows and movies. Notable among these are recurring roles in ""We'll Get By"", ""Bonanza"", ""Here Come the Brides"", and ""The Partridge Family""."
"Hoag was raised in North Olmsted, Ohio, near Cleveland, where she was born. Her father, John C. Hoag, was a supervisor for the A&P store chain. She graduated from John Marshall High School in 1949. A straight-A student and head majorette of the marching band, she appeared in numerous high school stage productions, already using the nickname ""Mitzi"". After high school, Hoag attended Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois, completing her degree in two years under the radically flexible University of Chicago curriculum of Robert Maynard Hutchins. She chose Shimer for its small classes and the opportunity for horseback riding. Because Shimer was then closely affiliated with the University of Chicago, she is sometimes reported as having graduated from there."
"When Hoag graduated from Shimer at age 19 in 1952, she was one of the first five Shimer students to receive the bachelor's degree. She was the only woman in the graduating class. She earned a bachelor of arts in general education, and became a certified teacher, but her experiences with drama at Shimer turned her towards an acting career. After leaving Shimer, Hoag studied drama at the graduate level at Case Western Reserve University for two years."
"In the mid-1950s, Hoag moved to New York, where she continued her study of acting with Herbert Berghof. She was cast in multiple off-Broadway shows, but these were all cancelled due to funding problems. Finally, she starred in the title role of the 1958 off-Broadway hit ""Heloise"", an adaptation by James Forsyth of the story of Heloise and Abelard. The play, which won considerable critical acclaim, was produced primarily by erstwhile actors and staffers of Case Western's Eldred Theatre."
"Hoag subsequently went to Hollywood, on her mother's advice. There she married Stephen Wolfson, who had a bit part in ""Heloise"", and later became a teacher. They had a daughter together, but subsequently divorced."
"In Hollywood, Hoag at first worked as a stage actress. She parlayed a successful stage performance as Annie Sullivan in ""The Miracle Worker"" into screen roles, starting with a role in the movie ""Tammy and the Doctor"", and continuing with numerous TV appearances."
"In the late 1960s, Hoag had a recurring role in ""Here Come the Brides"" in the late 1960s. In addition, from 1966 to 1972, she appeared frequently in the TV show ""Bonanza"" as Alice Brenner. In 1976, she appeared in the drama ""Family"" as Clara Briault. During this period, she also appeared in several movies, including ""Play It as It Lays"", ""Pieces of Dreams"", and ""Devil's Angels""."
"She also played Natalie Green's adoptive mother on ""The Facts of Life"", a role she played through all 9 seasons."
"Hoag's first and only starring role in a TV series came in 1975, when she appeared as the mother Liz Platt in the CBS sitcom ""We'll Get By"", starring opposite Paul Sorvino. A family sitcom, the show was created by Alan Alda, and modeled after his own domestic life. The show ran to twelve episodes, filmed in front of a live studio audience. Originally scheduled for September 1974, the show did not air until March 1975, in a time slot facing ""Chico and the Man"", one of NBC's most popular programs. It was not renewed."

"Matt Collar of AllMusic wrote that White Lies ""sound even more engaged and clear-eyed than on the ambitious, stylized ""Ritual"","" and they ""combine the urgent passions of their debut with the conceptual ambitions of their sophomore effort and by doing so, make the best album of their career"". Cai Trefor of ""Clash"" magazine rated the album 7 out of 10, and described it as leaning towards retro, but also sounding firmly in the present, ""utilising electronic samples with classic valve-driven guitar chords to accompany the trademark baritone of McVeigh"". The Line of Best Fit's reviewer Ryan Thomas noted the album's 1980s atmosphere but said that ""with influences visible, nods clearly marked, White Lies aren't just repackaging yesterday's hits as their own. Instead they're making use of abandoned utensils to create anew, achieving catharsis through resourcefulness. Yes, they are working with a previously-explored aesthetic, but they are molding it into a beautifully-original product, per a vision that refuses to forget music's former greatness""."

= = = Commodity value = = =
"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value."
"A commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility."
"Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law."
"Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become token."

"The Perry was a British car made by the Perry Motor Company based in Tyseley, Birmingham who made cars between 1913 and 1916."
"The company can trace its roots back to 1824 with James and Stephen Perry making pens in a workshop in London, later moving to Birmingham and building bicycles. By the late 1890s they were having financial problems and were bought by James William Bayliss, part owner of the Bayliss-Thomas car making company."
"Their first car, a three-wheeler, was made in 1899 followed by a forecar in 1903. Cecil Bayliss, the son of the new owner, built a cyclecar in 1911 with 800 cc engine, and this was developed into the first Perry car to reach production."
"The Perry cyclecar was described as 'just placed on the market' when exhibited at the November 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia. It was described as 'an exact replica of a full-sized model, but is of exceptionally light weight - less than 7cwt'."
"The engine for the car was built in-house and was a twin-cylinder vertical water cooled unit, with 72mm bore and 108mm stroke, unusual in that both pistons rose and fell at the same time. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox with reverse and worm-driven axle and spur differential. The rear springing was unusual in that the long semi-elliptic leaf springs were supplemented by coil springs. It was fitted with Sankey detachable wheels and Dunlop tyres."
"The basic body was an open two-seater, but a long-wheelbase version allowing a dickey seat was also available."
About 800 were made.
A full-sized car was introduced in 1914 with four-cylinder 1795 cc engine. The larger car allowed four seat bodies to be offered as well as two seaters and these were mainly made by Mulliners of Birmingham.
"About 300 were made before World War I curtailed car-building activities. A very few were made in 1919 when the design, jigs, patterns and tools were sold to Bean Cars for £15,000, who reintroduced it as the Bean 11.9."

"The series aired on CBS Mondays at 9:30pm ET/PT, following ""Two and a Half Men"". The premiere attracted 11 million viewers but lost a third of its lead-in audience. Ratings dropped to a low of 8.4 million viewers with the sixth episode, then began to climb steadily. They reached a high of 12.12 million viewers with the eleventh episode but declined afterwards.

After all, the British series ran for only two seasons and had a mere seven episodes each season...So how is CBS going to stretch this into 22 episodes without stretching it too thin?...In many ways, ""Worst Week"" seems incapable of being made into an American version (there were previous attempts that failed), because not only does the title not make sense, but not having a payoff for all the freaky, not-so-karmic woes Sam endures will be frustrating to the viewing audience . . . [It] is a series that may end up being on a short leash."""
"Linda Stasi of the ""New York Post"" called it ""one of the worst new shows of the week"" and added, ""Only a man (or a couple of them) could get paid big bucks in Hollywood to come up with such a lame-o rip-off and perpetuate the fantasy that gorgeous women can't help but to love out-of-shape guys who do everything wrong."""

"The Barony of Nikli was a medieval Frankish fiefdom of the Principality of Achaea, located in the southern Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece, and centred on the town of Nikli (; ; ), also known as Amyklai or Amyklion (Ἀμύκλαι, Αμύκλιον)."
"The Barony of Nikli was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The barony, with six knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to a lord known in the Greek and Italian versions of the ""Chronicle of the Morea"" only as William, but whose family name is given by Angevin records as Morlay. William was succeeded by his son Hugh—although Karl Hopf suggested the interposition of a second William after the original founder for chronological reasons—and then, around 1280, by Androuin de Villiers or de Villa, who had married Hugh's sister Sachette."
"Nikli, known in Antiquity as Tegea, is located on the southern Arcadian plain and was conquered by the Franks after a siege sometime before 1209; at the time it was a town of some importance and the seat of a bishopric, which was taken over by a Latin bishop until 1222, when it was abolished and joined to that of Lacedaemon. Nikli's location made it an excellent assembly point for armies, as well as for parliaments like the famous ""Ladies' Parliament"" in 1261, but after 1262, when the Byzantines recovered parts of the southeastern Peloponnese, the barony became a battleground, and by the early 1270s, Nikli was permanently garrisoned to prevent the Byzantines from breaking out of their territory in Laconia into the central Arcadian plateau. Nikli was still in Frankish hands in 1280, but was lost to the resurgent Byzantines sometime after. The Aragonese version of the ""Chronicle"" states that the Byzantines occupied the town in 1296, but, it being indefensible on account of its location on the plain, they preferred to destroy and abandon it. The region seems to have remained under Frankish control for a few years after that, but by 1302, it was definitely in Byzantine hands."

"Liberator is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. It is based on the ""Atari Force"" comic book series published by DC Comics from 1982 to 1986. ""Liberator"" has been described as the opposite of ""Missile Command"", in that the player destroys cities from space instead of defending them from the ground. Only 762 arcade machines were ever made."
"The story ""Code Name: Liberator"" describes the premise of the arcade game in detail and was included as a special insert in two comic books cover dated January 1983. Characters and concepts from the comic exist throughout the game. In the opening screen of the arcade game, Commander Champion of the ""Atari Force"" asks the player to help free the galaxy from the evil Malaglon Army."
"The ""Liberator"" controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from the closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships."
"At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into the player's ships. Shields do not work during this stage."
"After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at the player's ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit. At the end of each stage, the player is awarded a bonus ship for every 20,000 points."
"Missiles can be destroyed, although some split into four smaller particles when destroyed. Fireballs take four hits to destroy, but they slow down on each hit. Star balls also take four hits to destroy, but return to normal speed soon after being hit."
"Flying saucers sometimes appear from the planet. Flying saucers shoot a large, deadly laser which cannot be stopped."
"A level select menu allows the player to start at any third level (1, 4, 7... up to 22)."

"Second-order election is a term that appeared for the first time in Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt's ""Nine second-order national elections – A conceptual framework for the analysis of European election results"" article for the [European Journal of Political Research, in 1980]. It was used to analyze the first European Parliament elections, held in 1979 in the, then, nine member states of the European Economic Community. According to the ""second-order elections"" approach, European Parliament elections were ""second-order"" in that they were viewed as less important by voters, parties and the media than first-order elections."
"First-order elections are those that determine the government and/or executive power in a political system, i.e., national elections. They are first-order in that they are seen as more important by parties, voters and the media. Local and regional elections are also considered second-order elections."
"Second-order elections present the following characteristics: turnout is expected to be lower than in national elections, voters are more prone to vote for protest parties, or parties in the periphery of the political system, rather than the usual mainstream parties they would vote for in a national election. As a result, second-order elections are often used by voters to punish or reward the current governing parties."
"Regarding EP elections, empirical evidence has shown that all six EP elections (1979, 1985, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004) have been second-order elections. However, the second-order elections approach has not been confirmed for the twelve new member states of the European Union (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)."

"Joel Lester Oppenheimer (Jacob Hammer) (February 18, 1930 – October 11, 1988) was an American poet associated with both the Black Mountain poets and the New York School. He was the first director of the St. Marks Poetry Project (1966–68). Though a poet, Oppenheimer was perhaps better known for his columns in the ""Village Voice"" from 1969 to 1984."
"Oppenheimer was born in Yonkers, New York, attended Cornell University for one year in 1948, spent less than one semester at the University of Chicago, and in 1950 enrolled at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. At Black Mountain, he studied with Paul Goodman and poet Charles Olson, became friends with Fielding Dawson and Ed Dorn, and worked in the school's print shop."
"In his earliest poetry, Oppenheimer shows clearly the influence of William Carlos Williams, but he soon developed his own style. While at Black Mountain, Oppenheimer met and married his first wife, Rena Furlong. He left the school in January 1953 without taking a degree, eventually settling in New York and working in a print shop while continuing to write poetry."
"His first publications were ""The Dancer"" (1951), as ""Jargon"", no. 2, 1951, by The Sad Devil Press/Black Mountain College; ""The Dutiful Son"" (1956) by Jonathan Williams's Jargon Society, reprinted by LeRoi Jones's Totem Press in 1961, ""The Love Bit and Other Poems"" (1962), again with Totem. His satiric Western drama ""The Great American Desert"" was the first play produced by Robert Nichols, directed by Lawrence Kornfeld, who had been with the Living Theatre, at the Judson Poets' Theatre. It opened on November 18, 1961."
"Oppenheimer's poetry has been collected in two volumes: Robert J. Bertholf (editor, introduction), ""Collected Later Poems of Joel Oppenheimer,"" with eleven drawings by John Dobbs, The Poetry Collection, 1997 and ""Names & Local Habitations (Selected Earlier Poems 1951-1972),"" editor Jonathan Williams, The Jargon Society, 1988."
"He also published two nonfiction works, ""The Wrong Season,"" Bobbs-Merrill 1973, about the New York Mets, and ""Marilyn Lives,"" Delilah, 1984, on Marilyn Monroe. ""Drawing from Life"", posthumously published in 1997, gathered 92 columns written for the ""Village Voice"". Library Journal wrote that ""Drawing from Life"" ""emphasizes several favorite themes: baseball, politics, and the role of the changing seasons in our lives""."

"Pavol Horov Gymnasium () is an upper secondary school located in the city of Michalovce in Kosice Region, Slovakia. Established in 1922, it is the oldest Slovak Gymnasium east of the Mátra-Slanec Area and is one of two main providers of secondary school education in Michalovce, along with ""Gymnázium na ulici Ľudovíta Štúra""."
"Before the Czechoslovak declaration of independence on 28 October 1918, the area of surrounding the city of Michalovce was a part of the former Hungarian County of Kosice (). At that time, there was only three secondary schools in the entire county, all of which was purely Hungarian, located in the then cultural centers of Kosice, Presov and Uzhgorod."
"After becoming independent, patriotic sentiment ran high and Slovaks sensed immediately the need to establish a Slovak high school in the area, in order to provide higher education in Slovak language for the populace in eastern Slovakia. At first the choice stood between three sites in the Zemplin region, which were the cities of Humenne, Trebisov and Michalovce. Due to its ability to provide sufficient funds and staffing, Michalovce soon became the obvious choice for the construction of the new school."
"The new school was finished in 1922 and in the period 1922 - 1938 the school bore the name ""Czechoslovak state gymnasium."" At the stage, the education was conducted in a way that emphasized the idea of the single Czechoslovak nation, and the language taught was the ""českoslovenčina"", or Czechoslovak language.The School's administrators constantly struggled with finding teachers with sufficient qualifications, teaching post was often filled with engineers, and often the school was dependent on the assistance of local school teachers."
"In 1931, the school marked its first graduating class, of the 22 students, 18 managed to graduate. Seven years later the school was markedly affected by the First Vienna Award, which saw the departure of all Czech professors along with their families from Michalovce. These were highly skilled academics which undoubtedly contributed to the high reputation of the school."
"Following the Munich treaty in November 1938, the Name of the school was changed to ""Slovak real high school"" (). In connection with the events of Munich, the beginning of the 1938-39 school year the school was occupied by the army (mobilization). Teaching was suspended from 24 September 1938 to 10 October 1938. After the First Vienna Award the new students came from schools from the Hungarian territories, (mainly Uzhhorod)."
"After Slovak students started moving to nearby Sobrance and the number of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became an important part of the school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army."

The review identified the following factors:"
"As well as a general review, the review considers the impact of the Act on the Leadbeater's possum, the powerful owl and the tiger quoll, as well as on a threatened community and a threatening process. For example, it considers the concern of environmentalists for the small and poorly placed Special Protection and Management Zones for the tiger quoll, the continuing clear-fell logging followed by slash burns in their management zones, and the failure to stop the use of 1080 poison, which is a threat to the species."
"LFF recommended that the NRE should receive appropriate funding to fully implement the FFG Act, and the government commit to NRE fulfilling its obligations under the Act. The group further recommended that the Act should be enforceable, and NRE should be accountable in its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Act."

"Cap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to stay in the same geographic location for its entire existence. Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today. A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011."

In this ""conditional switching"" problem, it is often possible to generate a gain over the ""never switching"" strategy"", depending on the probability distribution of the envelopes."
"The envelope paradox dates back at least to 1953, when Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik proposed a puzzle in his book ""Recreational Mathematics"""
"concerning two equally rich men who meet and compare their beautiful neckties, presents from their wives, wondering which tie actually cost more money. He also introduces a variant in which the two men compare the contents of their purses. He assumes that each purse is equally likely to contain 1 up to some large number ""x"" of pennies, the total number of pennies minted to date. The men do not look in their purses but each reasons that they should switch. He does not explain what is the error in their reasoning. It is not clear whether the puzzle already appeared in an earlier 1942 edition of his book. It is also mentioned in a 1953 book on elementary mathematics and mathematical puzzles by the mathematician John Edensor Littlewood, who credited it to the physicist Erwin Schroedinger, where it concerns a pack of cards, each card has two numbers written on it, the player gets to see a random side of a random card, and the question is whether one should turn over the card. Littlewood's pack of cards is infinitely large and his paradox is a paradox of improper prior distributions."
"Martin Gardner popularized Kraitchik's puzzle in his 1982 book ""Aha! Gotcha"", in the form of a wallet game:"

"After more than a century of service to Roman Catholics of Polish descent in the Manayunk, Roxborough, and Wissahickon areas of the greater Philadelphia area, St. Josaphat's Parish was merged with St. John the Baptist and St. Mary of the Assumption in 2012."
"This church also operated a parish elementary school until June 2005 when that school was closed due to its low enrollment of 130 students. The Reverend Monsignor John Wendrychowicz, the pastor of Saint Josaphat Parish at the time, informed parishioners of the decision in Masses held during the weekend of April 25, 2005, noting that he had also informed teachers and families of the children attending the school he had secured support from the Parish Pastoral and Finance Councils to request permission from Cardinal Justin Rigali, Archbishop of Philadelphia, to close the facility. Students enrolled in Saint Josaphat School at the time were given the option to attend any other parish elementary school for the 2005-2006 school year. A new regional Catholic school, the Holy Child Catholic School, also opened in September 2005. Cardinal Rigali, who granted permission for the closure, said of his decision:"
"""I am grateful to Monsignor Wendrychowicz and Monsignor Beach, for their leadership in making this recommendation to close Saint Josaphat School. I recognize it was guided by a desire for careful stewardship of parish resources and for the pastoral care of parents, children and staff of the school. It is my hope that parents will continue to choose a quality, Catholic education for their children and I pray that the parishioners of St. Josaphat and all the faithful of Manayunk will continue to support Catholic education and be guided by the Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior during this transition."""

The Hamnigan Buryats or Khamnigan are Mongolized Evenks of Tungusic origin.
"Khamnigan is the Buriat-Mongolian term for all Ewenkis. In the early 16th century, the Evenks of Transbaikalia or Khamnigans were tributary to the Khalkha. The Khamnigan are only ethnic group of Tungus origin in Mongolia. They who lived around Nerchinsk and the Aga steppe faced both Cossack demands for tribute and Khori-Buriats trying to occupy their pastures. Most of them came under the Cossack rule and enrolled the Cossack regiments in the Selenge valley. The Khori Buriats occupied most of the Aga steppe and forced the Ewenkis to flee to the Qing Dynasty."
"After 1880 Russia's Khamnigan Evenks moved to semi nomadic herding of cattle, sheep, camels and horses. Some time after 1918 the Evenks, along with their Buriat neighbors, fled over the border into Mongolia and Hulun Buir, establishing the current Khamnigan communities there. The Khamnigan of Mongolia, numbering 300 households, are scattered among the Buriats and speak only the Khamnigan dialect of Buriat language. They live around the Yeruu Lake, Dornod and Khentii provinces as well as Möngönmorit of Töv Province."

"Early lenses suffered from flare and low contrast, worsening as the number of lens-air interfaces increased. The introduction of and improvements in anti-reflective coatings vastly reduced flare; some many-element lens designs which had been abandoned due to low contrast in spite of otherwise excellent performance became practical."
"Lenses designed for use with monochromatic film, first orthochromatic, then panchromatic, had less exacting requirements regarding chromatic aberrations than when colour film is used. When using older lenses today one should check that chromatic aberrations and flare are acceptable for the application."

= = = Ziamet = = =
"Ziamet was a form of land tenure in Ottoman Empire, consisting in grant of lands or revenues by the Ottoman Sultan to an individual in compensation for his services, especially military services. The ziamet system was introduced by Osman I who granted land tenure to his troops. Later this system was expanded by Murad I for his Sipahi."
"The Saljuq state, prior to the rise of the Ottoman State in the 14th century, utilized ziamets in an effort to implement provincial governors, who were also made subordinate chiefs in the military regime. In this pre-Ottoman period, timars were used with other tactics, such as building caravansaries, in an effort to sedentarize nomadic groups. The Ottoman state later took on this ""timar system"" after conquering Anatolia, and it represented just one of several institutions apparent in the Ottoman Empire derived from the Saljuq state."
"The Ottoman Empire came into disarray due to problems asserting ""central government control"" during the 16th and 17th centuries. They needed a way to reassert their military might. Ziamets of Ottoman cavalry were enlarged and turned over to a smaller number of owners, with a longer tenure. Thus, authority in provincial areas turned to police authority as local administrations dissolved, and ziamets were converted into tax-farms or iqta. This conversion of ziamets into tax-farms proved to be the first step to growing provincial control in the Ottoman Empire, as economic decline in the empire gave these stronger provincial governors the chance to assert power.[3]"
"The ziamet-holder acted as an agent of the central Ottoman government in supervising the possession, transfer, and rental of lands within his territory and collecting tax revenue, in return for military service. A timar was not necessarily made up of contiguous property, but could consist of property scattered among different villages."
A timar-holder is a zaim.

A controversial aspect of this was the withdrawal of Muslim children, especially Muslim girls from integrated schools as secular single-sex schooling died out in England. Less controversial were efforts to encourage religious education in Britain to expand beyond the teaching of Islam. The Trust also began supporting efforts to open private Islamic schools in 1974, and by 1992, 23 Islamic schools were open, all supported by the Trust. Important leaders in this movement were Ibrahim Hewitt Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), Afzal Rahman, and Gulam Sarwar.

"Kaldor's facts are six statements about economic growth, proposed by Nicholas Kaldor in his article of 1957. He described these as ""a stylised view of the facts"", which coined the term ""stylized fact."""
Nicholas Kaldor summarized the statistical properties of long-term economic growth in an influential 1957 paper. He pointed out the 6 following 'remarkable historical constancies revealed by recent empirical investigations':
"Kaldor did not claim that any of these quantities would be constant at ""all"" times; on the contrary, growth rates and income shares fluctuate strongly over the business cycle. Instead, his claim was that these quantities tend to be constant when averaging the data over long periods of time. His broad generalizations, which were initially derived from U.S. and U.K. data, but were later found to be true for many other countries as well, came to be known as 'stylized facts'."

Dardilly is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in eastern France.
"Its inhabitants are called ""Dardillois"""
"An undulating town to in the western lyonnais, Dardilly is crossed to the east by the A6 autoroute and the RN6 and to the west by the RN7. Marked by a pleasanter, greener and more rural lifestyle, Dardilly's center is only 20 minutes by car from the Lyons peninsula. (By TCL bus: lines 3, 89, and by train, from the Saint-Paul suburb, - Lozanne)."
"Dardilly, with its , includes three valleys oriented north south: the valley of ruisseau de la Beffe to the west, the valley of the ruisseau des Planches and the valley of the ruisseau de Serres to the east. Its altitude varies between 260 and 390 metres, allowing exceptional views over the , the Monts du Lyonnais and even on clear days the Alps, from Vercors to Mont Blanc."
"The Town also possesses 1.73 km of leafy forests of ones and of farmland. Many paths for walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers criss-cross these spaces:"
Bordering communes include:
"The name Dardilly may originate from the Gallo-Roman name Dardiliacus, if the town was founded in that period, but there is no historic proof for this hypothesis, although the remains of an aqueduct built by Claudius to bring the waters of the Brévenne River (a tributary of the Azergues, itself a tributary of the Saône) to Lyon have been found nearby. More likely, the name Dardilly originated at the time of its first surviving mention, in the 10th century cartulary of Ainay Abbey, which possessed several lands here."
"In the Middle Ages, the village, constructed on a mound, was made up of a church dedicated to Saint Pancras, an adjacent cemetery and about twenty houses. In 1210, at the time of the feudal wars, the Count of Beaujeu tried to seize the city of Lyon and its then archbishop, Renaud II de Forez, fortified Dardilly as part of his defence of Lyon by building a wall and ditch around the existing settlement."
"In the time of Jean-Marie Vianney - the late 18th and early to middle 19th centuries - Dardilly was an agricultural and wine-growing town, with some beautiful houses built by wealthy people from Lyons who spent the summer months here. The population was about 1500 inhabitants. At the end of the 19th century the vines were ravaged by phylloxera and many of the town's inhabitants left for Lyons to find work, bringing the population down to 982 in 1911. The vine-growers that remained went over to growing fruit."
In 1986 Pope John-Paul II visited Dardilly to see Vianney's birthplace on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth.
"The active population of Dardilly is 3546. Out of the employed residents of the commune, 25.6% work in Dardilly, 17.4% work in another TECHLID (Technopole économique de l'Ouest Lyonnais - Technopolis of West Lyonnais) commune, 52.3% work in another (non-TECHLID) commune within the département and 4.7% work outside the département."
Dardilly has several social action groups :
"The town had 1,700 buildings in 1982, compared to 2 821 buildings in 2005. Even though the town's buildings have remained very residential, with a majority being individually owned houses, many of its buildings are social housing."
"The 2 churches, Saint Jean-Marie Vianney et Saint Claude, make up the Catholic parish of Dardilly."
About twenty sports associations and some businesses (e.g. a dance school) give a variety of sports opportunities in Dardilly. The town also has access to several sports facilities:

The aversive or evitative case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case found in Australian Aboriginal languages that indicates that the marked noun is avoided or feared.
"For example, in Walmajarri:"
"The suffix ""-karrarla"" indicates that the action (running away) was carried out in order to avoid the dust storm, ""tjurtu-""."
"The aversive may also be used to mark the object of verbs of fearing. For example, in Djabugay:"
"The aversive may be used on a nominalized verb, to produce an equivalent of English ""lest"". For example, ""lest they be forgotten"" could be encoded as ""to avoid forgetting them""."
"Few languages have a distinct aversive case. Usually, a single case will be used both for the aversive and other functions."
Languages with a distinct aversive case include:
= = = William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center = = =
"The William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center is the long-distance ground travel (rail and bus) terminal serving the Syracuse, New York area. It is served by Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, Megabus, and Trailways. Local and regional bus transportation is provided by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (CENTRO). Various taxi firms service the Center, as well. The Regional Transportation Center is located on the north side of Syracuse, adjacent to the Central New York Regional Market and near Destiny USA."
"Syracuse is served by two trains daily on the ""Lake Shore Limited"", four trains daily of the ""Empire Service"", and two trains daily on the ""Maple Leaf""."
"When the financially desperate New York Central Railroad sold off its elevated right-of-way through downtown Syracuse to the State of New York in 1962, all rail service was re-routed onto a former freight bypass to the north of the city center. The elevated line and train station had been in service for less than 30 years, having replaced tracks that ran at-grade through the center of Washington Street."
"From this time until the late 1990s, bus service remained at the former train station downtown, but with the former train route converted into Interstate 690 (a downtown freeway, in vogue among mid-century urban planners), rail passengers were forced to use a ""temporary"" structure near the freight yards in East Syracuse, opened on August 29, 1962. Both options proved decidedly unpopular, with the train station in particular becoming synonymous with Amtrak's many woes."
"Opened in 1998, the Regional Transportation Center replaced both venues, re-integrating bus and rail service for the first time since the early 1960s. There were provisions built for OnTrack, Syracuse's commuter train line built on the former Lackawanna right-of-way through Armory Square, to call at the station. However, a bridge that was intended to connect the two lines was never built after CSX claimed construction could destabilize its freight rail bridge, and the OnTrack program was axed due to low ridership. The station is named for William F. Walsh, a former mayor of Syracuse and representative in the U.S. Congress."
"The station is built at ground level, with bus loading/unloading areas in front of the main entrance, and stairs and an elevator leading up to the tracks, which are on an embankment. A central concourse with shops and a waiting room links the two areas. Trains call at a single high-level island platform serving one (nominally eastbound) track; provisions were made for cross-platform transfers with OnTrack on the other side, but the program was canceled before service ever reached the station."
"Fifteen CENTRO bus routes serve the Walsh Regional Transportation Center from Auburn, Fulton, Liverpool, Oswego, Phoenix, Skaneateles, Syracuse, and nearby areas."
"The most frequently serviced corridor is between the Regional Transportation Center and the Downtown Syracuse CENTRO Transit Hub (at Salina and Adams Streets), via Route Nos. 16, 46, 50, 116, 216, 316, and 550. Transfers to buses serving other routes may be made at Destiny USA or the Downtown Transit Hub. Standard local fares are $2.00 per person; with children aged 6-9, seniors 65+ and persons with disabilities at $1.00 per person. Children under 6 are free. Fares for the longer distance regional bus routes are on a zone basis, up to $4.00 each way per person for the Auburn (Aub36) line, and $5.00 for the Oswego (Osw46) line."

"The Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) was established in the 1850s to rival the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (C&GU). The new railroad was constructed due to growing concern that the cities of Batavia and Aurora would have an economic downfall since the C&GU bypassed both settlements. The railroad station in Batavia was the first constructed by the CB&Q, and as such, the company took extra care to make it stand out architecturally."
"The wood structure stands two stories tall with red, vertical panels. Originally , a four-room extension was added to the ground floor in 1868. The main structure has a gable roof with Gothic brackets while the extension has a flat roof. The station was later abandoned by the CB&Q, who preferred to maintain only a direct route through Aurora. The station was moved to its current location in 1973 in an effort to preserve it. Renovations were made to restore the building to its 1919 appearance (which was likely very similar to the original). The building was placed on a new cinder block foundation. The new lot also had a basement for a furnace to keep the building open during the winter. The Fox River now lies to the building's east. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 6, 1979."
= = = London Underground mosquito = = =
"The London Underground mosquito is a form of mosquito in the genus ""Culex"". It is found in the London Underground railway system as its name suggests, but has a worldwide distribution and long predates the existence of the London Underground. It was first described as a distinct species from Egyptian specimens by the biologist Peter Forsskål (1732–1763). He named this mosquito ""Culex molestus"" due to its voracious biting, but later biologists renamed it ""Culex pipiens"" f. ""molestus"" because there were no morphological differences between it and ""Culex pipiens"". Notably, this mosquito assaulted Londoners sleeping in the Underground during the Blitz, although similar populations were long known."
"A study from 2004 analyzing DNA microsatellites suggested that ""Culex molestus"" is likely a distinct species from ""Culex pipiens"". However, a more recent paper from 2012 argues that it is more accurately 'a physiological and ecological variant of ""Cx. pipiens"" ' and should not be considered a distinct species."
"This mosquito, although first discovered in Egypt in the late 18th century, has been found in underground systems around the world. Some authors suggested that it adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground ""Culex pipiens"", but the more recent evidence suggests it is a southern mosquito variety related to ""C. pipiens"" that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities."
"Behavioral evidence for this mosquito being a different species from ""C. pipiens"" comes from research by Kate Byrne and Richard Nichols. The species have very different behaviours, are extremely difficult to mate, and with different allele frequencies consistent with genetic drift during a founder event. More specifically, this mosquito, ""C. molestus"", breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above-ground species, which is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and is considered to mostly feed on bird hosts. When the two varieties were crossbred, the eggs were infertile, suggesting reproductive isolation."

= = = Ileocecal valve = = =
"The ileocecal valve (ileal papilla, ileocaecal valve, Tulp's valve, Tulpius valve, Bauhin's valve, ileocecal eminence, valve of Varolius or colic valve) is a sphincter muscle valve that separates the small intestine and the large intestine. Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the ileum. Approximately two liters of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve."
The ileocecal valve is distinctive because it is the only site in the gastrointestinal tract that is used for vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption.
"The histology of the ileocecal valve shows an abrupt change from a villous mucosa pattern of the ileum to a more colonic mucosa. A thickening of the muscularis mucosa, which is the smooth muscle tissue found beneath the mucosal layer of the digestive tract. A thickening of the muscularis externa is also noted."
There is also a variable amount of lymphatic tissue found at the valve.
The ileocecal valve has a papillose structure.
"During colonoscopy, the ileocecal valve is used, along with the appendiceal orifice, in the identification of the cecum. This is important as it indicates that a complete colonoscopy has been performed. The ileocecal valve is typically located on the last fold before entry into the cecum, and can be located from the direction of curvature of the appendiceal orifice, in what is known as the bow and arrow sign."
"Intubation of the ileocecal valve is typically performed in colonoscopy to evaluate the distal, or lowest part of the ileum. Small bowel endoscopy can also be performed by double-balloon enteroscopy through intubation of the ileocecal valve."
"Tumors of the ileocecal valve are rare, but have been reported in the literature."
"It was described by the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp (1593–1674), and thus it is sometimes known as Tulp's valve."
"The valve was also described in 1588 by Gaspard Bauhin—hence the name Bauhin's Valve or Valve of Bauhin—in the preface of his first writing, ""De corporis humani partibus externis tractatus, hactenus non editus."""
= = = Dino Alfieri = = =
Edoardo Alfieri (first name usually shortened to Dino; 8 December 1886 – 12 December 1966) was an Italian fascist politician and diplomat.
"Alfieri was born in Bologna. In 1911 he finished law studies and soon after joined the nationalist group formed by Enrico Corradini. A volunteer in World War I, he was critical of the merger between Corradini's group and Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF). Nonetheless, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the PNF list in 1924."
"Under Mussolini's government, Alfieri was assigned several tasks: between 1929 and 1934, he was co-director of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, deputy secretary of the ""Corporazioni"", and deputy secretary for Press and Propaganda from 1935, assuming the duties of Minister Galeazzo Ciano during the latter's mission in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. When Ciano moved on to become Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dino Alfieri found himself appointed Minister of People's Culture in 1937, and declared himself to the Antisemitical racial segregation laws passed in 1938."
"He was Italy's envoy to the Holy See starting 7 November 1939, and five months later to Nazi Germany (where he often met Adolf Hitler). While there, he was constantly helping out Italian workers and consulate staff. As the war progressed and Italy needed help, he attempted to solicit material aid from Germany but despite assurances little came of it. When the war began to deteriorate for the Axis, he wrote communiques and expressed verbally to Mussolini that the Germans simply saw Italy as a buffer state from the encroaching allies and urged the Duce to seek peace with the allies while simultaneously assuring the Germans that Italy was not betraying them. He was urgently called to Rome in 1943 by members of the Grand Council in order to participate in a meeting. It is unclear as to whether he truly realized what was being proposed at the meeting. A member of the Grand Council of Fascism, he supposedly supported Dino Grandi's coup d'état in July 1943, that led to the fall from power of the Italian Fascist government after 21 years and the arrest of Mussolini. When the Wehrmacht occupied Italy (see Operation Achse), Alfieri fled to Switzerland to save his life."
"In January 1944, he was sentenced to death ""in absentia"" by a kangaroo court during the Verona trial. The Swiss government did not give him political asylum, but tolerated his attendance in Switzerland."
"On 12 November 1946, an Italian court stated his innocence; on 6 February 1947, an inquiry of the Italian Foreign Ministry ended. Then, he was officially pensioned off."
Autocomplete allows quickly typing names in the context of the code. It can be further improved to assist the developer.
"For example, in an XML context, when the developer types an opening tag ""<"" he is offered a list of tags via autocomplete, contextualized following the DTD or XML schema of the document. As the developer types more letters, the offered choices are filtered to only retain the relevant completions. When the developer finally completes the tag, the editor automatically generates the closing tag."
"Other autocomplete techniques exist. For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can just type in the first letter if lowercase and the uppercase letters from a type/variable name then press Ctrl+space to be offered all the choices that match the entered letters that are valid for the current context (class name, interface name, variable or field names)."
Code snippets allow the developer to add a complex coding structure by typing a minimal amount of text. Code snippets can only be used in a valid context (statements snippets are only offered when you can insert statements).
"For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can type in ""instanceof"" then press Ctrl+space which will replace ""instanceof"" by the following code snippet:"
"This code snippet can be further customised by the developer, with the IDE placing the cursor:"
= = = First Leisure Corporation = = =
First Leisure Corporation plc was a leisure operator in the United Kingdom between the years 1981 and 2004.
"Originally based in Soho Square, London, and with other offices in Blackpool and Leicester, its operations included Blackpool Tower, the WinterGardens and all three of Blackpool's piers, as well as five other piers, health and fitness clubs, nightclubs and bars, tenpin bowling centres and other mainstream UK high street entertainment venues."
"In 2000 a management buyout (MBO) financed by 3i and PPM Holdings saw First Leisure shed all but its Nightclubs and Bars division, which retained the First Leisure brand and consisted of approximately fifty mainstream high street venues. The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to Leicester."
"At that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as Esporta."
"By 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony."
"At the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to-month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver."
"A 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear."
"The remaining leases were sold, mostly to long-time rival Luminar Leisure."

"Gillis van Stralen, Antonie's father, was a textile merchant. The family originated in Weert but moved between 1584-1590 to Gorkum, presumably because of Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma's armies marching through the area."
"We don't hear much from Anthonie Verstraelen, until 1635 when he married Catalijntje van Oosten from Antwerp. The location of the wedding is unknown. The couple went to live in Oude Spiegelstraat, near Singel. In Amsterdam Antonie got into a dispute with the Sint Lucasgilde, for its laxness in allowing in too many non-citizen painters."
"In 1641 he was buried in the Westerkerk. In 1644 his two children inherited two hundred guilder each from the sale of their father's paintings. The paintings must have been sold very cheap. His widow remarried their guardian Emmanuel Jacobszoon van Hoogerheijm, an unknown Leiden 'fijnschilder'.

The definitions in the XML Information Set specification are meant to be used in ""other"" specifications that need to refer to the information in a well-formed XML document."
An XML document has an information set if it is well-formed and satisfies the namespace constraints. There is no requirement for an XML document to be valid in order to have an information set.
An information set can contain up to eleven different types of information items:
"XML was initially developed without a formal definition of its infoset. This was only formalised by later work beginning in 1999, first published as a separate W3C Working Draft at the end of December that year."
"Infoset recommendation Second Edition was adopted on 4 February, 2004. If a 2.0 version of the XML standard is ever published, it is likely that this would absorb the Infoset recommendation as an integral part of that standard."
"Infoset augmentation or infoset modification refers to the process of modifying the infoset during schema validation, for example by adding default attributes. The augmented infoset is called the post-schema-validation infoset, or PSVI."
"Infoset augmentation is somewhat controversial, with claims that it is a violation of modularity and tends to cause interoperability problems, since applications get different information depending on whether or not validation has been performed."

Despite what the title suggests, Doomdark himself, who was killed in the first game, does not actually return in the sequel."
"Like its predecessor, ""Doomdark's Revenge"" was a major critical success and a commercial hit. It was supposed to be followed the sequel titled ""Eye of the Moon"" in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, """", was eventually released in 1995."
A novelisation of Doomdark's Revenge has been announced and is planned to be released towards the end of 2019
"The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, the Barbarians, the Dwarfs, the Giants, and the Icelords. The main difference between this game and ""The Lords of Midnight"" is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. The enemy leader, Shareth, also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers. This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some lords can only be recruited by certain others. Certain lords are vassals of certain others, and some may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not, however, automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game. There are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle', as well as magic crowns, and the landscape and its features hold many surprises for the player."
"""Doomdark's Revenge"" reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of the main protagonist Luxor. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the mere rescue of Luxor's son Morkin from Shareth's spell of enchantment and retreat to Midnight, to the complete destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, as well as Luxor's companions Rorthron and Tarithel."

uBiome was a biotechnology company based in San Francisco that has developed technology to sequence the human microbiomes.
"The company was founded by Jessica Richman, Zachary Apte, and Will Ludington who were scientists in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences. In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign. The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz and 8VC."
"As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis. One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
The company currently employs 100 individuals.
"The company filed for bankruptcy on September 4, 2019 in Delaware (case number 19-11938). In an affidavit filed contemporaneously with the bankruptcy petition, Curtis Solsvig, III the acting CEO stated that the bankruptcy action was taken to allow the company to reorganize amidst ""investigations by certain federal and state investigatory bodies."""
"Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set. In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California. In 2016, uBiome received accreditation from the College of American Pathologists."
", the company first amplifies a portion of the bacterial gene that encodes 16S ribosomal RNA using PCR, then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA gene, in order to categorize the bacteria at the genus level. The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons. A 2014 report in ""Xconomy"" said the company outsources the sequencing. The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer."
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.
"uBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andMe, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley."
"Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval. The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues."
The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013.
"In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication."
"In April 2019, FBI agents raided the UBiome office in an investigation over possible insurance fraud. Cofounders Apte and Richman were put on administrative leave pending an investigation by the company's board."

"Iron Tank: The Invasion of Normandy, known as in Japan, is a 1988 top-view action shooting game produced by SNK for the Nintendo Entertainment System."
"This video game is based on SNKs 1985 arcade game ""TNK III"" (which was released as ""TANK"" in Japan). Set during the invasion of Normandy, the player takes control of a commando named Paul and codenamed SNAKE (Colonel Ralf in the Japanese version, who also appeared in ""Ikari Warriors""), as he mans the titular Iron Tank to infiltrate the German stronghold. Within PAL-A regions, it was only released in Australia."
"""Iron Tank"" is considered by some to be a spiritual successor to SNK's earlier game ""Guerilla War"" due to many similarities in gameplay, graphics and overall layout."
"The game opens with the titular tank landing on a beach, then advancing forward while fighting various enemies that include soldiers, officers, tanks of various types and fixed guns. In addition the player will have the opportunity to rescue captured soldiers (some of which give the player intel); and will have to negotiate various other obstacles and enemies such as armored trains, submarines, gunboats, land mines, airplane strafing runs, electric fences and gigantic rocket strikes."
"The tank is controlled by a standard NES controller: Directional buttons control the tank's movement, ""A"" fires the tank's machine-gun, ""B"" fires the main gun, ""Start"" pauses the game on the main screen, and ""Select"" opens the in-game menu. The turret can point in the standard 8 directions and is rotated by simultaneously pressing ""A"" and the desired direction. The turret will maintain its direction on the screen regardless of the tank's movements or facing and using this is part of the game's strategy."
"While in the game, pressing the ""Select"" button will open the in-game menu. From here, the player can activate or deactivate main gun fire options, read incoming radio messages, check progress on the game map and turn on the automated ""Refuel"" option. There are four main gun options, which when activated, alter the main gun's properties. They are:"
"While advancing through the game, the player will also come across power-up icons—red squares with a white letter in them. Some of the benefits from these include:"
"Like most NES action shooters, ""Iron Tank"" is divided into multiple levels, with bosses at the end of each. However, gameplay is continuous; there are no breaks between levels as the defeat of one boss directly leads to the start of the next level. One unique aspect that separates it from other action shooters is the ability of the player choose different paths to the final level by driving down the path of his choice. Some paths have fewer but more difficult levels, resulting in a shorter game if the player can successfully negotiate them while others are the reverse. The paths break and converge at specific points in the game's progress, allowing the player to mix and match level paths as the game progresses."
"The level bosses are various different, powerful weapons that include giant tanks, railway artillery, fortresses and grounded aircraft. Most have some degree of movement either in two directions—such as the railway gun, or freely around the screen like any of the several giant tanks. All of them have predictable movement and firing patterns and exploiting this is necessary to defeat them."

"BroadR-Reach technology is an Ethernet physical layer standard designed for use in automotive connectivity applications. BroadR-Reach technology allows multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cable. Benefits for automotive manufacturers integrating the BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard include reduced connectivity costs and cabling weight, according to Broadcom Corporation, now Broadcom Limited, inventor of the BroadR-Reach standard."
"Using BroadR-Reach technology in automotive enables the migration from multiple closed applications to a single open, scalable Ethernet-based network within the automobile. This allows automotive manufacturers to incorporate multiple electronic systems and devices, such as advanced safety features (i.e. 360- degree surround view parking assistance, rear-view cameras and collision avoidance systems) and comfort and infotainment features. The automotive-qualified BroadR-Reach Ethernet physical layer standard can be combined with IEEE 802.3 compliant switch technology to deliver 100Mbit/s over unshielded single twisted pair cable. This innovation bypasses traditional cabling for Ethernet connectivity, allowing all vehicle components to connect using wires that are lighter and more cost effective."
"The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit and receive (i.e., full-duplex) operations on a single-pair cable. In order to better de-correlate the signal, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements."
"The OPEN Alliance SIG is a special interest group formed by BMW, Broadcom, Freescale, Harman, Hyundai, NXP and STMicroelectronics to establish BroadR-Reach as an open standard and to encourage wide scale adoption of automotive Ethernet as the connectivity standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception in late 2011, membership has reached more than 140 members as of May 31, 2013."
IEEE 802.3 has standardized 100BASE-T1 in IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96.
