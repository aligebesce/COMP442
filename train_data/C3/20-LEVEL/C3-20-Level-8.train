It was your hair that got me.
Well the grey come through and I was just sort of I thought I can't wait all those years  with dark hair.
"I had a friend who had long hair and she, she let it grow right the way through."
And for nearly seven years she looked like an old woman of eighty.
Yes.

"Oh, no  doing that."
"Oh, don't be stupid,"
Some of us have done it before.
"Erm, it's like nobody turned up."

Yeah.
It's come to me.
"Oh not a big team is it, again?"
Tottenham.

Mark  told me that.
It was on his picture list.
Really?
That night we were gonna play Tottenham
Oh well.
in the league.
Oh sorry.
Perhaps we can play Tottenham when they haven't got er Gary Lineker in  their games any more.
Yeah.
You start hitting periods like this and you think  oh no.
You think every team  you start worrying about almost every side don't you?
Yeah.
Oh we always worry about every side cos Crystal Palace  always hate the  bad sides.
Cos usually we do well against the Man United and as soon as we start  losing against them we start getting worried.
They outplayed us last season at fairground didn't they?
Liverpool
What do you mean  at Liverpool?
What did Liverpool do to them then?
Well we lost  no we beat them two one
Yeah.
I remember that.
Most surprising result of that season.
Not really.
I'll turn it.
I hope we can get out at the road end.
"Have you stuck a poster in, no you haven't, in the back window?"
"No, I haven't."
I think more people see the back
"Well I know, cos"
coming up that way than they do the front window.
"a lot of people go to  now, more people"
Yeah.
"there, yeah."
So they'll see it
Yes.
both ways.
I'm gonna stick one in the back as well.
Have I got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
Oh!
I haven't got my purse.
"Oh well, brilliant!"
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I haven't got a key to get back in the house.
If you just stop here I'll run over the road.
If you give me the key please.
Thanks.
Ooh!
There's a car wants to be in.
It's there.
Sorry!
He didn't look very pleased did he?
If he was in a such a desperate hurry he could have gone down and gone  over there.
We don't usually get a second post on a Saturday.
"We do, you get a parcel delivery."
Oh yeah.
I'll tell you to get knotted!
"It's my house, you've got no permission!"
Did you
Well we're not gonna be doing anything!
"Well like, upstairs!"
"Well I'm not gonna take it round, why?"
It's only gonna downstairs in the living room!
.
"Right  I'll, I'll ju ju I'll just pretend I'm listening to it."
I'll take the things with me.
I'll just pretend I'm listening to it  and I'll just put it on the side and just the switch the thing on they'll never know the difference.
The answer is  So  is he paying you?
About twenty five pound.
Do you?
You kidding me or what?
No.
Why didn't he come to my house for?
Oh!
Honestly?
Yeah!
And how long you gotta do it for?
A week.
Barry's so mad!
How many tapes you got?
Twenty.
"No way, man!"
I wanna do it!
Tell him to come to my house next time!
Twenty five quid for doing that!
Trust you to in!
You don't have to fill all the tapes either!
Trust you lot to come up .
Yeah.
"And you measured it with a protractor,"
Mm.
"it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one."
Yeah.
"The gradient is the tan of the angle, but you can only read that off the graph if you've got the same units."
Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be  let's say someone gave you this  find an approximation for the gradient  erm Y equals X squared  minus one.
X squared?
"Y equals X squared minus one, at around the point where X equals three."
Someone wanted to know the gradient.
"So, so"
Ooh.
you d you'd have to find Y.
Okay.
So Y is three squared minus one.
Yeah okay.
be Y would equal eight.
Yeah.
Erm  so
Good.
"Right, draw a sketch, cos we need to know what we're working with here."
So Y could perhaps equal  three.
the rest of the graph
the opposite point.
Right.
Good.
It's symmetrical down the Y axis.
And  the lowest point.
It'd be about one .
About one.
"What's the graph going to look like here, when X is very big?"
.
Bury one thousand eight hundred and eighty six people!
Dreadful isn't it?
Who's that with seventeen thousand?
Wow West Brom.
"See West Brom, really a first division team."
They shouldn't be in the third division.
the figures is irrelevant isn't it?
Yeah.
The figures are irrelevant.
"Tradition that is, West Brom."
Just tradition.
They're getting bigger
Even if they went out the league they'd get that number.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been a West Brom supporter
They wouldn't be able to afford to keep the ground on would they?
all my life.
What?
They wouldn't be able to afford to keep the ground on if they went out
Well I mean it shows you what marvellous West Brom were.
When West Brom got lost four nil to Woking  wasn't it Paulie?
"The next round they had West Brom supporters supporting, came down from"
Yeah.
Birmingham to support Woking in the next round.
Yeah.
It's pretty good isn't it?
But that's all much of a muchness isn't it?
Nothing over four.
No.
was right.
We er we would have played  Tottenham on the night of the Q P R game.
Material  gone on first.
Oh yes
"procedure for any tackle, if you haven't got any the cover must go that way."
"oh I, I'd never, I I realize now from six weeks ago when I got the damn things"
Yeah.
and it's gone blank.
Of course the top material's gotta go on first Joan hasn't it?
Yes.
What am I?
Mm.
Yeah.
Star pupil for doing such silly things .
So really I'm stymied on that aren't I?
What I'll do today
Yeah you'll have to take those er those off and machine them all together.
You can use them on something else.
Yeah well that's no problem.
"What I'll do, I'll measure up today for er"
Yeah
the top material  work out a plan for how much I'll want.
How much you need.
I'll try and get through the  neutrally.
I dunno
"Yeah, how many have, have you got?"
Six.
Six?
Cos I might be putting a table in the sale  on its own  but it's a it's dark
Oh
i it's darker than that.
oh.
Yeah.
"Well actually it's mahogany, it's brown mahogany."
Yeah.
"And the old stuff is much more interesting, don't like the new stuff."

There's timesharing and
Different

Haven't got any what?
That is right isn't it?
One pint is
Well a quart is two pints.
Yeah.
And point five of a quart is one pint.
That makes it three pints.
Why they can't put three pints on instead of one point five quarts .
But does she want a three to four one?
If she wants a three to four you gotta have the next size up.
Three stroke four
Well she said  three or four.
Oh I see.

What's worrying you?
"Och, I don't know."
I haven't the foggiest.

I feel awfully depressed as well.
Right.
Whether it's this pain that's doing it I know I don't know.

Aye.
What's that in English?
Well one quart is two pints.
And a half a quart is one pint.
Right.
That'd make it the three pints.
So you'd want the next one up wouldn't you?
That would be that one.
Well it's a three or four pints she's after.
It's probably a four
It doesn't look big enough.
Are you sure it says one point five quarts?
Well it says it on there somewhere.
one point five quart.
Well.
Perhaps it's  perhaps they hold more than you think they do.
I don't know..
What do you think Dinda?
Should I take this one?
While
Erm

Between would be three.
"Up one  that, we'll just take ."
What will Y be when X is that?
Erm two point nine nine squared minus one.
Okay.
"So you'd just write it as, I mean as it's minus one, you can take it off as you go along, but it's, sometimes it'll be a minus six or something, so write it as two point nine nine squared minus one."
Erm  three  squared minus one.
Okay.

that Y from that one.
Okay.

Mm.
But you all said  that it depends on his skill or his what's his name
Or how many kids he's got.
"If I've got twenty five kids and you've only got one yo , I need more than you!"
So how can you possibly all earn the same?
Why not?
"Well you wouldn't have enough would you, to su sustain all those"
Yeah.

Erm

"I suppose you should tell them that you're going to tape the conversation maybe, yeah."
Yes.
I don't suppose that matters really.
"But I mean, if you erm  if you put your headphones on you see, they might just think erm  you're listening to a Walkman."
And er  they would come up with some bad language towards you.
Then especially if you told them you were recording what they  said .

"So the gradient there, is S over T, how far you've travelled."
"Let's say these, let's say we mark this off in one second intervals along here."
If I got the intervals right they'd be the same.

Yeah.

Mind you the firm that was in there Blue Bag I mean they abused the bloody place they did.
Aye.
They knocked it about something terrible.
Yeah.
"So I mean  sooner or later  would have been had to  to do, do up you know?"
Mm.
"And these people decide whether they want the place, and the ideal place for them."
Whether they want so
Er fourteen to twenty one.
That's what it is.
It's fourteen to twenty one.
What's that.
Mm.
Eh?
Opt er optional calories  .
"Well there ain't much that'd be fourteen to twenty, twenty calories is there?"
No.
You've got fourteen er fourteen options.

Thing is to do .

Ooh  it's early in the morning.
Yeah well I said to you
"There was skid marks all over and the traffic was right back down the A seventeen, when I got there it"
Would it be sort of before your dad went?
Perhaps say quarter to nine?

He wants another glass of sherry grandma.

It'd be broad daylight so it'd be a bit later.
"And that's all you have, you don't have"
Yeah.
And left  left
Well I only said whatever you want to do.
Do you wanna go up for suit .
"I said, that's all we want."
"Now, you know"
"We go out to win on the night, we're playing tomorrow"
Exactly!
and we go out to win.
Everybody goes on about .
"If we win without it, we come in the first five that's all well and good."
"We you go out, do you go out to win?"
Everybody
But
does that.
you don't argue about it.
"If we lose, we lose."
"You don't, I mean I'd like to win it every bloody week but, I'd be chuffed."
I'd be as happy as a dog with two dicks!
I mean they stopped us Friday didn't they?
They thought it would stop us didn't they?
You thought it would stop us as good as they did.
"What, seven two was it"
Six
or
"No, six."

one of them.
Mm.
"I mean we played good, but just  couldn't get out and they did."
Well the door was open and nobody were worried about that.
Don't you remember that thirty doubles.
"What, they got it?"
"Thing is  I, I just I can't work ."
No.
I   go sick
No.
somehow I haven't been able to work
"No, okay."
because I'm really worried
Mm.
"when I think about it I think  I just can't work, it's like, I've lost interest  whenever I find some  I feel I'm able to keep up"
Mm
which is something I
Mm.
"I mean want to  I have considered going back to er, training and cancel this"

"Unless you're a chicken, or to put it boldly, animals have rights too!"
But exactly what rights do they have?
And does supporting animal rights justify violence?
"The animal rights lobby is a forceful one  by various means, some legal, some not, some specific, some violent."
Campaigners seek to convince the unconverted that animals deserve a better deal!
Which animals?
"a and, and, and the S on the M as it were."
Yes.
Right.
"The oth the other, the other option is for us to hold that."
because it was supposed to be briefed last
Mm.

"Well in that, in that case"
when
"I've seen, I've seen all this"
Mm.
in that case when
It is ours.
Well we can't
We've got a
Right.
"In that case Jim you say to your staff that you're gonna have a dialogue with Dave  and myself, with a view to confirming how it will be implemented as far as your organization is concerned."
But surely
"we can still issue it, we can still brief"
This issue
that issue?
Of course you can.
Yes.
Well.
It is
work
It's been issued Roger.
"I think, I, I personally, I think everyone's got to work to it until they find it doesn't work."
"Ca can't you just, can't Jim just brief his staff, but er as far as that's concerned w he takes it that the Q S has asked him to do all the site measurement er and that they will then produce the certification"
Mm.
based on that?
Yeah.
"No,"
What's  what stinks then?
"Oh I didn't want to tell you this Phil, but"
What?
it's the
you've gotta
"No, this isn't gonna smell, I like the condom it's wearing"
It's just the things you poke your hairs up on a sharp stick
You can do a blue movie with this thing
What?
"Do shut up, what's that doing in there?"
Get it out
Oh dear
Have a goody
"Oh thank you, oh I love these, what you done to them?"
"Don't know, they're melting"
What have you done?
I use that thing  which sort of congeals them together
"That was a long word, congeal"
Here's another word conjugal
"I don't know why, good God what the hell's he doing over the road?"
He's not in the middle of the road
"He's not supposed to be in there, what the bike is doing, you're not allowed to go on this road"
It's a woman
I rest my case
Yeah
Women
Erm  close your window
Why?
otherwise you'll knock out the record
"Oh, sorry about that"
I thought  was cold
"No, I can't see the argument!"
"Well, to me you shouldn't have twenty five kids anyway!"
Well that's dictatorship
"Because because it, I would have a dictatorship on that!"
"I mean that's, I would have"
"Well that's, alright well  well that's"
"control of the world population, I se"
I would limit to two children.
"I would er, have control of the"
That's another argument!
world population.
Well fair enough!
But
Yeah.
that is another argument!
"It is, we're on the road ."
"That is er, that would mu , that would be my first priority."
Oh !
I thought your first one was everyone getting
I'm not go
the same pay!
"Yes, so everybody"
So
would need the same pay.
"But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever"
"No, but I mean  I mean"
"there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts  because people would manage money differently"
Differently
some would spend it
Of course they would!
as soon as they get it
Oh yeah.
On their own
singularly
That's a long word isn't it?
Singularly yeah that's not so bad
What's it mean?
"Something to do with singling,si si singing"
We  we can have a game of count down masters
Count down masters
cogitation  don't follow that one up
Mm
"Come on oh the loo, how much further is it?"
I'm getting desperate
Ah desperate's a good word
"Desperado, singular desperate"
Mm
Latin for desperado
"Oh dear   oh it's down about here when, did it the other day, and the woman just drove out straight in front of me from another lane"
Lovely
"I just, I mean, why bother having roundabouts I ask myself"
Well it was a woman come on
Yes it was a woman
"women don't comprehend roundabouts, driving cars"
Oh
"you should know that by now, nothing is ever"
it is an excuse
What?
er don't put your ear piece to the micro to my blooming sweets
I'm not keen on  ear droppings in my sweets
"They're not mine, don't worry"
"Mm, I know"
"I love it, I love it."
So why have you started taking up the bag?
What  ?
"And straight away we say, well this procedure, doesn't work."
Yeah.
But it's
Right.
Yeah.
"come out, it's come out early."
Damn it all.
"We had a procedure erm about senior project engineers, er about two years before we"
We've gotta keep repeating that.
Er
does it?
put that into the bridge office in
Mhm.
intended .
Right.
"The thing with this , the thing that puzzles me a bit er"
Just because you booked that
"on this, and I'll reiterate this, is the process that we go through as I understand it for introducing procedures, is that we take a diagonal slice through the organization  er in other words there's a draft procedure produced."
That is sent round to people who will have been involved.
"They have the opportunity to input, it is amended er taking account of, of the comments"
Taking account of some of the comments.
It can never take account of all the comments.
Of course it can't.
It will always be compromise.
But by a very virtue of the draft going round and being commented on people are aware then
We don't see
.
Mm.
all the drafts
No.

"Then she came over , sat down beside me , and took me in her arms . ''"
"` Do n't cry , dear little Rilla-my-Rilla ."
"You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to Fred ; and if Leslie West 's son asked you to keep your lips for him , I think you may consider yourself engaged to him ."
"But -- oh , my baby -- my last little baby -- I have lost you -- the war has made a woman of you too soon . '"
`` I shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mother 's hugs .
"Nevertheless , when I saw Fred marching by two days later in the parade , my heart ached unbearably ."
`` But I 'm glad mother thinks I 'm really engaged to Ken ! ''
"CHAPTER XXII LITTLE DOG MONDAY KNOWS `` It is two years tonight since the dance at the light , when Jack Elliott brought us news of the war ."
"Do you remember , Miss Oliver ? ''"
Cousin Sophia answered for Miss Oliver .
"`` Oh , indeed , Rilla , I remember that evening only too well , and you a-prancing down here to show off your party clothes ."
Did n't I warn you that we could not tell what was before us ?
Little did you think that night what was before you . ''
"`` Little did any of us think that , '' said Susan sharply , `` not being gifted with the power of prophecy ."
"It does not require any great foresight , Sophia Crawford , to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over ."
I could do as much myself . ''
"`` We all thought the war would be over in a few months then , '' said Rilla wistfully ."
`` When I look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it . ''
"`` And now , two years later , it is no nearer the end than it was then , '' said Miss Oliver gloomily ."
Susan clicked her knitting-needles briskly .
"`` Now , Miss Oliver , dear , you know that is not a reasonable remark ."
"You know we are just two years nearer the end , whenever the end is appointed to be . ''"
"`` Albert read in a Montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more , '' was Cousin Sophia 's cheerful contribution ."
"`` It ca n't , '' cried Rilla ; then she added with a sigh , `` Two years ago we would have said ` It ca n't last two years . '"
But five more years of this ! ''
"`` If Rumania comes in , as I have strong hopes now of her doing , you will see the end in five months instead of five years , '' said Susan ."
"`` I 've no faith in furriners , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The French are foreigners , '' retorted Susan , `` and look at Verdun ."
And think of all the Somme victories this blessed summer .
The Big Push is on and the Russians are still going well .
"Why , General Haig says that the German officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war . ''"
"`` You ca n't believe a word the Germans say , '' protested Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The dog is mine , and I shall do with him as I think fit ."
"He is sold , and that is all there is about it ."
Go on with your dinner . ''
But Ernest for the first time did not obey .
"He snatched his cap from the back of his chair , dashed it down over his eyes , and ran from the kitchen with a sob choking his breath ."
"Uncle Richard looked angry , but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him ."
"`` Do n't be vexed with the boy , Richard , '' she said ."
`` You know he is very fond of Laddie .
"He 's had to do with him ever since he was a pup , and no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him ."
I 'm rather sorry myself that you have sold the dog . ''
"`` Well , he is sold and there 's an end of it ."
I do n't say but that the dog is a good dog .
"But he is of no use to us , and twenty dollars will come in mighty handy just now ."
"He 's worth that to Bob , for he is a good watch dog , so we 've both made a fair bargain . ''"
Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie .
"I had taken no part in the discussion , for I felt no great interest in the matter ."
"Laddie was a nice dog ; Ernest was a quiet , inoffensive little fellow , five years younger than myself ; that was all I thought about either of them ."
I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard 's farm on the Nova Scotian Bay of Fundy shore .
"I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard , partly because he had been much attached to my mother , his only sister , partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son , who had died several years before ."
"Uncle Richard was a stern , undemonstrative man , but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me , and I always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place ."
"`` What are you going to do this afternoon , Ned ? ''"
"he asked , after the disturbance caused by Ernest 's outbreak had quieted down ."
"`` I think I 'll row out to Island Rock , '' I replied ."
`` I want to take some views of the shore from it . ''
Uncle Richard nodded .
He was much interested in my new camera .
"`` If you 're on it about four o'clock , you 'll get a fine view of the ` Hole in the Wall ' when the sun begins to shine on the water through it , '' he said ."
`` I 've often thought it would make a handsome picture . ''
"`` After I 've finished taking the pictures , I think I 'll go down shore to Uncle Adam 's and stay all night , '' I said ."
"`` Jim 's dark room is more convenient than mine , and he has some pictures he is going to develop tonight , too . ''"
I started for the shore about two o'clock .
"Ernest was sitting on the woodpile as I passed through the yard , with his arms about Laddie 's neck and his face buried in Laddie 's curly hair ."
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
There could n't be a better child and you 'd hardly know she was in the house . ''
"`` Dora is too good , '' said Anne ."
`` She 'd behave just as well if there was n't a soul to tell her what to do .
"She was born already brought up , so she does n't need us ; and I think , '' concluded Anne , hitting on a very vital truth , `` that we always love best the people who need us ."
Davy needs us badly . ''
"`` He certainly needs something , '' agreed Marilla ."
`` Rachel Lynde would say it was a good spanking . ''
"XI Facts and Fancies `` Teaching is really very interesting work , '' wrote Anne to a Queen 's Academy chum ."
`` Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I do n't find it so .

"Jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches , which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous ."
This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell ` speckled ' and could n't manage it .
"` Well , ' he said finally , ' I ca n't spell it but I know what it means . ' ''"
` What ? '
I asked . ''
"` St. Clair Donnell 's face , miss . '"
"`` St. Clair is certainly very much freckled , although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it ... for I was freckled once and well do I remember it ."
But I do n't think St. Clair minds .
It was because Jimmy called him ` St. Clair ' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school .
"I heard of the pounding , but not officially , so I do n't think I 'll take any notice of it ."
`` Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition .

"A mouthful , ' said Lottie ."

"`` It 's so hard not to laugh , Stella ."
"I have to save up all my amusement until I get home , and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause ."
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began .
`` Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE ?
Rose Bell says he was ... also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament .
Claude White says a ` glacier ' is a man who puts in window frames !
"`` I think the most difficult thing in teaching , as well as the most interesting , is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things ."
One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves .
Also that there were very few birds in winter .
"` Of course they might want your clothes , ' he had to admit rather falteringly ."
She was somewhat indignant at this .
"` They are always thinking of their nests , ' he said apologetically , ` and there are some bits of you ' -- he stroked the fur on her pelisse -- ` that would excite them very much . '"
"` They sha n't have my fur , ' she said sharply ."
"` No , ' he said , still fondling it , however , ` no ."
"O Maimie , ' he said rapturously , ` do you know why I love you ?"
It is because you are like a beautiful nest . '
Somehow this made her uneasy . '
"I think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now , ' she said , holding back , and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird ."
"` After all , ' she said , ` you are only a Betwixt-and-Between . '"
"But it hurt him so much that she immediately added , ` It must be a delicious thing to be . '"
"` Come and be one , then , dear Maimie , ' he implored her , and they set off for the boat , for it was now very near Open-Gate time ."
"` And you are not a bit like a nest , ' he whispered to please her ."
"` But I think it is rather nice to be like one , ' she said in a woman 's contradictory way ."
"` And , Peter , dear , though I ca n't give them my fur , I would n't mind their building in it ."
Fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it !
"O Peter , how perfectly lovely ! '"
"-LSB- Illustration : Building the house for Maimie -RSB- But as they drew near the Serpentine , she shivered a little , and said , ` Of course I shall go and see mother often , quite often ."
"It is not as if I was saying good-bye for ever to mother , it is not in the least like that . '"
"` Oh no , ' answered Peter , but in his heart he knew it was very like that , and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her ."
"He was so fond of her , he felt he could not live without her ."
"` She will forget her mother in time , and be happy with me , ' he kept saying to himself , and he hurried her on , giving her thimbles by the way ."
"But even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness , she still talked tremblingly about her mother ."
"` You know quite well , Peter , do n't you , ' she said , ` that I would n't come unless I knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to ?"
"Peter , say it . '"
"He said it , but he could no longer look her in the face ."
"` If you are sure your mother will always want you , ' he added rather sourly ."
` The idea of mother 's not always wanting me ! '
"Maimie cried , and her face glistened ."
"` If she does n't bar you out , ' said Peter huskily ."
"` The door , ' replied Maimie , ` will always , always be open , and mother will always be waiting at it for me . '"
"cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement , `` I 'm going to stay . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched , for Nan was a kindred spirit , and he foresaw `` larks '' in the future ."
"`` I can bat ; let me play , '' said Nan , who could turn her hand to any thing , and did not mind hard knocks ."
"`` We ai n't playing now , and our side beat without you . ''"
"`` I can beat you in running , any way , '' returned Nan , falling back on her strong point ."
`` Can she ? ''
asked Nat of Jack .
"`` She runs very well for a girl , '' answered Jack , who looked down upon Nan with condescending approval ."
`` Will you try ? ''
"said Nan , longing to display her powers ."
"`` It 's too hot , '' and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted ."
`` What 's the matter with Stuffy ? ''
"asked Nan , whose quick eyes were roving from face to face ."
"`` Ball hurt his hand ; he howls at every thing , '' answered Jack scornfully ."
"`` I do n't , I never cry , no matter how I 'm hurt ; it 's babyish , '' said Nan , loftily ."
`` Pooh !
"I could make you cry in two minutes , '' returned Stuffy , rousing up ."
`` See if you can . ''
"`` Go and pick that bunch of nettles , then , '' and Stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall ."
"Nan instantly `` grasped the nettle , '' pulled it up , and held it with a defiant gesture , in spite of the almost unbearable sting ."
"`` Good for you , '' cried the boys , quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex ."
"More nettled than she was , Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow , and he said tauntingly , `` You are used to poking your hands into every thing , so that is n't fair ."
"Now go and bump your head real hard against the barn , and see if you do n't howl then . ''"
"`` Do n't do it , '' said Nat , who hated cruelty ."
"But Nan was off , and running straight at the barn , she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat , and sounded like a battering-ram ."
"Dizzy , but undaunted , she staggered up , saying stoutly , though her face was drawn with pain , `` That hurt , but I do n't cry . ''"
"`` Do it again , '' said Stuffy angrily ; and Nan would have done it , but Nat held her ; and Tommy , forgetting the heat , flew at Stuffy like a little game-cock , roaring out , `` Stop it , or I 'll throw you over the barn ! ''"
and so shook and hustled poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels .
"`` She told me to , '' was all he could say , when Tommy let him alone ."
"`` Never mind if she did ; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl , '' said Demi , reproachfully ."
`` Ho !
"`` Now here , '' he cried , `` on my right hand , I swear to avenge it !"
"If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men 's souls for each , may this hand wither from my body !"
"I broke this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggared him to his door ; I burned the thatch above his head ; I drove him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ?"
"Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! ''"
"He was silent for some time , his face working ."
`` Eat ! ''
"he cried , suddenly ."
"`` And you here , '' he added to Matcham , `` swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . ''"
"`` I will pledge mine honour , '' replied Matcham ."
`` What make I with your honour ? ''
cried the knight .
`` Swear me upon your mother 's welfare ! ''
"Matcham gave the required oath ; and Sir Daniel re-adjusted the hood over his face , and prepared his bell and staff ."
To see him once more in that appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions .
But the knight was soon upon his feet .
"`` Eat with despatch , '' he said , `` and follow me yarely to mine house . ''"
"And with that he set forth again into the woods ; and presently after the bell began to sound , numbering his steps , and the two lads sat by their untasted meal , and heard it die slowly away up hill into the distance ."
`` And so ye go to Tunstall ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` Yea , verily , '' said Matcham , `` when needs must !"
I am braver behind Sir Daniel 's back than to his face . ''
"They ate hastily , and set forth along the path through the airy upper levels of the forest , where great beeches stood apart among green lawns , and the birds and squirrels made merry on the boughs ."
"Two hours later , they began to descend upon the other side , and already , among the tree-tops , saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House ."
"`` Here , '' said Matcham , pausing , `` ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y ' are to see no more ."
"Come , Dick , forgive him what he did amiss , as he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . ''"
`` And wherefore so ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . ''"
"`` Ye 'll never again see poor Jack Matcham , '' replied the other , `` that was so fearful and burthensome , and yet plucked you from the river ; ye 'll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! ''"
"He held his arms open , and the lads embraced and kissed ."
"`` And , Dick , '' continued Matcham , `` my spirit bodeth ill ."
"Y ' are now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly , and fortune followed him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he runs the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of us ."
"When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John ."
"There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me ."
"Feared he was , and proud ."
"They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them ."
"Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers ."
"Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . ''"
"`` Well , I tell you now , '' replied the lad , `` I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . ''"
"`` And a brave lad you were , and smart too , '' answered Silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . ''"
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms .
"By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard ."
"But on this point I was soon to be relieved , for Silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party ."
"`` Dick 's square , '' said Silver ."
"`` Oh , I know 'd Dick was square , '' returned the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands ."
"`` He 's no fool , is Dick . ''"
And he turned his quid and spat .
"`` But look here , '' he went on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?"
"I 've had a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder !"
"I want to go into that cabin , I do ."
"I want their pickles and wines , and that . ''"
"`` Israel , '' said Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever was ."
"But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough ."
"Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? ''"
growled the coxswain .
"`` What I say is , when ?"
That 's what I say . ''
`` When !
By the powers ! ''
cried Silver .
"`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when ."
"The last moment I can manage , and that 's when ."
"Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us ."
But I just want to say something that may help you over the worst when you hear that I 've gone ` west . '
"I 've a premonition about you , Rilla , as well as about myself ."
I think Ken will go back to you -- and that there are long years of happiness for you by-and-by .
"And you will tell your children of the Idea we fought and died for -- teach them it must be lived for as well as died for , else the price paid for it will have been given for nought ."
"This will be part of your work , Rilla ."
"And if you -- all you girls back in the homeland -- do it , then we who do n't come back will know that you have not ` broken faith ' with us ."
"`` I meant to write to Una tonight , too , but I wo n't have time now ."
"Read this letter to her and tell her it 's really meant for you both -- you two dear , fine loyal girls ."
"Tomorrow , when we go over the top -- I 'll think of you both -- of your laughter , Rilla-my-Rilla , and the steadfastness in Una 's blue eyes -- somehow I see those eyes very plainly tonight , too ."
"Yes , you 'll both keep faith -- I 'm sure of that -- you and Una ."
And so -- goodnight .
We go over the top at dawn . ''
Rilla read her letter over many times .
"There was a new light on her pale young face when she finally stood up , amid the asters Walter had loved , with the sunshine of autumn around her ."
"For the moment at least , she was lifted above pain and loneliness ."
"`` I will keep faith , Walter , '' she said steadily ."
"`` I will work -- and teach -- and learn -- and laugh , yes , I will even laugh -- through all my years , because of you and because of what you gave when you followed the call . ''"
Rilla meant to keep Walter 's letter as a a sacred treasure .
"But , seeing the look on Una Meredith 's face when Una had read it and held it back to her , she thought of something ."
Could she do it ?
"Oh , no , she could not give up Walter 's letter -- his last letter ."
Surely it was not selfishness to keep it .
A copy would be such a soulless thing .
"But Una -- Una had so little -- and her eyes were the eyes of a woman stricken to the heart , who yet must not cry out or ask for sympathy ."
"`` Una , would you like to have this letter -- to keep ? ''"
she asked slowly .
"`` Yes -- if you can give it to me , '' Una said dully ."
"`` Then -- you may have it , '' said Rilla hurriedly ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Una ."
"It was all she said , but there was something in her voice which repaid Rilla for her bit of sacrifice ."
Una took the letter and when Rilla had gone she pressed it against her lonely lips .
Una knew that love would never come into her life now -- it was buried for ever under the blood-stained soil `` Somewhere in France . ''
`` Course I do .
But you ca n't be a gemplum till you grow up . ''
"`` Oh , indeed you can , '' Anne hastened to say , thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes ."
`` You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy .
And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies ... or forget to say thank you ... or pull anybody 's hair . ''
"`` They do n't have much fun , that 's a fact , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` I guess I 'll wait till I 'm grown up to be one . ''
"Marilla , with a resigned air , had cut another piece of cake for Dora ."
She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then .
"It had been a hard day for her , what with the funeral and the long drive ."
At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself .
"The twins were not noticeably alike , although both were fair ."
Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order .
Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head .
Dora 's hazel eyes were gentle and mild ; Davy 's were as roguish and dancing as an elf 's .
"Dora 's nose was straight , Davy 's a positive snub ; Dora had a `` prunes and prisms '' mouth , Davy 's was all smiles ; and besides , he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other , which gave him a dear , comical , lopsided look when he laughed ."
Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face .
"`` They 'd better go to bed , '' said Marilla , who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them ."
`` Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable .
"You 're not afraid to sleep alone , are you , Davy ? ''"
"`` No ; but I ai n't going to bed for ever so long yet , '' said Davy comfortably ."
"`` Oh , yes , you are . ''"
"That was all the much-tried Marilla said , but something in her tone squelched even Davy ."
He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne .
"`` When I 'm grown up the very first thing I 'm going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like , '' he told her confidentially ."
In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins ' sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver .
Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it ; but it seemed so by reason of its novelty .
"There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it ; but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival , on Sunday morning ... a fine , warm day , as hazy and mild as September ."
Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora .
Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed .
`` Marilla washed it yesterday ... and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral .
That 's enough for one week .
"I just hoped he would go on forgetting about Jims , Mrs. Crawford . ''"
"`` And then your pa would have the expense of raising him , '' said Cousin Sophia reprovingly ."
`` You young creeturs are terrible thoughtless . ''
"Jims himself ran in at this juncture , so rosy and curly and kissable , that he extorted a qualified compliment even from Cousin Sophia ."
"`` He 's a reel healthy-looking child now , though mebbee his colour is a mite too high -- sorter consumptive looking , as you might say ."
I never thought you 'd raise him when I saw him the day after you brung him home .
I reely did not think it was in you and I told Albert 's wife so when I got home .
"Albert 's wife says , says she , ` There 's more in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for , Aunt Sophia . '"
Them was her very words .
` More in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for . '
Albert 's wife always had a good opinion of you . ''
"Cousin Sophia sighed , as if to imply that Albert 's wife stood alone in this against the world ."
But Cousin Sophia really did not mean that .
She was quite fond of Rilla in her own melancholy way ; but young creeturs had to be kept down .
If they were not kept down society would be demoralized .
`` Do you remember your walk home from the light two years ago tonight ? ''
"whispered Gertrude Oliver to Rilla , teasingly ."
"`` I should think I do , '' smiled Rilla ; and then her smile grew dreamy and absent ; she was remembering something else -- that hour with Kenneth on the sandshore ."
Where would Ken be tonight ?
And Jem and Jerry and Walter and all the other boys who had danced and moonlighted on the old Four Winds Point that evening of mirth and laughter -- their last joyous unclouded evening .
"In the filthy trenches of the Somme front , with the roar of the guns and the groans of stricken men for the music of Ned Burr 's violin , and the flash of star shells for the silver sparkles on the old blue gulf ."
"Two of them were sleeping under the Flanders poppies -- Alec Burr from the Upper Glen , and Clark Manley of Lowbridge ."
Others were wounded in the hospitals .
But so far nothing had touched the manse and the Ingleside boys .
They seemed to bear charmed lives .
Yet the suspense never grew any easier to bear as the weeks and months of war went by .
"`` It is n't as if it were some sort of fever to which you might conclude they were immune when they had n't taken it for two years , '' sighed Rilla ."
`` The danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches .
"I know this , and it tortures me every day ."
And yet I ca n't help hoping that since they 've come this far unhurt they 'll come through .
"Oh , Miss Oliver , what would it be like not to wake up in the morning feeling afraid of the news the day would bring ?"
I ca n't picture such a state of things somehow .
No one but herself -- and perhaps Rilla -- knew it -- would ever know it .
She had no right in the eyes of her world to grieve .
She must hide and bear her long pain as best she could -- alone .
"But she , too , would keep faith ."
CHAPTER XXIV MARY IS JUST IN TIME The autumn of 1916 was a bitter season for Ingleside .
"Mrs. Blythe 's return to health was slow , and sorrow and loneliness were in all hearts ."
Every one tried to hide it from the others and `` carry on '' cheerfully .
Rilla laughed a good deal .
"Nobody at Ingleside was deceived by her laughter ; it came from her lips only , never from her heart ."
"But outsiders said some people got over trouble very easily , and Irene Howard remarked that she was surprised to find how shallow Rilla Blythe really was ."
"`` Why , after all her pose of being so devoted to Walter , she does n't seem to mind his death at all ."
Nobody has ever seen her shed a tear or heard her mention his name .
She has evidently quite forgotten him .
Poor fellow -- you 'd really think his family would feel it more .
"I spoke of him to Rilla at the last Junior Red meeting -- of how fine and brave and splendid he was -- and I said life could never be just the same to me again , now that Walter had gone -- we were such friends , you know -- why I was the very first person he told about having enlisted -- and Rilla answered , as coolly and indifferently as if she were speaking of an entire stranger , ` He was just one of many fine and splendid boys who have given everything for their country . '"
"Well , I wish I could take things as calmly -- but I 'm not made like that ."
I 'm so sensitive -- things hurt me terribly -- I really never get over them .
I asked Rilla right out why she did n't put on mourning for Walter .
She said her mother did n't wish it .
But every one is talking about it . ''
"`` Rilla does n't wear colours -- nothing but white , '' protested Betty Mead ."
"`` White becomes her better than anything else , '' said Irene significantly ."
`` And we all know black does n't suit her complexion at all .
But of course I 'm not saying that is the reason she does n't wear it .
"Only , it 's funny ."
If my brother had died I 'd have gone into deep mourning .
I would n't have had the heart for anything else .
I confess I 'm disappointed in Rilla Blythe . ''
"`` I am not , then , '' cried Betty Meade , loyally , `` I think Rilla is just a wonderful girl ."
A few years ago I admit I did think she was rather too vain and gigglesome ; but now she is nothing of the sort .
"I do n't think there is a girl in the Glen who is so unselfish and plucky as Rilla , or who has done her bit as thoroughly and patiently ."
"Our Junior Red Cross would have gone on the rocks a dozen times if it had n't been for her tact and perseverance and enthusiasm -- you know that perfectly well , Irene . ''"
"In the pool of Corri-Bui swims a salmon with a skin that shines like silver , and whose gills are red -- bring them all to me , and then you shall know where dwell your brothers and your sister ! '"
` To-morrow at cock-crow I will begone ! '
answered Covan .
"The way to the mountain lay straight before him , and when he had climbed high he caught sight of the roe with the white feet and the spotted sides , on the peak in front ."
"Full of hope he set out in pursuit of her , but by the time he had reached that peak she had left it and was to be seen on another ."
"And so it always happened , and Covan 's courage had well-nigh failed him , when the thought of the Dog of Maol-mor darted into his mind ."
"` Oh , that he was here ! '"
he cried .
And looking up he saw him .
` Why did you summon me ? '
asked the Dog of Maol-mor .
"And when Covan had told him of his trouble , and how the roe always led him further and further , the Dog only answered : ` Fear nothing ; I will soon catch her for you . '"
And in a short while he laid the roe unhurt at Covan 's feet .
` What will you wish me to do with her ? '
said the Dog .
"And Covan answered : ` The old man bade me bring her , and the duck with the golden neck , and the salmon with the silver sides , to his cottage ; if I shall catch them , I know not ."
"But carry you the roe to the back of the cottage , and tether her so that she can not escape . '"
"` It shall be done , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"Then Covan sped to the lake which led to the land of the Sun , where the duck with the green body and the golden neck was swimming among the water-lilies ."
"` Surely I can catch him , good swimmer as I am , ' to himself ."
"But , if he could swim well , the duck could swim better , and at length his strength failed him , and he was forced to seek the land ."
` Oh that the black raven were here to help me ! '
he thought to himself .
And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder .
` How can I help you ? '
asked the raven .
And Covan answered : ` Catch me the green duck that floats on the water . '
"And the raven flew with his strong wings and picked him up in his strong beak , and in another moment the bird was laid at the feet of Covan ."
"This time it was easy for the young man to carry his prize , and after giving thanks to the raven for his aid , he went on to the river ."
In the deep dark pool of which the old man had spoken the silver-sided salmon was lying under a rock .
"` Surely I , good fisher as I am , can catch him , ' said Covan son of Gorla ."
"And cutting a slender pole from a bush , he fastened a line to the end of it ."
Before Miss Marshall had finished reading that letter she had cried three times and laughed times past counting .
"More tears came at the end -- happy , tender tears such as Miss Marshall had not shed for years ."
Something warm and sweet and gentle seemed to thrill to life within her heart .
"So those girls were not such selfish , heedless young creatures as she had supposed !"
How kind it had been in Cyrilla Blair to think of her and write so to her .
She no longer felt lonely and neglected .
Her whole sombre world had been brightened to sunshine by that merry friendly letter .
Mrs. Plunkett 's table was surrounded by a ring of smiling faces that night .
Everybody seemed in good spirits in spite of the weather .
"The pale little dressmaker , who had hardly uttered a word since her arrival a week before , talked and laughed quite merrily and girlishly , thanking Cyrilla unreservedly for her `` jolly letter . ''"
"Old Mr. Grant did not grumble once about the rain or the food or his rheumatism and he told Carol that she might be a good letter writer in time if she looked after her grammar more carefully -- which , from Mr. Grant , was high praise ."
All the others declared that they were delighted with their letters -- all except Miss Marshall .
"She said nothing but later on , when Cyrilla was going upstairs , she met Miss Marshall in the shadows of the second landing ."
"`` My dear , '' said Miss Marshall gently , `` I want to thank you for your letter , I do n't think you can realize just what it has meant to me ."
I was so -- so lonely and tired and discouraged .
It heartened me right up .
I -- I know you have thought me a cross and disagreeable person .
"I 'm afraid I have been , too ."
But -- but -- I shall try to be less so in future .
"If I ca n't succeed all at once do n't mind me because , under it all , I shall always be your friend ."
And I mean to keep your letter and read it over every time I feel myself getting bitter and hard again . ''
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , I 'm so glad you liked it , '' said Cyrilla frankly ."
`` We 're all your friends and would be glad to be chummy with you .
Only we thought perhaps we bothered you with our nonsense . ''
"`` Come and see me sometimes , '' said Miss Marshall with a smile ."
`` I 'll try to be ` chummy ' -- perhaps I 'm not yet too old to learn the secret of friendliness .
Your letter has made me think that I have missed much in shutting all young life out from mine as I have done .
I want to reform in this respect if I can . ''
When Cyrilla reached the front room she found Mrs. Plunkett there .
"`` I 've just dropped in , Miss Blair , '' said that worthy woman , `` to say that I dunno as I mind your making candy once in a while if you want to ."
Only do be careful not to set the place on fire .
Please be particularly careful not to set it on fire . ''
And two years ago this morning I woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me .
These are the two years I thought would be filled with fun . ''
`` Would you exchange them -- now -- for two years filled with fun ? ''
"`` No , '' said Rilla slowly ."
`` I would n't .
It 's strange -- is n't it ?
"-- They have been two terrible years -- and yet I have a queer feeling of thankfulness for them -- as if they had brought me something very precious , with all their pain ."
"I would n't want to go back and be the girl I was two years ago , not even if I could ."
"Not that I think I 've made any wonderful progress -- but I 'm not quite the selfish , frivolous little doll I was then ."
"I suppose I had a soul then , Miss Oliver -- but I did n't know it ."
I know it now -- and that is worth a great deal -- worth all the suffering of the past two years .
"And still '' -- Rilla gave a little apologetic laugh , `` I do n't want to suffer any more -- not even for the sake of more soul growth ."
"At the end of two more years I might look back and be thankful for the development they had brought me , too ; but I do n't want it now . ''"
"`` We never do , '' said Miss Oliver ."
"`` That is why we are not left to choose our own means and measure of development , I suppose ."
No matter how much we value what our lessons have brought us we do n't want to go on with the bitter schooling .
"Well , let us hope for the best , as Susan says ; things are really going well now and if Rumania lines up , the end may come with a suddenness that will surprise us all . ''"
Rumania did come in -- and Susan remarked approvingly that its king and queen were the finest looking royal couple she had seen pictures of .
So the summer passed away .
Early in September word came that the Canadians had been shifted to the Somme front and anxiety grew tenser and deeper .
"For the first time Mrs. Blythe 's spirit failed her a little , and as the days of suspense wore on the doctor began to look gravely at her , and veto this or that special effort in Red Cross work ."
"`` Oh , let me work -- let me work , Gilbert , '' she entreated feverishly ."
`` While I 'm working I do n't think so much .
If I 'm idle I imagine everything -- rest is only torture for me .
My two boys are on the frightful Somme front -- and Shirley pores day and night over aviation literature and says nothing .
But I see the purpose growing in his eyes .
"No , I can not rest -- do n't ask it of me , Gilbert . ''"
But the doctor was inexorable .
"`` I ca n't let you kill yourself , Anne-girl , '' he said ."
`` When the boys come back I want a mother here to welcome them .
"Why , you 're getting transparent ."
It wo n't do -- ask Susan there if it will do . ''
"Well , the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon , and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through ."
He had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them . ' ''
` Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave .
One day I found a big cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the Golden Lady .
She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive .
And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long ... you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks .
I 've never told Nora about the Golden Lady .
I was afraid it might hurt her feelings .
It even hurt her feelings if I talked too long with the Twin Sailors . ' '' '
I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks .
The youngest Twin Sailor is very good-tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times .
I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin .
I believe he 'd be a pirate if he dared .
There 's really something very mysterious about him .
He swore once and I told him if he ever did it again he need n't come ashore to talk to me because I 'd promised grandmother I 'd never associate with anybody that swore .
"He was pretty well scared , I can tell you , and he said if I would forgive him he would take me to the sunset ."
So the next evening when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her .
"The boat was all pearly and rainbowy , like the inside of the mussel shells , and her sail was like moonshine ."
"Well , we sailed right across to the sunset ."
"Think of that , teacher , I 've been in the sunset ."
And what do you suppose it is ?
The sunset is a land all flowers .
"We sailed into a great garden , and the clouds are beds of flowers ."
"We sailed into a great harbor , all the color of gold , and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses ."
I stayed there for ever so long .
It seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes .
"You see , in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here . ' ''"
` Your loving pupil Paul Irving . ' ''
"` P. S. of course , this letter is n't really true , teacher ."
"P.I. ' '' XII A Jonah Day It really began the night before with a restless , wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache ."
"When Anne arose in the dull , bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
She went to school in no angelic mood .
I do n't believe in whipping children MUCH .
"I think , as you say , Anne , that there are better ways of managing as a rule , and that corporal punishment should be a last resort ."
"But on the other hand , as Jane says , I believe there is an occasional child who ca n't be influenced in any other way and who , in short , needs a whipping and would be improved by it ."
Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule . ''
"Gilbert , having tried to please both sides , succeeded , as is usual and eminently right , in pleasing neither ."
Jane tossed her head .
`` I 'll whip my pupils when they 're naughty .
It 's the shortest and easiest way of convincing them . ''
Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance .
"`` I shall never whip a child , '' she repeated firmly ."
`` I feel sure it is n't either right or necessary . ''
`` Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something ? ''
said Jane .
"`` I 'd keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him , '' said Anne ."
`` There is some good in every person if you can find it .
It is a teacher 's duty to find and develop it .
"That is what our School Management professor at Queen 's told us , you know ."
Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him ?
"It 's far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three R 's , Professor Rennie says . ''"
"`` But the Inspector examines them in the three R 's , mind you , and he wo n't give you a good report if they do n't come up to his standard , '' protested Jane ."
"`` I 'd rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor , '' asserted Anne decidedly ."
"`` Would n't you punish children at all , when they misbehaved ? ''"
asked Gilbert .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose I shall have to , although I know I 'll hate to do it ."
But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write . ''
`` I suppose you wo n't punish the girls by making them sit with the boys ? ''
said Jane slyly .
Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly .
"Once upon a time , Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof ."
"`` Well , time will tell which is the best way , '' said Jane philosophically as they parted ."
"Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path , shadowy , rustling , fern-scented , through Violet Vale and past Willowmere , where dark and light kissed each other under the firs , and down through Lover 's Lane ... spots she and Diana had so named long ago ."
"She walked slowly , enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight , and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow ."
said the grocer ' I gave an old woman some coffee for the book .
If you like to give me twopence you can have the rest . '
"` Yes , ' said the student , ` give me the book instead of the cheese ."
I can eat my bread without cheese .
It would be a shame to leave the book to be torn up .
"You are a clever and practical man , but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there ! '"
"And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned , but the grocer laughed , and so did the student ."
It was only said in fun .
But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter .
"When it was night and the shop was shut , and everyone was in bed except the student , the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer 's wife 's tongue ."
"She did not use it when she was asleep , and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak , and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged ."
"But only one thing at a time could use it , and that was a good thing , or they would have all spoken together ."
The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers .
"` Is it true , ' he asked , ' that you know nothing about poetry ? '"
` Certainly not ! '
answered the tub .
"` Poetry is something that is in the papers , and that is frequently cut out ."
"I have a great deal more in me than the student has , and yet I am only a small tub in the grocer 's shop . '"
"And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffee-mill , and how it began to grind !"
"He put it on the butter-cask , and on the till , and all were of the same opinion as the waste-paper tub ."
and one must believe the majority .
` Now I will tell the student ! '
and with these words he crept softly up the stairs to the attic where the student lived .
"There was a light burning , and the Goblin peeped through the key-hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop ."
But how bright it was !
Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student .
"Every leaf was alive , and every flower was a beautiful girl 's head , some with dark and shining eyes , others with wonderful blue ones ."
"Every fruit was a glittering star , and there was a marvellous music in the student 's room ."
"The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight , much less seen it ."
"He stood on tiptoe gazing and gazing , till the candle in the attic was put out ; the student had blown it out and had gone to bed , but the Goblin remained standing outside listening to the music , which very softly and sweetly was now singing the student a lullaby . '"
I have never seen anything like this ! '
said the Goblin . '
"When he reached the scene of the accident he dreaded to look over the broken edge , but she was lying there safely and she smiled when she saw him -- a brave smile that softened her tense white face into the likeness of a frightened child 's ."
"`` If I drop the rope down to you , are you strong enough to hold to it while the earth goes and then draw yourself up the slope hand over hand ? ''"
asked Alan anxiously .
"`` Yes , '' she answered fearlessly ."
"Alan passed down one end of the rope and then braced himself firmly to hold it , for there was no tree near enough to be of any assistance ."
"The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it , for at her first movement the soil beneath her slipped away ."
Alan 's heart sickened ; what if she went with it ?
Could she cling to the rope while he drew her up ?
Then he saw she was still safe on the sloping shelf .
"Carefully and painfully she drew herself to her knees and , dinging to the rope , crept up the rock hand over hand ."
When she came within his reach he grasped her arms and lifted her up into safety beside him .
"`` Thank God , '' he said , with whiter lips than her own ."
"For a few moments Lynde sat silent on the sod , exhausted with fright and exertion , while her dog fawned on her in an ecstasy of joy ."
Finally she looked up into Alan 's anxious face and their eyes met .
It was something more than the physical reaction that suddenly flushed the girl 's cheeks .
She sprang lithely to her feet .
`` Can you walk back home ? ''
Alan asked .
"`` Oh , yes , I am all right now ."
It was very foolish of me to get into such a predicament .
Father and Emily went down the lake in the yacht this afternoon and I started out for a ramble .
When I came here I saw some junebells growing right out on the ledge and I crept out to gather them .
I should have known better .
"It broke away under me and the more I tried to scramble back the faster it slid down , carrying me with it ."
I thought it would go right over the brink '' -- she gave a little involuntary shudder -- `` but just at the very edge it stopped .
I knew I must lie very still or it would go right over .
It seemed like days .
"Pat was with me and I told him to go for help , but I knew there was no one at home -- and I was horribly afraid , '' she concluded with another shiver ."
`` I never was afraid in my life before -- at least not with that kind of fear . ''
"`` You have had a terrible experience and a narrow escape , '' said Alan lamely ."
He could think of nothing more to say ; his usual readiness of utterance seemed to have failed him .
"`` You saved my life , '' she said , `` you and Pat -- for doggie must have his share of credit . ''"
"You remember the Pied Piper -- but no , of course you would n't -- you were too young ."
One evening long ago when Nan and Di and Jem and the Merediths and I were together in Rainbow Valley I had a queer vision or presentiment -- whatever you like to call it .
"Rilla , I saw the Piper coming down the Valley with a shadowy host behind him ."
The others thought I was only pretending -- but I saw him for just one moment .
"And Rilla , last night I saw him again ."
"I was doing sentry-go and I saw him marching across No-man 's - land from our trenches to the German trenches -- the same tall shadowy form , piping weirdly -- and behind him followed boys in khaki ."
"Rilla , I tell you I saw him -- it was no fancy -- no illusion ."
"I heard his music , and then -- he was gone ."
But I had seen him -- and I knew what it meant -- I knew that I was among those who followed him .
"`` Rilla , the Piper will pipe me ` west ' tomorrow ."
I feel sure of this .
"And Rilla , I 'm not afraid ."
"When you hear the news , remember that ."
I 've won my own freedom here -- freedom from all fear .
"I shall never be afraid of anything again -- not of death -- nor of life , if after all , I am to go on living ."
"And life , I think , would be the harder of the two to face -- for it could never be beautiful for me again ."
There would always be such horrible things to remember -- things that would make life ugly and painful always for me .
I could never forget them .
"But whether it 's life or death , I 'm not afraid , Rilla-my-Rilla , and I am not sorry that I came ."
I 'm satisfied .
"I 'll never write the poems I once dreamed of writing -- but I 've helped to make Canada safe for the poets of the future -- for the workers of the future -- ay , and the dreamers , too -- for if no man dreams , there will be nothing for the workers to fulfil -- the future , not of Canada only but of the world -- when the ` red rain ' of Langemarck and Verdun shall have brought forth a golden harvest -- not in a year or two , as some foolishly think , but a generation later , when the seed sown now shall have had time to germinate and grow ."
"Yes , I 'm glad I came , Rilla ."
It is n't only the fate of the little sea-born island I love that is in the balance -- nor of Canada nor of England .
It 's the fate of mankind .
That is what we 're fighting for .
"And we shall win -- never for a moment doubt that , Rilla ."
For it is n't only the living who are fighting -- the dead are fighting too .
Such an army can not be defeated .
"`` Is there laughter in your face yet , Rilla ?"
I hope so .
The world will need laughter and courage more than ever in the years that will come next .
I do n't want to preach -- this is n't any time for it .
Her sunbonnet had fallen back and some loose tendrils of her auburn hair were curling around her forehead .
Her cheeks were so pink and her eyes so bright from running that she looked almost girlish .
"`` Oh , Mr. Harrington , '' she said breathlessly , `` that pet pig of Bobbles ' is in your garden again ."
He only got in this minute .
I saw him coming and I ran right after him . ''
"`` He 's there , all right , '' said Harrington cheerfully , `` but I 'll get him out in a jiffy ."
Do n't tire yourself .
Wo n't you go into the house and rest while I drive him around ? ''
"Mrs. Hayden , however , was determined to help and they both went around to the garden , set the gate open , and tried to drive the pig out ."
"But Harrington was not thinking about pigs , and Mrs. Hayden did not know quite so much about driving them as Mordecai did ; as a consequence they did not make much headway ."
"In her excitement Mrs. Hayden ran over beds and whatever came in her way , and Harrington , in order to keep near her , ran after her ."
Between them they spoiled things about as much as a whole drove of pigs would have done .
"But at last the pig grew tired of the fun , bolted out of the gate , and ran across the yard to his own place ."
Mrs. Hayden followed slowly and Harrington walked beside her .
"`` Those pigs are all to be shut up tomorrow , '' she said ."
`` Hiram has been fixing up a place for them in his spare moments and it is ready at last . ''
"`` Oh , I would n't , '' said Harrington hastily ."
`` It is n't good for pigs to be shut up so young .
You 'd better let them run a while yet . ''
"`` No , '' said Mrs. Hayden decidedly ."
`` They have almost worried me to death already .
In they go tomorrow . ''
"They were at the lane gate now , and Harrington had to open it and let her pass through ."
"He felt quite desperate as he watched her trip up through the rows of apple trees , her blue gingham skirt brushing the lush grasses where a lacy tangle of sunbeams and shadows lay ."
"Bobbles and Ted came running to meet her and the three , hand in hand , disappeared from sight ."
"Harrington went back to the house , feeling that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
"That evening at the tea table he caught himself wondering what it would be like to see Mary Hayden sitting at his table in place of Sarah King , with Bobbles and Ted on either hand ."
Then he found out what was the matter with him .
"He was in love , fathoms deep , with the blue-eyed widow !"
"Presumably the pigs were shut up the next day , for Harrington 's garden was invaded no more ."
He stood it for a week and then surrendered at discretion .
"He filled a basket with early strawberries and went across to the Hayden place , boldly enough to all appearance , but with his heart thumping like any schoolboy 's ."
"`` Captain , '' said the squire , `` the house is quite invisible from the ship ."
It must be the flag they are aiming at .
Would it not be wiser to take it in ? ''
`` Strike my colours ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` No , sir , not I '' ; and as soon as he had said the words , I think we all agreed with him ."
"For it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade ."
All through the evening they kept thundering away .
"Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand ."
"We had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket ."
"`` There is one good thing about all this , '' observed the captain ; `` the wood in front of us is likely clear ."
The ebb has made a good while ; our stores should be uncovered .
Volunteers to go and bring in pork . ''
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward .
"Well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission ."
The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel 's gunnery .
"For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current ."
Silver was in the stern-sheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own .
"The captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : Alexander Smollett , master ; David Livesey , ship 's doctor ; Abraham Gray , carpenter 's mate ; John Trelawney , owner ; John Hunter and Richard Joyce , owner 's servants , landsmen -- being all that is left faithful of the ship 's company -- with stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island ."
"Thomas Redruth , owner 's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; James Hawkins , cabin-boy -- And at the same time , I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins ' fate ."
A hail on the land side .
"`` Somebody hailing us , '' said Hunter , who was on guard ."
`` Doctor !
Squire !
Captain !
"Hullo , Hunter , is that you ? ''"
came the cries .
"And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade ."
"19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins : The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt , stopped me by the arm , and sat down ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there 's your friends , sure enough . ''"
"`` Far more likely it 's the mutineers , '' I answered ."
`` That ! ''
I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates .
"When we got to the inn , the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together , finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection ."
"Long John told the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth ."
"`` That was how it were , now , were n't it , Hawkins ? ''"
"he would say , now and again , and I could always bear him entirely out ."
"The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away , but we all agreed there was nothing to be done , and after he had been complimented , Long John took up his crutch and departed ."
"`` All hands aboard by four this afternoon , '' shouted the squire after him ."
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cried the cook , in the passage ."
"`` Well , squire , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me . ''"
"`` The man 's a perfect trump , '' declared the squire ."
"`` And now , '' added the doctor , `` Jim may come on board with us , may he not ? ''"
"`` To be sure he may , '' says squire ."
"`` Take your hat , Hawkins , and we 'll see the ship . ''"
"9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out , and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships , and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel , and sometimes swung above us ."
"At last , however , we got alongside , and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate , Mr. Arrow , a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint ."
"He and the squire were very thick and friendly , but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain ."
"This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why , for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us ."
"`` Captain Smollett , sir , axing to speak with you , '' said he ."
`` I am always at the captain 's orders .
"Show him in , '' said the squire ."
"The captain , who was close behind his messenger , entered at once and shut the door behind him ."
"`` Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ?"
"All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said the captain , `` better speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence ."
I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer .
That 's short and sweet . ''
"`` Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? ''"
"inquired the squire , very angry , as I could see ."
"`` I ca n't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , '' said the captain ."
`` She seems a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . ''
"`` Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? ''"
says the squire .
"Alan Douglas was a sincere man , with himself as well as with others , yet there are some motives that lie , in their first inception , too deep even for the probe of self-analysis ."
He had not as yet the faintest suspicion as to the real source of his interest in Lynde Oliver -- in his sudden forceful desire to be of use and service to her -- to rescue her from spiritual peril as he had that day rescued her from bodily danger .
"She must have a lonely , unsatisfying life , he thought ."
It is my duty to help her if I can .
It did not then occur to him that duty in this instance wore a much more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience .
"* * * * * Alan did not mean to be oversoon in going back to Four Winds , but three days later a book came to him which Captain Anthony had expressed a wish to see ."
It furnished an excuse for an earlier call .
After that he went often .
"He always found the Captain courteous and affable , old Emily grimly cordial , Lynde sometimes remote and demure , sometimes frankly friendly ."
"Occasionally , when the Captain was away in his yacht , he went for a walk with her and her dogs along the shore or through the sweet-smelling pinelands up the lake ."
He found that she loved books and was avid for more of them than she could obtain ; he was glad to take her several and discuss them with her .
She liked history and travels best .
"With novels she had no patience , she said disdainfully ."
She seldom spoke of herself or her past life and Alan fancied she avoided any personal reference .
"But once she said abruptly , `` Why do you never ask me to go to church ?"
I 've always been afraid you would . ''
"`` Because I do not think it would do you any good to go if you did n't want to , '' said Alan gravely ."
`` Souls should not be rudely handled any more than bodies . ''
"She looked at him reflectively , her finger denting her chin in a meditative fashion she had ."
`` You are not at all like Mr. Strong .
"He always scolded me , when he got a chance , for not going to church ."
I would have hated him if it had been worthwhile .
I told him one day that I was nearer to God under these pines than I could be in any building fashioned by human hands .
He was very much shocked .
But I do n't want you to misunderstand me .
Father does not go to church because he does not believe there is a God .
But I know there is .
Mother taught me so .
"I have never gone to church because Father would not allow me , and I could not go now in Rexton where the people talk about me so ."
"Oh , I know they do -- you know it , too -- but I do not care for them ."
I know I 'm not like other girls .
I would like to be but I ca n't be -- I never can be -- now . ''
I met another clever man a few evenings ago .
A lot of us went for a sail on the harbour .
Mrs. Braddon 's house party came too .
We had three big white boats that skimmed down the moonlit channel like great white sea birds .
"There was another boat far across the harbour , and the people in it were singing ."
"The music drifted over the water to us , so sad and sweet and beguiling that I could have cried for very pleasure ."
One of Mrs. Braddon 's guests said to me : `` That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness refined away . ''
I had n't thought about him before -- I had n't even caught his name in the general introduction .
"He was a tall , slight man , with a worn , sensitive face and iron-grey hair -- a quiet man who had n't laughed or talked ."
"But he began to talk to me then , and I forgot all about the others ."
I never had listened to anybody in the least like him .
"He talked of books and music , of art and travel ."
"He had been all over the world , and had seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they had n't too , I think ."
"I seemed to be looking into an enchanted mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back to me , but made , oh , so much more beautiful !"
On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody asked me how I liked Paul Moore !
"The man I had been talking with was Paul Moore , the great novelist !"
I was almost glad I had n't known it while he was talking to me -- I should have been too awed and reverential to have really enjoyed his conversation .
"As it was , I had contradicted him twice , and he had laughed and liked it ."
"But his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth , through the insight he himself has given me ."
It is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me .
But much of its abiding sweetness comes from my friendship with Margaret Raleigh .
You will be weary of my rhapsodies over her .
"But she is such a rare and wonderful woman ; much older then I am , but so young in heart and soul and freshness of feeling !"
"She is to me mother and sister and wise , clear-sighted friend ."
To her I go with all my perplexities and hopes and triumphs .
She has sympathy and understanding for my every mood .
I love life so much for giving me such a friendship !
This morning I wakened at dawn and stole away to the shore before anyone else was up .
I had a delightful run-away .
"The long , low-lying meadows between `` The Evergreens '' and the shore were dewy and fresh in that first light , that was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of one of my white roses ."
"On the beach the water was purring in little blue ripples , and , oh , the sunrise out there beyond the harbour !"
All the eastern Heaven was abloom with it .
"All are keeping a sharp look-out in front , but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind ."
This shows how real the island was .
The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys .
"They flung themselves down on the sward , close to their underground home . '"
"I do wish Peter would come back , ' every one of them said nervously , though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain . '"
"I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates , ' Slightly said , in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite ; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him , for he added hastily , ` but I wish he would come back , and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella . '"
"They talked of Cinderella , and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her ."
"It was only in Peter 's absence that they could speak of mothers , the subject being forbidden by him as silly ."
"` All I remember about my mother , ' Nibs told them , ` is that she often said to father , `` Oh , how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own . ''"
"I do n't know what a cheque-book is , but I should just love to give my mother one . '"
While they talked they heard a distant sound .
"You or I , not being wild things of the woods , would have heard nothing , but they heard it , and it was the grim song : ` Yo ho , yo ho , the pirate life , The flag o ' skull and bones , A merry hour , a hempen rope , And hey for Davy Jones . '"
At once the lost boys -- but where are they ?
They are no longer there .
Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly .
I will tell you where they are .
"With the exception of Nibs , who has darted away to reconnoitre , they are already in their home under the ground , a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently ."
But how have they reached it ?
"for there is no entrance to be seen , not so much as a pile of brushwood , which if removed would disclose the mouth of a cave ."
"Look closely , however , and you may note that there are here seven large trees , each having in its hollow trunk a hole as large as a boy ."
"These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground , for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons ."
Will he find it to-night ?
"As the pirates advanced , the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood , and at once his pistol flashed out ."
But an iron claw gripped his shoulder .
"` Captain , let go , ' he cried , writhing ."
Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook .
It was a black voice .
"` Put back that pistol first , ' it said threateningly ."
` It was one of those boys you hate .
I could have shot him dead . '
"` Ay , and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily 's redskins upon us ."
Do you want to lose your scalp ? '
Ride -- ride fast ! ''
And then the poor young lady fainted once again .
"One of Dick 's men carried a flask of some strong cordial , and with this Dick succeeded in reviving consciousness ."
"Then he took Joanna 's friend upon his saddlebow , and once more pushed toward the forest ."
`` Why do ye take me ? ''
said the girl .
`` Ye but delay your speed . ''
"`` Nay , Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick ."
`` Shoreby is full of blood and drunkenness and riot .
Here ye are safe ; content ye . ''
"`` I will not be beholden to any of your faction , '' she cried ; `` set me down . ''"
"`` Madam , ye know not what ye say , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Y ' are hurt '' -- `` I am not , '' she said ."
`` It was my horse was slain . ''
"`` It matters not one jot , '' replied Richard ."
"`` Ye are here in the midst of open snow , and compassed about with enemies ."
"Whether ye will or not , I carry you with me ."
Glad am I to have the occasion ; for thus shall I repay some portion of our debt . ''
For a little while she was silent .
"Then , very suddenly , she asked : `` My uncle ? ''"
`` My Lord Risingham ? ''
returned Dick .
"`` I would I had good news to give you , madam ; but I have none ."
"I saw him once in the battle , and once only ."
Let us hope the best . ''
"CHAPTER V -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS : ALICIA RISINGHAM It was almost certain that Sir Daniel had made for the Moat House ; but , considering the heavy snow , the lateness of the hour , and the necessity under which he would lie of avoiding the few roads and striking across the wood , it was equally certain that he could not hope to reach it ere the morrow ."
"There were two courses open to Dick ; either to continue to follow in the knight 's trail , and , if he were able , to fall upon him that very night in camp , or to strike out a path of his own , and seek to place himself between Sir Daniel and his destination ."
"Either scheme was open to serious objection , and Dick , who feared to expose Joanna to the hazards of a fight , had not yet decided between them when he reached the borders of the wood ."
"At this point Sir Daniel had turned a little to his left , and then plunged straight under a grove of very lofty timber ."
"His party had then formed to a narrower front , in order to pass between the trees , and the track was trod proportionally deeper in the snow ."
"The eye followed it under the leafless tracery of the oaks , running direct and narrow ; the trees stood over it , with knotty joints and the great , uplifted forest of their boughs ; there was no sound , whether of man or beast -- not so much as the stirring of a robin ; and over the field of snow the winter sun lay golden among netted shadows ."
"`` How say ye , '' asked Dick of one of the men , `` to follow straight on , or strike across for Tunstall ? ''"
"Ask my man Tom , if ye misdoubt me ."
"Seven pieces of good Gascon wine , a ship that was mine own , and was my father 's before me , a Blessed Mary of plane-tree wood and parcel-gilt , and thirteen pounds in gold and silver ."
Hey !
what say ye ?
"A man that fought the French , too ; for I have fought the French ; I have cut more French throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out of Dartmouth ."
"Come , a penny piece . ''"
"Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word , lest he should recognise their voices ; and they stood there as helpless as a ship ashore , not knowing where to turn nor what to hope ."
"`` Are ye dumb , boy ? ''"
inquired the skipper .
"`` Mates , '' he added , with a hiccup , `` they be dumb ."
"I like not this manner of discourtesy ; for an a man be dumb , so be as he 's courteous , he will still speak when he was spoken to , methinks . ''"
"By this time the sailor , Tom , who was a man of great personal strength , seemed to have conceived some suspicion of these two speechless figures ; and being soberer than his captain , stepped suddenly before him , took Lawless roughly by the shoulder , and asked him , with an oath , what ailed him that he held his tongue ."
"To this the outlaw , thinking all was over , made answer by a wrestling feint that stretched the sailor on the sand , and , calling upon Dick to follow him , took to his heels among the lumber ."
The affair passed in a second .
"Before Dick could run at all , Arblaster had him in his arms ; Tom , crawling on his face , had caught him by one foot , and the third man had a drawn cutlass brandishing above his head ."
"It was not so much the danger , it was not so much the annoyance , that now bowed down the spirits of young Shelton ; it was the profound humiliation to have escaped Sir Daniel , convinced Lord Risingham , and now fall helpless in the hands of this old , drunken sailor ; and not merely helpless , but , as his conscience loudly told him when it was too late , actually guilty -- actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose ship he had stolen and lost ."
"`` Bring me him back into the alehouse , till I see his face , '' said Arblaster ."
"`` Nay , nay , '' returned Tom ; `` but let us first unload his wallet , lest the other lads cry share . ''"
"But though he was searched from head to foot , not a penny was found upon him ; nothing but Lord Foxham 's signet , which they plucked savagely from his finger ."
"`` Turn me him to the moon , '' said the skipper ; and taking Dick by the chin , he cruelly jerked his head into the air ."
`` Blessed Virgin ! ''
"he cried , `` it is the pirate ! ''"
`` Hey ! ''
cried Tom .
"`` By the Virgin of Bordeaux , it is the man himself ! ''"
repeated Arblaster .
"`` What , sea-thief , do I hold you ? ''"
he cried .
`` Where is my ship ?
Where is my wine ?
Hey !
have I you in my hands ?
"And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road , the horse galloped on ."
"By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains , and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter 's net ."
"` Get down and cut the meshes of the net , and set the poor bird free , ' said the horse ."
"` But it will take so long , ' objected Jose , ` and we may miss the princess . '"
"` Never mind that ; do not lose a chance of helping others , ' answered the horse ."
"And when the meshes were cut , and the eagle was free , the horse galloped on ."
"The had ridden many miles , and at last they came to a river , where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand , and the horse said : ` Do you see that little fish ?"
It will die if you do not put it back in the water . '
"` But , really , we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this ! '"
cried Jose .
"` We never waste time when we are helping others , ' answered the horse ."
And soon the little fish was swimming happily away .
"A little while after they reached a castle , which was built in the middle of a very thick wood , and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens ."
"` Now listen , ' said the horse . '"
"I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips , which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor ."
"Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way , and you must help her to mount ."
"When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick , and you must say that I have never carried a woman before , and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me ."
Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king 's palace . '
"Jose did exactly as the horse told him , and everything fell out as the animal prophesied ; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive ."
"She said nothing , however , but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens , and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground ."
"` Oh , I have let fall my bran ! '"
cried she ; ` please get down and pick it up for me . '
But Jose only answered : ` We shall find plenty of bran where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"They were now passing through a forest , and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards , so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree ."
` Dear me ; how stupid !
"I have let my handkerchief blow away , ' said she ."
` Will you climb up and get it for me ? '
But Jose answered : ` We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"After the wood they reached a river , and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water ."
"` How careless of me , ' gasped she , beginning to sob . '"
"I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it ; and for my part , gossip Arblaster , methinks there is some sense in this young man ."
"Shall we go hear him , indeed ?"
"Say , shall we go hear him ? ''"
"`` I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale , good Master Pirret , '' returned Arblaster ."
"`` How say ye , Tom ?"
But then the wallet is empty . ''
"`` I will pay , '' said the other -- `` I will pay ."
"I would fain see this matter out ; I do believe , upon my conscience , there is gold in it . ''"
"`` Nay , if ye get again to drinking , all is lost ! ''"
cried Tom .
"`` Gossip Arblaster , ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty , '' returned Master Pirret ."
`` Would ye be led by a hired man ?
"Fy , fy ! ''"
"`` Peace , fellow ! ''"
"said Arblaster , addressing Tom ."
`` Will ye put your oar in ?
"Truly a fine pass , when the crew is to correct the skipper ! ''"
"`` Well , then , go your way , '' said Tom ; `` I wash my hands of you . ''"
"`` Set him , then , upon his feet , '' said Master Pirret ."
`` I know a privy place where we may drink and discourse . ''
"`` If I am to walk , my friends , ye must set my feet at liberty , '' said Dick , when he had been once more planted upright like a post ."
"`` He saith true , '' laughed Pirret ."
"`` Truly , he could not walk accoutred as he is ."
"Give it a slit -- out with your knife and slit it , gossip . ''"
"Even Arblaster paused at this proposal ; but as his companion continued to insist , and Dick had the sense to keep the merest wooden indifference of expression , and only shrugged his shoulders over the delay , the skipper consented at last , and cut the cords which tied his prisoner 's feet and legs ."
"Not only did this enable Dick to walk ; but the whole network of his bonds being proportionately loosened , he felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely , and could hope , with time and trouble , to entirely disengage it ."
So much he owed already to the owlish silliness and greed of Master Pirret .
"That worthy now assumed the lead , and conducted them to the very same rude alehouse where Lawless had taken Arblaster on the day of the gale ."
"It was now quite deserted ; the fire was a pile of red embers , radiating the most ardent heat ; and when they had chosen their places , and the landlord had set before them a measure of mulled ale , both Pirret and Arblaster stretched forth their legs and squared their elbows like men bent upon a pleasant hour ."
"The table at which they sat , like all the others in the alehouse , consisted of a heavy , square board , set on a pair of barrels ; and each of the four curiously-assorted cronies sat at one side of the square , Pirret facing Arblaster , and Dick opposite to the common sailor ."
"`` And now , young man , '' said Pirret , `` to your tale ."
"It doth appear , indeed , that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster ; but what then ?"
These terrible moods come on without any cause that we know of .
Even Mother could not do anything with him when he was like that .
You must go away now -- and do not come back until his dark mood has passed .
"He will be just as glad to see you as ever then , and this will not make any difference with him ."
Do n't come back for a week at least . ''
"`` I do not like to leave you in such trouble , Miss Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , it does n't matter about me -- I have Emily ."
And there is nothing you could do .
Please go at once .
Father knows I am talking to you and that will vex him still more . ''
"Alan , realizing that he could not help her and that his presence only made matters worse , went away perplexedly ."
The following week was a miserable one for him .
His duties were distasteful to him and meeting his people a positive torture .
Sometimes Mrs. Danby looked dubiously at him and seemed on the point of saying something -- but never said it .
"Isabel King watched him when they met , with bold probing eyes ."
In his abstraction he did not notice this any more than he noticed a certain subtle change which had come over the members of his congregation -- as if a breath of suspicion had blown across them and troubled their confidence and trust .
Once Alan would have been keenly and instantly conscious of this slight chill ; now he was not even aware of it .
When he ventured to go back to Four Winds he found the Captain on the point of starting off for a cruise in his yacht .
"He was urbane and friendly , utterly ignoring the incident of Alan 's last visit and regretting that business compelled him to go down the lake ."
"Alan saw him off with small regret and turned joyfully to Lynde , who was walking under the pines with her dogs ."
"She looked pale and tired and her eyes were still troubled , but she smiled proudly and made no reference to what had happened ."
"`` I 'm going to put these flowers on Mother 's grave , '' she said , lifting her slender hands filled with late white roses ."
`` Mother loved flowers and I always keep them near her when I can .
You may come with me if you like . ''
Alan had known Lynde 's mother was buried under the pines but he had never visited the spot before .
"The grave was at the westernmost end of the pine wood , where it gave out on the lake , a beautiful spot , given over to silence and shadow ."
"`` Mother wished to be buried here , '' Lynde said , kneeling to arrange her flowers ."
`` Father would have taken her anywhere but she said she wanted to be near us and near the lake she had loved so well .
Father buried her himself .
He would n't have anyone else do anything for her .
I am so glad she is here .
It would have been terrible to have seen her taken far away -- my sweet little mother . ''
"`` A much larger share than mine , '' said Alan , smiling ."
"`` If Pat had not come for me , I would not have known of your danger ."
What a magnificent fellow he is ! ''
`` Is n't he ? ''
she agreed proudly .
"`` And so is Laddie , my other dog ."
He went with Father today .
I love my dogs more than people . ''
She looked at him with a little defiance in her eyes .
`` I suppose you think that terrible . ''
"`` I think many dogs are much more lovable -- and worthy of love -- than many people , '' said Alan , laughing ."
How childlike she was in some ways !
That trace of defiance -- it was so like a child who expected to be scolded for some wrong attitude of mind .
And yet there were moments when she looked the tall proud queen .
"Sometimes , when the path grew narrow , she walked before him , her hand on the dog 's head ."
"Alan liked this , since it left him free to watch admiringly the swinging grace of her step and the white curves of her neck beneath the thick braid of hair , which today was wound about her head ."
"When she dropped back beside him in the wider spaces , he could only have stolen glances at her profile , delicately , strongly cut , virginal in its soft curves , childlike in its purity ."
"Once she looked around and caught his glance ; again she flushed , and something strange and exultant stirred in Alan 's heart ."
"It was as if that maiden blush were the involuntary , unconscious admission of some power he had over her -- a power which her hitherto unfettered spirit had never before felt ."
"The cold indifference he had seen in her face at their first meeting was gone , and something told him it was gone forever ."
When they came in sight of Four Winds they saw two people walking up the road from the harbour and a few further steps brought them face to face with Captain Anthony Oliver and his old housekeeper .
The Captain 's appearance was a fresh surprise to Alan .
"He had expected to meet a rough , burly sailor , loud of voice and forbidding of manner ."
"Instead , Captain Anthony was a tall , well-built man of perhaps fifty ."
"His face , beneath its shock of iron-grey hair , was handsome but wore a somewhat forbidding expression , and there was something in it , apart from line or feature , which did not please Alan ."
"He had no time to analyze this impression , for Lynde said hurriedly , `` Father , this is Mr. Douglas ."
He has just done me a great service . ''
"She briefly explained her accident ; when she had finished , the Captain turned to Alan and held out his hand , a frank smile replacing the rather suspicious and contemptuous scowl which had previously overshadowed it ."
"`` I am much obliged to you , Mr. Douglas , '' he said cordially ."
`` You must come up to the house and let me thank you at leisure .
"As a rule I 'm not very partial to the cloth , as you may have heard ."
"In this case it is the man , not the minister , I invite . ''"
"Well , four years ago his wife disappeared -- it was n't known how or when ."
"She just was n't ever seen again , that 's all ."
Whether she died or was murdered or went away nobody ever knew .
There was some talk of an investigation but nothing came of it .
"As for the girl , she 's always lived there with her father ."
She must be a perfect heathen .
"He never goes anywhere , but there used to be talk of strangers visiting him -- queer sort of characters who came up the lake in vessels from the American side ."
"I have n't heard any reports of such these past few years , though -- not since his wife disappeared ."
He keeps a yacht and goes sailing in it -- sometimes he cruises about for weeks -- that 's about all he ever does .
"And now you know as much about the Olivers as I do , Mr. Douglas . ''"
Alan had listened to this gossipy narrative with an interest that did not escape Isabel King 's observant eyes .
"Much of it he mentally dismissed as improbable surmise , but the basic facts were probably as Mrs. Danby had reported them ."
"He had known that the girl of the shore could be no commonplace , primly nurtured young woman ."
`` Has no effort ever been made to bring these people into touch with the church ? ''
he asked absently .
"`` Bless you , yes ."
Every minister that 's ever been in Rexton has had a try at it .
The old cousin met every one of them at the door and told him nobody was at home .
Mr. Strong was the most persistent -- he did n't like being beaten .
"He went again and again and finally the Captain sent him word that when he wanted parsons or pill-dosers he 'd send for them , and till he did he 'd thank them to mind their own business ."
"They say Mr. Strong met Lynde once along shore and wanted to know if she would n't come to church , and she laughed in his face and told him she knew more about God now than he did or ever would ."
Perhaps the story is n't true .
Or if it was maybe he provoked her into saying it .
Mr. Strong was n't overly tactful .
"I believe in judging the poor girl as charitably as possible and making allowances for her , seeing how she 's been brought up ."
You could n't expect her to know how to behave . ''
"Somehow , Alan resented Mrs. Danby 's charity ."
"Then , his sense of humour being strongly developed , he smiled to think of this commonplace old lady `` making allowances '' for the splendid bit of femininity he had seen on the shore ."
A plump barnyard fowl might as well have talked of making allowances for a seagull !
"Alan walked home with Isabel King but he was very silent as they went together down the long , dark , sweet-smelling country road bordered by its white orchards ."
"Isabel put her own construction on his absent replies to her remarks and presently she asked him , `` Did you think Lynde Oliver handsome ? ''"
The question gave Alan an annoyance out of all proportion to its significance .
A singular sneer played about the young nobleman 's mouth as he made answer : `` These are very brave words .
But to the more essential -- are ye Lancaster or York ? ''
"`` My lord , I make no secret ; I am clear for York , '' Dick answered ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"replied the other , `` it is well for you . ''"
"And so saying , he turned towards one of his followers ."
"`` Let me see , '' he continued , in the same sneering and cruel tones -- `` let me see a clean end of these brave gentlemen ."
Truss me them up . ''
There were but five survivors of the attacking party .
"Archers seized them by the arms ; they were hurried to the borders of the wood , and each placed below a tree of suitable dimension ; the rope was adjusted ; an archer , carrying the end of it , hastily clambered overhead ; and before a minute was over , and without a word passing upon either hand , the five men were swinging by the neck ."
"`` And now , '' cried the deformed leader , `` back to your posts , and when I summon you next , be readier to attend . ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said one man , `` beseech you , tarry not here alone ."
Keep but a handful of lances at your hand . ''
"`` Fellow , '' said the duke , `` I have forborne to chide you for your slowness ."
"Cross me not , therefore ."
"I trust my hand and arm , for all that I be crooked ."
Ye were backward when the trumpet sounded ; and ye are now too forward with your counsels .
But it is ever so ; last with the lance and first with tongue .
Let it be reversed . ''
"And with a gesture that was not without a sort of dangerous nobility , he waved them off ."
"The footmen climbed again to their seats behind the men-at-arms , and the whole party moved slowly away and disappeared in twenty different directions , under the cover of the forest ."
"The day was by this time beginning to break , and the stars to fade ."
"The first grey glimmer of dawn shone upon the countenances of the two young men , who now turned once more to face each other ."
"`` Here , '' said the duke , `` ye have seen my vengeance , which is , like my blade , both sharp and ready ."
"But I would not have you , for all Christendom , suppose me thankless ."
You that came to my aid with a good sword and a better courage -- unless that ye recoil from my misshapenness -- come to my heart . ''
"And so saying , the young leader held out his arms for an embrace ."
"In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertained a great terror and some hatred for the man whom he had rescued ; but the invitation was so worded that it would not have been merely discourteous , but cruel , to refuse or hesitate ; and he hastened to comply ."
"`` And now , my lord duke , '' he said , when he had regained his freedom , `` do I suppose aright ?"
Are ye my Lord Duke of Gloucester ? ''
"`` I am Richard of Gloucester , '' returned the other ."
`` And you -- how call they you ? ''
he asked .
`` I thought ye were of the other party . ''
Matcham began to sob .
`` What cheer ! ''
cried Dick .
`` Now the saints behold us !
would ye snivel for a word ? ''
"`` Ye hurt me , '' sobbed Matcham ."
`` Ye hurt me when ye threw me down .
Y ' are a coward to abuse your strength . ''
"`` Nay , that is fool 's talk , '' said Dick , roughly ."
"`` Y ' had no title to my windac , Master John ."
I would ` a ' done right to have well basted you .
"If ye go with me , ye must obey me ; and so , come . ''"
"Matcham had half a thought to stay behind ; but , seeing that Dick continued to scour full-tilt towards the eminence and not so much as looked across his shoulder , he soon thought better of that , and began to run in turn ."
"But the ground was very difficult and steep ; Dick had already a long start , and had , at any rate , the lighter heels , and he had long since come to the summit , crawled forward through the firs , and ensconced himself in a thick tuft of gorse , before Matcham , panting like a deer , rejoined him , and lay down in silence by his side ."
"Below , in the bottom of a considerable valley , the short cut from Tunstall hamlet wound downwards to the ferry ."
"It was well beaten , and the eye followed it easily from point to point ."
Here it was bordered by open glades ; there the forest closed upon it ; every hundred yards it ran beside an ambush .
"Far down the path , the sun shone on seven steel salets , and from time to time , as the trees opened , Selden and his men could be seen riding briskly , still bent upon Sir Daniel 's mission ."
"The wind had somewhat fallen , but still tussled merrily with the trees , and , perhaps , had Appleyard been there , he would have drawn a warning from the troubled conduct of the birds ."
"`` Now , mark , '' Dick whispered ."
`` They be already well advanced into the wood ; their safety lieth rather in continuing forward .
"But see ye where this wide glade runneth down before us , and in the midst of it , these two score trees make like an island ?"
There were their safety .
"An they but come sound as far as that , I will make shift to warn them ."
"But my heart misgiveth me ; they are but seven against so many , and they but carry cross-bows ."
"The long-bow , Jack , will have the uppermost ever . ''"
"Meanwhile , Selden and his men still wound up the path , ignorant of their danger , and momently drew nearer hand ."
"Once , indeed , they paused , drew into a group , and seemed to point and listen ."
"But it was something from far away across the plain that had arrested their attention -- a hollow growl of cannon that came , from time to time , upon the wind , and told of the great battle ."
"It was worth a thought , to be sure ; for if the voice of the big guns were thus become audible in Tunstall Forest , the fight must have rolled ever eastward , and the day , by consequence , gone sore against Sir Daniel and the lords of the dark rose ."
"They rode as for their lives , in complete disorder ; some of them were wounded ; riderless horses galloped at their side with bloody saddles ."
They were plainly fugitives from the great battle .
"The noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away towards Shoreby , before fresh hoofs came echoing in their wake , and another deserter clattered down the road ; this time a single rider and , by his splendid armour , a man of high degree ."
"Close after him there followed several baggage-waggons , fleeing at an ungainly canter , the drivers flailing at the horses as if for life ."
These must have run early in the day ; but their cowardice was not to save them .
"For just before they came abreast of where the lads stood wondering , a man in hacked armour , and seemingly beside himself with fury , overtook the waggons , and with the truncheon of a sword , began to cut the drivers down ."
"Some leaped from their places and plunged into the wood ; the others he sabred as they sat , cursing them the while for cowards in a voice that was scarce human ."
"All this time the noise in the distance had continued to increase ; the rumble of carts , the clatter of horses , the cries of men , a great , confused rumour , came swelling on the wind ; and it was plain that the rout of a whole army was pouring , like an inundation , down the road ."
Dick stood sombre .
"He had meant to follow the highway till the turn for Holywood , and now he had to change his plan ."
"But above all , he had recognised the colours of Earl Risingham , and he knew that the battle had gone finally against the rose of Lancaster ."
"Had Sir Daniel joined , and was he now a fugitive and ruined ?"
"or had he deserted to the side of York , and was he forfeit to honour ?"
It was an ugly choice .
"`` Come , '' he said , sternly ; and , turning on his heel , he began to walk forward through the grove , with Matcham limping in his rear ."
For some time they continued to thread the forest in silence .
It was now growing late ; the sun was setting in the plain beyond Kettley ; the tree-tops overhead glowed golden ; but the shadows had begun to grow darker and the chill of the night to fall .
`` If there were anything to eat ! ''
"cried Dick , suddenly , pausing as he spoke ."
Matcham sat down and began to weep .
"`` Ye can weep for your own supper , but when it was to save men 's lives , your heart was hard enough , '' said Dick , contemptuously ."
"`` Y ' ` ave seven deaths upon your conscience , Master John ; I 'll ne'er forgive you that . ''"
`` Conscience ! ''
"cried Matcham , looking fiercely up ."
`` Mine !
And ye have the man 's red blood upon your dagger !
"And wherefore did ye slay him , the poor soul ?"
"He drew his arrow , but he let not fly ; he held you in his hand , and spared you !"
"'T is as brave to kill a kitten , as a man that not defends himself . ''"
Dick was struck dumb .
`` I slew him fair .
"I ran me in upon his bow , '' he cried ."
"The ground became more and more uneven , full of pits and hillocks ."
"And with every step of the ascent the wind still blew the shriller , and the trees bent before the gusts like fishing-rods ."
"They had just entered one of the clearings , when Dick suddenly clapped down upon his face among the brambles , and began to crawl slowly backward towards the shelter of the grove ."
"Matcham , in great bewilderment , for he could see no reason for this flight , still imitated his companion 's course ; and it was not until they had gained the harbour of a thicket that he turned and begged him to explain ."
"For all reply , Dick pointed with his finger ."
"At the far end of the clearing , a fir grew high above the neighbouring wood , and planted its black shock of foliage clear against the sky ."
For about fifty feet above the ground the trunk grew straight and solid like a column .
"At that level , it split into two massive boughs ; and in the fork , like a mast-headed seaman , there stood a man in a green tabard , spying far and wide ."
"The sun glistened upon his hair ; with one hand he shaded his eyes to look abroad , and he kept slowly rolling his head from side to side , with the regularity of a machine ."
The lads exchanged glances .
"`` Let us try to the left , '' said Dick ."
"`` We had near fallen foully , Jack . ''"
Ten minutes afterwards they struck into a beaten path .
"`` Here is a piece of forest that I know not , '' Dick remarked ."
`` Where goeth me this track ? ''
"`` Let us even try , '' said Matcham ."
"A few yards further , the path came to the top of a ridge and began to go down abruptly into a cup-shaped hollow ."
"At the foot , out of a thick wood of flowering hawthorn , two or three roofless gables , blackened as if by fire , and a single tall chimney marked the ruins of a house ."
`` What may this be ? ''
whispered Matcham .
"`` Nay , by the mass , I know not , '' answered Dick ."
`` I am all at sea .
Let us go warily . ''
"With beating hearts , they descended through the hawthorns ."
"Here and there , they passed signs of recent cultivation ; fruit trees and pot herbs ran wild among the thicket ; a sun-dial had fallen in the grass ; it seemed they were treading what once had been a garden ."
Yet a little farther and they came forth before the ruins of the house .
It had been a pleasant mansion and a strong .
"A dry ditch was dug deep about it ; but it was now choked with masonry , and bridged by a fallen rafter ."
"The two farther walls still stood , the sun shining through their empty windows ; but the remainder of the building had collapsed , and now lay in a great cairn of ruin , grimed with fire ."
Already in the interior a few plants were springing green among the chinks .
"`` Now I bethink me , '' whispered Dick , `` this must be Grimstone ."
It was a hold of one Simon Malmesbury ; Sir Daniel was his bane !
"` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight , ' she said , with her eyes shining ."
"` And one ca n't get a fellow like this in summer either , ' said the young man , pointing to the Snow-man ."
` He 's a beauty ! '
"The girl laughed , and nodded to the Snow-man , and then they both danced away over the snow ."
` Who were those two ? '
asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog .
` You have been in this yard longer than I have .
Do you know who they are ? '
` Do I know them indeed ? '
answered the yard-dog .
"` She has often stroked me , and he has given me bones ."
I do n't bite either of them ! '
` But what are they ? '
asked the Snow-man .
` Lovers ! '
replied the yard-dog .
"Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther , who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe ."
To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide .
Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered ; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account .
What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method .
"On the other hand , this , as destroying the element of surprise , would have made his strategy of no avail , so that the whole question is beset with difficulties ."
"One can not at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme , and the fell -LSB- deadly -RSB- genius with which it was carried out ."
What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment ?
"Fain -LSB- gladly -RSB- would his dogs have known , as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses , they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook , and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man ."
"Elation must have been in his heart , but his face did not reflect it : ever a dark and solitary enigma , he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance ."
"The night 's work was not yet over , for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy ; they were but the bees to be smoked , so that he should get at the honey ."
"It was Pan he wanted , Pan and Wendy and their band , but chiefly Pan ."
Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man 's hatred of him .
"True he had flung Hook 's arm to the crocodile , but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led , owing to the crocodile 's pertinacity -LSB- persistance -RSB- , hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant ."
The truth is that there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy .
"It was not his courage , it was not his engaging appearance , it was not -- ."
"There is no beating about the bush , for we know quite well what it was , and have got to tell ."
"Imagine , when we returned here , we met some linnets who , just as the spring and the flowers and the long days had come , were setting out for the north and the cold ?"
Out of pure compassion we tried to persuade them to give up this folly ; but they only replied with the utmost insolence . '
` How shocking ! '
exclaimed the city swallow .
"` Yes , it was ."
"And worse than that , the crested lark , that was formerly so timid and shy , is now no better than a thief , and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them . ' '"
I am astonished at what you say . '
` You will be more astonished when I tell you that on my arrival here for the summer I found my nest occupied by a shameless sparrow !
"`` This is my nest , '' I said ."
`` Yours ? ''
"he answered , with a rude laugh ."
"`` Yes , mine ; my ancestors were born here , and my sons will be born here also . ''"
And at that my husband set upon him and threw him out of the nest .
I am sure nothing of this sort ever happens in a town . '
"` Not exactly , perhaps ."
But I have seen a great deal -- if you only knew ! '
` Oh !
do tell us !
do tell us ! '
cried they all .
"And when they had settled themselves comfortably , the city swallow began : ` You must know , then that our king fell in love with the youngest daughter of a tailor , who was as good and gentle as she was beautiful ."
"His nobles hoped that he would have chosen a queen from one of their daughters , and tried to prevent the marriage ; but the king would not listen to them , and it took place ."
"Not many months later a war broke out , and the king rode away at the head of his army , while the queen remained behind , very unhappy at the separation ."
"When peace was made , and the king returned , he was told that his wife had had two babies in his absence , but that both were dead ; that she herself had gone out of her mind and was obliged to be shut up in a tower in the mountains , where , in time , the fresh air might cure her . '"
` And was this not true ? '
asked the swallows eagerly .
"` Of course not , ' answered the city lady , with some contempt for their stupidity ."
"` The children were alive at that very moment in the gardener 's cottage ; but at night the chamberlain came down and put them in a cradle of crystal , which he carried to the river ."
"` For a whole day they floated safely , for though the stream was deep it was very still , and the children took no harm ."
In the morning -- so I am told by my friend the kingfisher -- they were rescued by a fisherman who lived near the river bank . '
"The children had been lying on the bench , listening lazily to the chatter up to this point ; but when they heard the story of the crystal cradle which their foster-mother had always been fond of telling them , they sat upright and looked at each other ."
"` Oh , how glad I am I learnt the birds ' language ! '"
"But Dick still stood irresolute ; he was yet young to the more deplorable necessities of war , and the thought of old Lady Brackley checked the command upon his tongue ."
His own men became restive .
"Some of them cried on him by name ; others , of their own accord , began to shoot ; and at the first discharge poor Bennet bit the dust ."
Then Dick awoke .
`` On ! ''
he cried .
"`` Shoot , boys , and keep to cover ."
England and York ! ''
"But just then the dull beat of many horses on the snow suddenly arose in the hollow ear of the night , and , with incredible swiftness , drew nearer and swelled louder ."
"At the same time , answering tuckets repeated and repeated Hatch 's call ."
"`` Rally , rally ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` Rally upon me !
Rally for your lives ! ''
"But his men -- afoot , scattered , taken in the hour when they had counted on an easy triumph -- began instead to give ground severally , and either stood wavering or dispersed into the thickets ."
"And when the first of the horsemen came charging through the open avenues and fiercely riding their steeds into the underwood , a few stragglers were overthrown or speared among the brush , but the bulk of Dick 's command had simply melted at the rumour of their coming ."
"Dick stood for a moment , bitterly recognising the fruits of his precipitate and unwise valour ."
"Sir Daniel had seen the fire ; he had moved out with his main force , whether to attack his pursuers or to take them in the rear if they should venture the assault ."
His had been throughout the part of a sagacious captain ; Dick 's the conduct of an eager boy .
"And here was the young knight , his sweetheart , indeed , holding him tightly by the hand , but otherwise alone , his whole command of men and horses dispersed in the night and the wide forest , like a paper of pins in a bay barn ."
`` The saints enlighten me ! ''
he thought .
`` It is well I was knighted for this morning 's matter ; this doth me little honour . ''
"And thereupon , still holding Joanna , he began to run ."
"The silence of the night was now shattered by the shouts of the men of Tunstall , as they galloped hither and thither , hunting fugitives ; and Dick broke boldly through the underwood and ran straight before him like a deer ."
"The silver clearness of the moon upon the open snow increased , by contrast , the obscurity of the thickets ; and the extreme dispersion of the vanquished led the pursuers into wildly divergent paths ."
"Hence , in but a little while , Dick and Joanna paused , in a close covert , and heard the sounds of the pursuit , scattering abroad , indeed , in all directions , but yet fainting already in the distance ."
"`` An I had but kept a reserve of them together , '' Dick cried , bitterly , `` I could have turned the tables yet !"
"Well , we live and learn ; next time it shall go better , by the rood . ''"
"`` Nay , Dick , '' said Joanna , `` what matters it ?"
Here we are together once again . ''
"He looked at her , and there she was -- John Matcham , as of yore , in hose and doublet ."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."
"Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said, ""That must be the fruit; go and gather it."" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, ""Come with me to my room while I open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat me."""
"""No,"" said King Dantal; ""remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to eat you."""
"Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor."
"Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him sadly, ""Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."""
"King Dantal answered, ""It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly."" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again."
"Then Laili said, ""Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"""
"""Oh!"" said Prince Majnun, ""I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them."" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs."
"After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden."
"""We must go into that garden and see it,"" said Majnun."
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked man."" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, ""Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you to seize me."""
"""What nonsense,"" said Majnun. ""I believe he is a very good Raja."
"Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away."""
"""Well,"" said Laili, ""it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed."" Now Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow."
"Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said, ""Why did you kill my husband?"""
"""Because I want to take you,"" he answered."
"""You cannot,"" said Laili."
"""Yes, I can,"" said the Raja."
"""Take me, then,"" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch."
"Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and said, ""What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had slept for years!"" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by Laili's horse."
"""What's that?"" said Majnun."
"""That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."""
"""Who killed him?"" asked Majnun."
"""I did,"" answered Laili, ""and it was I who brought you to life."""
"""Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,"" said Majnun."
"""No,"" said Laili, ""for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm."" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, ""Jump up on the horse, then, and go far away with the groom."""
"""What will you do,"" said Majnun, ""if I leave you? I cannot leave you."""
"""I will take care of myself,"" said Laili; ""but this man is so wicked, he may kill you again if you are near him."" So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili."
"Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace."
"There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and angry. ""How lucky for you that you have such a wife,"" he said."
"""Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; ""for,"" said King Dantal, ""Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."""
"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal"
"""YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT IS,"" said the North Wind; ""once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn't blow a puff for ever so many days, after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither."""
"Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn't be at all afraid."
"""Very well, then,"" said the North Wind, ""but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get thither at all."""
"Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world's end."
"Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds."
"So they tore on and on no one can believe how far they went and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels."
"""Are you afraid?"" said the North Wind."
"""No!"" she wasn't."
"But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again."
"Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have the Prince."
"""What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?"" said the Long-nose, and threw up the window."
"""It's not for sale, for gold or money,"" said the lassie."
"""If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,"" said the Princess."
"""Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,"" said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought."
"Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again."
"So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince and be with him that night, the Princess should have it."
"But when she went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with the long nose, and chased her out again."
"So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under the castle window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it."
"Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running, and they told that to the Prince."
"That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither."
"""Ah,"" said the Prince, ""you've just come in the very nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it."""
"So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said:"
"""First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."""
"""Yes!"" said the step-mother, with all her heart."
"""Well,"" said the Prince, ""I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she can't, she's not worth having."""
"Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew."
"""Ah!"" said the old hag, her mother, ""you can't wash; let me try."""
"But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand before it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt."
"Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney."
"""Ah!"" said the Prince, ""you're none of you worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie, I'll be bound she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN, LASSIE!"""
he shouted.
"Since the above was written, the account of the death of Governor      Andros is flashed across the wires to us. Verbum sap. Also In      hoc signo vinces."
"The author wishes to express by this means his grateful      acknowledgments to his friends and the public generally for the      great turn-out and general sympathy bestowed upon his relative, the      late Peter B. Stuyvesant, on the sad occasion of his funeral, which      was said to be one of the best attended and most successful      funerals before the war. Should any of his friends be caught in the      same fix, the author will not only cheerfully turn out himself, but      send all hands from his place that can be spared, also a six-seated      wagon and a side-bar buggy."
CHAPTER IX.
SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE STATES.
"The present State of New Jersey was a part of New Netherland, and the Dutch had a trading-post at Bergen as early as 1618. After New Netherland passed into the hands of the Dutch, the Duke of York gave the land lying between the Hudson and the Delaware to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret for Christmas."
"The first permanent English settlement made in the State was at Elizabethtown, named so in honor of Sir George's first wife."
"Berkeley sold his part to some English Quakers. This part was called West Jersey. He claimed that it was too far from town. It was very hard for a lord to clear up land, and Berkeley missed his evenings at the Savage Club, and his nose yearned for a good whiff of real old Rotten Row fog."
"So many disputes arose regarding the title to Jersey that the whole thing finally reverted to the crown in 1702. When there was any trouble over titles in those days it was always settled by letting it revert to the crown. It has been some years now, however, since that has happened in this country."
"Thirty-six years later New Jersey was set apart as a separate royal province, and became a railroad terminus and bathing-place."
"Delaware was settled by the Swedes at Wilmington first, and called New Sweden. I am surprised that the Norsemen, who it is claimed made the first and least expensive summer at Newport, R. I., should not have clung to it."
"They could have made a good investment, and in a few years would have been strong enough to wipe out the Brooklyn police."
"The Swedes, too, had a good foothold in New York, Jersey, and Delaware, also a start in Pennsylvania. But the two nations seemed to yearn for home, and as soon as boats began to run regularly to Stockholm and Christiania, they returned. In later years they discovered Minneapolis and Stillwater."
"William Penn now loomed up on the horizon. He was an English Quaker who had been expelled from Oxford and jugged in Cork also for his religious belief. He was the son of Admiral Sir William Penn, and had a good record. He believed that elocutionary prayer was unnecessary, and that the acoustics of heaven were such that the vilest sinner with no voice-culture could be heard in the remotest portion of the gallery."
"The only thing that has been said against Penn with any sort of semblance of truth was that he had some influence with James II. The Duke of York also stood in with Penn, and used to go about in England bailing William out whenever he was jailed on account of his religious belief."
"Penn was quite a writer (see Appendix). He was the author of ""No Cross, No Crown,"" ""Innocency with her Open Face,"" and ""The Great Cause of Liberty of Conscience."""
"From his father he had inherited a claim against the government for sixteen thousand pounds, probably arrears of pension. He finally received the State of Pennsylvania as payment of the claim. The western boundary took in the Cliff House and Seal Rocks of San Francisco."
"Penn came to America in 1682 and bought his land over again from the Indians. It is not strange that he got the best terms he could out of the Indians, but still it is claimed that they were satisfied, therefore he did not cheat them."
"The Indian, as will be noticed by reading these pages thoughtfully, was never a Napoleon of finance. He is that way down to the present day. If you watch him carefully and notice his ways, you can dicker with him to better advantage than you can with Russell Sage."
"Take the Indian just before breakfast after two or three nights of debauchery, and offer him a jug of absinthe with a horned toad in it for his pony and saddle, and you will get them. Even in his more sober and thoughtful moments you can swap a suit of red medicated flannels with him for a farm."
"Penn gathered about him many different kinds of people, with various sorts and shades of belief. Some were Free-Will and some were Hard-Shell, some were High-Church and reminded one of a Masonic Lodge working at 32°, while others were Low-Church and omitted crossing themselves frequently while putting down a new carpet in the chancel."
"But he was too well known at court, and suspected of knowledge of and participation in some of the questionable acts of King James, so that after the latter's dethronement, and an intimation that Penn had communicated with the exiled monarch, Penn was deprived of his title to Pennsylvania, for which he had twice paid."
"Penn was a constant sufferer at the hands of his associates, who sought to injure him in every way. He rounded out a life of suffering by marrying the second time in 1695."
"In 1708 he was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the villany and mismanagement of his agent, and was thrown into Fleet Street Prison, a jail in which he had never before been confined. His health gave way afterwards, and this remarkable man died July 30, 1718."
"Philadelphia was founded in 1683 and work begun on a beautiful building known as the City Hall. Work has steadily progressed on this building from time to time since then, and at this writing it is so near completion as to give promise of being one of the most perfect architectural jobs ever done by the hand of man."
"In two years Philadelphia had sprung from a wilderness, where the rank thistle nodded in the wind, to a town of over two thousand people, exclusive of Indians not taxed. In three years it had gained more than New York had in fifty years. This was due to the fact that the people who came to Philadelphia had nothing to fear but the Indians, while settlers in New York had not only the Indians to defend themselves against, but the police also."
Penn and his followers established the great law that no one who believed in Almighty God should be molested in his religious belief.
"Even the Indians liked Penn, and when the nights were cold they would come and crawl into his bed and sleep with him all night and not kill him at all. The Great Chief of the Tribes, even, did not feel above this, and the two used frequently to lie and talk for hours, Penn doing the talking and the chief doing the lying."
"It is said that, with all the Indian massacres and long wars between the red men and the white, no drop of Quaker blood was ever shed. I quote this from an historian who is much older than I, and with whom I do not wish to have any controversy."
"The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday I heard Father say so so it wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't so there!"""
"The sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at Jane, and then he got on the slide and tried to go toward the Crystal Palace which was not easy, because that way is uphill. So they left him trying, and went on."
"Before they started, the white grouse thanked them in a few pleasant, well-chosen words, and then they took a sideways slanting run and started off again on the great slide, and so away toward the North Pole and the twinkling, beautiful lights."
"The great slide went on and on, and the lights did not seem to come much nearer, and the white silence wrapped around them as they slid along the wide, icy path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by someone calling: ""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and tumbled as before, stopping in the only possible way, and Jane stopped on top of him, and they crawled to the edge and came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking for specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net and a blue book with colored plates."
"""Excuse me,"" said the collector, ""but have you such a thing as a needle about you a very long needle?"""
"""I have a needle book,"" replied Jane, politely, ""but there aren't any needles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of cork in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young Mechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles."""
"""Curiously enough,"" said the collector, ""I too wish to use the needle in connection with cork."""
"""I have a hatpin in my hood,"" said Jane. ""I fastened the fur with it when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and sharp would that do?"""
"""One could but try,"" said the collector, and Jane began to feel for the pin. But George pinched her arm and whispered, ""Ask what he wants it for."" Then the collector had to own that he wanted the pin to stick through the great Arctic moth, ""a magnificent specimen,"" he added, ""which I am most anxious to preserve."""
"And there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net sat the great Arctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation."
"""Oh, I couldn't!"" cried Jane. And while George was explaining to the collector that they would really rather not, Jane opened the blue folds of the butterfly net, and asked the moth quietly if it would please step outside for a moment. And it did."
"When the collector saw that the moth was free, he seemed less angry than grieved."
"""Well, well,"" said he, ""here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I shall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of writing to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly thoughtless little girl."""
"So they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill towards the Crystal Palace."
"When the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks in a suitable speech, George and Jane took a sideways slanting run and started sliding again, between the star-lamps along the great slide toward the North Pole. They went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter and brighter so that they could not keep their eyes open, but had to blink and wink as they went and then suddenly the great slide ended in an immense heap of snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because they could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that they went in up to their very ears."
"When they had picked themselves out and thumped each other on the back to get rid of the snow, they shaded their eyes and looked, and there, right in front of them, was the wonder of wonders the North Pole towering high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse, and it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your head as far back as it would go, and farther, before you could see the high top of it. It was made entirely of ice. You will hear grown-up people talk a great deal of nonsense about the North Pole, and when you are grown up, it is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it yourself (the most unlikely things do happen) but deep down in your heart you must always remember that the North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not possibly, if you come to think of it, be made of anything else."
"All around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were hundreds of little fires, and the flames of them did not flicker and twist, but went up blue and green and rosy and straight like the stalks of dream lilies."
"Jane said so, but George said they were as straight as ramrods."
"And these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the children had seen as far away as Forest Hill."
"The ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth, hard snow, which shone and sparkled like the top of a birthday cake that has been iced at home. The ones done at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they mix flour with the icing sugar."
"""It is like a dream,"" said Jane."
"And George said, ""It is the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people always make about getting here and it was no trouble at all, really."""
"""I daresay lots of people have gotten here,"" said Jane, dismally. ""It's not the getting here I see that it's the getting back again."
"Perhaps no one will ever know that we have been here, and the robins will cover us with leaves and """
"""Nonsense,"" said George. ""There aren't any robins, and there aren't any leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now I shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top my handkerchief will do; and if it really is the North Pole, my pocket compass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I shall know. Come on."""
"So Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear, tall, beautiful flames they saw that there was a great, queer-shaped lump of ice all around the bottom of the Pole clear, smooth, shining ice, that was deep, beautiful Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and all sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors in the thin parts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's house in London."
"""It is a very curious shape,"" said Jane. ""It's almost like"" she moved back a step to get a better view of it ""it's almost like a dragon."""
"""It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment,"" said George, who had noticed a curly thing like a tail that went twisting up the North Pole."
"""Oh, George,"" cried Jane, ""it is a dragon; I can see its wings."
"Whatever shall we do?"""
"And, sure enough, it was a dragon a great, shining, winged, scaly, clawy, big-mouthed dragon made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep curled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the middle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column of steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have got frozen in his sleep frozen too hard to move and there he stayed."
"No! They are placed right for you to look at other people, and are where they help you hunt for food."""
"""How often may I look at my own feathers?"" asked the young Woodpecker."
"He was wondering at that minute how his tail looked, but he was determined not to turn his head."
"The old Woodpecker's eyes twinkled. ""I should think,"" he said, ""that since you are young and have no family to look after, you might preen your feathers in the morning and in the afternoon and when you go to sleep. Then, of course, when it is stormy, you will have to take your waterproof out of the pocket under your tail, and put it on one feather at a time, as all birds do. That would be often enough unless something happened to rumple them."""
"""I will not look at them any oftener,"" said the young Red-headed Woodpecker, firmly. ""I will not be called a silly fellow."" And he was as good as his word."
"His mother sighed when she heard of the change. ""I am very glad,"" said she. ""But isn't that always the way? His father and I have talked and talked, and it made no difference; but let somebody else say he is silly and vain, and behold!"""
THE NIGHT MOTH WITH A CROOKED FEELER
"The beautiful, brilliant Butterflies of the Meadow had many cousins living in the forest, most of whom were Night Moths. They also were very beautiful creatures, but they dressed in duller colors and did not have slender waists. Some of the Butterflies, you know, wear whole gowns of black and yellow, others have stripes of black and white, while some have clear yellow with only a bit of black trimming the edges of the wings."
"The Moths usually wear brown and have it brightened with touches of buff or dull blue. If they do wear bright colors, it is only on the back pair of wings, and when the Moth alights, he slides his front pair of wings over these and covers all the brightness. They do not rest with their wings folded over their heads like the Butterflies, but leave them flat."
"All the day long, when the sun is shining, the Moths have to rest on trees and dead leaves. If they were dressed in yellow or red, any passing bird would see them, and there is no telling what might happen."
"As it is, their brown wings are so nearly the color of dead leaves or bark that you might often look right at them without seeing them."
"Yet even among Moths there are some more brightly colored than others, and when you find part of the family quietly dressed you can know it is because they have to lay the eggs. Moths are safer in dull colors, and the egg-layers should always be the safest of all. If anything happened to them, you know, there would be no Caterpillar babies."
"One day a fine-looking Cecropia Moth came out of her chrysalis and clung to the nearest twig while her wings grew and dried and flattened. At first they had looked like tiny brown leaves all drenched with rain and wrinkled by somebody's stepping on them. The fur on her fat body was matted and wet, and even her feelers were damp and stuck to her head."
"Her six beautiful legs were weak and trembling, and she moved her body restlessly while she tried again and again to raise her crumpled wings."
"She had not been there so very long before she noticed another Cecropia Moth near her, clinging to the under side of a leaf. He was also just out of the chrysalis and was drying himself. ""Good morning!"" he cried."
"""I think I knew you when we were Caterpillars. Fine day to break the chrysalis, isn't it?"""
"""Lovely,"" she answered. ""I remember you very well. You were the Caterpillar who showed me where to find food last summer when the hot weather had withered so many of the plants."""
"""I thought you would recall me,"" he said. ""And when we were spinning our chrysalides we visited together. Do you remember that also?"""
"Miss Cecropia did. She had been thinking of that when she first spoke, but she hoped he had forgotten. To tell the truth, he had been rather fond of her the fall before, and she, thinking him the handsomest Caterpillar of her acquaintance, had smiled upon him and suggested that they spin their cocoons near together. During the long winter she had regretted this. ""I was very foolish,"" she thought, ""to encourage him."
"When I get my wings I may meet people who are better off than he. Now I shall have to be polite to him for the sake of old friendship. I only hope that he will make other acquaintances and leave me free. I must get into the best society."""
"All this time her neighbor was thinking, ""I am so glad to see her again, so glad, so glad! When my wings are dry I will fly over to her and we will go through the forest together."" He was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, who cared more for friendship than for beauty or family."
"Meanwhile their wings were growing fast, and drying, and flattening, so that by noon they could begin to raise them above their heads. They were very large Moths and their wings were of a soft dust color with little clear, transparent places in them and touches of the most beautiful blue, quite the shade worn by the Peacock, who lived on the farm. There was a brown and white border to their wings, and on their bodies and legs the fur was white and dark orange. When the Cecropias rest, they spread their wings out flat, and do not slide the front pair over the others as their cousins, the Sphinxes, do. The most wonderful of all, though, are their feelers."
"The Butterflies have stiff feelers on their heads with little knobs on the ends, or sometimes with part of them thick like tiny clubs. The Night Moths have many kinds of feelers, most of them being curved, and those of the Cecropias look like reddish-brown feathers pointed at the end."
"Miss Cecropia's feelers were perfect, and she waved them happily to and fro. Those of her friend, she was troubled to see, were not what they should have been. One of them was all right, the other was small and crooked. ""Oh dear,"" she said to herself, ""how that does look! I hope he will not try to be attentive to me."" He did not mind it much. He thought about other things than looks."
"As night came, a Polyphemus Moth fluttered past. ""Good evening!"" cried he. ""Are you just out? There are a lot of Cecropias coming out to-day."""
"Miss Cecropia felt quite agitated when she heard this, and wondered if she looked all right. Her friend flew over to her just as she raised her wings for flight. ""Let me go with you,"" he said."
"While she was wondering how she could answer him, several other Cecropias came along. They were all more brightly colered than she."
"""Hullo!"" cried one of them, as he alighted beside her. ""First-rate night, isn't it?"""
"He was a handsome fellow, and his feelers were perfect; but Miss Cecropia did not like his ways, and she drew away from him just as her friend knocked him off the branch. While they were fighting, another of the strangers flew to her. ""May I sit here?"" he asked."
"""Yes,"" she murmured, thinking her chance had come to get into society."
"""I must say that it served the fellow right for his rudeness to you,"""
"Heretofore among the politicians a platform, like that on the railway cars, ""is made for the purpose of helping the party to get aboard, but not to ride on."""
"The Columbian Exposition and World's Fair at Chicago in the summer of 1893 eclipsed all former Exhibitions, costing more and showing greater artistic taste, especially in its buildings, than anything preceding it."
"Some gentle warfare resulted from a struggle over the question of opening the ""White City"" on Sunday, and a great deal of bitterness was shown by those who opposed the opening and who had for years favored the Sunday closing of Niagara. A doubtful victory was obtained by the Sunday openers, for so many of the exhibitors closed their departments that visitors did not attend on Sunday in paying quantities."
"Against a thousand odds and over a thousand obstacles, especially the apprehension of Asiatic cholera and the actual sudden appearance of a gigantic money panic, Chicago, heroic and victorious, carried out her mighty plans and gave to the world an exhibition that won golden opinions from her friends and stilled in dumb wonder the jealousy of her enemies."
"In the mean time, the author begs leave to thank his readers for the rapt attention shown in perusing these earnest pages, and to apologize for the tears of sympathy thoughtlessly wrung from eyes unused to weep, by the graphic word-painting and fine education shown by the author."
"It was not the intention of the writer to touch the fountain of tears and create wash-outs everywhere, but sometimes tears do one good."
"In closing, would it be out of place to say that the stringency of the money market is most noticeable and most painful, and for that reason would it be too much trouble for the owner of this book to refuse to loan it, thereby encouraging its sale and contributing to the comfort of a deserving young man?"
THE END.
THE Velveteen Rabbit
"Here was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming."
"There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten."
Christmas Morning
"For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with Government. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse."
The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.
"He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it."
"""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"""
"""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."""
"""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit."
"""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."""
"""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?"""
"""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept."
"Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
"""I suppose you are real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled."
The Skin Horse Tells His Story
"""The Boy's Uncle made me Real,"" he said. ""That was a great many years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always."""
"The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him."
"There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled them away in cupboards. She called this ""tidying up,"" and the playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft."
"One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop."
"""Here,"" she said, ""take your old Bunny! He'll do to sleep with you!"""

CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.
"calmly, and added, with a sigh, ""I have no doubt he would have landed"
"you in rather an awkward fix ... had we not taken pity upon you."""
"""Ah!""  And the angry soldier raised his hand.  ""There are two of them"
"...  One of them discovered it, the other wrote the petition, the"
"accursed reporter!"""
"""Why the reporter?"""
"""He writes for the papers ...  He is one of your lodgers ... there they"
"all are outside ...  Clear them away, for Christ's sake!  The robbers!"
They disturb and annoy everyone in the street.  One cannot live for
them ... And they are all desperate fellows ...  You had better take
"care, or else they will rob or burn you ..."""
"""And this reporter, who is he?"" asked Petunikoff, with interest."
"""He?  A drunkard.  He was a teacher but was dismissed.  He drank"
everything he possessed ... and now he writes for the papers and
"composes petitions.  He is a very wicked man!"""
"""H'm!  And did he write your petition, too?  I suppose it was he who"
discovered the flaws in the building.  The beams were not rightly put
"in?"""
"""He did!  I know it for a fact!  The dog!  He read it aloud in here and"
"boasted, 'Now I have caused Petunikoff some loss!'"""
"""Ye--es...  Well, then, do you want to be reconciled?"""
"""To be reconciled?""  The soldier lowered his head and thought. ""Ah!"
"This is a hard life!"" said he, in a querulous voice, scratching his"
"""They was here first,"" said Lampert obstinately."
"""But the hisland is British ground,"" urged Simcox, ""and where our"
flag flies no Frenchman can have the best.  We gives 'em liberty to
"trade, and they can take what's left.  What for have we always beat"
"'em if we're to give in now?"""
"""Continuosity of foreign politics is my motter,"" said the skipper."
"""With continuosity and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'"
"this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and evacuate.  I shall send"
"hin my hultimatum this very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be"
"hambassador."""
Simcox looked anxious.
"""Well, captain, I was thinking it would be judicious policy to send"
in the Dutchman.  It will remind them that Europe is more or less
"agin them, and to have a Dutchman here will make 'em think twice"
"afore they elects for war."""
The skipper shook his head.
"""No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the surface, but takin' deeper"
"thought it ain't.  It would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy."
"We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin' anythin' unpleasin'"
more'n askin' for our rights.  And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to
remind 'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat 'em.  And
moreover it's accordin' to no tradition I've heard of to send a
"furriner as hambassador.  No, Simcox, you shall go.  I'll draw up the"
"hultimatum at once."""
"""Yes, yes; that's nothing!  Don't cry--don't cry!"""
"Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but"
still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down.  Gyp felt
"paralyzed.  The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of"
mutton--creeping!
"At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving"
"for sugar-plums, murmured:"
"""It's you he--he--really loves all the time.  And you don't love"
"him--that's what's so funny--and--and--I can't understand it.  Oh, Mrs."
"Fiorsen, if I could see him--just see him!  He told me never to come"
again; and I haven't dared.  I haven't seen him for three weeks--not
"since I told him about IT.  What shall I do?  What shall I do?"""
His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
"crawl back to a man who had spurned her.  Unconsciously, she had drawn"
"herself up and pressed her lips together.  The girl, who followed every"
"movement, said piteously:"
"""I don't seem to have any pride.  I don't mind what he does to me, or"
"what he says, if only I can see him."""
Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity.  She said:
"""How long before?"""
"""Three months."""

trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.

I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;
every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable
"soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the"
"blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,"
when I suddenly got scared right through.
His eyes.
They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.
Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did
"it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a"
surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it
opened two long tooth-studded jaws.
"""Green shatas!"" he said suddenly. ""Only a tadpole. I must be getting"
"jumpy enough to splash."""
Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly
"leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted"
"to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes."
"I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. ""My name is Ferdinand"
"Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--"""
"""Hope for your sake,"" he said to me, ""that you aren't what you"
"seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura."""
"""_What?_"""
"""A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come"
"""Have you ever heard the like of it? She told me to get out! I shall leave"
"tomorrow."""
"""Have you found the galoshes?"" I asked."
"""Of course,"" he replied. ""They were right in the passage. 'Here they are,'"
"I said to her. 'Yes, yes,' she said. 'Right under your nose,' I said."
"'Yes, yes, go away,' she said, and began to cry. So I went away."""
"""She'll get over it."""
"""Do you think so? Yes, I expect she will. Oh, well, it's my opinion nobody"
"can understand women, anyhow. But they're a mighty sex, the women, a"
"mighty sex. They certainly are."""

That evening the lady was in the dining room before us; she was there when
"we came in, and we all nodded slightly in greeting. To the actor she was"
"very kind, quite making up for her petulance of the afternoon."
When he sat down he found a letter in his table napkin: a written note
folded into the napkin. He was so surprised that he dropped everything he
"was doing to unfold and read it. With an exclamation and a smile, his"
"blue, delighted eyes splashed over her; but she was looking down into her"
"lap with her forehead wrinkled, so he put the note away in his vest"
pocket.
"Then it probably dawned on him that he had betrayed her, and he tried to"
cover it up somehow.
Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"
"eye to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed his horses to"
his ancient cab and had them ready for an emergency.
After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.
"""Now give me some inkling of what started this crazy adventure. Thank"
God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still
"fighting for his life! Answer me, Sidney."""
But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"
"when she spoke, came with a childish tremor."
"""Oh, Lavender _can't_ die. If he does--it will be all my fault! I"
"started everything. I--I told him about the diamonds--"""
"""_Diamonds_--"""
"ship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the"
Welsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the
"_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on"
"the Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and"
"her cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns."
"Alves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor"
"of Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but"
by way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a
Scotch one and not a Portuguese.

"In 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the"
Banks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by
"Phillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John"
"Fillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,"
"Edward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and"
"the two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was"
taken to Boston.

Of the Island of Antigua.

"prevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35."
"""Vera, my love,"" Eva said, cutting her off, ""if you try and double-"
"cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You seem to forget we've"

"we've deciphered it."""
"""You--?"""
"""That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going to like what"
"it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story before"

"Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. ""Michael, Tanzan Mino's people"

"King William Street first."" He was nervously glancing out the window."
"""We're running out of time."""
"The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take charge."
"But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85, a"
"lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his"
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.
The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers weren't
supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.
"""Michael,"" he said as he glanced over, ""would you kindly give me a hand"

"Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. ""I don't know how far you think"
"you will get with this."""

"we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you,"

"“Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You’ve changed lots,"
Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.”
"“Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.”"
"“Doing well in New York, Jimmy?”"
"“Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on,"
"Bob; we’ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk"
about old times.”
"The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West,"
"his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history"
"of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with"
interest.
"At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When"
they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze
upon the other’s face.
The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.
"“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped. “Twenty years is a long time, but"
not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug.”
"“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,” said the tall man."

"you can git--git!"" And with these words she unbolted the door and"
concluded tensely:
"""If they kill you I don't care. Do you hear, I don't care . . ."""
At those bitter words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide
"their misery, the Girl's face became colourless."
"With the instinct of a brave man to sell his life as dearly as possible,"
"Johnson took a couple of guns from his pocket; but the next moment, as"
if coming to the conclusion that death without the Girl would be
"preferable, he put them back, saying:"

"going. He would see the name on the programme, “Amédée Bazouge.” There"
could not be two tenors of that name in Europe. Everard must be kept
away at all costs.
"She rushed from the room and down the stairs, in terrible anxiety lest"
"he should have already left the hotel. To her intense relief, she saw"
him sitting in one of the cane chairs in the vestibule smoking his
after-lunch cigar. He threw it away as he caught sight of her at the
"head of the stairs, breathless, and holding the balusters, and went up"
to meet her.
"“My poor child,” said he in an anxious tone. “What is the matter?”"
"“Oh, Everard--I don’t want any more to be left alone. Don’t think me"
silly and cowardly. I am afraid of all kinds of things.”
"“Of course I ’ll come and sit with you a little,” he replied kindly."
They entered her room together. Yvonne lay down. Her head was splitting
with nervous headache. The Canon tended her in his grave way and
"sat down by the window with a book. Yvonne felt very guilty, but yet"
"comforted by his presence. At the end of an hour, he looked at his watch"
and rose from his seat.
“Are you easier now?”
"“You are not going to the Kursaal, Everard?”"

"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"

"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.
"""Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"" he bellowed.  ""What's"

"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"Dawson came back after a few minutes, picked up another cigar from"
"Cary's box, and sat down. ""You see, I have a letter from him. I found"
"it in his quarters where I went straight from the _Malplaquet_."""
"""May we read it?"" I asked gently. ""I was greatly taken with Trehayne"
"myself. He was a clean, beautiful boy. He was an enemy officer on"
"Secret Service; there is no dishonour in that. If he were alive, I"
could shake his hand as the officer of the firing party shook the hand
"of Lody before he gave the last order."""
"Dawson took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to me. ""Read it"
"out,"" said he; ""I can't."""
CHAPTER VIII
TREHAYNE'S LETTER
I took the letter from Dawson and glanced through it. The first sheet
and the last had been written very recently--just before the boy had
left his quarters for the last time to go on board the _Malplaquet_;
the remainder had been set down at various times; and the whole had
"been connected up, put together, and paged after the completion of the"
"last sheet. Trehayne wrote a pretty hand, firm and clear, the writing"
of an artist who was also a trained engineer. There was no trace in
the script of nervousness or of hesitation. He had carried out his
"Orders, he saw clearly that the path which he had trod was leading him"
"to the end of his journey, but he made no complaint. He was a Latin,"
"girl's getting on. She's dependent upon her own labor."" As she spoke"
she spread out the sheet. A sketch dropped to the table.
Trude drew a long breath. She had not known how worried she was. She
wanted to laugh aloud now from sheer relief. Because she had to do
"something she took up the sketch with a murmured: ""May I?"""
"""Laura writes it's a little sketch she made in class. 'This will show"
you I am improving. It's from life. It will give you an idea of the
"delightful types we find around here, types that you will not find"
anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds whom you see almost
anytime on the beach or around the wharves--as wild and free and
"beautiful as the seagulls--'"""
Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take the sketch and exclaimed
aloud at Trude's face. It had gone deathly white.
"""My _dear_, what is it?"""
For a moment Trude could not answer. She was staring at the sketch as
though she could not take her eyes from it.
"""Read that again! These are types--you find these girls any time on the"
"wharves--wild--vagabonds! Oh, Aunt Edith that's--_that's_--_Sidney_!"""
"""Why, it _can't_ be, Trude. You said--"""
"Trude shook her head. ""I can't help what I said. It's Sidney. I--know."
The likeness is true--there can't be anyone else who looks like Sidney!
But she's barefooted--and--and so--_slovenly_--and--_her hair_! She's
"cut her beautiful hair!"""
"in it, to check up on the disappearance of the first. That ship, too,"
never came back. Almost with the second of its arrival at the edge of
the red area all radio communication with it was cut off. It was never
heard from again. Two weeks ago I sent Journeyman there. Now _he_ has
"been swallowed up in a mysterious silence."""
An exclamation burst from Brand's lips. Sub-Commander Journeyman!
"Senior officer under Stone, ablest man in the expeditionary forces,"
and Brand's oldest friend!
"Stone nodded comprehension of the stricken look on Brand's face. ""I"
"know how friendly you two were,"" he said soberly. ""That's why I chose"
"you to go and find out, if you can, what happened to him and the other"
"two ships."""
Brand's chin sank to rest on the stiff high collar of his uniform.
"""Journeyman!"" he mused. ""Why, he was like an older brother to me. And"
"now ... he's gone."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was silence in Commander Stone's sanctum for a time. Then Brand
raised his head.
"""Did you have any radio reports at all from any of the three ships"
"concerning the nature of the red spot?"" he inquired."
"""None that gave definite information,"" replied Stone. ""From each of"
the three ships we received reports right up to the instant when the
red area was approached. From each of the three came a vague
description of the peculiarity of the ground ahead of them: it seems
"Nick rose high above the other sounds of the night, calling,"
"""Min-Minnie-Girl, let us in!"" she hurriedly brushed past him and yelled"
through the door:
"""What do you want?"""
Again Johnson's hand went up imperatively.
"""Don't let him come in!"" he whispered."
"But even then she heard not his warning, but silently, tremulously"
"listened to Sonora, who shouted through the door: ""Say, Girl, you all"
"right?"" And not until her answering voice had called back her assurance"
that she was safe did she turn to the man at her side and whisper in a
voice that showed plainly her agitation and fear:
"""Jack Rance is there! If he was to see you here--he's that jealous I'd"
"be afraid--"" She checked her words and quickly put her ear close to the"
"door, the voices outside having become louder and more distinct."
"Presently she spun round on her heel and announced excitedly: ""Ashby's"
"there, too!"" And again she put her ear to the door."
"""Ashby!"" The exclamation fell from Johnson's lips before he was aware of"
it. It was impossible to deceive himself any longer--the posse had
tracked him!
"""We want to come in, Girl!"" suddenly rang out from the well-known voice"
of Nick.
"""But you can't come in!"" shouted back the Girl above the noise of the"
"storm; then, taking advantage of a particularly loud howl of the blast,"
"she turned to Johnson and inquired: ""What will I say? What reason will I"
the other end of the eyot.
"'I shall sleep,' Steve said drowsily."
"The insects were beginning to hum. The horses stood huddled together,"
swishing their long tails.
'You think they won't track us?' I asked.
"'Certain,' he said. 'There are six hundred yards of mud and water,"
"eel-holes, and willow shoots between us and the road.'"
The Waldgrave assented mechanically; it seemed so to me too. And
"by-and-by, worn out with the night's work, I fell asleep, and slept, I"
"suppose, for a good many hours, with the sun and shade passing slowly"
"across my face, and the bees droning in my ears, and the mellow warmth"
of the summer day soaking into my bones. When I awoke I lay for a time
"revelling in lazy enjoyment. The oily plop of a water-rat, as it dived"
"from a stump, or the scream of a distant jay, alone broke the laden"
silence. I looked at the sun. It lay south-west. It was three o'clock
then.
[Illustration: We were alone.... I whispered in her ear ...]
"A light touch fell on my knee. I started, looked down, and for a"
"moment stared in sleepy wonder. A tiny bunch of blue flowers, such as"
"I could see growing in a dozen places on the edge of the island, lay"
"on it, tied up with a thread of purple silk. I started up on my elbow,"
"and--there, close beside me, with her cheeks full of colour, and the"
"sunshine finding golden threads in her dark hair, sat Marie, toying"
Eva. Where was she?
"He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap anese,"
"the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A"
classic.
But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.
The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up and headed
for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized that
the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.
"But across, opposite the _tokonoma_, was another set of sliding doors."
"As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing _tabi_, light"
"cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned"
"_yukata_  robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-"
dressed.
"This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms lay beyond,"
"and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He"
"moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming"
"disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it."
"""Wake up."" He shook her again. ""The party just got moved. Wait'll you"
"get a load of the decor."""
"""What . . ."" She rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes. Then"
she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was appointed
"identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the _tokonoma_"
"different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. ""My God."""
"The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was"
"in for it. ""I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's"
"library,"" I told her in a hurry."
"""No doubt,"" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. ""But"
you aren't going to tell me that you read about _dunging_ in the ship's
library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of
Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible
young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed--this Terran
"Agent--"""
"""Paddlefoot,"" I sneered."
"Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. ""Now that's a term,"" she said"
"carefully, ""that is used only by Venusian riffraff."""
"""They're not!"""
"""Not what?"""
"""Riffraff,"" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the"
time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!
"""They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building"
"Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like"
"Venus."""
"""Does it, now?"" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow"
"a second pair of ears. ""Tell me more."""
"""You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start"
civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid
to make their own law if necessary--with their own guns. That's where

life and death. But I shouldn't have told you. Well--we'd better say good
"night now, Gerda."""
The manufacturer and his wife got up.
Then the first man from Bergen made another speech.
*       *       *       *       *
"The manufacturer stayed with us for the promised three days, and then made"
ready to travel again. His mood never changed; he was contented and
entertaining the whole time. Every evening one whisky and soda was brought
"him--no more. Before their bedtime, his little girls had a wildly"
hilarious half-hour with him. At night a tremendous snoring could be heard
"from his cottage. Before his arrival, the little girls had spent a good"
"deal of time with me, but now they no longer knew I existed, so taken up"
with their father were they. He hung a swing for them between the two
"rowan trees in the field, taking care to pack plenty of rag under the rope"
so as not to injure the tree.
He also had a talk with Paul; there were rumors that he was intending to
"take his money out of the Tore Peak resort. Paul's head was bent now, but"
he seemed even more hurt that the manufacturer should have paid a visit to
"“Powder,” answered the Canon. “She has been using her puff too freely.”"
"“She has been putting it on with a _muff_,” cried Yvonne."
He laughed. Yvonne had such a triumphant air in delivering herself of
little witticisms.
"A magnificently dressed woman, in a great feathered hat and low-dress,"
"with diamonds gleaming at her neck, passed by. “You are right, I fear,"
"about the two worlds,” said the Canon."
“Are n’t there crowds of them? I like to look at them because they wear
such beautiful things. And they fit so. And then to rub shoulders with
"them makes one feel so delightfully wicked. You know, I knew a girl"
once--she went in for that life of her own accord and she was awfully
happy. Really. Is n’t it odd?”
"“My dear Yvonne!” said the Canon, somewhat shocked, “I sincerely trust"
"you did not continue the acquaintance, afterwards.”"
"“Oh, no,” she replied, sagely. “It would not have done for me at all."
A lone woman can’t be too careful. But I used to hear about her from my
dressmaker.”
Her point of view was not exactly the Canon’s. But further discussion
"was stopped by the arrival of the Wilmingtons, who carried off Yvonne"
"to the dancing-room. The Canon, drawing the line at his own appearance"
"there, strolled back contentedly to the hotel to finish the evening over"
a book.
Two mornings afterwards Yvonne was walking by herself along the _digue_.
"They were to leave for Switzerland the next day, and she determined to"
"Whereupon, Johnson went over to the window and put his face close to"
hers on the frosted panes; a great sea of white snow met his gaze!
"""This means--"" he said, turning away from the window and meeting her"
"glance--""surely it doesn't mean that I can't leave Cloudy to-night?"""
"""It means you can't get off the mountain to-night,"" calmly answered the"
Girl.
"""Good Lord!"" fell from the man's lips."
"""You can't leave this room to-night,"" went on the Girl, decidedly. ""Why,"
you couldn't find your way three feet from this door--you a stranger!
"You don't know the trail anyway unless you can see it."""
"""But I can't stay here?"" incredulously."
"""Why not? Why, that's all right! The boys'll come up an' dig us out"
"to-morrow or day after. There's plenty o' wood an' you can have my bed."""
"And with no more ado than that, the Girl went over to the bed to remove"
the covers and make it ready for his occupancy.
"""I wouldn't think of taking that,"" protested the man, stoutly, while his"
face clouded over.
The Girl felt a thrill at the note of regard in his voice and hastened
to explain:
"""I never use it cold nights; I always roll up in my rug in front of the"
"fire."" All of a sudden she broke out into a merry little laugh. ""Jest"
"think of it stormin' all this time an' we didn't know it!"""
“It must be such an adventure. It must make you hold your breath and
your heart beat.”
John wondered grimly whether a certain doer of wickedness had felt this
"ecstatic rapture. She, too, must have seen the gray dawn, but creeping"
through prison-bars into her cell. God of Inscrutability! Was it
"possible that these two co-watchers of the dawn, both so dominant in his"
"life, were of the same race of beings? If the one was a woman born of"
"woman, what in the name of mystery was Stellamaris?"
"“Don't look so grave, Great High Belovedest,” she said, squeezing a"
finger. “I only spoke in fun. It must really be horrid to be wicked.
When I was little I had a book about Cruel Frederick--I think it
"belonged to grandmama. It had awful pictures, and there were rhymes--"
"He tore the wings off little flies,"
And then poked out their little eyes.
And there was a picture of his doing so. I used to think him a
detestable boy. It made me unhappy and kept me awake when I was quite
"small, but now I know it's all nonsense. People don't do such things, do"
they?”
"Risca twisted his glum face into a smile, remembering the Unwritten Law."
"“Of course not, Stellamaris,” said he. “Cruel Frederick is just as much"
"of a mythical personage as the Giant Fee-fo-fum, who said:"
"I smell the blood of an Englishman,"
"And be he alive or be he dead,"
aid. The thought of either was unendurable. I hated him—yet was
dependent on him.
"“To-night I met him, in his empty apartment, alone. I knew that he had"
"what was left of his money with him, that everything was packed up. I"
went prepared. I would not elope. My plan was no less than to make him
pay the balance on the necklace that he had lost—or to murder him.
"“I carried a new pistol in my muff, one which Lynn had just bought. I"
don’t know how I did it. I was desperate.
"“He told me he loved me, that Lynn did not, never had—that Lynn had"
"married me only to show off his wealth and diamonds, to give him a"
social! position—that I was merely a—a piece of property—a dummy.
“He tried to kiss me. It was revolting. I struggled away from him.
"“And in the struggle, the revolver fell from my muff and exploded on"
the floor.
“At once he was aflame with suspicion.
"“‘So—it’s murder you want!’ he shouted. ‘Well, murder it shall be!’"
“I saw death in his eye as he seized my arm. I was defenseless now. The
old passion came over him. Before he killed—he—would have his way with
me.
“I screamed. With a wild effort I twisted away from him.
"“He raised his hand to strike me, I saw his eyes, glassy. Then he sank"
back—fell to the floor—dead of apoplexy—dead of his furious emotions.
"of veal, and he’s got a cute little round bald spot on the top of his"
head. And he wants to be dignified and speaks his words impressively.
"Say, Ned,” the boy continued, “I wouldn’t mind having that fellow get"
into some kind of a mixup out here!”
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the voice from the forest.
"“That’s Gilroy, all right enough!” Ned declared. “Why don’t you go down"
"and see what he wants, Jimmie?” he added."
"“Aw, he ain’t talking to me!” cried the boy."
"“Then I presume I’ll have to go,” Ned said, rising from his seat in"
front of the barrier. “Perhaps he’s been stung by a bee.”
"“He didn’t get crippled in his shrieker,” Jimmie suggested."
Ned stepped into the cave and secured an automatic revolver to replace
"the one taken from him at the old mission, and also passed one to"
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest in the direction of the
sounds.
"The call for help continued to come, although the voice of the man came"
hoarser at every call. When the boys finally came close enough to
"distinguish words spoken in low tones, they heard a warning."
“Shoot!” he cried. “There’s a lot of bears under this tree!”
"Although convulsed with laughter, the boys moved more cautiously after"
this. At last they came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
"There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced, and they saw a black"
object shambling away.
"A door opened, and through it (though dimly) Rollo could see the great"
"waterfall glimmering and above the stars, chill over the snowy shoulder"
"of Peñalara. He could not make out who had opened the door, but there"
was enough light to discern that a lady wrapped in a mantilla went out
"first. Then followed another, stouter and of shorter stature, apparently"
carrying a burden. Then the whole doorway was obscured by the tall
figure of a man.
"""Muñoz himself, by Heaven!"" thought Rollo."
"And with a leap he was after him, in his headlong course dashing to the"
ground some other unseen person who confronted him in the hall.
In a moment more he had caught the tall man by the collar and swung him
impetuously round back within the doorway.
"""Move one sole inch and your blood be on your own head!"" he muttered."
"And the captive feeling Rollo's steel cold at his throat, remained"
prudently silent. Not so the lady without. She uttered a cry which rang
about the silent château.
"""Muñoz! My husband! Fernando, where art thou? Oh, they have slain him,"
"and I only am to blame!"""
"She turned about and rushed back to the door, which she was about to"
"enter, when a cry far more sudden and terrible rang out behind her."
"""_They have killed the Princess! Some one hath slain my darling!_"""
"At the word Rollo abandoned the man whom he was holding down, and with"
"shouts of ""Cardono!"" ""El Sarria!"" ""To me! They are upon us!"" he flung"
"“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"“Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They"
left a week ago Tuesday.”
“And before they occupied it?”
"“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business."
He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two
"children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,"
whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a
"year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The
essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had
"departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house"
"furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,"
singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the
sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly
into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut
"he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself"
gratefully upon the bed.
It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched
it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where
house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.
"“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy,"
worth while to add that the next suite was his own.
"""A thousand pardons,"" repeated M. Dubois, very penitently. ""I am too"
stupid! But mademoiselle will perhaps be so gracious as to forgive me
"this time."""
"He bowed to Sallie again and to Slyne, and disappeared, sharply scanning"
the latter's face to the last.
"""Who's that son of a sea-cook?"" snapped Captain Dove, and Mr. Jobling"
looked wanly up out of one eye.
"""A French detective,"" Slyne answered reflectively. But Sallie felt sure"
"that he was afraid of M. Dubois, and wondered why."
"""Well, he has nothing against me that I'm aware of,"" the old man"
"declared. ""And now--what about this wire? Does it mean that some other"
fellow has scooped the pool--and that I've had all my trouble for
"nothing, eh?"" He clenched his fist again and shook it in the lawyer's"
face.
"""No, no,"" gasped Mr. Jobling. ""Don't be so hasty. It makes no difference"
"at all, now that we have Lady Josceline with us. I told you that the"
"American, Carthew, is of no account against her--and how he has ever"
"cropped up again I can't conceive. In any case--"""
"""In any case, you'd better be off to your room and ring for a bit of"
"beefsteak to doctor that eye with,"" Slyne interposed in a tone of"
intense annoyance.
"""And I wish to goodness, Dove!"" he added savagely, ""that you would"
"behave a little more like a reasonable human being and less--"""
"uprooting of all your habits,” said he, in a softened voice."
"She smiled. “I can bring them with me,” she said cheerfully. “You won't"
"mind Dandy, will you? He'll soon get used to you. And as for Dickie,”"
"she added, with a touch of wistfulness, “I 'm sure I can find a nice"
home for him.”
John put his arm round her shoulder and gave her the kiss of a shy bear.
"“My good soul,” he cried, “bring fifty million Dickies if you like.” He"
laughed. “There's nothing like the song of birds for the humanizing of
the cockney child.”
"He looked around and beheld the little, gimcrack room with a new vision."
"After all, it was as much an expression of her individuality, and as"
"genuine in the eyes of the high gods, as Herold's exquisitely furnished"
"abode was of Herold's, or the untidy jumble of the room in Fenton Square"
was of his own. And all she had to live upon was a hundred and fifty
"pounds a year, and no artistic instincts or antecedents whatsoever."
“I feel a brute in asking you to give up this little place now that
"you've made it so pretty,” he said."
"Her face brightened at the praise. “It is pretty, is n't it?” Then she"
sighed as her eyes rested fondly on her possessions. “I suppose it would
be too tiny for us all to live here.”
"“I'm afraid it would,” said John. “Besides, we must live in London, on"
account of my work.”
“In London?”
"“We might begin,” replied John, “with more elementary accomplishments.”"
"“I could teach her botany,” said Miss Lindon, pensively. “I got first"
"prize for it at school. I still have the book in a cupboard, and I"
could read it up. And I'm so glad I have kept my two volumes of pressed
"flowers. It's quite easy to learn, I assure you.”"
"“I'm afraid, my dear,” said John, “you 'll first have to teach her to"
"eat and drink like a Christian, and blow her nose, and keep her face"
clean.”
"“Ah, that reminds me. My head's in a maze, and I can't think of"
"everything at once, like some clever people. What kind of soap do"
"gentlemen use? I 'll have to know, so as to supply you with what you"
like.”
"“Any old stuff that will make a lather,” said John, rising."
"“But some soaps are so bad for the skin,” she objected anxiously."
“Vitriol would n't hurt my rhinoceros hide.”
"He laughed, and held out his hand. Further discussion was useless."
Miss Lindon accompanied him to the front gate and watched him stride
down the perky terrace until he disappeared round the corner. Then she
"went slowly into the house and uncovered the canary, who blinked at her"
"in oblique sullenness, and did not respond to her friendly “cheep” and"
the scratching of her finger against the rails of his cage. She turned
"to Dandy, who, snoring loud, was equally unresponsive. Feeling lonely"
"and upset, she rang the bell."
"""So! We know now what happened to Journeyman and the others!"" burst"
"out Dex. ""I'll see 'em in hell before I'll talk!"""
"""And me,"" nodded Brand. ""But that doesn't cure the situation. As long"
"as ships disappear in this red inferno, so long will the Old Man keep"
sending others to find out what's wrong. The Rogans will capture them
as easily as they captured us. And eventually someone will happen
"along who'll weaken under torture. Then--"""
*       *       *       *       *
He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the
"feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies"
falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.
"Greca caught the vision. She nodded. ""Yes, that is what would happen"
"if they found ways of reaching your globe."""
"""But, God, Brand, we can't allow that!"" cried Dex. ""We've got to find"
"a way to spike the guns of these walking gas-pipes, somehow!"""
"Brand sighed heavily. ""We are two against hundreds of thousands. We"
"are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we"
are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can
"we do to spike their guns?"""
He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the

"""What's in that big, round topped building, Greca?"" he asked quietly."
"""I do not know, exactly,"" replied the girl. ""There is some sort of"
"enough wisdom and courage to put this matter before the people?"""
"""Young man, I am not going to pass judgment on anyone in Washington or"
"elsewhere. Each of us, I'm sure, does his duty as he sees it."""
Again it seemed to Senator Crane that he heard a ripple of mirth--louder
this time. It had to be something to do with the acoustics. Except that
"he was suddenly aware of smiles, too. The next question had to do with"
possible consultation with Russia on the matter of the coming space
invasion.
Senator Crane agreed that such consultation should be made and then
retired hastily into seclusion. A touch of panic hit him. He felt like a
"man who was far out in the water without a boat, with the closest land a"
few hundred feet straight down. Good God! Had he miscalculated? Of
course not. He had only to await the verdict of the nation's top
newspapers before proceeding with the publicity program that might well
make him presidential timber.

"John Dennis, for the first time since Rhoda had known him, seemed"
nervous. He kept licking his lips and shifting his eyes from Rhoda to
Frank Corson.
"Frank Corson sat quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Rhoda crossed"
to the liquor cabinet and poured a double Scotch. She went to the sofa
and sat down a little uncertainly.
"""I guess you two haven't met. John, this is Frank Corson."""
"John Dennis paid no attention. He walked to the sofa, sat down, and took"
He broke off abruptly as a sound of sliding bolts came from the
"doorway. The two men whirled around to face the door, their fists"
doubling instinctively against whatever new danger might threaten
them.

"The door was opened and two of their ugly, towering enemies came in,"
their tubes held conspicuously before them. Behind came another
"figure; and at sight of this one, so plainly not of the race of"
"Jupiter, the Earthmen gasped with wonder."
"They saw a girl who might have come from Earth, save that she was"
taller than most Earth women--of a regal height that reached only an
inch or two below Brand's own six foot one. She was beautifully
"formed, and had wavy dark hair and clear light blue eyes. A sort of"
"sandal covered each small bare foot; and a gauzy tunic, reaching from"
"above the knee to the shoulder, only half shielded her lovely figure."
She was bearing a metal container in which was a mess of stuff
evidently intended as food. The guards halted and stepped aside to let
"her pass into the room. Then they backed out, constantly keeping Dex"
"and Brand covered with the tubes, and closed and barred the door."
The girl smiled graciously at the admiration in the eyes of both the
men--a message needing no inter-planetary interpretation. She
"advanced, and held the metal container toward them."
"""Eat,"" she said softly. ""It is good food, and life giving."""

your watchfulness. I had full information of King Charles's design upon
"my life from no less a person than Monsieur le Grand himself, who showed"
me the letter asking that I be returned to England.
"""I explained to Monsieur le Grand that the English king sought my life,"
"not because he is in fear of me, but because he thought I stood between"
him and a lady who despises him. While Monsieur le Grand was much in
"sympathy with the English king's grievance, his contempt for Charles,"
"his regard for me, which seems to be sincere, and his longing to possess"
"Dunkirk all induced him to laugh at the request, the nature of which he"
had imparted to no one save me.
"""My account of the lady who despised King Charles's love gave Monsieur le"
"Grand a new idea, and suggested a method of purchasing Dunkirk which he"
hopes will save the heavy cost of bidding against the citizens of London.
I had no hint of what he intended till one day he took me to his closet
and began to question me.
"""'Do you possess the love of the lady who despises King Charles?' he"
asked.
"""'I do, your Majesty,' I answered."
"""'Do you know you possess it?' he asked."
"""'As well as a man who is not a king may know,' I returned."
"""'Tush, tush! Kings are no more certain than other men.'"
"""'I know I possess this woman's love,' I said."
"""'Would she be willing to make a great sacrifice to help you?'"
Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward
and faced Bob.
"“I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” he snapped viciously."
"“This river hog o’ yours thinks he kin play the devil with my boom, but"
he’s got another guess comin’. I own this land an’ that sawmill. I got a
right to run my booms out in the river same as anybody else. I ain’t
"lookin’ for trouble, but the first man as tries any monkey business"
"wants to look out, that’s all.”"
"Bainbridge raised his eyebrows, and let his gaze wander leisurely from"
the man’s head to his heels with an expression which brought an added
touch of color to the already flushed cheeks.
“Indeed!” he drawled. “Who are you?”
“Who be I?” retorted the other angrily. “Humph! I don’t see that it
"makes no difference, but my name’s Joyce--John Joyce. An’ I ain’t the"
"kind as backs down an’ takes water, believe me!”"
A singularly irritating smile curved the corners of Bob’s lips. His
"unruffled composure served, as he hoped it might, to increase the rage"
of Mr. Joyce.
“Do you realize that you’re obstructing navigation?” he inquired
suavely.
"“I don’t admit it,” snapped Joyce. “There’s plenty of room for your"
"drive to git past if you had a gang that knew their business, instead of"
a lot o’ greenhorns.”
"“I dare say you could give us all points,” Bainbridge murmured smoothly,"
"through."""
"She nodded, then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the bundles of"
securities. Vance took one last look at the Smith & Wesson in his own
hand and did the same. Even ex-archaeologists could do arithmetic.
All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely stood watching
"the proceedings with a detached smile. Finally she spoke. ""Now we can"
"proceed with the counting,"" she said calmly."
"""Maybe you don't fully grasp the situation here, comrade."" Vance stared"
"at her. ""Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got to stand"
"together."""
"She burst out laughing. ""Mr. Vance, you are truly naive. No, you're"
worse. You actually thought you could sabotage the most powerful new
"global alliance of the twentieth century."" Her dark eyes were gradually"
"turning glacial. ""It will not be allowed to happen, believe me."""
"My God, he realized, that's why she wanted to get her hands on the"
"protocol. To deep-six it. She's been biding her time, stringing us"
along. And today she managed to stall us long enough for Mino's boys to
figure out the switch. She's no longer working for T-Directorate; she's
part of Tanzan Mino's operation. All this time she's been working with
them.
"""The negotiable certificates in this room will be delivered to their"
"rightful recipient by his personal jet,"" she continued. ""Today."""
"""Over my dead body."" He found himself thinking it might well be true."
"""No, Mr. Vance, not exactly. Your contribution will be more substantial"

"""One must learn by experience,"" Petunikoff reassured him, lighting a"
cigarette.
"""Learn ...  It is not that, my dear sir; but don't you see there is no"
freedom?  Don't you see what a life I lead?  I live in fear and
trembling ...  I am refused the freedom so desirable to me in my
"movements, and I fear this ghost of a teacher will write about me in"
the papers.  Sanitary inspectors will be called for ... fines will have
to be paid ... or else your lodgers will set fire to the place or rob
and kill me ... I am powerless against them.  They are not the least
"afraid of the police, and they like going to prison, because they get"
"their food for nothing there."""
"""But then we will have them turned out if we come to terms with you,"""
promised Petunikoff.
"""What shall we arrange, then?"" asked Vaviloff, sadly and seriously."
"""Tell me your terms."""
"""Well, give me the six hundred mentioned in the claim."""
"""Won't you take a hundred roubles?"" asked the merchant, calmly, looking"
"attentively at his companion, and smiling softly.  ""I will not give you"
"one rouble more,"" ... he added."
"After this, he took out his eye-glasses, and began cleaning them with"
his handkerchief.  Vaviloff looked at him sadly and respectfully.  The
"calm face of Petunikoff, his grey eyes and clear complexion, every line"
of his thickset body betokened self-confidence and a well-balanced
"""With gratitude,"
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"I sought Frances, and when I told her the substance of George's letter,"
she was almost wild with joy.
"""Am I willing to try?"" she exclaimed, laughing while tears were hanging"
"in her eyes. ""I am not only willing to try, but am determined to succeed."
"Ay, I'd sell England itself in the same cause. Of all the men I have ever"
"known, this king of ours is the greatest dupe. Since the return of the"
"court to Whitehall, he has been growing more importunate every day. He"
"seems to have lost what little wits he had, and does and says the"
"silliest things one can imagine."""
"""And you do not fear attempting to lead him on to sell Dunkirk? You do"
"not fear going too near the precipice?"" I asked, wishing to weigh her"
self-confidence more by the manner of her reply than by her words.
"She laughed and answered: ""There is no precipice, cousin Ned; nothing to"
"fear save kidnapping, and I am always guarded against that danger;"
"nothing to do of which I need feel ashamed, save the acting of a lie, and"
"surely one may lie to the father of lies without sin."""
"""But the lie may be recognized,"" I suggested, ""if one be too bold about"
"it."""
"""My lie will go little beyond a smile or two. The king's vanity will do"
"the rest. He will make himself believe that I mean more than I say."""
squarely in the stomach.
"With a startled, disbelieving look the Japanese stumbled backward,"
crashing over a large chair positioned next to the table. The other
"_kobun_ instantly reached for his holstered Llama, but by then Kenji"
"Nogami had moved, seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a"
powerful embrace.
"For her own part, Eva had lunged for Vera and her purse, to neutralize"
"the Walther she carried. Comrade Karanova, however, had already"
"anticipated everything. She whisked back the purse, then plunged her"
"hand in. What she withdrew, though, was not a pistol but a shiny"
cylindrical object made of glass.
"It was three against three, a snapshot of desperation."
"We've got a chance, Vance thought. Keep him down. And get the Llama."
"As the _kobun_ tried to rise, gasping, Vance threw himself over the"
"upturned chair, reaching to pin the man's arms. With a bear-like"
"embrace he had him, the body small and muscular in his arms. Out of the"
corner of his eye he saw Kenji Nogami still grappling with the other
"_kobun_. The computer now lay on the floor, open and askew."
"Where's Eva? He tried to turn and look for her, but there was no sound"
to guide him. Then the _kobun_ wrenched free one arm and brought a fist
"against the side of his face, diverting him back to matters at hand."
Hold him down. Just get the gun.
"He tried to crush his larger frame against the other's slim body,"
forcing the air out of him. Focus.
"Defoe is uncertain, though the character of Robinson Crusoe was certainly"
"founded on his adventures in Juan Fernandez. In 1712 he returned to Largo,"
"living the life of a recluse, and we must be forgiven for suspecting that"
"he rather acted up to the part, since it is recorded that he made a cave"
in his father's garden in which to meditate. This life of meditation in an
artificial cave was soon rudely interrupted by the appearance of a certain
"Miss Sophia Bonce, with whom Selkirk fell violently in love, and they"
"eloped together to Bristol, which must have proved indeed a sad scandal to"
the elders and other godly citizens of Largo. Beyond the fact that he was
"charged at Bristol with assaulting one Richard Nettle, a shipwright, we"
"hear no more of Selkirk until his first will was drawn up in 1717, in"
"which he leaves his fortune and house to ""my loving friend Sophia Bonce,"
"of the Pall Mall, London, Spinster."" Shortly after this, Alexander basely"
"deserted his loving friend and married a widow, one Mrs. Francis Candis,"
at Oarston in Devon.
"In 1720 he was appointed mate to H.M.S. _Weymouth_, on board of which he"
died a year later at the age of 45.
"Selkirk is immortalized in literature, not only by Defoe, but by Cowper in"
"his ""Lines on Solitude,"" beginning: ""I am monarch of all I survey."""
"SHARP, ROWLAND."
Of Bath Town in North Carolina.
One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried for piracy at Charleston in 1718
"and found ""not guilty."""
"SHASTER, ROGER."
"""It's more 'n I did,"" returned the Girl, evenly, and bolted the door."
"""Do you think I'd want to shield a man who tried to rob me?"" she asked,"
facing him.
"Ignoring the question, Rance removed the glove of his weaponless hand"
and strode to the curtains that enclosed the Girl's bed and parted them.
When he turned back he was met by a scornful look and the words:
"""So, you doubt me, do you? Well, go on--search the place. But this ends"
your acquaintance with The Polka. Don't you ever speak to me again.
"We're through."""
Suddenly there came a smothered groan from the man in the loft; Rance
"wheeled round quickly and brought up his gun, demanding:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
Leaning against the bureau the Girl laughed outright and declared that
the Sheriff was becoming as nervous as an old woman. Her ridicule was
"not without its effect, and, presently, Rance uncocked his gun and"
replaced it in its holster. Advancing now to the table where the Girl
"was standing, he took off his cap and shook it before laying it down;"
"then, pointing to the door, his eyes never leaving the Girl's face, he"
went on accusingly:
"""I saw someone standing out there against the snow. I fired. I could"
"have sworn it was a man."""
The Girl winced. But as she stood watching him calmly remove his coat
"and shake it with the air of one determined to make himself at home, she"
cried out tauntingly:
"""That's my business!"" came like a knife-cut from the Girl."
"""Do you know you're talkin' to the Sheriff?"""
"""I'm talkin' to Jack Rance, the gambler,"" she amended evenly."
"""You're right,--and he's just fool enough to take you up,"" returned"
Rance with sudden decision. He looked around him for a chair; there was
"one near the table, and the Girl handed it to him. With one hand he"
"swung it into place before the table, while with the other he jerked off"
"the table-cover, and flung it across the room. Johnson neither moved nor"
"groaned, as the edge slid from beneath his nerveless arms."
"""You and the cyards have got into my blood. I'll take you up,"" he said,"
seating himself.
"""Your word,"" demanded the Girl, leaning over the table, but still"
standing.
"""I can lose like a gentleman,"" returned Rance curtly; then, with a swift"
"seizure of her hand, he continued tensely, in tones that made the Girl"
"shrink and whiten, ""I'm hungry for you, Min, and if I win, I'll take it"
"out on you as long as I have breath."""
"A moment later, the Girl had freed her hand from his clasp, and was"
"saying evenly, ""Fix the lamp."" And while the Sheriff was adjusting the"
"wick that had begun to flare up smokily, she swiftly left the room,"
saying casually over her shoulder that she was going to fetch something
from the closet.
"""What you goin' to get?"" he called after her suspiciously. The Girl made"
"""Sallie--_Harris!_"" Mr. Jobling ejaculated. ""Dear me! Did you say"
"Sallie--er--Harris?"""
"""I said Saleh Harez,"" affirmed Captain Dove, and filled the glass at his"
"elbow again. ""But all that concerns you, so far's I can see, is that"
I've known her ever since she was knee-high to me. I've been a father to
"her all those years, and she's my adopted daughter. So now, you can take"
"it from me, Mr. Jobling, that I'm the joker, and both bowers too, in"
"this merry little game."""
"""Which makes it all the more unfortunate for you that you haven't a"
"single penny to stake on your hand,"" Slyne put in, while the lawyer"
"looked somewhat blankly from one to the other of them. ""So--don't waste"
"any more time bluffing, but tell Jobling how you found Sal--Lady"
"Josceline."""
"Captain Dove darted a very evil look at his friendly adviser. ""And what"
"if I refuse?"" he asked."
"Slyne almost smiled. ""Why cut off your own nose to spite your face?"" he"
"returned. ""You won't refuse, because it would cost you a hundred"
"thousand dollars to do so."""
"Captain Dove stroked his chin contemplatively, and his face slowly"
cleared.
"""A hundred and fifty thousand, you mean,"" he said in a most malevolent"
tone.
"Slyne got up from the table as if in anger, and for some time the two"
"wrangled over that point, the stout solicitor gazing at them with"
"evident dismay, while Sallie awaited the upshot of it all with bated"
"for herself, but with fear for me. No one can reassure her. In fact it"
was as much for her sake as anyone’s that I sent for you. Reginald has
"tried to trace the thing down himself, but has not succeeded.”"
She paused. The door opened and Reginald Blake entered. He was a young
"fellow, self confident and no doubt very efficient at the new dances,"
"though scarcely fitted to rub elbows with a cold world which, outside"
"of his own immediate circle, knew not the name of Blake. He stood for a"
moment regarding us through the smoke of his cigarette.
"“Tell me just what you have done,” asked Kennedy of him as his mother"
"introduced him, although he had done the talking for her over the"
telephone.
"“Done?” he drawled. “Why, as soon as mother told me of the letter, I"
"left an envelope up at the Prince Henry, as it directed.”"
“With the money?” put in Craig quickly.
"“Oh, no—just as a decoy.”"
“Yes. What happened?”
"“Well, I waited around a long time. It was far along in the day when a"
woman appeared at the desk. I had instructed the clerk to be on the
watch for anyone who asked for mail addressed to a Dr. Hopf. The clerk
slammed the register. That was the signal. I moved up closer.”
“What did she look like?” asked Kennedy keenly.
"“I couldn’t see her face. But she was beautifully dressed, with a long"
"light flowing linen duster, a veil that hid her features and on her"
"allow her,--and great gladness lit her face."
“Darling! Are you going to stay here to-day and to-morrow and the next
day?”
"“My dear,” said John, “I've got to get up to town this morning.”"
"“You won't do that,” said Stella. “Look at the clock.”"
"It was a quarter to one. He had spent the whole morning with her, and"
the hours had flown by like minutes.
“Why did n't you tell me that I ought to be catching my train?”
She regarded him in demure mischief.
“I had no object in making you catch your train.”
"And then Her Serene High-and-Mightiness, the nurse (who had been called"
"in for Stella when first she was put to bed in the sea-chamber, and,"
"falling under her spell, had stayed on until she had grown as much"
involved in the web of her life as Sir Oliver and Lady Julia and
"Constable and Herold and Risca), came into the room and decreed the end"
of the morning interview.
"Risca went down-stairs, his purpose unaccomplished. He walked about the"
"garden and argued with himself. Now, when a man argues with himself, he,"
"being only the extraneous eidolon of himself, invariably gets the worst"
"of the argument, and this makes him angry. John was angry; to such a"
"point that, coming across Sir Oliver, who had just returned from an"
inexplicably disastrous game of golf and began to pour a story of
"bunkered gloom into his ear, he gnashed his teeth and tore his hair and"
"be in the mornin'. You'll see in the mornin' that there'll be--"" She"
"stopped and stared in frozen terror at the sinister face of the Sheriff,"
who was coolly watching his handkerchief turn from white to red under
the slow rain of blood from the loft above.
"""Oho!"" he emitted sardonically, stepping back and pointing his gun"
"towards the loft. ""So, he's up there!"""
"The Girl's fingers clutched his arm, dragging desperately."
"""No, he isn't, Jack--no, he isn't!"" she iterated in blind, mechanical"
denial.
"With an abrupt movement, Rance flung her violently from him, made a grab"
"at the suspended ladder and lowered it into position; then, deaf to the"
"Girl's pleadings, harshly ordered Johnson to come down, meanwhile"
covering the source of the blood-drops with his gun.
"""Oh, wait,--wait a minute!"" begged the Girl helplessly. What would"
happen if he couldn't obey the summons? He had spent himself in his
"climb to safety. Perhaps he was unconscious, slowly bleeding to death!"
"But even as she tortured herself with fears, the boards above creaked as"
though a heavy body was dragging itself slowly across them. Johnson was
evidently doing his best to reach the top of the ladder; but he did not
move quickly enough to suit the Sheriff.
"""Come down, or I'll--"""
"""Oh, just a minute, Jack, just a minute!"" broke in the Girl frantically."
"""Don't shoot!--Don't you see he's tryin' to--?"""
"""Come down here, Mr. Johnson!"" reiterated the Sheriff, with a face"
She ate alone that evening.
"""Isn't your husband coming in?"" asked the woman of the house."
"""Perhaps he doesn't want anything,"" she replied."
"There he stood, away by the tiny barn pretending to be interested in the"
"roof, in the style of building, and walked round looking at it, pursing"
his lips and whistling. But she could see perfectly well from the window
"that his face was blue and dejected. When she had eaten, she walked down"
"to the shore, calling as she passed him:"
"""Go in and eat!"""
"But he had not sunk quite so low; he would not go in to eat, and slept"
towards the papers in the seed-tray.
“You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man

"“Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession, and if what I"
tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away

look glazed. When he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry
flesh on his forehead. Nobody buys a watch.
Look out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two
"""What are your plans of escape?"" I asked."
"""I shall work my way down to Sheerness, where I hope to find a boat"
"for The Hague or the French coast. Lilly, who seems to know everything,"
"past, present and future, came last night to tell me that the king has"
"fifty men seeking me in various parts of England, especially the"
"seaports, and has offered a reward of two hundred pounds for me, dead"
"or alive, preferably dead, I suppose. If I go direct to Sheerness and try"
"to take a boat, I am sure to be examined, and I'm not prepared for the"
ordeal. So I intend to preach my way down the river and induce the king's
"officers to send me abroad by force."""
"""How are you off for money, George?"" I asked."
"""I borrowed ten guineas from Lilly,"" he answered."
"""I thought you might be in need of money, so I brought fifty guineas from"
"the strong box under my bed,"" I said, offering him the little bag of"
gold.
"He hesitated, saying: ""If I take the money, you may never again see a"
"farthing of it."""
"""In that case, I'll take my pay in abusing you,"" I replied."
"""Do you believe he would, Frances?"" asked George, turning to my cousin."
Then continuing thoughtfully:
"""It is strange that I should have found such a friend at the bottom of a"
"quarrel, all because I allowed him to abuse me. Truly forbearance is a"
"profitable virtue. The 'other cheek' is the better of the two."""
"She threw up her hand suddenly, as if she were about to vent on him"
"all the passions which consumed her--the terror, rage, and shame which"
"swelled in her breast. But something in his gibing tone, something in"
the set lines of his figure--she could not see his face--checked her.
"She let her hand fall in a gesture of despair, and shrank into"
"herself, shuddering. She looked at him as at a serpent--that"
fascinated her. At last she murmured--
'You will not dare. What have they done to you?'
"'Nothing,' he answered. 'It is not their affair; it is yours.'"
For a moment after that they stood confronting one another while the
"sound of the women sobbing in a corner, and the occasional jingle of a"
"bridle outside, alone broke the silence. Behind her the room was dark;"
"behind him, through the open windows, lay the road, glimmering pale"
"through the dusk. Suddenly the door at her back opened, and a bright"
light flashed on his face. It was Marie Wort bringing in a lamp. No
"one spoke, and she set the lamp on the table, and going by him began"
"to close the shutters. Still the Countess stood as if turned to stone,"
and he stood watching her.
"'Where are they?' she moaned at last, though he had already told her."
"'In the camp,' he said."
'Can I--can I see them?' she panted.
"'Afterwards,' he answered, with the smile of a fiend; 'when you are my"
wife.'
"'em as they were talking to Peasley. You'd better 'beat' it, quick!"""
"""How? I couldn't get through that crowd. They know me. Listen!"" Outside"
the street broke into a roar at some taunt of the fishermen high up in
"the rigging. ""I can't run away, and if those detectives get me I'm"
"ruined."""
"""Well! What's to be done?"" demanded Fraser, sharply. ""If you say the"
"word, we'll shoot it out with them, and get away on the ship before--"""
"""We can't do that--there are a dozen policemen in front here."""
"""Well, you'll have to move quick, or they'll 'cop' you, sure."""
"Boyd clinched his hands in desperation. ""I guess they've got me,"" he"
"said, bitterly. ""There's no way out."""
His eyes fell upon the letter containing his boastful assurance of
victory. What a mockery!
"""From what they said I don't think they know you,"" Fraser continued."
"""Anyhow, they wanted Peasley to point you out. When they come off,"
"maybe you can slip 'em."""
"""But how?"" Boyd seized eagerly upon the suggestion. ""The wharf is"
"empty--see! I'll have to cross it in plain sight."""
Through the rear door of the office that opened upon the dock proper
they beheld the great floor almost entirely clear. Save for a few tons
"of freight at which Big George's men were working, it was as"
"unobstructed as a lawn; and, although it was nearly the size of a city"
"block, it afforded no more means of concealment than did the little"
"""All right,"" Slyne repeated. ""We'll lunch at two--after they're all"
"signed. So--off you go, and get busy."""
"The stout solicitor hurried away, cowed and obedient again, and Slyne,"
"very smart in an almost new flannel suit, rejoined Captain Dove."
"""I'm _too_ fashionable, that's what's the matter with me!"" declared"
"Captain Dove with sudden conviction at sight of him, and gazed very"
bitterly at his own image in an inconvenient mirror.
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne advised soothingly. ""It's not as if you"
"were staying here, you know. You'll be back on board your ship by"
"supper-time. And now, I must tell you how we've got to handle this"
lawyer-fellow when he fetches in the raft of papers he'll want us all to
"sign."""
"Captain Dove listened gloomily while he went on to explain, at"
"considerable length, and in his most convincing manner, that they must"
match their combined wits against the lawyer's for their own profit.
"""It's not that I don't trust him,"" said Slyne, ""but--I'll feel more"
secure after everything's settled in writing and signed. He can't go
"back on us then."""
"""He'd better not!"" Captain Dove commented. ""I'll wring his neck for him"
"if he tries--"""
"""And, as for Sallie,"" Slyne cut him short, ""I've made things quite--"""
"""Sallie will do whatever I tell her,"" growled Captain Dove. ""And don't"
you attempt to interfere between me and her--till you've paid me my
expressed intention of hiding this terrible discovery from him. He had
"been duped, not by her, but by his own romantic folly."
Yet what would his life be without her--or rather without his illusion?
An icy hand gripped his heart. He turned to the glimmering window and
stared at the blank wall.
"Presently a moan struck upon his ear. He wheeled round sharply, and"
distinguished her lying with helpless outspread arms on the couch. Mere
humanity brought him to her side.
"“I am so tired,” she moaned."
"“You must go to bed,” he replied in a gentler voice than hitherto. “We"
"had better part now. To-morrow, if you are well enough to travel, we"
will leave for England.”
"“Let me go alone,” she murmured, “and you go on to Switzerland. Why"
should your holiday be spoiled?”
"“It is my life that is spoiled,” he said ungenerously. “The holiday"
matters very little. It is best to return to England as soon as
possible. Between now and to-morrow morning I shall have time to reflect
upon the situation.”
He struck a match and lit the candles and drew down the blind. The
light revealed her to him so wan and exhausted that he was moved with
compunction.
"“Don’t think me hard, my child,” he said, bending over her. “It is the"
bitterest day of our lives. We must pray to God for strength to bear it.
I shall leave you now. I shall see that you have all you want. Try to

THE SAMPLE PAGE
"With these details settled, the sample page is next in order. Knowing"
that the book is to be a 12mo (size of leaf 5⅛ × 7⅝) or a 10mo (size
"of leaf 5½ × 8¼), the printer must ""lay out"" the page so as to leave"
margins of proper size and proportion. A 12mo type page may vary from
"3 × 5¼ inches to 4 × 6¾ inches. Somewhere within this area, in the"
"given example, the page must contain about 280 words. If the manuscript"
"is long, then the type page must be large, the type itself small (never"
"smaller than long primer[36] nor larger than pica[36]), the leads[36]"
reduced or omitted altogether. This is where the printer's taste and
skill is given an opportunity for expression: he is the architect
"of the book, and must not combine types or decorations which are"
"inharmonious, and his proportions must be kept correct."
I'm glad you did. I suppose the lampooners will get hold of the story
and will set every one laughing at me. Kidnapped the wrong woman and
lost her! Odds fish! But you're a pair of wise ones. I see I shall have
"to find me a new Lord High Kidnapper."""
"The king was right concerning the lampooners, for soon they had the"
"story, and he became the laughing-stock of London, though Frances's name"
was not mentioned.
It is a significant index to the morals of our time that the king's
attempt to kidnap a woman in the streets of London should have aroused
laughter rather than indignation.
"As it was, the kidnapping episode brought no harm to my cousin, but she"
"did not want it to happen again, and so was careful to take a trusted"
escort with her when she went abroad thereafter.
CHAPTER X
AT THE MAID'S GARTER
"Betty was confined to her room during the greater part of the next month,"
and Frances visited her frequently. Notwithstanding my vows not to see
"Betty, I was compelled to go with Frances as her body-guard. I even went"
so far in my feeble effort to keep my resolution as to suggest Churchill
"as a body-guard, but Frances objected, and the quality of my good intent"
"was not enduring. So I went with my cousin, and the joy in Betty's eyes"
whenever we entered her room was not the sort that would come because she
"George would not have sailed without notifying us."""
"""He may have feared to betray himself by writing,"" she suggested, ""since"
"King Charles had asked King Louis to detain him."""
"""That is true,"" I returned. ""But the occasion must have been urgent"
"indeed if he could not have sent us word in some manner."""
"But I could find no comfort for her, for I really believed that George"
"had gone to Canada, and there was a certain relief to me in knowing that"
he had passed out of Frances's life.
After along silence this feeling of relief found unintentional expression
when I said:--
"""Time heals all wounds, Frances. One of these days you will find a man"
"who will make amends for your present loss, and then--"""
"""No, no, Baron Ned. Your words are spoken in kindness, but what you"
suggest is impossible. Perhaps if there had been fewer obstacles between
"us, or if I had not misjudged him so cruelly, I might have found my heart"
"more obedient to my will."""
The only comfort I could give my beautiful cousin was that a letter would
"soon come explaining everything. In default of a letter, I promised to go"
"to Paris and learn the truth from George's friends, if possible."
"Frances did not go back to Whitehall that day, but remained at home,"
pretending to be ill of an ague.
"At the end of a week, Frances not having returned to Whitehall, Sir"
"Richard was honored by a visit from no less a person than the king,"
The grim smile on the countenance of old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds grew
yet more grim.
"""No gipsy planned it and no man!"" he said sententiously. ""Come hither,"
"Chica!"""
And out from among the listening throng came a girl of thirteen or
"fourteen, dressed neatly and simply in a grey linen blouse belted at the"
"waist with a leather belt. A gay plaid, striped of orange and crimson,"
"hung neatly folded over her shoulder, and she rested her small sunburnt"
hand on the silver hilt of a pistol. Black elf-locks escaped from
beneath a red silk kerchief knotted saucily after the fashion of her
"companions. But her eyes, instead of being beady and black with that"
"far-away contemplative look which characterises the children of Egypt,"
were bright and sunny and blue as the Mediterranean itself in the front
of spring.
"""Come hither, Chica--be not afraid,"" repeated old Pépe of the Eleven"
"Wounds, ""this is a great man--the greatest of all our race. You have"
"heard of him--as who, indeed, has not!"""
Chica nodded with a quick elfish grin of intense pleasure and
"appreciation. ""I was listening,"" she said, ""I heard all. And I"
"saw--would that I could see it again. Oh, if only the like would happen"
"to me!"""
"""Tell the noble Don José who you are, my pretty Chica,"" said Pépe,"
soothingly.
But the child stamped her sandalled foot. It was still white at the
"instep, and the sergeant could see by the blue veins that she had not"
"Two centuries later, the Brethren, known now as the Moravians, settled"
"on Count Zinzendorf’s estates in Saxony, spreading rapidly from thence"
into other countries in Europe and to the United States. One of

an adherent to their faith.

"The movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian"
"Brethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement."
Luther’s influence on the worship and music of the church was
revolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in church
song. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music had at first
been introduced for congregational use but it became more and more
"liturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian Chant"
which followed was never intended for use except by the priests and
trained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational
singing; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it into full
fruition.
"""You must not stop here,"" he said. ""You have frightened us all"
terribly. The regiment has come and is attacking. There will be some
"desperate fighting. We must all stick together."""
She caught Nicholson's eyes resting on her. She thought she read pity
"and sympathy in their steady depths, and wondered if he guessed what"
"she had tried to do. But he said nothing, and she followed the two men"
blindly and indifferently back to the bungalow.
CHAPTER X
TRAVERS
"They had no light. They talked in whispers, and now and again, when"
"the darkness grew too oppressive, they stretched out groping hands and"
touched each other. They did this without explanation. Though none
"complained or spoke of fear, each needed the consolation of the"
"other's company, and a touch was worth more than words. Mrs. Cary"
alone needed nothing. She lay on the rough truckle-bed and slept. Thus
she had been for a week--a whole week of nerve-wrecking struggle
against odds which marked hope as vain. Bullets had beaten like rain
"upon the walls about her, the moaning of wounded men on the other side"
of the hastily constructed partition mingled unceasingly with the
cries of the ever-nearing enemy. And she had lain there quiet and
"indifferent. Martins, the regiment's doctor, had looked in once at her"
"and had shaken his head. ""In all probability she will never wake,"" he"
"had said. ""Perhaps it is the kindest thing that could happen to her."""
Tildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she
went and stood at Bogle’s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not to
let her words sound proud and boastful.
"“A gentleman insulted me to-day,” she said. “He hugged me around the"
waist and kissed me.”
"“That so?” said Bogle, cracking open his business armour. “After this"
week you get a dollar a week more.”
At the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom
"she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one whose"
merit needed no bolstering:
“A gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm
around my waist and kissed me.”
"The diners accepted the revelation in various ways—some incredulously,"
some with congratulations; others turned upon her the stream of
badinage that had hitherto been directed at Aileen alone. And Tildy’s
"heart swelled in her bosom, for she saw at last the towers of Romance"
rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long
travelled.
For two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy
"established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought ribbons,"
"and arranged her hair like Aileen’s, and tightened her waist two"
inches. She had a thrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders would
rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol. He must have loved her
desperately; and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous.
"He was interrupted by Monsieur, himself, who emerged from the"
companionway door.
"""I come again,"" he smiled apologetically, ""because tomorrow our journeys"
"part, and I have shown scant consideration for your kindness."""
"""It's we who feel the obligation,"" Tommy murmured. ""Now, if we could"
"only help you find the child--supposing, of course, that's what you're"
"watching for!"""
"Monsieur gave a deep sigh, appearing to be quite overcome by a secret"
"grief; but after a moment he looked at us, asking ingenuously:"
"""You think my behavior unusual?"""
"""Well, since you make a point of it,"" I laughed, and hesitated."
"""I see, I see! But, my young friends, you must take my word that I"
"cannot tell you much."" He drew us nearer. ""This I may say: that, after"
"Roumania dropped out of the war, the new Chancellor of Azuria wired"
imploringly for me to leave my classes at the University and come to
"him--because for years I have advised with Azurian statesmen, frequently"
going on special missions. By the recent death of the old Chancellor a
certain paper came to light. This was a secret agent's report sent from
Havana in 1914----I may not divulge its contents. But for the war it
would have been followed up at once. Whether the same hopes exist
"now--well, I am here to discover. Ah, my young friends,"" his voice"
"trembled, ""much depends upon this! I must--I must find the child if it"
"lives!"""
Tommy's eyes grew round.
"_plus_?"""
"""All x--two points four seconds plus--we're riding on 981.286"
"centimeters, to allow for the reversal and for minor detours. Bye."""
"""All this may have been coincidence, Breck, but we'll find out pretty"
"quick now,"" the computer remarked when the flying vessel was nearing"
"the third check-station. ""Unless I'm all out of control we'll check in"
"almost fourteen seconds minus on W41, and we may not even find him on"
"the center block of the screen."""
"When he plugged in W41 was on the block, but was in the extreme upper"
right corner. They checked in thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on
"the station, and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned"
the accuracy of the location of the station and refused point-blank to
correct his course.
"""Not I, my friend, I have robbed you enough."""
"""And about time for the luck to turn, isn't it? Well, I don't care! What"
"shall we do?"""
"""What you will,"" answered the Frenchman absently."
"Benham pulled his beard, then leant forward and put a question with an"
intoxicated leer. A laugh of feigned reproof burst from Gaspard. Benham
"seemed to urge him, and at last he said,"
"""Oh, if you're bent on it, I can be your guide."""
"The two men left the house arm-in-arm, went down the street, and crossed"
"Digby Square. It was late, and few people were about, but Gaspard saw"
"one acquaintance. The doorkeeper was strolling along on his way home,"
matters worse Manufacturer Brede had said he would withdraw his money....
Paul's careworn face looked out of the kitchen door. Before going out
"himself he wanted to make sure there was no one about, but he was"
"disappointed in this, for the lawyer at once greeted him loudly: ""Good"
"evening, Paul!"" and drew him outside."
They strolled down the field in the dusk.
"Assuredly there is little to be gained by ""having a good talk"" with a man"
about his drinking; such matters are too vital to be settled by talking.
"But Paul seems to have admitted that the lawyer was right in all he said,"
and probably left him with good resolutions.
Paul went down to the village again. He was going to the post office; the
money he had from the seven departed guests would be scattered to all
quarters of the globe. And yet it was not enough to cover everything--in
"fact not enough for anything, for interest, repayments, taxes, and"
repairs. It paid only for a few cases of food from the city. And of course
he stopped the case of sirup from going back.
Paul returned blind-drunk because he no longer wished to see. It was the
same thing all over again. But his brain seemed in its own way to go on
"searching for a solution, and one day he asked the lawyer:"
"""What do you call those square glass jars for keeping small fish"
"in--goldfish?"""
"""Do you mean an aquarium?"""
"""That's it,"" said Paul. ""Are they dear?"""

"""The Child of Mary"" (Asbjörnsen, and Moe, N.F.E., p. 34, No. 8,"

takes the place of the Virgin Mary.
XI
STORM MAGIC
The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his
"captain; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew"
"restless and did not want to go along. The captain liked him, for though"
"he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall"
"lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did"
"as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the"
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
"the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was"
"ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in"
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
"account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship."
"But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf"
Kennedy related the history of the Farnese Palace to Cæsar. They went
through the Via del Mascherone and came out into the Via Giulia.
"“This Via Giulia is a street in a provincial capital,” said Kennedy;"
“always sad and deserted; a Cardinal or two who like isolation are still
living here.”
"At the entrance to the Via dei Farnesi, Cæsar stopped to look at two"
marble tablets set into the wall at the two sides of a chapel door.
"Cut on the tablets were skeletons painted black; on one, the words:"
"“Alms for the poor dead bodies found in the fields,” and on the other:"
“Alms for the perpetual lamp in the cemetery.”
“What does this mean?” said Cæsar.
“That is the Church of the Orison of the Confraternity of Death. The
tablets are modern.”
"They passed by the “Mascherone” again, and went rambling on until they"
reached the Synagogue and the Theatre of Marcellus.
They went through narrow streets without sidewalks; they passed across
"tiny squares; and it seemed like a dead city, or like the outskirts of a"
village. In certain streets towered high dark palaces of blackish stone.
These mysterious palaces looked uninhabited; the gratings were eaten
"with rust, all sorts of weeds grew on the roofs, and the balconies were"
"covered with climbing plants. At corners, set into the wall, one saw"
"niches with glass fronts. A painted madonna, black now, with silver"
"jewels and a crown, could be guessed at inside, and in front a little"
lantern swung on a cord.
"me by speaking English, though I shall not attempt to reproduce his"
"pronunciation. ""How far better it is to say: 'Monsieur, permit to me,'"
before one runs a man through than to do it as though one were sticking
"a mere pig. Is it not so?"""
"""True as sunshine, my dear count,"" I returned. ""There's a vast difference"
"between the trade of butchering and the gentle art of murder."""
"De Grammont threw back his head, laughing softly. ""Ah, good, good! Very"
"good, dear baron! The sentiment is beau-ti-ful and could not be better"
"expressed--in English. You should have been born across the channel."""
"""I wish I had been born any place, not excepting hell, rather than in"
"England,"" I answered."
"""True, true, what a hole it is,"" returned the count, regretfully. ""The"
"Englishman is one pig."""
He saw by the expression of my face that while I might abuse my own
"countrymen, I did not relish hearing it from others, so with true French"
tact he held up his hand to keep me from speaking till he could correct
himself.
"""Pardon, baron, I forgot the 'r,' The Englishman's affectation of a"
"virtue he despises makes of him a prig--not a pig. Non, non! Mon Dieu!"
"Not a pig--a prig! Is it not so?"""
"""True, true, count,"" I returned, unable to restrain a laugh. ""It is the"
"affectation of virtue that makes frank vice attractive by comparison."""
"""Ah, true, true, my dear baron. May I proceed with my errand?"""
"next year it comes up thicker. If you mow it down, remove the seeds,"
"sow it with salt and kill the field, you have a useless plot of land, a"
worthless territory. Then some day up comes weed and briar--which then
must be removed root and branch before the land is plantable again.
"Just remember, we are after a profitable exchange of economy, not"
another stellar system to list as a conquest for the sake of history
"our children will read. I want my reward now, or next week. Having my"
"name on a monument does not have much appeal."""
"He was half standing with his hands closed into fists, his knuckles on"
the table supporting him as he leaned forward to drive his facts home.
"""Or,"" he added scathingly, ""are you two firebrands so youthful that you"
don't know that a man has only one single lone chance at this business
of living? And that your finest reward at eventide is knowing you have
lived a full and eventful life without screwing it up somewhere along
"the line by making a lot of idiotic moves?"""
Viggon Sarri turned on a heel and walked out.

Naylo and Twill turned to Linus Brein.
"""What do you think?"" Twill asked."
"Linus Brein shrugged. ""He is undoubtedly right. Besides, we don't know"
"all there is to know about the strange race out there yet."""
"""Oh, faugh! What else--"""
"Linus Brein smiled. He said slowly. ""We don't even know whether or not"
"law begins; the books get written up later."""
"""You're going to _tell_, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is"
"speaking through your mouth!"""
"""Nobody!"" I insisted. ""They're my own ideas!"""
"""They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy"
"who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless"
entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a
"government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand--after"
"I have found a good, steady husband, of course--and I don't look"

I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels
someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to
wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.
"""What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?"""
"A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. ""One of the passengers"
"wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit."""
"""The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of"
"them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has"
"been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering"
masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in
"government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,"
"in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that"
"""Yes, there may be for a man, but I insist there is no real intellect."""
"""Well, Sarah,"" I answered, showing irritation despite an effort to appear"
"indifferent, ""it is my opinion that the possession of great intellectual"
"power by a woman is the one virtue with which men, as a rule, find"
themselves most willing to dispense. It gives her too great an
"advantage."""
"""Yes, a soft, plump figure like Betty's, long lashes and red lips,"
"surrounded by dimples, are apt to please a fool."""
"""But they're good in their way, Sarah, you'll admit--excellent!"""
"I retorted sharply, caring little if she saw that I was angry."
"""And men are fools, so there! Not another word about the barmaid!"" cried"
"Sarah, dismissing the subject with a wave of her hand."
"But men, too, sometimes like to have the last word, so I remarked: ""The"
"mother of the Duchess of York was a barmaid, at least, a barmistress."""
"""Yes, but is that any reason why Frances should be kissing this one?"
"Doubtless your friend Betty finds men enough to do the office."""
"""Sarah!"" I cried, springing to my feet, now thoroughly angry. ""If you"
"were a man, I'd give you the lie direct!"""
"Sarah began to laugh and clapped her hands, saying: ""I was leading you"
"on. I suspected you were fond of her. Now I know it."""
"But Sarah's remark, being so near the truth, did nothing to allay my"
"anger, so I told her she was a fool, and went into an adjoining room,"
"""We seem to be working toward different objectives,"" Novosty answered."
"""Michael has a solution to everybody's problem. I regret very much"
"you've chosen not to help facilitate it."""
"""The only problem he solved was yours,"" she shot back. ""Mr. Vance"
devised what amounts to an enormous check kiting scheme. You two
"planned to perpetrate fraud. You're nothing better than criminals, both"
"of you, and I intend to make sure you haven't also given us a short"
"count."""
"""Comrade, fraud is a harsh word,"" Vance interjected."
"""You are not as amusing as you think,"" she replied."
"""Humor makes the world go round."""
'This is not a joke. The negotiable instruments in this room are Soviet
funds. I intend to make sure those funds are intact. There will be a
"full and complete count. Now."""
"She's gone over the edge, he told himself. She's definitely going to"
"try and screw us, either wittingly or unwittingly. But who in the room"
is going to help her? That huddled group of Russian bankers now staring
"terrified at Novosty's 9mm? Not damned likely. She's improvising, on"
her own. But her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship.
The two couriers were now spread against the brown textured fabric of
"the wall, legs apart. He walked over and reached into the leather"
"holsters at their hips, drawing out their revolvers. They were snub-"
"nosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguards, .38 caliber. He looked them over,"
"cocked them, and handed one to Eva."
"""You've got some singular new attraction about you, Alwyn,""--he said,"
with a strange sense of keen inward excitement as he met his friend's
"calm yet flashing glance,--""Something mysterious, . . something that"
COMPELS! What is it? ... I believe that visit of yours to the Ruins of
"Babylon had a more important motive than you will admit, . . moreover.."
"I believe you are in love!"""
"""IN love!""--Alwyn laughed a little as he repeated the words.. ""What a"
foolish term that is when you come to think of it! For to be IN love
"suggests the possibility of getting OUT again,--which, if love be true,"
can never happen. Say that I LOVE!--and you will be nearer the mark!
"Now don't look so mystified, and don't ask me any more questions just"
"now--to-night, when we are sitting together in the library, I'll tell"
"you the whole story of my Babylonian adventure!"""
"And with a light parting wave of the hand he left the room, and"
Villiers heard him humming a tune softly to himself as he ascended the
"stairs to his own apartments, where, ever since he arrived, he had made"
it his custom to do two or three hours' steady writing every morning.
"For a moment or so after he had gone Villiers stood lost in thought,"
"with knitted brows and meditative eyes, then, rousing himself, he went"
"on to his study, and sitting down at his desk wrote an answer to the"
Duchess de la Santoisie accepting her invitation.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
REWARDS OF FAME.
"""Yes,"" he answered, ""and I shall visit him without delay."""
"""In Paris?"" I asked, not quite sure that Monsieur le Grand was King Louis"
"of France, and not desiring to know certainly."
"""In Paris,"" he answered, giving me to understand by his manner that he"
must tell me nothing more definite of Le Grand's identity.
"""Don't tell me what you know of the business this letter refers to, but"
"tell me whether you know,"" I said, hoping that George might at least tell"
me it meant good fortune for him.
"""I cannot even conjecture the business upon which I am wanted,"" he said,"
"""but I hope that it may give me an opportunity to be of service to the"
"writer."""
Thus I was relieved of the disagreeable task of trying to induce George
"to leave England, and was very thankful to escape it."
"After a long silence, during which he read the one-line letter many"
"times, he asked:--"
"""Are you willing to bring Frances to me early to-morrow morning, if she"
"will come?"""
"""Doubtless I can,"" I answered. ""Her willingness to come has been shown"
"all too plainly of late; but ought I bring her?"""
"""Yes. It will be the last time I shall ever see her unless good fortune"

5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.
"The followers of John Hus who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren,"
"and later as the Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce"
congregational singing into their worship. They also published the first
"Protestant hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and"
"400 hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts"
to introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman
hierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at the
"stake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing of"
hymns in the churches. It decreed:
"If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much"
more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.
"As a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out"
messengers to search for true Christian people into whose communion they
"might apply for admission—one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,"
and one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No such
"Christians had been found. They therefore remained in their own country,"
giving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of the
Bible.
In 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and ask
his advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their
fellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had
"published, and later used some of the hymns in his own work."

"""I have told madame your mother everything,"" I said.  ""Do not be uneasy"

"""Ah,"" she sighed, ""how I regret that we came to Paris!  I regret it all,"
"Gerald, save that you and I have met again;"" and she stretched out her"
"hand until it came into contact with my coat-button, with which she"
toyed like a child.
"""And this meeting has really given you satisfaction?""  I whispered to"
"her, heedless of the presence of the others."
"""Not only satisfaction,"" she answered, so softly that I alone could"
"catch her words, and looking into my face with that expression of"
"passionate affection which can never be simulated; ""it has given back to"
"me a desire for happiness, for life, for love."""
"There were tears in those wonderful blue eyes, and her small hand"
trembled within my grasp.  My heart at that moment was too full for mere
"words.  True, I loved her with a mad fondness that I had never before"
"entertained for any woman; yet, nevertheless, a hideous shadow arose"
"between us, shutting her off from me for ever--the shadow of her"
"secret--the secret that she, my well-beloved, was actually a spy."
CHAPTER NINE.
AT THE ELYSEE.
"Having reassured myself of Yolande's recovery, I was compelled to rush"
"off, slip into uniform, and attend a dinner at the Elysee.  The function"
"was a brilliant affair, as are all the official junketings of the French"
"After a short walk, Jack beckoned the boys to his side and suggested"
that they take a route to the camp different from that which they had
followed on leaving it.
"“You see, boys,” he explained, “that was a signal, all right, and we"
"haven’t found out the cause of it. So far as we know, it was put up to"
get us away from the camp.”
"“I’m beginning to think it was,” Frank announced. “Either to get us away"
"from the camp for the purpose of capturing us, or for the purpose of"
raiding our provisions.”
"“Well,” Jack went on, “if we duck away to the south and return to the"
"camp by a new course, anyone watching for us might watch in vain.”"
“That’s the idea!” Harry answered.
"“Then here we go the south,” Frank suggested, starting away at as swift"
a gait as was possible in the thicket.
They had proceeded but a short distance when every tree bole of good
size immediately in front of them seemed to their astonished eyes to
"yield a scowling, dirty half-breed. The boys drew their guns."
"“No use, lads!” a voice said, speaking in good English. “The men in the"
"bushes have you covered. Anyway, there’s no harm intended.”"
“Why the holdup?” demanded Jack.
The man who had spoken now advanced to Jack and looked him keenly in the
face. Although carrying the general appearance of the gang of
"half-breeds at his back, the boys could see by the fellow’s face and"
"""Since nakedness has always existed ..."""
"""Yes, and it created Rome,"" said the teacher."
"""Yes, of course,"" says the Captain, beaming with joy. ""Romulus and"
"Remus, eh?  We also shall create when our time comes ..."""
"""Violation of public peace,"" interrupts Abyedok.  He laughs in a"
"self-satisfied way.  His laughter is impudent and insolent, and is"
"echoed by Simtsoff, the Deacon and Paltara Taras.  The naive eyes of"
"young Meteor light up, and his cheeks flush crimson."
"Kanets speaks, and it seems as if he were hammering their heads."
"""All these are foolish illusions ... fiddle-sticks!"""
"It was strange to see them reasoning in this manner, these outcasts"
"from life, tattered, drunken with vodki and wickedness, filthy and"
forlorn.  Such conversations rejoiced the Captain's heart.  They gave
"him an opportunity of speaking more, and therefore he thought himself"
"better than the rest.  However low he may fall, a man can never deny"
"himself the delight of feeling cleverer, more powerful, or even better"
"fed than his companions. Aristid Kuvalda abused this pleasure, and"
"never could have enough of it, much to the disgust of Abyedok, Kubar,"
"and others of these creatures that once were men, who were less"
interested in such things.
"Politics, however, were more to the popular taste.  The discussions as"
to the necessity of taking India or of subduing England were lengthy
and protracted.  Nor did they speak with less enthusiasm of the radical
measure of clearing Jews off the face of the earth.  On this subject
"something a little suspicious about one of his eyes, and a squat,"
queerly-shaped old fellow in semi-clerical garb and wearing smoked
"glasses, completed the party. Their waiters began to hover about them,"
and the fashionable world went on with its dinner.
"""Who was that _lovely_ girl?"" the Duchess of Dawn demanded of her"
"_vis-à-vis_, the veteran soldier, and he, reputed among women to have no"
"heart at all, recalled himself with an evident start from the reverie"
"into which he had fallen. He almost blushed, indeed, under the duchess's"
blandly discerning smile.
"""I don't know, I'm sure, duchess,"" he returned, smiling also, in spite"
"of himself, and beckoned to a servant behind him, whom he despatched on"
some errand.
"""She's registered as Miss Harris, your lordship,"" the man announced in"
an undertone when he returned.
"""Miss Harris!"" echoed the prince, who was also a soldier. He had"
"overheard. And, as he in turn caught the duchess's eyes, he lay back"
"laughing, a little ruefully. But the man opposite him, the master of"
"armies, was not amused."
"""I'd like to know who and what those three fellows with Miss Harris may"
"be,"" said he."
*       *       *       *       *
"At their table in the corner, they seemed to be thoroughly enjoying"
themselves. The three men were toasting Sallie and each other with equal
good-will. And even Sallie had dismissed from her mind the last of her
lingering doubts as to the reality and endurance of her part in that
“Don’t go. Send her an excuse--and take me for a drive. It would do me
"good, and I should so love to be alone with you.”"
It was the very first time in her life that Yvonne had consciously
cajoled a man. Her face flushed hot with misgivings. It was with a
mixture of her sex’s shame and triumph that she heard him say.
"“Whatever you like, dear. It is still your holiday.”"
CHAPTER XIII--Dis Aliter Visum
But the best laid schemes of Yvonnes and men often come to nothing.
"While she was devising, on her drive along the coast, a plan for"
"spending a quiet dangerless evening at the hotel, Mrs. Winstanley was"
"sitting in solitary dignity at the concert, nursing her wrath over"
"Professor Drummond’s “Natural Law in the Spiritual world,” a book which"
she often perused when she wished to accentuate the rigorous attitude of
her mind.
Yvonne had reckoned without Mrs. Winstanley. Otherwise she would have
"offered her a seat in the carriage. As it was, Mrs. Winstanley felt"
more resentful than ever. Under the impression that the Canon was to
"accompany her to the Kursaal, she had graciously dispensed with the"
"escort of the Wilmingtons, who had gone off to see bicycle races at the"
Vélodrome. She was left in the lurch.
To dislike this is human. To wrap oneself up in one’s sore dignity is
"more human still, and there was much humanity that lurked, unsuspected"
"by herself, in Mrs. Winstanley’s bosom. It asserted itself, further,"
Then the other said to me:
"""This is a thing I have never told anyone yet, but I will tell it to you"
now. There are times when I almost wish I could see German troops
marching victoriously through the streets of London. It is not my reason
"that is speaking now, but my bitterness, which has become stronger than"
"my reason."""
I understood him far too well to make any comment.
"And then after a long silence, I said: ""I wonder if anybody else thinks"
"like that."""
"And he answered: ""Yes, there are many--more than you would believe."""
"But the first added: ""We must remain neutral--that is our one and only"
"duty. The more malevolent our neutrality the better, but it must be"
neutrality. Remember that there are Germans whose bitterness prompts
them to wish that British troops were marching through the streets of
"Berlin. I think their wish is juster than yours, but both wishes cannot"
"be fulfilled, and it is therefore desirable that the next best thing"
"should happen, namely, that both the Allies and their enemies should be"
"entirely deprived of victory."""
"I agreed, but added:"
"""Yes, fundamentally one must remain neutral, but in relation to present"
circumstances one cannot remain neutral. It is our business to arraign
"England, our own country, and not Germany. It is for every nation to"
discover its own faults. There are many Germans of courage and honesty
who will condemn their country for the crimes she has committed. But
prove that; but I doubt if they could ever analyze that atomic motor
"with no hint as to how it works."""
"Silence descended on them again, in which each was lost in his own"
thoughts.
"How many hours had passed, the Earthmen did not know. They had spent"
the time in fruitless planning to escape from their tower room and go
back to the ship again. Though how they could get away in the ship
when the Rogans seemed able to propel it where-ever they wished
"against the utmost power of their motor, they did not attempt to"
consider.
"One of Jupiter's short nights had passed, however--a night weirdly"
"made as light as day by red glares from the plates, which seemed to"
"store up sunlight, among their other functions--and the tiny sun had"
risen to slant into their window at a sharp angle.
Suddenly they heard the familiar drawing of the great bolts outside
"their door. It was opened, and a dozen or more of the Rogans came in,"
with Greca cowering piteously in their midst and attempting to
communicate her distress to Brand.
*       *       *       *       *
At the head of the little band of Rogans was one the prisoners had not
"seen before. He was of great height, fully two feet taller than the"
others; and he carried himself with an air that proclaimed his
importance.
"The tall one turned to Greca and addressed a few high-pitched, squeaky"
"words to her. She shook her head; whereupon, at a hissed command, two"
"""A LADY! ... To see Mr. Alwyn!""--he repeated, his thoughts instantly"
"reverting to his friend's vaguely hinted love-affair,--""What name?"""
"""She gives no name, sir. She says it isn't needed,--Mr. Alwyn will know"
"who she is."""
"""Mr. Alwyn will know who she is, will he?"" murmured Villiers"
"dubiously.--""What is she like? Young and pretty?"""
"Over the man-servant's staid countenance came the glimmer of a demure,"
respectful smile.
"""Oh no, sir,--not young, sir! A person about fifty, I should say."""
This was mystifying. A person about fifty! Who could she be? Villiers
"hastily considered,--there must be some mistake, he thought,--at any"
"rate, he would see the unknown intruder himself first, and find out"
"what her business was, before breaking in upon Alwyn's peaceful studies"
upstairs.
"""Show the lady in here""--he said--""I can't disturb Mr. Alwyn just now."""
"The servant retired, and soon re-appeared, ushering in a tall, gaunt,"
"black-robed female, who walked with the stride of a dragoon and the"
"demeanor of a police-inspector, and who, merely nodding briskly in"
"response to Villiers's amazed bow, selected with one comprehensive"
"glance the most comfortable chair in the room, and seated herself at"
"ease therein. She then put up her veil, displaying a long, narrow face,"
"cold, pale, arrogant eyes, a nose inclined to redness at the tip, and a"
"thin, close-set mouth lined with little sarcastic wrinkles, which came"
"into prominent and unbecoming play as soon as she began to speak, which"
she did almost immediately.
"Panama is divided into seven provinces, Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon,"
"Chiriqui, Los Santos, Panama and Veragua. Its total population by the"
"census of 1911 was 386,749, a trifle more than the District of Columbia"
"which has about one five-thousandth of its area, and almost precisely"
the same population as Montana which has less than half its size. So it
"is clearly not over-populated. Of its population 51,323 are set down by"
"its own census takers as white, 191,933 as mestizo, or a cross between"
"white and Indian, 48,967 as negro; 2313 Mongol, and 14,128 Indian. The"
"census takers estimated that other Indians, living in barbarism remote"
"from civilization and unapproachable by the enumerators, numbered"
"36,138."
[Illustration: NATIVE FAMILY IN CHORRERA]
All these figures have to be qualified somewhat. The mestizos are
"theoretically a cross between whites and Indians, but the negro blood is"
"very generally present. It is doubtful, too, whether those classed as"
white are not often of mixed blood.
A singularly large proportion of the population lives in the towns. In
"12 towns, exceeding 7000 inhabitants each, are more than 150,000 people."
"More than one-third of the people therefore are town dwellers, which is"
to say they are unproductive citizens. Meanwhile more than five-eighths
of the arable land in the country is not under cultivation.
The five chief towns of Panama with their population in 1911 are:
"Panama             37,505"
"Colon              17,748"
"David              15,059"
"Santiago           13,081"
"Bocas del Toro      9,759"
plainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible
check-stations.
"""Not that baby,"" returned the computer confidently. ""I'll bet you a"
small farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his
goniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back
"into position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's"
"always been there."""
"""The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to"
"them?"""
"""Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody"
"anything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?"""
"""Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?"""
"""Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are"
altogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you.
"Another thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x."
"If so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all"
"off on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every"
"check-station. See?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"True to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact"
"center of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he"
began really to enjoy the trip.
"""How do we check on chronometers?"" asked P6 when Stevens had been"
"introduced. ""By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds"
"that we have Ned Nestor, the alleged juvenile detective, at our camp. He"
"seems inclined to keep what information he possesses to himself, and,"
"before proceeding to extreme measures with him, we decided to lay the"
case before you. I am afraid Nestor will receive rough treatment at the
hands of my allies unless the information they demand is given them.”
"“So that was a lying message you sent Nestor, was it?”"
"“There’s no use in discussing the matter at length,” the other stated."
“I think I’d better take you boys into camp and let the boss talk with
"you. And let me warn you now, before anything more is said, not to"
"attempt resistance. If you do, there’ll be shooting done, and it won’t"
"be my men who will get hurt! Now, face about to the north and march away"
"to camp, like good little boys. We don’t want to hurt you, but we insist"
on having our way in the matter of this information. Perhaps Nestor may
be able to convince you that you ought not to be so obstinate.”
"“I don’t think Nestor will attempt anything of the kind,” replied Jack,"
“and I think that you are a great big bluff!”
CHAPTER X
GILROY AND THE BEAR
"When, at last, Ned and Jimmie, still watching about for hostile forces,"
"came to the barricaded camp, the fire had burned down and no one was in"
sight. Ned regarded the wall of rock with a smile.
“Isn’t that great?” Jimmie asked.
"if you wish to make sure whether it is a good auspice or a bad, you kill"
"the spider and count its legs. If they are an even number, it is a good"
"omen; if uneven, bad.”"
"“But I believe spiders always have an even number of legs,” said Cæsar."
"“Certainly,” responded the old man; “but my wife swears they do not;"
that she has seen many with seven and nine legs. It is religious
unreasonableness.”
"“Are there many people like that, so credulous?” asked Cæsar."
"“Oh, lots,” replied Lanza; “in the shops you will find amulets, horns,"
"hands made of coral or horseshoes, all to keep away bad luck. My wife"
"and the neighbour women play the lottery, by combining the numbers of"
"their birthdays, and the ages of their fathers, their mothers, and their"
"children. When some relative dies, they make a magic combination of"
"the dates of birth and death, the day and the month, and buy a lottery"
ticket. They never win; and instead of realizing that their systems
"are of no avail, they say that they omitted to count in the number of"
"letters in the name or something of that sort. It is comical, so much"
religion and so much superstition.”
"“But you confuse religion and superstition, my friend,” said Kennedy."
"“It’s all the same,” answered the old man, smiling his suavely ironical"
smile. “There is nothing except Nature.”
"“You do not believe in miracles, Giovanni Battista?” asked the"
Englishman.
"“Yes, I believe in the earth’s miracles, making trees and flowers grow,"
nature; nowadays we who have nerves all upset and brains probably upset
"too, form deceptive reflections. And so, that time in Paris, sick and"
"shut in, I was happy; and here, sound and strong, when toward nightfall,"
"I look at the splendid skies, the palaces, the yellow walls that take an"
"extraordinary tone, I feel that I am one of the most miserable men on"
the planet....”
_ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON_
His lack of tranquillity led Cæsar to make absurd resolutions which he
didn’t carry out.
"One Sunday in the beginning of April, he went out into the street,"
"disposed to take a walk outside of Rome, following the road anywhere it"
"led. A hard, fine rain was falling, the sky was grey, the air mild, the"
"streets were full of puddles, the shops closed; a few flower merchants"
were offering branches of almond in blossom.
Cæsar was very depressed. He went into a church to get out of the rain.
The church was full; there were many people in the centre of it; he
didn’t know what they were doing. Doubtless they were gathered there for
"some reason, although Cæsar didn’t understand what. Cæsar sat down on"
"a bench, worn out; he would have liked to listen to organ music, to a"
boy choir. No ideas occurred to him but sentimental ones. Some time
"passed, and a priest began to preach. Cæsar got up and went into the"
street.
"“I must get rid of these miserable impressions, get back to noble ideas."
I must fight this sentimental leprosy.”
"""Uncanonical!"" roared the Abbot. ""I scorn the charge! I"
"scorn it with my heels! Two masses daily,--morning and"
"evening--Primes,--Nones,--Vespers,--Aves,--Credos,--Paters--"""
"""Excepting on moonlight nights,"" the duke blinked."
"""Exceptis excipiendis,"" replied the Abbot."
"""Sheer heresy!"" roared the duke. ""The devil is apt to keep an eye on"
"such exceptions. Does he not go about like a roaring lion?"""
"""Let him roar!"" shouted the Abbot, bringing his fist down upon the"
"table, and looking about in canonical ire, when the door opened"
noiselessly and in its dark frame stood Francesco.
He had waited at the camp for the return of the duke until his misery
"and restlessness had mastered every other sensation. Sleep, he felt,"
"would not come to his eyes, and he craved for action. He should have"
"liked nothing better than to mount his steed on the spot, ride"
single-handed into Anjou's camp and redeem his honor in the eyes of
those who regarded him a bought instrument of the Church. The memory
of Ilaria wailed through the dark chambers of his heart. He felt at
"this moment, more than ever, what she had been to him, and to himself"
"he appeared as a derelict, tossed on a vast and shoreless sea."
"For a moment he gazed as one spellbound at the drinkers, then he"
strode up to the duke and shook him soundly.
"""To the rescue, my lord duke!"" he shouted, in the excess of his"
"frenzy, till the vaults re-echoed his cry from their farthest"
"recesses. ""Conradino has been betrayed by the Frangipani!"""
9. English Hymnody.
"The youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748, an ardent dissenter,"
pioneered the movement which resulted in a flood of hymns and hymnbooks
in the English churches. Watts was not satisfied with the psalm singing
"of his time, which by now had become formal and lifeless. Parts of the"
"psalter, he pointed out, were obviously not written in the spirit of the"
"Gospel. “By keeping too close to David,” he wrote in one of his"
"Prefaces, “the vail of Moses is thrown over our hearts.” Watts removed"
"that “vail,” Christianizing the psalms and composing during his lifetime"
"more than 600 original hymns, expressing in the language of the time,"
"the thoughts of the worshippers. Through his influence, his age, the"
"18th century, became the first age of hymn singing in England."
"John and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of hymn"
"singing in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for"
congregational singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have
"composed over 6,000 hymns."
"From the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers in"
England became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing had
been broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms resulted in a
vast number of original religious lyrics and the publication of hundreds
of hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here only in outline
form.

"Lady Blount turned to him severely. Despite her affection for him,"
"she more than suspected him of a pagan pantheism, which she termed"
atheistical. His talk about belief in spirits and hobgoblins irritated
"her. She kept a limited intelligence together by means of formulas, as"
she kept her scanty reddish-gray hair together by means of a rigid false
front.
"“I believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,” she"
"said, with an air of cutting reproof."
"Sir Oliver pushed his plate from him, but not the fraction of a"
millimetre beyond that caused by the impatient push sanctioned by good
manners.
"“Don't be a fool, Julia!”"
“I don't see how a Christian woman declaring the elements of her faith
"can be a fool,” said Lady Blount, drawing herself up."
"“There are times and seasons for everything,” said Sir Oliver. “If you"
"were having a political argument, and any one asked you whether you"
"believed in tariff reform, and you glared at him and said, I believe in"
"Pontius Pilate,' you'd be professing Christianity, but showing yourself"
an idiot.”
"“But I don't believe in Pontius Pilate,” retorted Lady Blount."

"In the still grey dawn, in dripping drizzle, Gavroche the anarchist"
slouched forth from prison-cell to his harsh doom.
He was dejected.
"He missed the band, the public eye, the shouts of the comrades."
"What, Gavroche! this is thy dramatic moment--thou hast the stage all to"
thy sole swaggering self--and though thou roused at daybreak from thy
broodings to lilt a braggart song with all thy best intent to play the

thou didst sing “somewhat palsily.”
"Tush, man! Is it thus thou goest to thy end? Hath thy desire to be"
Ruthless Overman brought only this about--that thou art to become no
"better than manure? Where is now thy dream of Ruthless Overman? Nay,"

feel rather with unpleasant shiver of discomfort the overlordship
"of the Commonweal? The aristocrat despised it yesterday, and thou"
"to-day. Hast thou, even thus late, a glimmering that thy vaunted"
"Ruthless Brutality is to be snipped by the might of this Commonweal,"

falls on the bidding of that overwhelming force which is the public

"Presently Cabrera, recollecting the sealed letter in his hand, gave it"
unopened to the youth.
"""There,"" he said, ""that, I see, is to be opened in the camp of General"
"Cabrera. Well--where Cabrera is, there is his camp. Open it, and let us"
"see what it contains."""
"""I will, general,"" said the young Scot, ""in so far, that is, as it"
"concerns your Excellency."""
The Carlist general sat watching Rollo keenly as he broke the seal and
discovered a couple of enclosures. One was sealed and the other open.
"The first he presented to Cabrera, who, observing the handwriting of the"
"superscription, changed colour. Meanwhile, without paying any attention"
"to him, Rollo read his own communication from beginning to end. It had"
"evidently been passed on to him from a higher authority than the Abbot,"
for only the address was in the handwriting of that learned ecclesiast.
It ran as follows:
"""To the Man who shall be chosen by our trusted Councillor for"
the Mission Extraordinary in the service of Carlos
Quinto--These:
"""You will receive from General Cabrera such succour and"
assistance as may seem to you needful in pursuance of the
"project you have in hand, namely the capturing of the young"
"Princess Isabel together with her mother, the so-called Regent"
Cristina. Thereafter you will bring them with diligence within
"our lines, observing all the respect and courtesy due to their"
exalted rank and to the sex to which they belong.
"""I suspect the informant is a wretched little hussy of whom I have"
"heard--the daughter of the innkeeper,"" remarked Mary, looking up to"
me for confirmation.
"""Suspect no longer,"" I answered, with sharper emphasis than I should have"
used.
"""Do you know her?"" she asked."
"""I do not know a 'wretched hussy' who is the daughter of the innkeeper,"""
"I answered sullenly. ""I know a beautiful girl who watched devotedly at"
"your brother's bedside, day and night, and probably saved his life at a"
"time when he was deserted by his sisters and his mother."""
"""We often find that sort of kindness in those low creatures,"" she"
"answered, unaware of the tender spot she was touching, and ignoring"
my reference to George's sisters and his mother.
"Naturally Mary was kind of heart, but her mother was a hard, painted"
"old Jezebel, whose teachings would have led her daughter away from every"
"gentle truth and up to all that was hard, cruel, and selfish in life. A"
woman in the higher walks of life is liable to become enamelled before
her twentieth year.
"While I did not blame Mary for what she had said relating to Bettina,"
still I was angry and longed to do battle with any one who could fight.
"After we had been together perhaps ten minutes, some one claimed her for"
"a dance, and she left me, saying hurriedly in my ear:--"
"""I'll see you soon again. I want to ask you further about George."" She"
had not a question to ask about me.
Dex started to reply to that; but Brand flung him a warning look.
"""Tell him we are the least of the Earth people,"" he answered steadily."
"""Tell him we are of an inferior race. Most of those on Earth are"
"giants five times as large as we are, and many times more powerful."""
"Greca relayed the message in the whistling, piping Rogan tongue. The"
"tall one stared, then hissed another sentence to the beautiful"
interpreter.
"""He wants to know,"" said Greca, ""if there are cities on your globe as"
"large and complete as this one."""
"""There are cities on Earth that make this look like a--a--"" Brand cast"
"about for understandable similes--""like a collection of animal"
"burrows."""
"""He says to describe your planet's war weapons,"" was the next"
interpretation. And here Brand let himself go.
"With flights of fancy he hadn't known he was capable of, he described"
"great airships, steered automatically and bristling with guns that"
discharged explosives powerful enough to kill everything within a
range of a thousand miles. He told of billions of thirty-foot giants
sheathed in an alloy that would make them invulnerable to any feeble
rays the Rogans might have developed. He touched on the certain
wholesale death that must overtake any hostile force that tried to
invade the planet.
"""The Rogan shock-tubes are toys compared with the ray-weapons of"
"Earth,"" he concluded. ""We have arms that can nullify the effects of"
"yours and kill at the same instant. We have--"""
"It was by no means a difficult task to replace the stone, as it was thin"
"and had been nicely fitted into the opening. In a short time the boys,"
"proceeding mostly on their hands and knees, came to the end of the"
tunnel and looked out over a valley tucked in between two great summits.
"The snow-line was not far away and the air was cold, notwithstanding the"
direct rays of the sun.
"There was no one in sight, no moving object anywhere, as the boys paused"
at the mouth of the passage and gazed about. Judging from the location
"of the sun, they were looking straight west."
"“Now,” Ned said after a pause, “if we follow this little valley straight"
"to the south, we’ll come out somewhere near our camp.”"
"“Yes,” Jimmie answered, “I have a pious notion that our brownstone front"
is carved into the face of a continuation of that ridge on the other
side of the little valley.”
"“Perhaps we’ll find the Boy Scout messenger at the camp,” Ned suggested."
"“If we do,” Jimmie declared, “I’ll change his face for him!”"
"“I can’t understand the fellow,” Ned admitted."
"“Gee!” cried Jimmie, “He came out into the woods and told Frank and I to"
"beat it, then went up into the camp and led you into the clutches of"
"these outlaws. If I had his head in chancery right now, I’d ‘beat it’,"
all right! He ought to get a thousand years!”
"“I hope the boys are all safe,” said Ned."
"Lampert, as it breezed up again."
"And five minutes' later, while Lampert was lighting his pipe half-way"
"down the cabin stairs, he heard a bellow forward which made him drop"
thoughts of tobacco.
"""Breakers ahead!"""
The watch came out on deck and ran aft; and were followed by the
"watch below in various articles of attire, not calculated to keep"
them very warm.
The _Potluck_ had been running with the wind nearly dead aft.
"""Starboard, starboard!"" roared Lampert.  ""Oh, steady; hold her there!"""
The vessel ran off to port at a sharp angle to her wake.
"""Up here some,"" yelled the mate, ""and set the spanker!  Stand by"
"the----  My God!"""
"And, as old Jones and Simcox came on deck, the _Potluck_ was hard and"
fast ashore.  With one simultaneous crack the three topmasts went
"over the side, and as the men and officers jumped under the shelter"
"of the weather rail, Lampert and those of the watch who were with him"
came tumbling down from the poop.  They reckoned on a boiling sea
coming after and sweeping them away.  But though the malignity native
"to matter had set the _Potluck_ ashore, by good luck she was hard and"
fast in the one sheltered cove on the island.  When Lampert by
"instinct altered her course to port, as he heard the coast breakers"
"at the starboard bow, he had run her in between two ledges of rock,"
of which the outer or more westerly one acted as a complete

10. American Hymns.
The English speaking colonists who settled in America during the 17th
century continued the psalm singing traditions of their forebears in
England. The practice prevailed in their churches for two hundred years.
"The first book printed by them was the _Bay Psalm Book_, in 1640, at"
"Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no original hymns. The singing of"
"psalms, and later of hymns borrowed from England made up nearly the"
entire repertory of church music until the middle of the 19th century.
"On the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the"
"Mennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran"
tradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.
"The two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales, went"
"their independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing each"
other.
In the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in
"America, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their"
"brief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and"
"tunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until"
"recently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight’s hymn on the church, “I"
"love Thy Kingdom, Lord” (275) is probably the earliest American hymn"
still in use.
After the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers became
"large and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples"
finding their way into English hymnbooks. America’s original
conditions seem to be reversed--the eight legs and two tails and two necks
"with one head pointing to enlargement of the land, whereas a double foetus"
with only six or five feet forebodes some impending misfortune[41].
Let us proceed further with this text.
"If it is a double foetus, one well formed and the second issuing from"
"the mouth of the first[42], the king will be killed and his army will"
"[revolt ?], his oil plantation and his dwelling will be destroyed[43]."
"If it is a double foetus, the second lying at the tail [of the"
"first], with two breasts and two tails, there will be no unity in the"
land[44].
"If it is a double foetus, and the second lies at the tail of the"
"first and enclosed and both are living, ditto."
"If it is a double foetus, and one rides over the other, victory,"
throne will support throne.
If it is a double foetus and one rides over the other and there is
"only one head, the power of the king will conquer the enemy's land."
"If it is a double foetus, one above and one below, with only one"
"spine and eight feet, four [Variant: 'two'] ears, and two tails,"
throne will support throne.
"If it is a double foetus with the faces downward, approach of the son"
"of the king, who will take the throne of his father, or a second son"
"of the king will die, or a third son of the king will die."

himself outside.
There was little to be discerned clearly when he emerged into the cool
"damp darkness, only a dim heap of writhing bodies as in some combat of"
hounds or of the denizens of the midnight forest. But Rollo once and
again saw a flash of steel and a hand uplifted to strike. Without
waiting to think he gripped that which was topmost and therefore nearest
"to him, and finding it unexpectedly light, he swung the thing clear by"
the garment he had clutched. As he did so he felt a pain in his right
"shoulder, which at the time appeared no more than the bite of a squirrel"
"or the sting of a bee. With one heave he threw the object, human or not"
"he could not for the moment determine, behind him into the blackness of"
the hall.
"""Take hold there, somebody!"" he cried, for by this time he could hear"
the clattering of the feet of his followers on the stairs and flagged
"where to find Vance and the woman. Now."""
"""Were they responsible?"""
"""With deepest apologies, that need not trouble you."" He stood ramrod"
straight.
"""With deepest apologies, Sato-sama, it troubles me very much."" Nogami"
"examined his cigar. ""This entire affair is very troublesome. In times"
past I remember a certain prejudice in favor of civility on the part of
"Tokyo. Have things really changed that much?"""
"""The moment for soft words is past. Tonight ended that."""
"Nogami drew on his cigar. ""Assuming you locate Vance, what action do"
"you propose taking?"""
It was the maid’s turn to look surprised.
"“I didn’t think he was to be here,” she said. “He’s had some—”"
"“Trouble at the office,” supplied Kennedy. “That’s what it was about."
Perhaps he hasn’t been able to get away yet. But I had the appointment.
"Ah, I see a telephone in the hall. May I?”"
"He had stepped politely in, and by dint of cleverly keeping his finger"
"on the hook in the half light, he carried on a one-sided conversation"
with himself long enough to get a good chance to look about.
There was an air of quiet and refinement about the apartment in the
Recherche. It was darkened to give the little glowing electric bulbs in
their silken shades a full chance to simulate right. The deep velvety
"carpets were noiseless to the foot, and the draperies, the pictures,"
"the bronzes, all bespoke taste."
But the chief objects of interest to Craig were the little square green
baize-covered tables on one of which lay neatly stacked a pile of
"gilt-edged cards and a mahogany box full of ivory chips of red, white"
and blue.
"It was none of the old-time gambling places, like Danfield’s, with its"
steel door which Craig had once cut through with an oxyacetylene
blowpipe in order to rescue a young spendthrift from himself.
Kennedy seemed perfectly well satisfied merely with a cursory view of
"the place, as he hung up the receiver and thanked the maid politely for"
allowing him to use it.
sexes--or worse. I was positive I could shame him into a more rational
"social behavior and make him give himself up. Then he--he--"""
"She pressed her fingernails into her palms and let out a long, glaring"
"sigh at the door. ""Then he kissed me! Oh, it was a good enough"
kiss--Mr. Brown has evidently had a varied and colorful background--but
"the galling idiocy of the man, trying that! I was just getting over the"
colossal impudence involved in _his_ proposing marriage--as if _he_ had
"to bear the children!--and was considering the offer seriously, on its"
"merits, as one should consider _all_ suggestions, when he deliberately"
dropped the pretense of reason. He appealed to me as most of the savage
"ancients appealed to their women, as an emotional machine. Throw the"
"correct sexual switches, says this theory, and the female surrenders"
herself ecstatically to the doubtful and bloody murk of masculine
"plans."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was a double knock on the door and the Captain walked in without
waiting for an invitation. He was still holding Butt's blaster. He
"pointed it at me. ""Get your hands up, Ferdinand Sparling,"" he said."
I did.
"""I hereby order your detention for the duration of this voyage, for"
"aiding and abetting a stowaway, as set forth in Sections Forty-one and"
"Forty-five--"""
"""Forty-three and Forty-five,"" Sis interrupted him, her eyes getting"
"larger and rounder. ""But you gave me your word of honor that no charges"
"would be lodged against the boy!"""
XVII. EVIL DAYS
"Accompanied by Kennedy, Cæsar called repeatedly on the most auspicious"
"members of the French clerical element living in Rome, and found persons"
"more cultivated than among the rough Spanish monks; but, as was natural,"
nobody gave him any useful information offering the possibility of his
putting his financial talents to the proof.
"“Something must turn up,” he used to say to himself, “and at the least"
opening we will dive into the work.”
Cæsar kept gathering notes about people who had connections in Spain
with the Black party in Rome; he called several times on Father
"Herreros, despite his uncle’s prohibition, and succeeded in getting the"
"monk to write to the Marquesa de Montsagro, asking if there were no"
"means of making Cæsar Moneada, Cardinal Fort’s nephew, Conservative"
Deputy for her district.
The Marquesa wrote back that it was impossible; the Conservative Deputy
for the district was very popular and a man with large properties there.
"When Holy Week was over, Laura and the Countess Brenda and her daughter"
"decided to spend a while at Florence, and invited Cæsar to accompany"
"them; but he was quite out of harmony with the Brenda lady, and said"
that he had to stay on in Rome.
"A few days later Mme. Dawson and her daughters left, and the San"
Martinos and the Marchesa Sciacca; and an avalanche of English people
"and Germans, armed with their red Baedekers, took the hotel by storm."
Susanna Marchmont had gone to spend some days at Corfu.
"“In return,” said he, “I hope you will allow me to send in some jellies"
"and fruits, or appliances, or whatever may be of pleasure or comfort to"
the child.”
"“Whatever you send her that is practical shall be applied to her use,”"
said the Sister superintendent.
"She was cold, unemotional; no smile, no ghost even of departed smiles,"
"seemed ever to visit the tired, gray eyes or the corners of the rigid"
mouth; coif and face and thin hands were spotless. She did not even
thank him for his forced gift to the orphanage.
"“I should like to know,” said John, regarding her beneath frowning"
"brows, “whether any one here loves the unhappy little wretch.”"
"“These children,” replied the Sister superintendent, “have naturally a"
hard battle to fight when they go from here into the world. They come
"mostly from vicious classes. Their training is uniformly kind, but it"
has to be austere.”
John rose. “I will bring what things I can think of to-morrow.”
"The Sister superintendent rose, too, and bowed icily. “You are at"
"liberty to do so, Mr. Risca; but I assure you there is no reason for"
your putting yourself to the trouble. In the circumstances I can readily
understand your solicitude; but again I say you have no cause for it.”
"“Madam,” said he, “I see that I have more cause than ever.”"
"The next day he drove to the orphanage in a cab, with a hamper of"
delicacies and a down pillow. The latter the Sister superintendent
"""Then my name can't seem very odd to you, Miss Graham!"""
She was regarding me as though trying to discover what kind of a species
"I was that had got on her father's yacht, when the sailor came back"
followed by a husky brute in uniform. Intuitively I stiffened to meet
"the crisis, but even at this eleventh hour a respite came."
"""He ain't aboard,"" the other Jack whispered, and the captain--for the"
"burly one was only the captain, after all--saluted, saying:"
"""I've just now found out, ma'am, he ain't aboard!"""
"""Not aboard? What do you mean?"""
"""After bringing you on last night he went ashore again to get a little"
below was the bed-chamber of as many more.
"Cast back upon his own thoughts, Rollo reviewed many things--his short"
"life, the reckless ups-and-downs in which he had spent it--but all"
without remorse or regret.
"""I might have been a lawyer, and lived to a hundred!"" he said to"
"himself. ""It is better as it is. If I have done little good, perhaps I"
"have not had time to do a great deal of harm."""
"Then very contentedly he curled himself up to sleep as best he might,"
only dreamily wondering if little Concha would be sorry when she heard.
Ramon Garcia sat with his eyes fixed on the sentry who had ceased his
"to-and-fro tramp up the centre, and now leaned gloomily against the"
"wall, his hands crossed about the cross-bar of his sword-bayonet."
"defenders, roused from their feast of blood, had poured all their"
"defences towards the point of attack, leaving the northern slope to"
look to itself.
As they rode down the ravine there came from the bottom of the valley
the sharp yelp of a dog. It was instantly answered by a similar bark
from the very top of the castello.
"""No two dogs ever had the same voice,"" the duke turned to Francesco."
"""They must be hell-hounds, whom the fiend has trained to one tune. But"
"what is that yonder? A goat picking its way?"""
"""A goat walking on its hind legs!"""
"""Are there horns on its head?"""
"""No!""--"
"""Then it is not the Evil One! Forward, my men!"""
The pause that preceded the breaking of the storm had been unnaturally
"long. Save for the gleam of the lightnings, the waters had grown to an"
"inky blackness. There came one long moment, when the atmosphere sank"
under the weight of a sudden heat. Then the ever increasing thunder
"rushed upon the silence with a mighty roar and out of the west, driven"
"by the hurricane, came a long line of white waves, that rose as they"
"advanced, till the very Tritons beat their heads and the nymphs"
scurried down to greener depths.
"And now a sudden streak of fire hissed from the clouds, followed by a"
crash as if all the bolts of heaven had been let off at once. From the
"ramparts of Astura came cries of alarm, the din of battle, the blaring"
"""Yes, we were fortunate in getting such good ones."""
"""You were fortunate in many ways. In fact you are a very lucky young"
"man."""
"""Indeed! How?"""
"""Well, don't you think you were lucky to beat that strike?"""
"""It wasn't altogether luck. However, I do consider myself fortunate in"
"escaping at the last moment,"" Boyd laughed easily. ""By the way, what"
"happened to the man they mistook for me?"""
"""Let him go, I believe. I didn't pay much attention to the matter."""
"Marsh had been using his eyes to good advantage, and, seeing the work"
"even better in hand than he had supposed, he was moved by irritation"
and the desire to goad his opponent to say more than he had intended:
"""I rather think you will have a lot to explain, one of these days,"" he"
"said, with deliberate menace."
"""With fifty thousand cases of salmon aboard _The Bedford Castle_ I will"
"explain anything. Meanwhile the police may go to the devil!"" The cool"
assurance of the young man's tone roused his would-be tormentor like a
personal affront.
"""You got away from Seattle, but there is a commissioner at Dutch"
"Harbor, also a deputy marshal, who may have better success with a"
"warrant than those policemen had."" The Trust's manager could not keep"
"down the angry tremor in his voice, and the other, perceiving it,"
replied in a manner designed to inflame him still more:
"""Yes, I have heard of those officers. I understand they are both in"
The repulsive creature outside made an authoritative gesture. He
"seemed to be beckoning to them, his huge dull eyes glaring"
threateningly at the same moment.
"""Our beanpole friend is suggesting that we get out of the shell and"
"stay awhile,"" said Dex with grim humor. ""They seem anxious to"
"entertain us--_ouch!_"""
"As the two men made no move to obey the beckoning gesture, the"
"creature had raised the tube again; and again the sharp, unpleasant"
shock shot through them.
"""What the devil are we going to do?"" exclaimed Brand. ""If we go out in"
that mob of nightmare things--it's going to be messy. As long as we
"stay in the shell we have some measure of protection."""
"""Not much protection when they can sting us through metal and glass at"
"will,"" growled Dex. ""Do you suppose they can turn the juice on harder?"
"Or is that bee-sting their best effort?"""
"As though in direct answer to his words, the blob-like face of the"
being who seemed in authority convulsed with anger and he raised the
tube again. This time the shock that came from it was sufficient to
throw the two men to the floor.
"""Well, we can't stay in the ship, that's certain,"" said Brand. ""I"
"guess there's only one thing to do."""
"Dex nodded. ""Climb out of here and take as many of these skinny"
"horrors with us into hell as we can,"" he agreed."
"Once more the shock stung them, as a reminder not to keep their"
[17] It was a bad day for the cause of truth when Foxe's _Book of
Martyrs_ was allowed to go out of general circulation. When I was a boy
it was no uncommon thing to see copies of it in American homes. Now it
is rarely seen. A new and corrected edition of it ought to be brought
out and given wide circulation. There have been not a few indications
this year that our people are forgetting some of the most instructive
"history of all the past, and those who seem to be most oblivious of it"
are the editors of some of the secular newspapers.
"[18] There are other indications of some improvement in this matter,"
"but an Anglican resident in Italy, quoted by the _Review of Reviews_ as"
"""a painstaking and fair-minded"" witness, says, ""People are not shocked"
"by clerical immorality, but regard it as natural and inevitable."" To an"
Anglican friend a Roman prelate lamented that a certain cardinal was
"not elected at the late conclave. But the Anglican replied, ""He is a"
"man of conspicuous immorality."" ""No doubt,"" was the answer, ""but you"
Americans seem to think there is no virtue but chastity. The Cardinal
"has not that, but he is an honest man."""
CHAPTER XXXII.
THE OLD FORCES AND THE NEW IN THE ETERNAL CITY.
[Sidenote: An Audience with the Pope.]
"Well, we have seen the Pope. Hearing that a body of Italian pilgrims"
"were to be received by the pontiff at the Vatican, and having assured"
"In less than a week Cæsar remained alone, knowing nobody in the hotel,"
and despite his believing that he was going to be perfectly indifferent
"about this, he felt deserted and sad. The influence of the springtime"
"also affected him. The deep blue sky, cloudless, dense, dark, made him"
"languish. Instead of entertaining himself with something or other, he"
did scarcely anything all day long but walk.
_TWO ABSURD MEN_
"“I have continually near me in the hotel,” wrote Cæsar to Alzugaray,"
“two absurd fellows: one is one of those stout red Germans with a square
"head; the other a fine slim Norwegian. The German, who is a captain in"
"some service or other, is a restless man, always busy about what the"
"devil I don’t know. He is constantly carrying about trunks and boxes,"
"with the aid of a sorrowful valet, dressed in black, who appears to"
detest his position. The captain must devote the morning to doing
"gymnastics, for I hear him from my room, which is next to his, jumping"
"and dropping weights on the floor, each of which must weigh half a ton,"
to judge by the noise they make.
"“He does all this to vocal commands, and when some feat doesn’t go right"
he reprimands himself.
"“This German isn’t still a moment; he opens the salon door, crosses the"
"room, stands at the window, takes up a paper, puts it down. He is a type"
that makes me nervous.
"“The Norwegian at first appeared to be a reasonable man, somewhat"
"luck."""
"Brand saluted, and went out, to go to his own quarters and make the"
few preparations necessary for his sudden emergency flight.
*       *       *       *       *
The work of exploring the planets that swung with Earth around the sun
"was still a new branch of the service. Less than ten years ago, it had"
"been, when Ansen devised his first crude atomic motor."
"At once, with the introduction of this tremendous new motive power,"
"men had begun to build space ships and explore the sky. And, as so"
"often happens with a new invention, the thing had grown rather beyond"
itself.
Everywhere amateur space flyers launched forth into the heavens to try
their new celestial wings. Everywhere young and old enthusiasts set
Ansen motors into clumsily insulated shells and started for Mars or
the moon or Venus.
"The resultant loss of life, as might have been foreseen, was"
appalling. Eager but inexperienced explorers edged over onto the wrong
side of Mercury and were burned to cinders. They set forth in ships
"that were badly insulated, and froze in the absolute zero of space."
"They learned the atomic motor controls too hastily, ran out of"
"supplies or lost their courses, and wandered far out into space--stiff"
corpses in coffins that were to be buried only in time's infinity.
"To stop the foolish waste of life, the Earth Government stepped in. It"
was decreed that no space ship might be owned or built privately. It
was further decreed that those who felt an urge to explore must join
"SYMPSON, DAVID."
Born at North Berwick.
One of Roberts's crew. Tried and hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722. On
the day of execution Sympson was among the first six prisoners to be
brought up from the ship's hold to have their fetters knocked off and to
"be fitted with halters, and it was observed that none of the culprits"
"appeared in the least dejected, except Sympson, who ""spoke a little faint,"
but this was rather imputed to a Flux that had seized him two or three
"days before, than Fear."" There being no clergyman in the colony, a kindly"
"surgeon tried to take on the duties of the ordinary, but with ill-success,"
the hardened ruffians being quite unmoved by his attempts at exhortation.
"In fact, the spectators were considerably shocked, as indeed they well"
"might be, by Sympson, suddenly recognizing among the crowd a woman whom he"
"knew, calling out ""he had lain with that B----h three times, and now she"
"was come to see him hanged."""
"Sympson died at the age of 36, which was considerably above the average"
age to which a pirate might expect to live.
"TAYLOR, CAPTAIN."
"This formidable South Sea pirate must indeed have looked, as well as"
"acted, the part, since his appearance is described by Captain Johnson as"
"follows: ""A Fellow with a terrible pair of Whiskers, and a wooden Leg,"
"being stuck round with Pistols, like the Man in the Almanack with Darts."""
This man Taylor it was who stirred up the crew of the _Victory_ to turn
"these three stalwarts, the car--a source of the utmost excitement"
"and wonderment to them--Allan, Allah-dad and my weary self were, ere"
"long, safe in the rest-house of the small mud fort at Saindak."
"The following morning, after a good night's rest, I had a long talk"
"with Idu, and the very favourable impression I had formed of the man"
the night before was greatly increased. I found him by daylight to be
"a highly intelligent-looking, splendidly proportioned fellow of about"
"five feet eight, with a big black beard. I had glimpses, even then,"
of the keen sense of humour which was to do so much to lighten the
difficulties of the ensuing campaign. Never once in all the months to
come did I find his wit and humour fail.
"As after-events proved he was absolutely invaluable. In fact, I often"
"called him, and told him that I called him, my ""head."" Not only did"
"he know every yard of the country, but he knew by name practically"
"every one of the Raiders, knew their peculiarities and their weak"
"points as well as their strength. Idu was a man in a million, and I"
"should like to think that, some day, this public appreciation of him,"
"and of what he did to help in this campaign, may reach him."
"After breakfast and my talk with Idu, we set out on the last march of"
"the first phase of my journey, and reached Robat by two o'clock in"
the afternoon.
CHAPTER III
A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
"chin in the air, triumphant."
"He led the way to his car, and was gratified to observe its salutary"
effect on Captain Dove's somewhat contemptuous demeanour. The little
"policeman in charge of it pending its opulent owner's return, came"
"forward, touching his képi, which further impressed Captain Dove,"
"uncomfortably. Slyne handed Sallie into the tonneau, and Ambrizette"
"after her, tossed the policeman a further tip which secured his"
"everlasting esteem, took his own seat at the wheel, and was hastily"
followed by Captain Dove.
"""Where are we bound for?"" asked Captain Dove, holding his top-hat on"
"with both hands, as Slyne took the road toward Sampierdarena at a round"
pace.
"""Don't talk to the man at the wheel,"" answered Slyne, and laughed."
"""We've a hundred miles or so ahead of us. Better chuck that old tile of"
yours away and tie a handkerchief round your head; you'll find that less
"uncomfortable."""
"The old man, at a loss for any more effective retort, pulled his"
"antiquated beaver down almost to his ears, folded his long arms across"
"the chest of his flapping frock-coat, and sat silent, scowling at the"
baggy umbrella between his knees. Nor did he open his mouth again during
the swift journey.
But when they at length reached their destination and Slyne stopped the
"car quietly before the imposing pile that forms the Hôtel de Paris,"
Captain Dove's jaw dropped and his mouth opened mechanically.
A resplendent porter came hurrying forward and bowed most humbly to the
magnificent Slyne.
"""That's hardly fair, is it?"" commented Wilson."
"""It's a start. You have to start somewhere. Radio--know its start?"
The first message was sent across the ocean a few hundred years ago
from one man to the other after they had made a complete plan as to
"time, date, location and frequency, and also the transmitted message."
"Sure enough, they got through. That, too, was under the ideal test"
conditions. So when we finally assembled the half-a-hundred separate
circuits and devices that made it look as though we might have a space
"detector, we put up targets, aimed our equipment, and looked for a"
"response where there should be one."""
"""We don't know where our target is,"" objected Wilson."
"""And we haven't yet fired up this equipment to seek a target of unknown"
"position and range,"" admitted Allison. ""But this gear is better than"
"nothing."""
Again the green spots flickered in the dome over their heads.
"""What do all those spots mean?"" asked Wilson."
"""Those are false targets, probably caused by background noise. Although"
"the infrawave is noiseless, we still seem to be getting it. Dr."
"Friedrich disagrees. He claims this is not noise, but interferences."
"However, the good doctor is not at all certain that the so-called"
interferences come from localized conditions within the equipment or
"from external sources."""
"Wilson shrugged. ""I don't see how it's done with a radiation type that"
"has neither a directional quality nor a velocity of propagation."""
We had been summoned over the telephone to the Blake mansion by
"Reginald Blake, Mrs. Blake’s eldest son. Reginald had been very"
"reticent over the reason, but had seemed very anxious and insistent"
that Kennedy should come immediately.
"Craig read quickly and I followed him, fascinated by the letter from"
its very opening paragraph.
"“Dear Madam,” it began. “Having received my diploma as doctor of"
"medicine and bacteriology at Heidelberg in 1909, I came to the United"
States to study a most serious disease which is prevalent in several of
the western mountain states.”
"So far, I reflected, it looked like an ordinary appeal for aid. The"
"next words, however, were queer: “I have four hundred persons of wealth"
on my list. Your name was—”
Kennedy turned the page. On the next leaf of the letter sheet was
pasted a strip of gelatine. The first page had adhered slightly to the
gelatine.
"“Chosen by fate,” went on the sentence ominously."
"“By opening this letter,” I read, “you have liberated millions of the"
virulent bacteria of this disease. Without a doubt you are infected by
"this time, for no human body is impervious to them, and up to the"
present only one in one hundred has fully recovered after going through
all its stages.”
I gasped. The gelatine had evidently been arranged so that when the two
"sheets were pulled apart, the germs would be thrown into the air about"
the person opening the letter. It was a very ingenious device.
"as the work progressed, it seemed that good-fortune would never smile"
"upon them for long. One day, when their preparations were nearly"
"completed, a foreman came to Boyd, and said excitedly:"
"""Boss, I'd like you to look at the Iron Chinks right away."""
"""What's up?"""
"""I don't know, but something is wrong."" A hurried examination showed"
the machines to be cunningly crippled; certain parts were entirely
"missing, while others were broken."
"""They were all right when we brought them ashore,"" the man declared."
"""Somebody's been at them lately."""
"""When? How?"" questioned Boyd. ""We have had watchmen on guard all the"
"time. Have any strangers been about?"""
"""Nobody seems to know. When we got ready to set 'em just now, I saw"
"this."""
"The Iron Chink, or mechanical cleaner, is perhaps the most ingenious of"
the many labor-saving devices used in the salmon fisheries. It is an
"awkward-looking, yet very effective contrivance of revolving knives and"
"conveyors which seizes the fish whole and delivers it cleaned, clipped,"
"cut, and ready to be washed. With superhuman dexterity it does the work"
of twenty lightning-like butchers. Without the aid of these Iron
"Chinks, Boyd knew that his fish would spoil before they could be"
"handled. In a panic, he pursued his investigation far enough to realize"
that the machines were beyond repair; that what had seemed at first a
"trivial mishap was in fact an appalling disaster. Then, since his own"
"experience left him without resource, he hastened straightway to George"
"""You're free now to do as you like,"" he answered, and left her. He felt"
as if he were treading on air on his way back to the mid-ship saloon.
"Captain Dove, in the same _négligé_ costume, was busy at breakfast when"
"Slyne walked in upon him again, but looked up from his plate for long"
enough to mumble a malicious question.
"""Yes, I've fixed it all up with her,"" Slyne answered with assumed"
"nonchalance. ""You can always trust me to know how to handle a woman,"
"Dove."""
"Captain Dove shot a derisive glance in his direction. ""Is she willing to"
"marry you after all, then?"" he demanded, feigning a surprise by no means"
complimentary.
"""Not just at once, of course,"" returned his companion, and left the old"
man to infer whatever he pleased.
In response to a shouted order of Captain Dove's a slatternly
cook-steward brought Slyne a steaming platter of beans with a bit of
"bacon-rind on top, and an enamelled mug containing a brew which might,"
"by courtesy, have been called coffee. There was a tray of broken ship's"
"biscuits, a tin containing some peculiarly rank substitute for butter,"
"upon the table, with the other equally uninviting concomitants of a"
meagre meal.
"""_Tchk-tchk!_"" commented Slyne, and sat down to satisfy his hunger as"
"best he might; while Captain Dove, having overheard that criticism, eyed"
"him inimically, and proceeded to puff a peculiarly rank cigar in his"
face.
"""You might as well be getting dressed now,"" said Slyne indifferently."

"As we left the Blake mansion, Kennedy remarked, “We must trace that car"
somehow—at least we must get someone working on that.”
Half an hour later we were in a towering office building on Liberty
"Street, the home of various kinds of insurance. Kennedy stopped before"
"a door which bore the name, “Douglas Garwood: Insurance Adjuster.”"
"Briefly, Craig told the story of the stolen car, omitting the account"
of the dastardly method taken to blackmail Mrs. Blake. As he proceeded
"a light seemed to break on the face of Garwood, a heavyset man, whose"
very gaze was inquisitorial.
"“Yes, the theft has been reported to us already by Dr. Wilson herself,”"
he interrupted. “The car was insured in a company I represent.”
"“I had hoped so,” remarked Kennedy, “Do you know the woman?” he added,"
watching the insurance adjuster who had been listening intently as he
told about the fair motor car thief.
"“Know her?” repeated Garwood emphatically. “Why, man, we have been so"
close to that woman that I feel almost intimate with her. The
"descriptions are those of a lady, well-dressed, and with a voice and"
"manner that would carry her through any of the fashionable hotels,"
perhaps into society itself.”
"“One of a gang of blackmailers, then,” I hazarded."
"Garwood shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps,” he acquiesced. “It is"
"automobile thieving that interests me, though. Why,” he went on, rising"
"excitedly, “the gangs of these thieves are getting away with half a"

"Having thus checked and tested every function of his department,"
"Breckenridge plugged into ""Captain,"" and when the green light went on:"
"""Chief pilot check-out--all x,"" he reported briefly."
"""All x,"" acknowledged the speaker, and the chief pilot unplugged."
"Fifteen minutes remained, during which time one department head after"
another would report to the captain of the liner that everything in his
charge was ready for the stupendous flight.
"""All x, Steve?"" Breckenridge turned to the computer. ""How do you check"
"acceleration and power with the observatory?"""
"""Not so good, old bean,"" the younger man frowned in thought. ""They"
"figure like astronomers, not navigators. They've made no allowances for"
"anything, not even the reversal--and I figure four thousands for that"
"and for minor detours. Then there's check station errors...."""
"""Check-station errors! Why, they're always right--that's what they're"
"for!"""
"""Don't fool yourself--they've got troubles of their own, the same as"
"anybody else. In fact, from a study of the charts of the last few weeks,"
I'm pretty sure that E2 is at least four thousand kilometers this side
"of where he thinks he is, that W41 is ten or twelve thousand beyond his"
"station, and that they've both got a lateral displacement that's simply"
"fierce. I'm going to check up, and argue with them about it as we pass."
"Then there's another thing--they figure to only two places, and we've"

"“Yes, certainly. And the effort to learn about useful things seems"
"natural and logical to me too, but not to learn about merely agreeable"
things. To learn medicine and mechanics is logical; but to learn to look
at a picture or to hear a symphony is an absurdity.”
“Why?”
“At any rate the neophytes that go to see a Rafael picture or to hear
"a Bach sonata and have an exclamation all ready, give me the sad"
impression of a flock of lambs. As for your sublime pedagogues of the
"Ruskin type, they seem to me to be the fine flower of priggishness, of"
"pedantry, of the most objectionable bourgeoisie.”"
“What things your brother is saying!” exclaimed Kennedy.
"“You shouldn’t notice him,” said Laura."
“Those artistic pedagogues enrage me; they remind me of Protestant
"pastors and of the friars that go around dressed like peasants, and who"
I think are called Brothers of the Christian Doctrine. The pedagogues
"are Brothers of the Esthetic Doctrine, one of the stupidest inventions"
that ever occurred to the English. I don’t know which I find more
"ridiculous, the Salvation Army or Ruskin’s books.”"
“Why have you this hatred for Ruskin?”
“I find him an idiot. I only skimmed through a book of his called _The
"Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and the first thing I read was a paragraph"
in which he said that to use an imitation diamond or any other imitation
"stone was a lie, an imposition, and a sin. I immediately said: ‘This man"

therefrom.
Crane droned on. The Vice-President of the United States looked down on
the top of Senator Crane's massive head and became fruitfully
preoccupied with thoughts of his own.
"Then, quite suddenly, the line of Crane's exposition changed. The"
Vice-President wasn't quite sure at what precise point this had come
about. He wasn't aware of the change until some very strange words
penetrated:
""" ... so, therefore, it has become starkly apparent that the American"
people have been denied the information which would have made them
"aware of their own deadly danger. Invasion from space is now imminent."""
"The Vice-President tensed. Had the stupid idiot gone mad? Or had he, the"
"Vice-President, been in a fog when vital, top-secret information had"
been made public?
"He banged the gavel down hard, for want of a better gesture, and was"
"grateful when a tall, dignified man with a look of deepest concern on"
his face rose from behind his desk out on the floor.
"""Will the Senator yield to his distinguished colleague from"
"Pennsylvania?"""
"Crane turned, scowling. ""I will yield to no man on matters of grave"
"import."" With that he turned and continued with his revelations. ""The"
people of this nation have been deprived of the knowledge that the

"creatures have even now achieved a beach-head on our planet. Even now,"

Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the
"great and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and"
"when one is of the _beau monde_ only one day in seventy, one loves to"
"protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring,"
"provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air"
proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure.
"At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the"
question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in
which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just
"then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of"
icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.
Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy.
"The girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and"
thanked him demurely.
"“I think my ankle is strained,” she said. “It twisted when I fell.”"
“Does it pain you much?” inquired Chandler.
“Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in
a minute or two.”
"“If I can be of any further service,” suggested the young man, “I will"
"call a cab, or—”"

"wingless angel,--made woman?"
"""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings!"" And with the name of his"
angel-love upon his lips he closed his eyes and sank into a deep and
dreamless slumber.

Tanzan Mino listened in silence. He was sitting at his desk in the
command sector wing of the North Quadrant at the Hokkaido facility.
"Although the sector was underground, like the rest of the facility,"
"behind his desk was a twenty-foot-long ""window"" with periscope double"
mirrors that showed the churning breakers of La Perouse Strait.
His jet had touched down on the facility's runway at 6:48 A.M. and been
promptly towed into the hangar. Tanzan Mino intended to be in personal
"command when _Daedalus I_ went hypersonic, in just nineteen hours. The"
video monitors in his office were hard-wired directly to the main
"console in Flight Control, replicating its data displays, and all"
decisions passed across his desk.
"""Leave the pilot to me,"" he said without emotion, revolving to gaze out"
"the wide window, which displayed the mid-afternoon sun catching the"
"crests of whitecaps far at sea. ""What he knows or doesn't know will not"
"disrupt the schedule."""
"Once again, he thought, I've got to handle a problem personally. Why?"
Because nobody else here has the determination to make the scenario
"succeed. First the protocol, and then the money. I had to intervene to"
resolve both.

to Tortuga.
"THWAITES, CAPTAIN JOSEPH."
"Coxswain to Captain Hood, he was promoted in 1763 to be a midshipman in"
"H.M.S. _Zealous_, cruising in the Mediterranean. Putting into Algiers,"
"Thwaites was sent ashore by the captain to buy some sheep, but did not"
"return to the boat and, it being supposed he had been assassinated, the"
"ship sailed without him. The fact was that young Thwaites, who spoke"
"Turkish and Greek, had accepted an invitation to enter the Ottoman"
"service. Embracing the Mohammedan religion, Thwaites was put in command of"
a forty-four gun frigate.
"His first engagement was with the flagship of the Tunisian Admiral, which"
"he took and carried to Algiers. He soon brought in another prize, and so"
"pleased the Dey that he presented him with a scimitar, the hilt of which"
was set with diamonds.
"Thwaites, having soiled his hands with blood, now became the pirate"
"indeed, taking vessels of any nation, and drowning all his prisoners by"
tying a double-headed shot round their necks and throwing them overboard.
"He stopped at no atrocity--even children were killed, and one prisoner, an"
"English lieutenant and an old shipmate of his, called Roberts, he murdered"
"without a second thought. When Thwaites happened to be near Gibraltar, he"
"He pointed to the four men who still stood by the wall, the firing party"
"at attention before them, and the eyes of all on the next wave of the"
general's hand which would mean life or death.
La Giralda drew a quick breath. Would the hold she had over him be
sufficient for what she was about to ask? He was a fierce man and a
"cruel, this Ramon Cabrera, who loved naught in the world except his"
"mother, and had gained his present ascendency in the councils of Don"
Carlos by the unbending and consistent ferocity of his conduct.
"""These are no traitors, General,"" she said; ""they are true men, and deep"
"in the councils of the cause."""
She bent and whispered in his ear words which others could not hear. The
"face of the Carlist general darkened from a dull pink to purple, and"
then his colour ebbed away to a ghastly ashen white as he listened.
"Twice he sprang up from the stone bench where he had seated himself,"
"ground his heel into the gravel brought from the river-bed beneath, and"
"muttered a characteristic imprecation, ""Ten for one of their women I"
"have slain already--by San Vicente after this it shall be a hundred!"""
For La Giralda was telling him the tale of his mother's shooting by
Nogueras.
"Then all suddenly he reseated himself, and beckoned to Concha."
"""Come hither,"" he said; ""let me see these fellows' papers, and tell me"
"how they came into your hands!"""
Concha was ready.
"""We must be in La Granja in two hours if we are to save a soul within"
"its walls,"" he said, ""but--we have an hour for dinner first! Therefore"
"let us dine. God knows when we shall taste food again!"""
And with this dictum John Mortimer heartily agreed.
CHAPTER XXX
PALACE BURGLARS
The startling announcement of the Sergeant at once set the whole party
"in motion. Their suspicions of the morning were cast to the winds, as"
"the Sergeant and La Giralda in turn related their adventures. Concha,"
"having formerly vouched so strongly for the old gipsy woman, now nodded"
"triumphantly across to Rollo, who on his part listened intently. As"
Sergeant Cardono proceeded the young man leaned further and further
"forward, breathing deeply and regularly. The expression on his face was"
that of fierce and keen resolution.
"The Sergeant told all the tale as it had happened, reserving only the"
"identification of himself with the famous José Maria of Ronda, which the"
"gipsies had made on the strength of the red mark about his neck, now"
"once more concealed under his military stock. Cardono, however, made no"
"secret that he was of the blood of Egypt, and set down to this fact all"
that he had been able to accomplish. In swift well-chosen words he told
"of the fierce little girl with the dark hair and blue eyes, who declared"
"herself to be the daughter of Muñoz, sometime paramour and now reputed"
husband of the Queen-Regent--making it clear that she had indeed planned
vulgarly self-assertive. Be righteous. Let your words and deeds
correspond. Lead no double life. Proclaim what you think right.
IDEAL OF KINGSHIP
The Indian ideal of kingship will be clear to you if I recite the
invocation with which we crowned our kings from the Vedic Times:
"""Be with us. We have chosen thee"
Let all the people wish for thee
Stand steadfast and immovable
Be like a mountain unremoved
"And hold thy kingship in thy grasp."""
"We have chosen thee, our prayers have consecrated thee, for all the"
wishes of the people went with thee. Thou art to stand as mountain
"unremoved, for thy throne is planted secure on the hearts of thy people."
"Stand steadfast then, for we have endowed thee with power irresistible."
Fall therefore not away; but let thy sceptre be held firmly in thy
grasp.
"Which is more potent, Matter or Spirit? Is the power with which the"
people endow their king identical with the power of wealth with which we
enrich him by paying him his Royal dues? We make him irresistible not by
"wealth but by the strength of our lives, the strength of our mind, may,"
"we have to pay him more according to our ancient Lawgivers, in as much"
"as the eighth part of our deeds and virtues, and the merit we have"
ourselves acquired. We can only make him irresistible by the strength of
"our lives, the strength of our minds, and the strength that comes out of"
righteousness.
the name of these societies and they are known outside of the
State by its name. Cross-reference when necessary.
Enter churches under the name of the place.
"Single churches have usually been entered under the place, a practice"
"which arose in American indexes from our way of naming churches ""The"
"First Church in----,"" ""The Second Church of----,"" etc., and applies"
"very well to a majority of English churches, whose name generally"
includes the name of the parish. It is more in accordance with indexing
"principles to limit the local entry of churches to _First Church_,"
"etc., and those which have only the name of the town or parish, and to"
"put all others (as _St. Sepulchre's_, _St. Mary Aldermansbury_) under"
"their names, as they read, and to treat convents and monasteries in the"
same way; but the convenience of having a single definite rule has been
held to outweigh in this case the claims of consistency.
"The parishes of London (as _Kensington_, _Marylebone_, _Southwark_),"
"like the parts of Boston (_Dorchester_, _Roxbury_, etc.), or of any"
"other composite city, would be put under their own names, not under the"
name of the city.
A few cathedrals generally known by some other name may be entered
"under it: e.g., _St. Paul's, London; Notre Dame, Paris; St."
"Peter's, Rome; St. Sophia, Constantinople_."
"Put monasteries and convents, like churches, under the place,"
unless better known by the name.
National banks designated merely by number (as _First National Bank
of Boston_) go under the name of the place.
gridded with radio location finders so accurate that the position of
two ships a hundred yards apart shows a hundred yards of difference in
absolute position in the loran.
Some day in the distant future space would be solid-gridded with
infrawave navigation signals. Then the space coordinates of any
spacecraft could be found to a fine degree of precision. But now all
that Wilson and his nav-techs could do was to keep sighting the fixed
"stars, and from them compute their position."
"This sort of space navigation was good enough to keep a ship on course,"
"but far from precise enough to pinprick a true position. But, after"
"all, a crude positioning in the middle of interstellar space is good"
enough. One literally has cubic light years to float around in. Once
"the spacecraft begins to approach a destination, the space positioning"
can be made.
"Again, few spacecraft pause in mid-flight between stars long enough to"
"care about their interstellar position. After all, space flight does"
provide a mode of travel where the destination lies within eyesight.
"Or rather, it has lain within eyesight ever since it became commonly"
"accepted that these ultimate destinations were places, instead of holes"
poked in an inverted ceramic bowl.
"Then, in the middle of the communications confusion, came a call from"
one of Commander Hatch's scout flights.
"""Pilot Logan, Flight Eighteen, to Commander Hatch. Report."""
"""Hatch to Logan. Go ahead. Find something, Will?"""
"Will Logan said, ""Solid target detected on radar, Commander. Approached"
"abdomen slightly tumid; tenderness over lower half, especially"
on left side; the lower half moves little with respiration.
Twenty-four hours later the patient had improved. He was
comfortable and hopeful; slept well with morphia 1/3 grain
"hypodermically. Tongue moist, covered with white fur; has been"
"taking milk only, [Symbol: ounce]ij every half-hour. No"
sickness. Temperature
99°. Pulse 104. Respirations 24. Abdomen flatter; general
respiratory movement; tenderness now mainly localised to an
"area 2-1/2 inches in diameter, to the left of the umbilicus,"
above exit wound.
"The patient continued to improve, and on the fifth day"
travelled six hours in a bullock wagon to Bloemfontein. Soon
"after arrival his temperature was normal: pulse 80,"
"respirations 16, with good abdominal movement. Local tenderness"
"persisted in the same area, but was less in degree. Tongue"
"rather dry, bowels confined. Micturition normal. Two drachms of"
castor oil and an enema were given.
"On the ninth day patient was practically well, except for"
slight deep tenderness. He remained in bed on ordinary light
"diet, but at the end of the third week he was seized by a"
"sudden attack of pain, the temperature rising to 103° and the"
"pulse to 140, the abdomen becoming swollen and tender. He was"
"then under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, who ordered some opium,"
and the symptoms rapidly subsided. Although this wound crossed
"the small intestine area, it is probable that the symptoms may"
have been due to an injury of the rectum or sigmoid flexure.
"father, and two other men. Susanna was most smart; she greeted Laura and"
"Cæsar very affably, and presented her father, Mr. Russell; then she"
"presented an English author, tall, skinny, with blue eyes, a white"
"beard, and hair like a halo; and then a young Englishman from the"
"Embassy, a very distinguished person named Kennedy, who was a Catholic."
_TEA_
"After the introductions they passed into the dining-room, which was"
"most impressive. It was an exhibition of very smart women, some of"
"them ideally beautiful, and idle men. All about them resounded a nasal"
English of the American sort.
Susanna Marchmont served the tea and did the honours to her guests.
"They all talked French, excepting Mr. Russell, who once in a long while"
uttered some categorical monosyllable in his own language.
Mr. Russell was not of the classic Yankee type; he looked like a vulgar

What to Cæsar seemed wonderful in this gentleman was his economy of
"words. There was not one useless expression in his vocabulary, and"
"not the slightest redundancy; whatever partook of merit, prestige, or"
"nobility was condensed, for him, to the idea of value; whatever partook"
"of arrangement, cleanliness, order, was condensed to the word “comfort”;"
"so that Mr. Russell, with a very few words, had everything specified."

I am glad to add that the views we hold seem to have come at last to be
shared by the more responsible part of the French amongst the
"governmental circle, as well as by the general public. The newspapers"
"which are still sticking to their old contention are very few in number,"
and they seem to have some particular reasons of their own. I can never
think a nation like France could consciously and wilfully offend against
"justice and equity, and the only thing we anxiously hope for is that the"
declaration of the French Government may be honestly and effectually
"followed up. Whatever may be one's intention, the drift of events often"
"creates unlooked-for incidents, and that too often against one's will,"
when it is too late to avoid the consequences. Let all parties concerned
be careful in this matter of vital importance.

You ask my opinion on the future of the Yellow Peril cry. From an
ethical point of view it is an unjust and unreasonable accusation. From
a practical point of view it is idle and useless talk.
I have spoken and written on these particular points so often that I do
"not feel inclined to reiterate any more. I will, however, consider the"
matter from a different point of view and solicit any answer which may
be advanced against my conviction. I do not do this from any thought of
vanity; I should be very sorry if it were ever taken in that sense. I
"do not suffer."""

GUESSWORK
"Cary tried to shake my resolution, but I was obdurately silent. While"
"he canvassed the whole position, bringing to bear his really profound"
knowledge of naval equipment and routine--and incidentally helping me
greatly to realise the improbability of my own guesswork solution--I
was able to maintain an air of lofty superiority. I must have
"aggravated him intensely, unpardonably, for I was his guest. He ought"
to have kicked me out. Yet he bore with me like the sweet-blooded
"kindly angel that he is, and when at the end it appeared that I was"
"right after all, Cary was the first to pour congratulations and honest"
admiration upon me. If he reads this book he will know that I am
repentant--though I must confess that I should behave in just the same
abominable way if the incident were to occur again. There is no great
value in repentance such as this.
"We reached Dawson's office in the early afternoon, and found his chief"
"assistant there, but no Dawson. ""The old man,"" remarked that officer,"
"a typical, stolid, faithful detective sergeant, ""is out on the"
rampage. He ought by rights to sit here directing the staff and leave
"the outside investigations to me. He is a high-up man, almost a deputy"
"assistant commissioner, and has no call to be always disguising"
himself and playing his tricks on everybody. I suppose you know that
"white-haired old gent down here ain't a bit like Bill Dawson, who's"

"And the faces that pass, with lingering glance out of the dusk, the"
pale sweet faces of thy beautiful women and the handsome figures of a
"vigorous race, how much larger vastnesses are in the communion of these"
eyes than in wide empty spaces of unthinking continents!
The mystic dusk turns thy many habitations to a thousand shadowy
"palaces, thy very vulgarities to dulcet musicalities. What comedies are"
in the making in thy wide hospitable lap to-night! what tragedies! what
heroic strivings! what bemeaning indecencies! what crimes!
Thy very mud holds something of dark mysterious lustre--being that
which is trod out of thy pageant and thy history.
"He only loves thee best who, being divorced from thee, comes to"

"familiarity, but hears in the hollows of his reverent ears the æolian"

"The sound of footsteps ceased to rouse the echoes in the empty street,"
as Noll came to a halt before Netherby Gomme’s doorway. He hesitated
for a moment; ran up the steps; and rang the bell.
"The smoky twilight that held the place was passing into sooty darkness,"
turning the staid street of lodging-houses into a way of fairy
"habitations, the lemon flames of gas-lamps showing a sweeping curve"
of light down its long length to the far rumble of the city’s distant
traffic.
A key coughed in its wards as it shot back the bolts of the lock; and
If an ewe gives birth to a lion with the horny exuberance of an ibex

From texts like these it would appear that the phrase of 'an ewe giving
birth to a lion' had acquired a purely conventional force to describe a
lamb whose head or general features suggested those of a lion. It may have
come to be used indeed for a newly born lamb of unusually large
proportions. Hence one could combine with the description of a lion-lamb
"who, shortly before his death, declared her to be “the only"
"woman in contemporary literature who knew how to write a novel,”"
and that her future work would be her best. Another eminent
"English critic, Dr. Robertson Nicholl, spoke for some of the"
best students of modern literature in saying:—
“Gertrude Atherton is the ablest woman writer of fiction
now living.”
"In her most notable novel, “The Conqueror,” Gertrude Atherton"
has chosen in “the true and romantic story of Alexander
Hamilton” a subject which would have attracted few woman
"writers, and has handled those parts of it with which many men"
have busied their brains in such a way that _The New York Times
Saturday Review_ remarked that it
“Holds more romance than nine-tenths of the imaginative
fiction of the day and more veracity than ninety-nine
hundredths of the history. She is master of her
material.”
“Certainly this country has produced no writer who approaches
"Mrs. Atherton,” says one critic, while another adds that to have"
so “re-created a great man as Mrs. Atherton has done in this
novel is to have written one’s own title to greatness.” All
alike regard it as “a thing apart” (_The Critic_); “a remarkable
"production, full of force, vigour, brains, and insight” (_Boston"
Herald_); “an entrancing book . . . brilliantly written”
(_Glasgow Herald_). “It is hardly too much to say that she has
invented a new kind of historical novel” is the comment of the
"_Athenæum_ (London), with the addition that “the experiment is a"
remarkable success.”

"The period of the German chorales may be said to have begun with Luther,"
"1483-1546, and ended two centuries later with J. S. Bach, 1685-1750."
"Bach brought the chorale tunes to their highest perfection, using many"
of them in his larger choral works. He composed about 30 original
"chorale melodies, wrote reharmonizations for approximately 400, and"
composed many chorale preludes for the organ which are in wide use
today.
"The German hymns and chorale tunes, used constantly in the home and"
"school, as well as in the church, have been of great importance in our"
Mennonite worship in the past. They constitute the main body of material
in all our German collections of hymns. In an effort to preserve and
"emphasize this rich heritage, there was incorporated into the _Hymnary_,"
"a special section, Book III, made up exclusively of chorales."

Presently the monkey had another disappointment. The intact tin

capitulating to the strenuous frontal attacks on the part of
Mephisto.

"the staff-paymaster recklessly, who had now taken the precaution of"
covering the pay-tables with a green baize cloth.
"""Bang, bang, bang!"" went the tin under the muscular efforts of"
Mephisto. Already large drops of the viscous fluid were descending
"upon the hallowed quarter-deck, bespattering officers and men"
"indiscriminately, for owing to the ship's speed a strong current of"

converted from liquid to gaseous phase for combustion. He'd been
worrying about their pulse rating and couldn't sleep.
He'd gone on to explain that although static testing had shown they
would achieve operating pressure in twenty milliseconds if they were
"fully primed in advance, that was static testing, not flight testing,"
and he'd been unable to sleep wondering about the adhesive around the

From the after-bridge of the cruiser a searchlight flashed skywards.
For a few seconds even its powerful rays failed to penetrate the pall

MONROE DOCTRINE OF THE PAST
'America's relation to this problem is more difficult. Monroeism is
thought to stand in the way. I appreciate the delicacy of venturing to
"discuss the policy of a nation other than my own, but I feel that"
Americans are too sensible to resent an honest expression of opinion.
"Monroeism is not part of the constitution, but the dictum of a"
"statesman. This dictum was made when our planet was very large, before"
the development of steam and electricity. The nations were isolated and
insulated by distance and non-communication.
'At that time American theory and practice relative to foreign affairs
"were in harmony. America was actually self-contained, but to-day the"

the American people cling to the idea of leaving distant matters alone.
Nevertheless the state department is widely and intelligently active.

"respecting the Jews, as well as despatch after despatch aimed at Russian"
aggression in Manchuria. The world's interests are becoming woven into a

THE QUEEN'S ANTE-CHAMBER
Out of the darkness Rollo and the Sergeant stepped quickly into the

"into her chair, the waiting-maid drop upon the floor as if she had been"

Both Zeppelins began to throw out ballast with frantic haste. They
"also released the whole of their remaining supply of bombs, which"

mile from the nearest destroyer.
With the release of the ballast the undamaged Zeppelin shot skywards
until her altitude was not less than ten thousand feet. Comparatively
"safe for the time being from the effect of the anti-aircraft shells,"
"she floated, a mere speck in the concentrated yet diminished glare of"
"a dozen searchlights, and awaited events."
"Meanwhile, the damaged Zeppelin had checked her plunge, and, in spite"
"of a hot fire, was slowly rising. By dint of strenuous efforts her"
crew succeeded in shifting aft the travelling weight that served to
trim the unwieldy craft. Even then her longitudinal axis was sharply
inclined to the horizontal.
"Everything that could be jettisoned was thrown overboard. Guns,"
"ammunition, stores, and the metal framework of the wrecked car were"
"sacrificed, till without being hit by the British guns, she rose to a"
terrific height.
"""We've lost her!"" exclaimed Oswestry savagely."
"""One thing, she won't trouble us again,"" added the commander. ""And"
I'm not so certain that she will get clear. We've wirelessed the
"seaplanes, and they'll have a chip in. Hullo! What's the game now?"""

"In this connection, it is a good plan occasionally during the story"
"hour to introduce really good poetry which, delivered in a dramatic"

children their first love of beautiful form in verse. And I do not
think it necessary to wait for this. Even the normal child of seven
(though there is nothing arbitrary in the suggestion of this age) will
appreciate the effect--if only on the ear--of beautiful lines well
"spoken. Mahomet has said, in his teaching advice: “Teach your children"

"Now, in comparing this poem with some of the doggerel verse offered"
"to small children, one is struck with the literary superiority in the"
"choice of words. Here, in spite of the simplicity of the poem, there"
"is not the ordinary limited vocabulary, nor the forced rhyme, nor the"
"application of a moral, by which the artist falls from grace."

"Alwyn looked at her steadily, and a swift flush colored her smooth"
"cheek. She toyed with the magnificent diamond spray at her breast, and"
wondered what strange spell was in this man's brilliant gray-black
eyes!--did he guess that she--even she--had sold herself to the Duc de

unresistingly as though she were a mere purchasable animal?

"gently--""It would lead us too far. But I am convinced, that whether"
"dire poverty or great riches be our portion, life, considered apart"
"from its worldly appendages, is always worth living, if lived WELL."""

"appendages?""--inquired a satirical-looking gentleman opposite--""Life IS"
"the world, and the things of the world; when we lose sight of the"
"world, we lose ourselves,--in short, we die,--and the world is at an"
"end, and we with it. That's plain practical philosophy."""

"Christianity."""
"""Oh, Christianity!""--and the gentleman gave a portentous sniff of"

Northern companies are finding some profit in exploiting such natural
resources of Panama as are available in their wild state. Of these the
"most promising is rubber, the tree being found in practically every part"
"of the country. One concern, the Boston-Panama Company, has an estate"
"approximating 400 square miles on which are about 100,000 wild rubber"
"trees, and which is being further developed by the planting of bananas,"
"pineapples, cocoanuts and other tropical fruits."

"Coffee, sugar and cacao are raised on the Isthmus, but of the two former"

"industry to large proportions seems probable, as several foreign"
corporations are experimenting on a considerable scale. Cocoanuts are
easily grown along both coasts of the Isthmus. A new grove takes about
"five years to come into bearing, costing an average of about three"
dollars a tree. Once established the trees bring in a revenue of about
"one dollar each at present prices and, as the demand for Panama"
"cocoanuts is steady, the industry seems to offer attractive"
"possibilities. The groves must be near the coast, as the cocoanut tree"
needs salt air to reach its best estate. Given the right atmospheric
conditions they will thrive where no other plant will take root. Growing
"at the edge of the sea, water transportation is easy."

"covered by what seemed a jointless metal plate. The open squares,"

that hooked each metal square with every other one of its kind as
batteries are wired in series. Over these open squares progressed
"tiny, two legged figures, for the most part following gigantic"
shapeless animals like figures out of a dream. Ahead suddenly appeared
the spires and towers of an enormous city!

"Over a group of squat square buildings their ship passed, decreasing"
speed and drifting lower with every moment. The lofty structures that
were the nucleus of the strange city loomed closer. Now they were
"soaring slowly down a wide thoroughfare; and now, at last, they"
hovered above a great open square that was thronged with figures.
Lower they dropped. Lower. And then they settled with a slight jar on
a surface made of reddish metal; and the figures rushed to surround
them.

with complete disappearance of hepatic dulness. Some movement
"of right half of abdomen, left half immobile, dulness extending"
from the flank as far forwards as linea semilunaris. An
"incision was made in left linea semilunaris, and Oj blood"
evacuated from the left loin. There was no lymph on the
intestines nor sign of inflammation. No perforation was
"discovered in either stomach or intestine, but on two coils of"
"jejunum there were deep slits 3/4 inch long, extending through"
"both peritoneal and muscular coats. Beyond these wounds, on"
"other coils oval patches of ecchymosis, due to direct bruising,"
were present. The peritoneal cavity was sponged free of all
blood and irrigated with boiled water; no bleeding point was
"discovered, and the abdomen was closed."
The next morning the patient was comfortable; temperature
"100.2°, pulse 100. Tongue clean and moist; he vomited once"
during the night.
"Some bloody discharge had collected in the dressing, and at the"
"lower angle of wound there was a local swelling, apparently in"
the abdominal wall. The flank was resonant.
"During the afternoon the patient became faint, and when seen at"
"6 P.M. was in a state of collapse, in which he shortly died."
Death was apparently due to renewal of the previous hæmorrhage.
No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"no Dryasdust. He was a living human being, troubled as we are troubled,"
"and interested in the things which interest us. He spoke to us, not"
"from the skies, but from among a crowd of his fellow human beings, and"
we feel that he was one of ourselves. As such it is good that a
memorial of him should be placed where it may easily be seen.

CHAPTER I
EARLY LIFE
"It may be a truism, but it is none the less a fact, that it is not"
always he of whom the world hears most who influences most deeply the
thought of the age in which he lives. The name of James Frederick
Ferrier is little heard of beyond the comparatively small circle of
philosophic thinkers who reverence his memory and do their best to keep
it green: to others it is a name of little import--one among a
multitude at a time when Scotland had many sons rising up to call her
"blessed, and not perhaps one of the most notable of these. And yet,"
could we but estimate the value of work accomplished in the higher
sphere of thought as we estimate it in the other regions of practical
"work--an impossibility, of course--we might be disposed to modify our"
"views, and accord our praises in very different quarters from those in"
which they are usually bestowed.
James Ferrier wrote no popular books; he came before the public
comparatively little; he made no effort to reconcile religion with
It was time to give the almost overheated starboard guns a chance to
"cool, so orders were given for the helm to be starboarded. Seeing the"
"cruiser in the act of turning, a destroyer tore across her bows,"
purposely throwing out huge volumes of black smoke from her four
"funnels in order to mask the ""Sunderland"" as she circled."
"Terence recognized the destroyer as his old ship the ""Livingstone,"""
"as she darted swiftly round the turning cruiser, then, leaving a"
"thick pall of smoke in her wake, hastened off to assist another"
destroyer that was evidently in difficulties.
"The ""Livingstone's"" manoeuvre undoubtedly saved the ""Sunderland"" from"
"destruction, for a fifty-two centimetre shell, aimed to hit the exact"
position where the cruiser would have been had she not altered
"course, struck the water with a tremendous splash not fifty yards on"
her beam.
"Before the ""Sunderland"" had drawn clear of the friendly cloud of"
smoke she had increased her distance from shore by nearly five
"cables' lengths; while, until the German gunners had found the range"
"anew, she was able to enjoy a brief respite."
"""Seaplanes returning,"" announced the gunnery-lieutenant on the"
"fire-control platform, who from his elevated post could command a"
wide and almost uninterrupted view.
"Their task done, the seaplanes, which had been engaged in dropping"
"bombs on the railway stations in the rear of the German batteries,"
were on their homeward way. Anxiously Terence counted them. Thank
heaven! Not one was missing.
Apparently the last but one of the aerial procession was in
Having resumed their respective stations the cruiser and the
destroyer flotilla followed. Owing to the greatly reduced speed of
the hostile aircraft it was an easy matter to maintain a fixed
"relative distance between them and the British vessels, whose"
attention was divided between the prospect of an aerial meeting with
seaplanes and the risk of being intercepted by the torpedo of a
"German submarine, to say nothing of floating mines."
"""She's cast off!"" shouted a dozen voices."
"Such was the case. The two Zeppelins had parted company, one flying"
"off at a terrific speed, rising rapidly as she did so, while the"
"other, being without means of propulsion, drifted at the mercy of the"
winds.
It was now dawn. The grey light of morning was already overcoming the
strength of the searchlights and it was already possible to discern
the outlines of the abandoned Zeppelin by the natural light of day.
Pelting up from the eastward came the air squadron of seaplanes. Half
"a dozen circled and started off in pursuit of the fugitive airship,"
"which, travelling at high speed, was now but a faint speck against"
the ruddy sky.
"The rest advanced boldly upon the disabled Zeppelin, although"
"ignorant of the fact that she had jettisoned her guns, and, save for"
"a few rifles, was without means of defence."
"The seaplanes' automatic guns spat viciously, and as the range"
decreased almost every shot began to tell. The huge fabric once more
"began to drop, as the small projectile ripped through the flimsy"
aluminium envelope.
CHAPTER I
PARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS
"""I was born when my country was perishing. Thirty thousand French"
"vomited upon our coasts, drowning the throne of Liberty in waves of"
"blood, such was the sight which struck my eyes."" This passionate"
"utterance, penned by Napoleon Buonaparte at the beginning of the"
"French Revolution, describes the state of Corsica in his natal year."
The words are instinct with the vehemence of the youth and the
extravagant sentiment of the age: they strike the keynote of his
career. His life was one of strain and stress from his cradle to his
grave.
In his temperament as in the circumstances of his time the young
Buonaparte was destined for an extraordinary career. Into a tottering
civilization he burst with all the masterful force of an Alaric. But
"he was an Alaric of the south, uniting the untamed strength of his"
island kindred with the mental powers of his Italian ancestry. In his
"personality there is a complex blending of force and grace, of animal"
"passion and mental clearness, of northern common sense with the"
promptings of an oriental imagination; and this union in his nature of
seeming opposites explains many of the mysteries of his life.
"Fortunately for lovers of romance, genius cannot be wholly analyzed,"
even by the most adroit historical philosophizer or the most exacting
champion of heredity. But in so far as the sources of Napoleon's power
"can be measured, they may be traced to the unexampled needs of mankind"
"called to their action stations when a faint buzzing, immediately"
"becoming louder and louder, announced that the raiders were"
approaching the town and harbour of Dover.
"Searchlights flashed skywards, while from beneath the old castle on"
the lofty chalk cliffs half a dozen intrepid British airmen ascended
to meet the foe. Already the anti-aerial guns were stabbing the
"darkness with lurid spurts of flame, while their shells, bursting"
"perilously close to the hostile aeroplanes, caused the calculating"
Teutons to think better of the attempt.
It was an easy matter to steal over an unfortified town or village
and drop explosives; but for once the Germans were to learn the
"wisdom of discrimination. Higher and higher they banked, until"
catching a glimpse of the British seaplanes as they passed through
the path of one of the searchlights they precipitately turned tail.
"""'Sunderland' and destroyer flotilla to proceed in support of"
"seaplanes,"" came the signal."
Hastily the pins of the mooring shackle were knocked out. Steam was
"already raised, and in a very few minutes the light cruiser and her"
attendant destroyers were slipping between the heads of the detached
breakwater and the Admiralty Pier.
But swift as were the light cruisers the seaplanes were quicker.
"Already they were five or six miles out to sea, their position being"
revealed by the flashes of the light guns as they exchanged shots
with the fugitive Taubes.
Suddenly with a dazzling flash a bomb exploded hardly twenty feet
"from the ""Sunderland's"" starboard quarter. Five seconds later another"
"the author's attitude, and thus lessen the value of his work. It is"
"most desirable, in order to prevent this, that the author carefully"
inspect the index while in manuscript. He can thus detect possible
departures in the indexer's condensed expression of his own thought.
The following rules and suggestions are given with a twofold object
"in mind: _first_, to prevent those authors who possess the necessary"
qualifications from avoiding the preparation of their own indexes
"because of unfamiliarity with the technical details; _second_, to"
enable authors intelligently to criticize the form as well as the
matter of those indexes which are prepared for their volumes by other
hands.
WHAT TO INDEX
The closeness with which a book is to be indexed depends partly upon
the nature of its contents and partly upon the ideas of the author
or publisher. Some indexes contain only the page references; some
are so analytical that a reader can gain an excellent idea of the
"subject-matter itself. These, however, represent the two extremes. The"
ordinary index aims to give every reference necessary to enable the
"reader to locate easily the subject-matter for which he searches, but"
"not a synopsis of that subject-matter. The entries should cover, then,"
"with more or less minuteness, as desired, the following:"
"(_a_) Proper names, whether of persons, places, religious or political"
"bodies, etc."
(_b_) Events and periods.
(_c_) Titles of books to which reference is made.
(_d_) Specific topics or subjects.
(_e_) Definitions.
In this brief sketch it is quite impossible to relate the many
changes of species and genera during the Silurian.
CORALS. Some of the more common types are familiarly known as cup
"corals, honeycomb corals, and chain corals. In the CUP CORALS the"
most important feature is the development of radiating vertical
"partitions, or SEPTA, in the cell of the polyp. Some of the cup"
"corals grew in hemispherical colonies (Fig. 288), while many were"
"separate individuals (Fig. 289), building a single conical, or"
"horn-shaped cell, which sometimes reached the extreme size of a"
foot in length and two or three inches in diameter.
"HONEYCOMB CORALS consist of masses of small, close-set prismatic"
"cells, each crossed by horizontal partitions, or TABULAE, while"
"the septa are rudimentary, being represented by faintly projecting"
ridges or rows of spines.
CHAIN CORALS are also marked by tabulae. Their cells form
"elliptical tubes, touching each other at the edges, and appearing"
in cross section like the links of a chain. They became extinct at
the end of the Silurian.
The corals of the SYRINGOPORA family are similar in structure to
"chain corals, but the tubular columns are connected only in"
places.
To the echinoderms there is now added the BLASTOID (bud-shaped).
"The blastoid is stemmed and armless, and its globular ""head"" or"
"""calyx,"" with its five petal-like divisions, resembles a flower"
"bud. The blastoids became more abundant in the Devonian,"
"culminated in the Carboniferous, and disappeared at the end of the"
Paleozoic.

(3) The said commission and warrant may authorise either a
"Vice-Admiralty Court or a Colonial Court of Admiralty, within the"
"meaning of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, to act as a prize"

"(4) Any such commission, warrant, or instructions may be revoked or"
altered from time to time.

"this gift, he replied: “I wept with the man, so I feel I ought to _do_"
something for him.”
CHAPTER V.
ELEMENTS TO SEEK IN CHOICE OF MATERIAL.
IN “The Choice of Books” Frederic Harrison has said: “The most useful
"help to reading is to know what we shall _not_ read, ... what we"
shall keep from that small cleared spot in the overgrown jungle of
information which we can call our ordered patch of fruit-bearing
knowledge.”[24]
"Now, the same statement applies to our stories, and, having busied"
"myself, during the last chapter, with “clearing my small spot” by"
"cutting away a mass of unfruitful growth, I am now going to suggest"
what would be the best kind of seed to sow in the patch which I have
“reclaimed from the Jungle.”
"Again I repeat that I have no wish to be dogmatic, and that in offering"
"suggestions as to the stories to be told, I am only catering for a"
group of normal school-children. My list of subjects does not pretend
"to cover the whole ground of children's needs, and just as I exclude"
the abnormal or unusual child from the scope of my warning in subjects
"to avoid, so do I also exclude that child from the limitation in choice"
"of subjects to be sought, because you can offer almost any subject to"
"the unusual child, especially if you stand in close relation to him and"
"know his powers of apprehension. In this matter, _age_ has very little"
Rossiter and the indignation of the W.S.P.U. became so alarming that
the agitated Secretary of State--not at all sure how we were going
"to come out of the War--gave way, and an order was signed for"
Vivie's release on the 11th of August; on the understanding that she
would immediately proceed abroad; an understanding to which she
would not subscribe but which in her slowly-formed hatred of the
British Government she resolved to carry out.
"Mrs. Warren, assured by Praed and Rossiter that Vivie's release was"
"a mere matter of a few days, had left for Brussels on the 5th of"
August. If--as was then hoped--the French and Belgian armies would
"suffice to keep the Germans at bay on the frontier of Belgium, she"
would prefer to resume her life there in the Villa de Beau-séjour.
If however Belgium was going to be invaded it was better she should
"secure her property as far as possible, transfer her funds, and make"
her way somehow to a safe part of France. Vivie would join her as
soon as she could leave the prison.
CHAPTER XVI
BRUSSELS AND THE WAR: 1914
The Lilacs in Victoria Road had been disposed of--through
"Honoria--as soon as possible, after the sentence of Three years'"
imprisonment had been pronounced on Vivie; and the faithful
"Suffragette maid had passed into Honoria's employ at Petworth, a"
fact that was not fully understood by Colonel Armstrong until he had
become General Armstrong and perfectly indifferent to the Suffrage
"""Eighty yards short,"" came the wireless report of the observing"
"seaplane that, hovering a bare five hundred feet above the German"
"mobile battery, had marked the point of impact of the shells."
Again a salvo was let loose. This time came the encouraging statement
"that the hostile guns were knocked clean out of action, and that"
swarms of artillerymen and infantry were scurrying across the dunes.
The next discharge practically annihilated the fugitives. In one
"minute and twenty-five seconds the ""Sunderland's"" particular task was"
"accomplished. It was but the beginning, for acting upon orders from"
the flagship she was ordered to engage a battery at close range.
"Meanwhile, the rest of the battleships and cruisers had not been"
idle. A perfect tornado of shell was being directed upon the Belgian
shore.
"""Hard aport!"" shouted the captain of the ""Sunderland."""
"Round swung the cruiser, only just avoiding the tell-tale line of"
bubbles that marked the track of a torpedo. With consummate daring a
German submarine had dived under a part of the torpedo-boat destroyer
"flotilla, and had discharged a weapon at the British cruiser. The"
"torpedo, having missed the ""Sunderland,"" was tearing straight for one"
"of the monitors, which, having to go full speed astern to avoid a"
"collision with a couple of damaged destroyers, was now practically"
stationary.
Owing to the light draught the weapon passed six feet beneath her
"keel, and finishing its run rose to the surface three hundred yards"
"beyond; for, instead of the torpedo sinking at the end of its course,"
"The temperature inside was a constant 5 degrees Celsius, kept just"
above freezing to extend the life of the sensitive electronic gear in
the next three bays. The high-voltage sodium lamps along the sides of
the fuselage now switched on automatically as the door swung inward. He
"fleetingly thought about turning them off, then realized they weren't"
manually operated.
Through the clouds of his condensing breath he could see that the
"interior of the entry bay was a pale, military green. The color"
"definitely seemed appropriate, given what he now knew about this"
vehicle.
"He quickly turned and, after making sure the outer door could be"
"reopened from the inside, closed it behind him. When it clicked secure,"
the sodium lights automatically shut off with a faint hum.
"Just like a damned refrigerator, he thought."
But the dark was what he wanted. He withdrew a small penlight from his
pocket and scanned the three bulkhead hatches leading to the forward
"bays. The portside bay, on the left, contained electronics for the"
"multimode phased array radar scanner in the nose, radar processors,"
"radar power supply, radar transmitters and receivers, Doppler"
"processor, shrouded scanner tracking mechanism, and an RF oscillator."
He knew; he'd checked the engineering diagrams.
"He also knew the starboard equipment bay, the one on the right,"
"contained signal processors for the inertial navigation system (INS),"
"the instrument landing system (ILS), the foreplane hydraulic actuator,"
"the structural mode control system (SMCS), station controller, and the"
pilot's liquid-oxygen tanks and evaporator.
"no longer to him, as to the man of the Middle Ages, as crystals mounted"
"in gold, or as stars in the firmament. 'I like assertions so little that"
I would easily take sides with the sceptics whereever it is allowed by
the inviolable authority of Holy Scripture and the decrees of the
Church.' 'What is exempt from error?' All subtle contentions of
theological speculation arise from a dangerous curiosity and lead to
impious audacity. What have all the great controversies about the
Trinity and the Virgin Mary profited? 'We have defined so much that
without danger to our salvation might have remained unknown or
undecided.... The essentials of our religion are peace and unanimity.
These can hardly exist unless we make definitions about as few points as
possible and leave many questions to individual judgement. Numerous
problems are now postponed till the oecumenical Council. It would be
much better to put off such questions till the time when the glass shall
"be removed and the darkness cleared away, and we shall see God face to"
face.'
'There are sanctuaries in the sacred studies which God has not willed
"that we should probe, and if we try to penetrate there, we grope in ever"
"deeper darkness the farther we proceed, so that we recognize, in this"
"manner, too, the inscrutable majesty of divine wisdom and the imbecility"
of human understanding.'
CHAPTER XIV
ERASMUS'S CHARACTER
Erasmus's character: Need of purity and cleanliness--
"Delicacy--Dislike of contention, need of concord and"
"the Germans, in direct contravention of the laws of naval warfare,"
had closed the sinking valve so that the torpedo virtually became a
floating mine.
"In this instance the trick did not avail, for a well-directed shot"
from one of the monitor's quick-firers exploded the war-head and sent
the missile into a thousand fragments.
"""A feeble reply,"" observed Oswestry to Terence. ""These fellows seem"
"afraid to stand to their guns."""
Even as he spoke the air was torn by a terrific salvo of shells from
powerful batteries hitherto well concealed in the dunes. The
"""Sunderland,"" being fairly close, seemed the special mark, for in six"
seconds she received as many direct hits. One of her funnels showed a
jagged gash ten feet in length and was only prevented from toppling
"overboard by the steel-wire guys. A three-pounder gun, that"
"fortunately was not manned, was blown completely from its mountings,"
while the rest of the shells passed clean through the unprotected
"parts of the ship, totally wrecking the ward-room and the stokers'"
mess-deck.
Terence felt a strong desire to make a hasty rush for the shelter of
"the conning-tower, for splinters were flying and wafts of pungent"
"smoke from the hostile shells were drifting over the bridge, but the"
sight of his captain standing cool and collected and without a
vestige of protection tended to restore his confidence.
With unabated fury her guns replied to the German fire. The
"""Sunderland"" proved that she could receive as well as give hard"
knocks.
"formations classified as the Cretaceous system, and which occur"
neither above these formations nor below them. On the basis of
these few fossils we may be confident that the strata in which
they were found in the antarctic region were laid in the same
period of geologic time as were the Cretaceous rocks of the United
States and Canada.
THE RECORD AS A TIME SCALE. By means of the law of included
organisms and the law of superposition the formations of different
countries and continents are correlated and arranged in their
natural order. When the geological record is thus obtained it may
be used as a universal time scale for geological history.
Geological time is separated into divisions corresponding to the
times during which the successive formations were laid. The
"largest assemblages of formations are known as groups, while the"
corresponding divisions of time are known as eras. Groups are
"subdivided into systems, and systems into series. Series are"
"divided into stages and substages,--subdivisions which do not"
concern us in this brief treatise. The corresponding divisions of
time are given in the following table.
STRATA     TIME
Group      Era
System     Period
Series     Epoch
The geologist is now prepared to read the physical history--the
geographical development--of any country or of any continent by
"means of its formations, when he has given each formation its true"
place in the geological record as a time scale.
"The following chart exhibits the main divisions of the record, the"
The text passes on to an enumeration of the case of an ewe giving birth to
more than two lambs. The 'official' interpretations are throughout
"unfavorable[49], and the priests were quite safe in their entries which"
"were purely arbitrary in these cases, since such multiple births never"
occurred. It is worth while to quote these interpretations as an
"illustration of the fanciful factor that, as already indicated, played a"
not insignificant part in the system unfolded.
"If an ewe gives birth to three (lambs), the prosperity of the country"
"will be annulled, but things will go well with the owner of the ewe,"
his stall will be enlarged.
"If an ewe gives birth to three fully developed (lambs), the dynasty"
"will meet with opposition, approach of an usurper, the country will"
be destroyed.
"If an ewe gives birth to four, the land will encounter hostility, the"
"produce of the land will be swept away, approach of an usurper,"
destruction in the land.
"If an ewe gives birth to four fully developed lambs, [locusts (?)]"
will come and [destroy] the country.
"If an ewe gives birth to four, approach of an usurper, the country"
will be destroyed.
"If an ewe gives birth to five, destruction will ravage the country,"
"the owner of the house will die, his stall will be destroyed."
"If an ewe gives birth to five, one with the head of a bull[50], one"
"with a lion-head, one with a jackal-head, one with a dog-head and one"
"Secondly, passages for sheer interest of content, such as the Trial"
"Scene from “The Merchant of Venice,” or the Forest Scene in “As You"
Like It.”
"Thirdly, for dramatic and historical interest, such as, “Men at some"
"time are masters of their fates,” the whole of Mark Antony's speech,"
and the scene with Imogen and her foster-brothers in the Forest.
It may not be wholly out of place to add here that the children learned
"and repeated these passages themselves, and that I offered them the"
same advice as I do to all Story-tellers. I discussed quite openly
"with them the method I considered best, trying to make them see that"
simplicity of delivery was not only the most beautiful but the most
"effective means to use; and, by the end of a few months, when they"
"had been allowed to experiment and express themselves, they began"
"to see that mere ranting was not force, and that a sense of reserve"
power is infinitely more impressive and inspiring than mere external
presentation.
"I encouraged them to criticise each other for the common good, and"
"sometimes I read a few lines with over-emphasis and too much gesture,"
"which they were at liberty to point out, so that they might avoid the"
same error.
A very good collection of poems for this purpose of narrative is to be
found in:
"Mrs. P. A. Barnett's series of _Song and Story_,"
Published by A. and C. Black.
And for older children:
acts (or legislation) we destroy the very tracts we have improved.
"The Indian must ultimately be merged into the body politic, as has been"
"affirmed. But in bringing about this desideratum, it is not necessary to"
crush all happiness out of his life. For fifty years the Indian has
"followed a devious and uncertain trail, in the fond hope that he might"
"reach his journey’s end. If men and women, who through unintentional"
"ignorance have given no heed to the welfare of our red Americans, will"
"interest their Representatives in Congress, and also help to crystallize"
"public opinion against further harmful legislation, it is quite possible"
that the National Commission plan may be carried into effect. After many
"years of study of the subject, I firmly believe that the welfare of the"
Indian depends upon the creation of such a Commission as has been
"indicated—one composed not of those interested in political parties, but"
"on the contrary of competent men who understand Indians and their needs,"
of men who are willing to devote the best years of their lives to
"transforming the rough, uncertain trail along which the Indian has"
"toiled, into a broad highway, upon which the Red Man may safely travel"
to his ultimate destination—the civilized community. And having reached
"the end of his journey, the Indian will live henceforth peacefully, and"
"enjoy to the full the blessings of liberty, equality and justice."

varying in strength. Aconitine often contains a considerable proportion
"of aconite and benzaconine, and so varies in activity, which is a great"
objection to the use of one of the most powerful drugs known.

subcutaneously.
"Actions of aconite, its preparations and derivative are anodynes and"
"sedatives, acting specially on the peripheral endings of the sensory"
"nerves, on the heart and on respiration. Aconite kills by respiratory"
arrest.
Its physiological actions as a cardiac and respiratory sedative renders
it a febrifuge; it is also diaphoretic and diuretic. It is prescribed in
"acute febrile conditions, and in the earlier stages of acute local"
inflammation. It is used topically to relieve pain.
"GENERAL ACTIONS.--Locally applied, in virtue of its action on sensory"
"nerves, aconite produces first irritation, tingling and twitching and"
subsequently numbness and anesthesia. The tincture of aconite is
"rapidly absorbed and quickly passed into the tissues, as is shown by"
the blood of a poisoned dog five minutes after the drug has been
"administered, being transferred into the veins of another dog without"
producing the physiological action of the poison.
TOXIC EFFECTS.--One and one-half drachm of the tincture (equal to about
one drachm of aconite root) is given as the minimum fatal dose for the
"horse, one-half drachm will occasionally cause very serious symptoms and"
where an idiosyncrasy exists as little as fifteen minims will cause
toxic symptoms.
"It causes great muscular weakness, dimness of sight; pupil at first may"
"between 'our apprehension' and 'the perception-of-matter,' the latter"
"being one fact and indivisible, and on no account to be taken as two"
"separate facts or thoughts. The whole point is, that by no possible"
means can the perception-of-matter be divided into two facts or
"existences, as was done by psychology. And Ferrier goes on to point out"
"that this is not a subjective idealism, it is not a condition of the"
"human soul alone, but it 'dwells apart, a mighty and independent"
"system, a city fitted up and upheld by the living God.' And in"
"authenticating this last belief Ferrier calls in internal convictions,"
"'common-sense,' to assist the evidence of speculative reason, where,"
"had he followed more upon the lines of the great German Idealists, he"
might have done without it.
"Now, Ferrier continues, we are safe against the cavils of scepticism;"
the metaphysical theory of perception steers clear of all the
perplexities of representationalism; for it gives us in perception one
"only object, the perception of matter; the objectivity of this _datum_"
keeps us clear from subjective idealism.
"From the perception of matter, a fact in which man merely participates,"
"Ferrier infers a Divine mind, of which perceptions are the property:"
they are states of the everlasting intellect. The exercise of the
senses is the condition upon which we are permitted to apprehend or
"participate in the objective perception of material things. This,"
"shortly, is the position from which he starts."

"purgative, such as linseed or castor oil should be used. The medical"
"value of aloes being large, it is impossible to enumerate all the"
diseases in which it is useful. Externally the tincture of aloes and
"myrrh is sometimes applied as a stimulant to wounds, and powdered aloes"
is mixed with plaster of paris in making splints for dogs to prevent
these animals from biting and tearing them off. Internally aloes should
"be combined with ginger, nux vomica and given in capsule or bolus."

aluminum silicate and iron sulphide. This is roasted and exposed to the
"air, when the sulphur is oxidized into sulphuric acid and combined in"
part with aluminum and iron to form sulphates. The mass is lixiviated
"with water, and aluminum and iron sulphates together with sulphuric acid"
are recovered in solution. The solution is concentrated and to it is
added potassium chloride. The double sulphate of potassium and aluminum
"(alum) is formed, which crystallizes out on cooling, while potassium"
sulphate and ferric chloride remain as by-products. Alum is purified by
recrystallization.
"PROPERTIES.--Large, colorless, octahedral crystals, sometimes modified"
"by cubes or crystalline fragments; without odor, but having a sweetish"
and strongly astringent taste. On exposure to the air the crystals are
liable to absorb ammonia and acquire a whitish coating. Soluble in nine
"parts of water, insoluble in alcohol."
"either of such punishments, at the discretion of the court before"
"which the offender is convicted; and imprisonment, if awarded, may"
be either with or without hard labour: and
(2) Such ship shall be detained until the trial and conviction or
"acquittal of the master or owner, and until all penalties"
"inflicted on the master or owner have been paid, or the master or"
owner has given security for the payment of such penalties to the
"satisfaction of two justices of the peace, or other magistrate or"
magistrates having the authority of two justices of the peace: and
(3) All illegally enlisted persons shall immediately on the
"discovery of the offence be taken on shore, and shall not be"
allowed to return to the ship.

[Sidenote: Penalty on illegal Shipbuilding and illegal Expeditions.]

"Her Majesty, does any of the following acts; that is to say,--"
"(1) Builds or agrees to build, or causes to be built any ship with"
"intent or knowledge, or having reasonable cause to believe that"
the same shall or will be employed in the military or naval
service of any foreign state at war with any friendly state: or
(2) Issues or delivers any commission for any ship with intent or
"knowledge, or having reasonable cause to believe that the same"
shall or will be employed in the military or naval service of any
foreign state at war with any friendly state: or
"21. The following officers, that is to say,--"

"""local authority""; but nothing in this Act contained shall"
derogate from the power of the Court of Admiralty to direct any
ship to be seized or detained by any officer by whom such court
may have power under its ordinary jurisdiction to direct a ship to
be seized or detained.
[Sidenote: Powers of Officers authorised to seize Ships.]
22. Any officer authorised to seize or detain any ship in respect of any
"offence against this Act may, for the purpose of enforcing such seizure"
"or detention, call to his aid any constable or officers of police, or"

OH?
"YOU KNOW, MY DARLING,"

THAT YOU WERE IN THE FELTON APARTMENT AT 8:00.
Y

BUT I DON'T KILL!
I LEAVE HER WHEN SHE TAKE BATH.
"WHEN I COME BACK, I FIND HER DEAD."
"IF YOU WENT AWAY AND CAME BACK, GEORGE,"
HOW DID YOU GET INTO HER APARTMENT?
I USE PASS KEY.
"THE DOOR WAS LOCKED, THEN, HUH?"
YES.
DID ANYONE ELSE IN THE BUILDING HAVE A PASS KEY?
NO.
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL US
THAT SOMEBODY WALKED THROUGH A LOCKED DOOR
AND KILLED MISS FELTON?
I TELL TRUTH.
I DON'T KILL HER.
I FIND HER DEAD.
"ALL RIGHT, PILSKY."
WE'RE GONNA START ALL OVER FROM THE BEGINNING.
HMMM!
SUN'S COMING UP.
NOT FOR THAT OLD BOY.
HE DIDN'T DO IT.
YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T.
4 DAYS AND NO RESULTS.
SOMEBODY HAD TO BE HAULED IN FOR THE HOWLING PUBLIC.
OR THE CRIME COMMISSION.
BUT YOU'LL LET HIM GO BEFORE THE DAY'S OVER.

-You know this isn't cool.
"-Maybe Connie, his wife, will answer."
-You gotta do me a really big favor.
-What's that?
Mike promised to get me money.
I can't get in touch with him--
-That's not how this works.
"-But if I could borrow $20, I promise- l will give him your message."
-l gotta get up. I don't have any money.
-l'm gonna give him your message.
-No.
"No, no, no."
That's not good.
You think I'm only his snitch?
You think that's what I am?
I'm not.

I'm his whore.
-What the hell's going on?

"Hi, Mike."

I have to go somewhere.
Where?

"But, I'll return as soon as possible."
When will you come back?
"We'll give him a name when I get back, okay?"
"When I return, we will give him a beautiful name."
"It's not a dangerous place, right?"
Don't worry.
"I will surely return to your side,"
and our son's side.

- This is Luke.
- Luke.
Nice to finally meet you.
"- So nice to meet you, ma'am."
- Ma'am?
- Missus?
- Claire.
I'm surprised you've come to our home for the first time and you didn't bring anything.
"Tell him he's got to call me, ok?"
"As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. lt's important."
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
-Take this. lt's a couple thousand.
"-Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
-For my mom.
"-Yeah, whatever."
Not here. ln the store on the corner.
"It's swag, so I got it down on the corner."
"Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you."
-Thanks.
-Don't worry.
-l'll try.
-He's got to call me.
Over here?
Right down there.
"It's over there, right on the corner."
"Yeah, it's over there."
Right there.

"I'M SORRY,IT'S THE LARGEST ONE I HAVE."
I WILL NOT BE THE BIG GUY IN THE TINY HAT.
THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS PARTY I'M THROWING
AS HEAD OF THE PARTY PLANNING COMMITTEE.
"THE THEME IS ""NIGHT IN MOROCCO."""
THIS ISN'T YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S CHRISTMAS PARTY.
"UNLESS,OF COURSE, SHE'S FROM MOROCCO,"
IN WHICH CASE IT'S VERY ACCURATE.
"HEY,PHYLLIS,"
DO I NEED THIS INVITE TO GET INTO THE PARTY?
- YES.
- AWESOME.
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS PARTY EVER.
ANGELA...
"YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THIS FOR THE PARTY,RIGHT?"
IT'S NOT OUR THEME.
IT'S THE NATIVITY SCENE.
ALL RIGHT...
"YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CAMEL,"
"- SHEEP,ELEPHANT."
- HEY.
AND THE NORTH AFRICAN KING CAN STAY.
EVERYTHING ELSE GOES IN THE DRAWER.
I AM NOT GONNA JUDGE PHYLLIS FOR DESECRATING CHRISTMAS.
"THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO WILL,THOUGH."
AND PHYLLIS JUST STUFFED HIM INTO A DRAWER.
I NEED YOU TO GET RID OF THE TREE.
- BUT--
"Oh, good God, Ross."
"Nick at Nite, once in a while."
"All right, I'm going."
Bye.
"Phoebe, will you wait here?"
-I wanna get your opinion on something.
-Yeah.
How does Mona feel about Rachel moving in?
I'm on my way to tell her.
"She's been away all week, but she'll be cool."
She's been so supportive.
"She even got the baby a T-shirt that says ""Fossils are my friends."""
"Come on, Mona."
Don't kiss ass.
So I'm gonna take off.
"Oh, shoot!"
"Oh, shoot!"
Rachel wanted to see this tape.
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.
Could you take it to your apartment?
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
"Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter."
The father's name is also Cookie.
Why am I friends with these people?
"Phoebe, come here."
I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
"Monica, grow up."
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.
"NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE,"
STAY IN THE CAR UNTIL I SAY.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
WHERE'S YOUR SON?
WHERE'S JASPER?
"LOOK,THIS IS ABOUT ME."
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
JUST DON'T GO AFTER MY SON.
YOU PEOPLE KILLED MY WIFE.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?
THE BASIC RULE OF COVERT OPS
IS LET SOMEONE ELSE DO YOUR DIRTY WORK.
LET SOMEONE ELSE FIND THE GUY YOU WANT TO KILL.
IT'S A GREAT TECHNIQUE
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT THE SOMEONE ELSE.

Don't cause any more trouble.
We don't want to bring you in again if we don't have to.

Huh?

You say it to my face!

Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.

Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
"We all spend so much time, energy AND money in an effort to look our best."

Hello.
"Hello, Rose, it's Alex."
Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?
"Oh, I'm okay, I'm... trying to get on with my life, ya know."
"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."

Nai would what to say to you right now.
"I can't talk to her, though."
"I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore."
Exactly.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"I'm so sorry, daddy."
Hi.
Hi.
Nice shoes.
I hate talking about shoes with you.
I...
I hate that at's all we talk about.
I miss you.
I... where are you?
"Where... where did you go, Addison?"
"Like I said, nice shoes."
You came.
"No, wait."
I...
I need you to listen.
Just listen?
Um...
I want to be a good mother.
"I want to be a good mother so badly,"
"And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel..."
Uh...
Katie stole something from me.
"She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back."
"But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?"
Okay.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."
Hello.
I'm Victoria Chase.
This is Dr. Lori Hernandez.
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.
Likewise.
"I'm sorry for staring, but I'm just surprised at how well you look."
"Oh, thank you, but I'm tired."
So very tired.
Please sit.
I know that I need to.
"Hmm, that's very odd."
What?
You're not limping at all.
Limping?
"- Excuse me, Jesse."
I've got to run.
- Have a great day.
"- Have yourself a ""morning air"" day."
- I will.
Filthy rich.
Let's call a spade a spade and a chicken a chicken.
"Julie, call me the minute that Peter Rickman is out of the OR."
- The very minute.
"- Yes, Dr. James."
Perhaps you can get me an update on Hook's progress.
"Yes, Dr. James."
"Okay, Elmer, there it is."
A three-pound universe.
What do you know?
Go back to sleep.
Elmer.
That nurse down there is no longer dancing to the sound of the Big Brass Band.
"Would you mind squirreling her away in a corner, please?"
Thank you.
What the hell did you just do?
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
I'm just the dog.
Hook.
Yeah.
"Just slow down, Otto."
I'm on my way.
"Mrs. Rickman, I assure you..."
- Are you my husband's doctor?
- That would be Hook.
He was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
Good!
# This is Flora's holiday... #
Yes!
# This is Flora's holiday. #
"Good night, Mr Kirkby."
Night.
I'm meeting my dad.
See you!
"See you, Hewitt."
"We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby."
"Are you all right, Mr Kirkby?"
It's this leg.
Gets bad in the cold.
Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.
I'm always carrying coal and spuds and that for Mam.
"Come on, Tubby!"
Hello!
"Oh, you came."
"Pauline, this is Tubby."
"You remember, I told you."
Did you hear about Mr. Rossi.
"-No, what?"
-He's leaving town.
-Leaving?
"-Well, not really leaving."
They're trying to make him principal of a high school in Portland.
-Are you sure?
-Of course.
I got it first hand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Miss Thornton."
I suppose that's first hand.
I guess we won't be able to keep him here.
-This is nice.
Can I try it on?
"-Sure, come on."
-Merry Christmas.
-Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time and it is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
-Let me take your coat.
-I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
-Can I fix you a drink?
"-No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ls it really true that you might go to Portland?"
I received the offer.
"It's a larger school and, naturally, more money."
"I, on the other hand, am a person."
I do what I want.
I take what I want.
I don't have to answer to nobody.
Everybody answers to somebody.
"You answer to Waltzer,"
Waltzer answers to Jerry the Pope.
"Oh, oh, you think so, huh?"
Yeah.
"Waltzer steals from Jerry, I steal from Waltzer."
"They think that this is their turf, but they're wrong."
This all belongs to me.
I'm the man.
"Yeah... you're the man, Cash."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Yeah, and the man's got to go out."
Don't neither of yous two move until I get back.
I am a person.
I'm a human being.
Yeah.
T ell the asshole I'm borrowing his car.
"Hey, you can't do that, V."
"Oh, yes, I can."
Didn't your mothers tell you not to play in the rain?
Bye.
Thanks.
Thank you.
See you guys.

Yep.

I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Evenin', Lyle."
I knew the German girl worked at the lodge.
That's why I called Greg.
"I didn't want to bother you, sir."
You-
"- You told him that, didn't you, Greg?"
Yeah.
"Uh, Dad wanted to come."
I insisted.
Hilla was one of my best employees.
Melvin.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Uh, she's back here."
Oh.
You were close?
Uh--
Yeah.
We were friends.
"I-- Ah, he's a good-looking kid."
Lots of girls at the lodge have their eye on him.
"Suck it up, Greg."
[ Chuckles ] Kid's got his mother's stomach.
Seems like there was more to it than that.
Her name's Hilla.
Hilla Danner.
I hired her as a desk clerk at the beginning of the season.
"She, uh, have any family?"
I believe they were all killed during the war.
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to bury her in potter's field."
I'll pay for it.
"Well, that's real nice of you, sir."
"Yes, much is found!"
"Give it to Brother Lone, it's very important!"
Greet Brother Lone.
Brother Lone.
I heard steps.
And it's far away...
"It's late, Brother Lone, let's call it a day."
Wait for me.
Super swords and capital chopper.
I can tell it's a trap.
The prosecutor is cocky!
Who the hell is he?
A very sharp-tongued lawyer.
"What a co-incidence, he is Ho Chun's boss, named Ho Chung."
Who is his boss then?
"His dad, Ho Sai."
Ho Sai?
"He is a rich merchant, and is the council member."
He owns many properties in Western District.
Sai?
"Yes, Sai."
"Hearing this word ""Sai"", I..."
Did it ring your bell?
"Right, because I remember Foon has..."
What?
"A piece ofjade which the word ""Sai"" is carved."
"Maybe, there is another story."
"This may be related to the poor orphan, Ho Foon."
Wu Man.
Hubby.
Do you know anything about Ho Sai?
"He is a Catholic, a righteous man."
Here.
You okay?
"I'll call the ambulance, okay?"
Mary.
"- Yeah, hey, this is Detective Ben Wesley."
- Help me.
Help me.
I need an ambulance to 1287 Monument Drive.
"Yeah, male, 40s, gunshot wound to the chest."
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
And then he pinned me down and shot me with pento.
"And I really thought, ""This is it."""
"And it's true, you know, that cliche?"
Your life really does flash before your eyes.
And then you were there.
"Uh, look, we can take it from here."
We'll get the results back shortly.
Okay.
I'm glad you're okay.
"Am I okay, Ben?"
Ma'am.
I'm here to take you home.
"Yeah, wait, you sure you don't need to go to a hospital?"
I'm sure.
"I'm a doctor, remember?"
Yeah.
"Grady's gun is a 9-mil, same as the bullet we found in Sid Thomas-Haye."
"Yeah, we're gonna have ballistics compare."
It's right here.
"Oh, here it is."
Here it is.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
- What are you doing?
- You want it?
There's the medicine.
That's why I wanna go as far away as I can.
I can't save you.
I can't watch you go do this over and over and over again.
"- Oh, no."
"No, no..."
- It's just...
I can't.
"Every time I think you're going to get better, you don't."
- It's too much.
"- No, wait."
Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
"Oh, no, look, they're all over the..."
I'm gonna get them.
I'm gonna get all the pills.
I'm gonna pick them all up.
Every single one.
"I'm getting them all picked up, and then..."
And then...
And then...
"Here, you hold them for me."
"You hold them for me, honey."
That's good.
Okay.
"I'm gonna get them, and I'm gonna take all my pills."
Da Ran...
It's me.
Yoon Jae...
I...
"I was so very, very worried!"
I felt like this all happened because I got angry and threw a fit...
I was so very worried because I thought it was all my fault!
Because I...
Because I needlessly said those words...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
The words I was going to say to you...
I'll say them now.
Ppuing-ppuing.
"I'm sorry, ppuing-ppuing!"
He's not coming back.
"I'm saying, he didn't come back."
I'm Kang Gyung Joon!
Your face looks very disappointed.
Hello?
Teacher Gil.
Get your senses back.
Where are we right now?
Does this...
All seem like a child's joke to you right now?
Is it fun?
Why is an adult crying at a child's joke?
Being fooled by a kid like you...
I'm the one at fault.
Is it my fault that we didn't switch back?
Why is she getting mad at me?
Where are my belongings?
"Oh, he's already left for work."
I hear him go 7:40 on the dot every morning.
Oh.
Does he live on his own?

You bet he does.

So there was someone in here?
"It's not secure, that's all I'm saying."
The other day you said you thought she might have been killed.
I said I wasn't ruling it out.
"Got me thinking, though."
Hmm?
What if it was someone from here?
From one of the flats?
Why would one of her neighbours want to kill her?
Bye-bye now.

Psst!
Hey!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?
"- Minny, no."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, not really."
But listen.
"I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar."
I'm being held against my will.
"I need you to call my team, so they can come rescue me and get me to California in time for me to win the Piston Cup."
Understand?
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"No, it's the truth!"
I'm telling you!
You gotta help me!
Don't leave me here!
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!
I'm becoming one of them!
"OK, don't worry."
They know where we are now.
They'll tell friends.
You'll see.
We'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...
- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.
Still no sign of Lightning McQueen.
Chick arrived in California and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.
"Karen, that was worth $60,000!"
I need that money!
That's all we got!
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to!
They were going to find it!
-They wouldn't have found it!
-They would have!
I swear!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that?
"Oh, my God!"
-l had to do it.
"-Oh, my God!"
No!
"Paulie, I'm really sorry."
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
"I can be trusted now, Paulie. I'm clean."
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"Paulie, after what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
How do you f eel?
Better.

Good evening.
"From New York City,"
I'm Dan Rydell alongside Casey McCall.
"Bats and balls, balls and strikes -- let's play ball."
It's time for spring training.
"You hear that, gentlemen?"
This is the sound of opportunity knocking.
Don't be slow to answer the door.
J.D. :
I still can't believe you did it.
His name is Vito Corleone.
We'll send him olive oil from here.
To his company in America.
"They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio."
"We'd like your blessing, and your permission to start work."
Where is this young man from New York?
Have him come closer.
I can't see him so good.
"My respects, Don Ciccio."
Give me your blessing.
Bless you!
What's your name?
You took the name of this town!
And what's your father's name?
His name was...
Antonio Andolini.
"Louder, I don't hear so good."
My father's name was Antonio Andolini and this is for you!
"Michael, say goodbye."
"Hi, Al."
"Can I speak with you for a second, Tom?"
"Tom, where's Mike?"
Waiting for you to leave.
-Can I talk with him?
"-Sorry, Fredo."
No chance.
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.
"Michael, it's Connie."
Michael...
"I'd like to stay close to home now, if it's all right."
Is Kay coming?
Let's get you outta here.
- You good?
-Yeah.
(COCKS GUN)
Stop.
Let him go.
"Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?"
"Once a stiff, always a stiff."
(GUNFIRE)
Go!
"Four, how did you get past security?"
FOUR:
You know me.
Scary boyfriend skills.
What is it?
You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.
"Tris, we need to leave now, all right?"
"I'm sorry, Four."
What?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was gonna go.
I wanted to say goodbye and I just didn't know how.
I didn't know how.
What are you talking about?
So even though I didn't get to say it in real life at least I get to say it now.
Even if it is just in the sim.
"Tris, we're not in a sim."
Don't you think I'd know if I was in a sim?
"Four, you're not in a sim."
You are the sim.
"Wait, wait."
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
I can see you're attaching electrodes to the boy's chest.
What are those for?
"- What are those for, Dr. Ross?"
- Patch me through to County.
Dr. Ross has just asked me to patch him through to County General.
- You need a red key.
- Look out for the Lost Soul.
- Use the rocket launcher.
- Mount Sinai's shooting us.
- They're cheaters!
Get them!
- You do it!
- I need a bulletproof vest.
- Blast him with a BFG 9000!
"Look, his guts are all over the place!"
"Quiet, you guys."
This is County General.
Go ahead.
This is Chopper Five from Channel Five News.
We've got a Dr. Ross flying in a hypothermic kid.
- Doug Ross?
- That is correct.
"Hold on, Chopper Five."
"Mark, Doug is on a news chopper bringing in a hypothermic kid."
- What?
- It's on the MICN.
- What's he doing on a news chopper?
"- Look, there's Dr. Ross."
- Turn up the volume.
- Where's the remote?
"Doug, do you read me?"
"- Mark, is that you?"
I am king.
IMANDINKA GROWLSI
Do you realize that you came this close to hitting me out there?
"Gosh, Ed."
I'm sorry.
"-I'm really miffed, Alan."
-My mind wasn't on it.
I was thinking about that Donahue Show I gotta do tomorrow.
He's ruthless.
Ed.
Ed....
BILLIE:
"No, I don't want-"
- No--
-Just look at him.
"When they dragged him out, his face looked like a pizza."
"Come on, come on, he's right over here."
"Look at him, he's fine."
Hi. toots.
-Hey. you're not allowed in here.
-We've got passes.
-We're looking for Bull Shannon.
-Who?
He's a big guy.
Kind of weird-looking.
"All right, let's have your attention."
"Gents and ladies, meet the next wrestling champion of the world."
IWHININGI Hey. you promised me I'd be champ next.
"Don't get bitchy, Ed."
[NORMAL VOICE] I'm sorry.
I've been on the edge lately.
This new fabric softener isn't working out at all.
Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?
"-Yeah, let's do that."
-Okay.
"And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie."
Okay?
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, Rags."
"We'll have a good day, yeah?"
"You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like."
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's okay."
"Well, thank you very much but why on earth would I wanna bring Burke on your birthday?"
"Well, you like him."
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
What is this?
"-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?"
"-Oh, my God."
Are you kidding?
-What?
-Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Of course I like him.
"I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one."
You don't like him like Daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I guess that must be you.
OK...
Action!
"Girl, the kid's pretty messed up."
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
"To which, she replies,"
"""I'm Rose."
This is Nancy.
"The Nancy."" To which you say..."
Rose.

"They're always going to be like that, aren't they?"
"Younger, in awe of you."
Like I was?
Aw!
Cmon Cat.
You had a choice.
You didn't choose me.
I'll come back in a few days and we'll mend things.
Oh!
For God's sake.
Across the street?
That's where I was born.
Salute.
Kid got a nice mother?
"She's the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever known."
Why?
"Well, 'cause daddy ain't gonna live long drinking like that."
"Hey, don't even talk to me like that, man."
"It's a celebration tonight, and I don't need to hear that."
Robbie.
"Hey, Sonny."
"Tell me, boy or girl?"
I got a son.
"That's great, man."
Let's go see the family.
Why don't you have a drink with me first?
The doc wants them to rest up for a little while.
Everything okay?
Everything's all right.
"Julia, she's just knocked out, though."
She was in labor for 15 hours.
You're kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
How's the kid?
How's the kid?
He's great.
Black Jack.
That's terrific.
How much did he weigh?
"Eight pounds, six-and-a-half ounces."
Wow!
You got yourself a big boy.
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time.
"Or a light, or whatever."
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tonnes.
I'd better save some for Manuela.
You OK?
I feel a bit...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can you...stop the car.
Stop the car.
"""It's done."""
Are either of the kid's fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abby's dad sends money in a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know?"
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe anywhere.
I'll need it for the beach.
"'This is freedom, isn't it?"
I'm a good girl!
I went to Catholic school!
"Okay, well, it's getting late."
This was terrific.
You win.

What did you say to Gus?
Because he's on to us.
Yeah.
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us?
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.
"-Lie still, kid."
Lie still;
Not while I'm still breathing in and out.
Lying still comes later.
"Not much later, though, huh, doc;"
"Hello, sheriff."
Somebody left a note for you.
Right side of you.
Brock.
"Your sister sends her love, son."
Good girl.
"Good, bright girl."
"She told me, Brock."
She told me why you ducked out.
"And, Brock, your mother..."
-...there's something--
"-Dad, let's go down to Charley's, huh;"
Let's drink all the boys under the table.
"And then when there's just me and you left, I'll drink you under."
Ask Charley.

How's the investigation?
Found the Scorpion Yong?
"If he didn't attack us, we wouldn't have lost to him."
I find it strange.
Like someone is leading us in circle.
Does that tattoo guy really exist?
"That message from Lo Keung, is it real?"
What good is it to Lo?
He got us to meet Scorpion Yong.
To have him kill us.
Okay.
Someone's pulling the strings to do it to us.
Good partners.
"I'm hungry, let's eat first."
Waiter!
"Michael, how did you piss off Scorpion Yong?"
What?
He's bringing his men come to you.
How does he know I am here?
"You can pay me, so can he."
How do you know where I am?
Your Lamborghini is hard to miss.
This is my favour to you.
Run now.
"Me and my brother's daddy was white, did you know that?"
"Of course, we never knew him."
He had another family.
That's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.
"You figured since I kind of look white, you could fuck me, what the hell."
"Because I was kind of black you could dump me, what the hell."
211 to 210.
211 to 210.
211 to 210.
"Dale, where are you at?"
"Hey, June."
Juney!
How are you doing?
You got something for me?
"Hi, Mr. Charlie."
Is this Ronnie?
"Ronnie, this is Ray."
Is Fantasia there?
"Yeah, Lila."
Where is she?
Have you got a number out there for her?
"Give it to me, all right?"
Ronnie!
"Ronnie, come here."
-Come here.
-I got to go.
"If you know something about Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen."
I don't want you being in trouble.
"No, ma'am."
I don't know nothing about that.
June Hawkins told me he was out last night digging frogs.
- What kind do you want?
- Mink.
You'll take rabbit and like it.
And that's no...
Am I aggrieved.
"Well, better luck next time."
Mm.
What lovely weather we're having.
"Excuse me, I've gotta see a patient."
- Taxi?
- Uh...
"No, no, uh..."
That dame just dropped this purse.
"- Well, I'll see that she gets it."
"- Uh-uh, uh-uh."
Ha-ha.
"No, I think she'd like me to have it."
[BUZZES]
What is it?
"Yeah, you're the doll."
You dropped this in the Randolph Hotel.
"- I tried to catch you, but you were too fast."
"- Oh, thank you."
I didn't miss it until I got home.
I wondered where I lost it.
"Won't you, uh, come in a minute?"
[CHUCKLES]
Who could say no?
"Oh, it's all there."
All I wanted was the card.
I didn't mean it that way.
"I was looking for a reward for you, but I'm afraid I haven't got enough."
- Do you guys remember?
- He did.
That was uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
On-stage.
"- But I stopped it, didn't I?"
- There we go.
"- Yeah, he was trying to get me back..."
"Oh, my gosh."
"- But, Mike, I averted your..."
"- Yeah, you did."
We were on stage doing a QA in Toronto and Rafi said:
"""Mike, sing that song that you always sang to me on set."""
And he was getting me back because of this prank we had played on him in Toronto.
He was getting you back for the $20 prank?
"Yes, exactly."
"Oh, I felt..."
I was really...
That was not a good moment.
"And he looked at me, like, the most sadistic look."
"Well, and then he got his, like, Rafi little-kid thing of like:"
"""Mike, you did it to me."""
Hilarious.
"And then I played, like, mom."
I was mom there.
"I was like, ""No."
"Michael does not do it."""
"- Yeah, that was nice."
- Here we go.
Bishop Allen.
"Oh, Mike."
"Oh, yeah, here we go."
Huh ?
"Oh, yeah, whatever."
"I mean, sure, if you want to."
We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport.
First would be...
Luke at Holly's beach house.
"Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
Right.
At the diner.
"Yeah, and again at the mall."
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.
"Yeah, in T.J."
"Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic ?"
"Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away ?"
Hmm.
"Well, we have checked everywhere else."
Light.
Be careful.
Oh... gross.
It's okay.
What is that ?
That's Uncle Alistair.
That's your uncle ?
Yeah.
No.
"It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school."
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.
"God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
Okay.
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
What were you aiming for?
"Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
Are we OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"I mean, we had the talk, right?"
"It's just that every time you look at me, it's like you want to run away."
"Nah, no, no way!"
"Or if I do, it's just 'cause I'm busy."
"You know, I got places to be, stuff to do, you know, just like you."
"OK, well, as long as we're cool."
Cool as a...
Cool thing.
Look at them all.
They think I killed her.
Nobody thinks that.
Do they Fiona?
'Course not.
Terrible news.
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way!
Here I come!
Here I come!
"Hey, look, its lasers light up."
"Take that, Zurg!"
"Quick, make a space."
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
"Come on down, guys!"
It's time for games!
We've got prizes!
-What is it?
-Can you see it?
-What the heck is up there?
"-Woody, who's up there with ya?"
Woody?
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'.
Nothin'.
"I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all."
"Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose."
It's just a mistake!
"Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody."
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
"Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome."
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
"Come in, Star Command."
"Star Command, come in."
-Oh my God.
Mom says we should pull ourselves.
It can also ye are not.
It's crisis.
"Lars, you must talk to her."
"I've tried, but she is furious because we conducted the tour."
But you must have the agreement.
Lars.
"I have not seen him in 20 years, since the trial."
So he stands here.
Totally sick.
You just do not let her run over you.
Not this time.
-No.
She takes well to mind.
"Yeah, talk to her."
-Hey it's me.
-I do not know if I want to talk.
-How did it go with Tim?
-It goes well good with him.
He spoke to me twice without screaming.
"Angie, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry I went.
-Are you all right?
You were right.
It was a bad idea to come here.
-Has Something happened?
No.
I'm going home soon.
We can do as you said.
I might take me a little time off from work.
Maybe we can go somewhere.

I want him to go!

Then I won't worry.
Why don't you dance with me?
-Any reason why I should?
-Any reason why you shouldn't?
No.
You're a very nice girl.
And I'll thank you to remember it.
-What's your name?
-Rosa Senta.
-Italian?
"- No, ma'am, i'm not here to take anything."
I'm here to bring something back.
Just sign right here and i'll bring it in.
I don't have any money.
I didn't order anything.
You of all people should know that.
"Ma'am, it's already been taken care of."
Just sign and i'll bring the stuff in.
"It's got my name and address on it, baby."
"Well, bring it on."
"All right, fellas, move it in."
Come on.
- What?
- What is this?
"Oh, it's your furniture."
Oh my goodness.
How did this happen?
- Who did...
"Mama, thank you."
"- Oh, i didn't do it,"
But i'll take the hug.
I need one about now.
"Mama, this is all our furn..."
"Marcus, you did this."
"Baby, thank you."
"Sorry, babe, i wish i could take the credit,"
But i didn't have anything to do with it.
"Well, then who did this?"
How did this happen?
"It was me, mama."
- Monica?
- You?
"Rose, I'm his only chance."
Let's go.
- You workin' with the feds?
- No.

- No.
You're alone.
Let's go.

Get down.
"- Oh, shit."
- And stay down.
Shit.
"Bill, where are you?"
"Bill, if you read, we're going back to the station."
You gonna keep me in here?
You gonna keep me in here with cuffs?
"- You don't know what you're doing, do you?"
- Shut up.
"You don't have a clue as to what the fuck is going on, do you, Sheriff?"
"Bill, do you copy?"
"Bill, do you read?"
"- It's just club soda, Freddy."
- Finish it.
"- Hey, Ray."
"- Hey, Freddy."
I came to tell you I found Superboy... and I'm bringing him in tomorrow morning... and I'd like you to come with me.
I owe you that much.
"He's a fugitive, Ray, and he's convinced you're tryin' to kill him."
"Just tell me where he is, Freddy."
- You be easy now.
"Yeah, man, take it easy."
"My God, Miller."
I don't know where to begin.
"Nah, don't sweat it, kid."
There is nothing to say.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
"Well, for starters, you can give me your left arm."
"In fact, that is why I came by here today."
"Isn't it, Tucker?"
Fair is fair.
"We are just razzing you, kid."
"You keep your left arm, I will keep my settlement."
Hell!
I've heard these guys who'd give his arm and a leg to get a deal like this.
"So, I guess you can call me lucky."
"Well, Miller, if there is anything I can do..."
"Nah, forget it."
No hard feelings.
"I'll see you around, pal."
Hey!

Hey!
Hey!

"Hey, what's up ?"
"Look, we were just dancing."
"And what, her ass just happened to fall into your hands ?"
"No, it was-"
"- You were dancing with Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki."
The music was going and-- l thought we were having a good time.
Look.
There's nothing between me and Nikki anymore.
"Yes, I'm fine."
"Well, I'll just visit the powder room."
Of course.
You sure Mrs McCarthy's in danger?
George may well have poisoned Henry to stop him revealing that he killed Vera Blanchett.
And if George did that to Henry...
Exactly.
"Oh, that looks lovely."
I've taken the liberty of pouring you some wine.
Oh!
Why not?
"Here's to you, Bridget, and to Henry."
Of course.
To poor Henry.
"Oh, It's quite sharp."
Maybe even a little bitter.
Try the fish.
Yes.
Mrs McCarthy.
What are you...
George.
What on earth is going on?

I'm afraid there has been a fire at St Mary's.
A fire!
"Now, the Fire Brigade have it under control, Mrs McCarthy, but I need you to go back with Sid and sort out a few things."
But I haven't even started my dinner.
I'm so sorry.
"But all things considered, I think we've had a lucky escape."
Right.
Shall we?
"The Rolls, Mrs M?"
Is that her mother?
I say yes.
And who's that Ghena?
Why does it smell of wine here?
What wine?
We had a drink with Mashka.
Today is her birthday.
We went to a cafe with the girls.
One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us.
"You do remember Mashka, don't you?"
"We came with her last year, remember?"
A little blond one.
- What have you got on your head?
- Grandma's present.
Take it off.
Grandma's present is for winter.
Go to your room.
Get away from the jam with your spoon!
Go to your room!
Lay off me!
"Oh, what great caviar I cooked!"
"Taste it, daughter."
I don't want it now.
"- Taste it now, I said!"
"- Come on, mama..."
Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose?
Is it really big?
That's how they joke now.
I wish you heard what she says to me.
And who is that Ghena?
Ghena is my colleague.

Better not let my husband hear that.
I don't care if he hears it.
Will you do it for me?
Okay.
How much you gonna pay?
- Fifty dollars an hour.
- Fifty an hour?
I'll do it... 200.
[Cloudy] Nah.
Can't afford it.
I'll call you later.
All right.
Bye-bye.
"Hey, it's 1:30."
I didn't expect you till 2:00.

"I mean, I'll absolutely own it."
"They'r e both very nice and very f unny, and they like you a lot, J.J."
That's good.

Absolutely sur e.

"Greg, she forced you to walk her to her car."
You missed the birth of our firstborn.
"I did, but I saw the sheets."
Put a fun spin on it.
"You're a pervert, Sid."
You need to get help.
I know.
"Right, we have a big case to solve, something you're not going to have to worry about now, eh?"
No.
Big cases and police work.
"Sleet, don't say that."
I'm really bad at breaking bad news.
"Yeah, yeah, no fucking joke!"
That's why I thought I'd get you to do it.
"Yeah, really fucking funny!"
"OK, I, I'm sorry, Sid."
"Be careful, yeah?"
Are we going now?
"Yeah, we go."
Come on.
"We'll just leave him here, he'll be fine."
Good luck.

"Bye, Sid."
Sorry.

Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby... died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."

He's dead.

"Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin."
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
"Okay, you got my attention."

- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.

What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
Hi Zeke.
Hello young lovers.
I got to get back to class.
See you back in class...
Striktly hands of Bro.
"Zeke, I wouldn't do that."
She's just my friend.
You wouldn't?
That's what best-buds do don't they?
Yeah!
I can think about a dozen times...
-
I have been the best friend you ever have.
"Saved your ass, lie for you, stolen for you."
"Zeke, I am telling you."
Nothing is going on.
So we are on the same page?
Yeah.
"Ok, come on, let's hang out."
I steal 6 packs of beer how does that sound?
"Tonight, me and you we are going to the movies."
Leo is in a new movie.
You got to see it.
"I can't, I have to work tonight."
Why do you work in that awful place?
"I need the money, I have to save up to college."
"Alright, whatever."
I ask Mimi to go with me.
"Ok, see you later."
Bye!
All hands on deck.
Jake?
They've got a gym...
"Come on, Mom."
Please.
This is ridiculous.
It's what I chose to do.
I'm going to find a place soon.
- And you really think you can start over?
- You mean at my age?
"- Yes, yes I do."
"- I'm still breathing, aren't I?"
I'm still here.
It's a long time ago.
Daddy'll understand.
"No, that's..."
That's not the point of this.
You've been together since college.
Yup.
And do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
- I don't think that's true.
"- Well, I've just kept it from you."
"Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions."
Really?
I'm sorry.
You make this difficult because you want it that way.
Men are easy.
"And you've been with Michael, what,"
"- three years, right?"
- Yeah.
And it took me less than half an hour to figure him out.
- Wow.
"Oh, you're lucky."
Jeez.
- It's gonna happen.
I can feel it.
- Shut up.
You're gonna jinx it.
"Please, God, if you give us a snow day,"
I promise I'll be a good boy for the rest of my life.
"...Abington High closed, Germantown West closed,"
William Penn Academy... open.
- Balls!
- Why?
!
I'm back to being a bad boy.
"This is on you, Mother Nature."
"Sadly, we were that one school that never closed for snow."
"Abington High closed,"
- Germantown West closed...
"- Please, please, please."
Say it.
"Say ""closed."""
"I will fist-punch the radio if you don't say ""closed."""
...William Penn Academy open.
- Balls!
Balls!
- I hate everything!
I'm a man of my word!
Ow!
"Every time, it was the same heartbreak... until the snow gods finally showed mercy."
William Penn Academy... closed.
"Am I still asleep, or did he just say William Penn is closed?"
"He said ""closed."" School is closed."
This is the best day of my life!
I feel so alive!
Or just hitting Mike.
- It's like hitting a puppy.
You cannot...
- But we were in character.
"I know, but..."
It would have been so Of Mice and Men.
I didn't do it.
But back to the Denzel story somebody thought Michael was Denzel.
Did you ever think that maybe Denzel was just standing behind you?
- We looked to make sure.
- They were looking at me.
"I looked around for Denzel, because I love Denzel."
- But there is no Denzel.
"- No, it was me."
Did we have any celebrity sightings on the shoot?
- I don't...
"- Wait, wait."
"Yeah, we..."
"Oh, God."
"Well, now I forget."
"Remember there was a guy near Don Hill's who was crossing the street and I was like, ""That's the guy from..."""
Really?
"He's in a band, remember?"
He's handsome.
- Was it Mayim Bialik?
- I forget.
- Maybe.
- Mayim Bialik.
- Could be.
- I love Mayim Bialik in Blossom.
I don't remember.
"Mayim Bialik was, like, head of a Yiddish singing group."
"- Let's get him out, okay?"
"- Please, please, get me out of here!"
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build....
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?
Yeah.
"You gotta watch, because when it rains, the water comes up really quick."
"Joey, listen to me."
You go find a phone.
You call 911.
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
"All right, Joey?"
Go!
Go!
"- Well, where's he going?"
"- Well, this grate is locked."
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.
Just don't!
"Ben, listen to me."
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise you that.
"But you gotta do me a favor, okay?"
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?
What'd he say?
"The guywho burned you... turns outyou don't need to go up there to see him, 'cause... well, he's coming down here to seeyou."
See me?
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
Just a heads-up.
Well...
- looks like I'm gonna have to get the Charger fixed after all.
- Yeah.

"...FAMILY, TOO..."
IS THAT YOUR MOM AGAIN?
...IF YOU'RE DESPERATE.
SOMEONE NEEDS YOUR HELP.
BOTTOM LINE -
Yeah.
"Yeah, it really is."
No.
Mom...
"Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
Do you mind being my friend instead?
"So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
We can still play ping-pong together.
Come on.
"You know, I let you win."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
In your dreams.
You ever see that movie Casablanca?
No.
It goes like this:
"Peanut, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady."
Oh!
"I can't believe this, I didn't win."
Shocking.
"Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding."
Would anyone like seconds?
"Yeah, I would."
"Yeah, me, too."
Thank you.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie.
Hey...
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid.
It's been a long time since I've done that.
Tell me that's her.
- Because they were laughing.
- I drew a sketch for you.
"This one is a 2CV, with round headlights on the hood."
And the Dyane 6 has them built in.
It was more like this one.
The Dyane 6.
- Who are they?
- Pickers.
Here for the harvest.
He's from the town.
They know him.
Could be a picker who comes every year.
Or someone who works at the fair.
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.
- And gray.
It's a common car.
- Excuse me.
Someone wants to talk to you.
"Angelita is psychic, she sees stuff."
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother the last two nights.
And she said... she saw the girls at the abandoned farmhouse.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.

"-Cora, how much we pay last guy?"
-Eight dollars.
-And you promised him....
-Eight dollars.
"Room, board and you say you like my wife's cooking."
-Your wife?
"-Oh, sure."
"Tell you what, Nick."
I got to track my guy down in L.A.
"If it don't pan out, I take you up on it."
"Well, okay."
If we still got it.
And I'll send you some money in any case for the breakfast.
"-Oh, yeah."
Do that.
-Okay.
"Thanks a lot, Nick."
"Goodbye, now."
Missus.
Be right with you there.
"Here's a change, 20 cents."
Thank you very much.
"What you need, Mr. Papadakis, is more coverage."
I hadda lass year.
"Last year you had fire, theft, no liability."
So what I need it now for?
"Well, you should've had it then."

"No, I'm sorry."
There's no grease onna floor.
"-No, I'm just sayin' suppose."
-No.
"Everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum!"
"Mate, I'm not joking."
"I was on the dancefloor, this tune was playing."
I had my hand up both of their skirts at the same time.
It was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep!
"Very suave, man, very suave."
"Oh, mate, that will be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening."
But without wanting to give the game completely away...
"They're twins, they're from Macedonia and"

"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
I'm not staying here.
He's an idiot.
That's a bit harsh.
Granted he's no Steven Hawking.
"John mate, don't be like that."
"Don't John mate me, please."
I'm not staying here.
You don't want to live with him?

President Raphelson has ordered an air strike..
"on the White House, and I can hear the planes coming."
L..
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
"Delta 26, requesting permission to deliver payload."
"Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear."
"All right, guys, let's clean it up."
"Delta 26, we're locked on target."
Please confirm Free Castle is a go.
"Raptor Alpha 1, clear."
Mission is a go.
"Delta 26, we have friendlies all over the kill zone."
"I cannot see the planes, but what I can see is an unbelievable sight."
"Emily Cale is out on the lawn, and she's waving the presidential flag."
"No, baby."
"No, I told you to run!"
You gotta run!
"Captain, do you see this?"
"Delta 26, we have a young girl on the lawn."
I think she's trying to wave off the air strike.
"Sir,requestingpermissiontoabort Mr. President, please."
Sir!
Sir!
I need an answer.
"I'm not doing this, guys."
Abort mission.
Pull out!
Abort!
Abort!
Abort!
No!
- I'm on the bridge.
- [ Man On Phone ] Is Babitch there?
- Yeah.
I see him.
- Take care of it.

"Uncle Ray, I saw a gun."
I saw the gun.
He took a shot at me.
Tell 'em.
They took a shot at me.
[ Man ] Stay here with us.
Tunney didn't even get the grand jury for shit like this.
"Fuck the G.J. You're Superboy, huh?"
"You saved, what?"
Six black babies?
"Come on, kid, the shit plays!"
- Three babies.
"- Hey, one at a time, please."
"I got P.A. on another channel, the mayor's office, assistant D.A."
Press up the yin-yang.
The only reason they're not here now... is we got gridlock from across Bronx to the Palisades.
There's no gun.
"You didn't see it,Jack?"
You can't find it?
- Flaky.
"- Listen, I heard a shot."
"I heard a shot, Ray."
- I heard a shot.
I saw a gun.
"- In my trunk, in the grand union bag."
"- I heard a shot, Leo."
"So is this your, uh, big ""Welcome to Hawaii"" plan?"
Pin me to some guy with a badge?
"Mary, I'm trying to keep you out of jail."
Come here.
Ahem.
- What are you laughing at?
"- Punk, you're like, 7 years old."
"I don't get it, Mary."
"I mean, why come back here?"
You already missed the funeral.
You think I feel good about not being there?
Truthfully?
"I don't know, I can't tell."
"I mean, we were invisible to that man."
"I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment."
Because at least it would have been something.
"Listen, Mary."
"You know this is really hard for you to accept, okay?"
But Dad loved us.
"He just didn't know how to show it, I guess."
"Hey, I got that address on Sofia Archuleta."
"Mary, right?"
"Sis, meet Danno."
Danny Williams.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- A tie.
Seriously?
"Ha, ha."
"- Ha, ha."
What is it with you people and ties?
We're in Hawaii.
I have some friends.
"Now, look."
This is Mrs. Ryan's check for $20.000 made out to me.
Do me a favor and get me my check back.
You mean that cashier's check you gave me?
Yes.
I don't know if I can.
It may have gone down to the bank.
I've got to have it back.
Why?
It's just as good a check as Mrs. Ryan's.
"I know, It's just that I've got to use that check for a transaction after business hours."
Nobody'll honor a personal check.
"Oh, I see."
It's endorsed.
I know.
Miss Watkins.
"Yes, Mr. O'Hara?"
Do you still have Mr. Sabourin's check for $20.000?
What was the transaction?
Wentworth Drug.
"Sabourin, Sabourin, Sabourin."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
That went to the bank about an hour ago.
Is something wrong?
"Oh, no."
No.
I'm sorry.
It went to the bank.
How long ago?
About an hour ago with our last deposits.
We make several a day.
You must work faster than this.
Okay.
Day 3
"Isn't this going overboard, bro?"
Your body might fall apart.
It's okay.
I've been up for 5 days before.
Kai.
I'm really thankful that you told me to work.
It really works.
Shit.
My head is so heavy.
Day 4
Yoon.
You accepted the job from Peng?
Yeah.
You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work.
You've only got 2 weeks.
And you accepted it!
Yeah.
You know even though I...
"I didn't screen it, you should have known better."
Why did you take it?
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You're the only one who looks up to him.
You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of.
He lied!
You know that?
"At least someone thinks of me, Je."
"Thought of you, that's f*cked up."
He only cares about his job.
So he sweet talked you into taking this job.
"I was there, sure."
Boy postured like he's seasoned.
Feels light.
Which would mean a lot if you were a scale.
Do you want it or no ?
Now it is light.
I'm losing my patience.
$800 or the deal is off.
Deal's off.
I'm out of here.
"See, there's a problem with your story, Julio."
"What, no happy ending ?"
"No, whoever shot Bob left evidence of their gun on him."
Okay.
"Look, I brought an associate with me."
"New guy, loose cannon,"
"- name of Luis, Luis Rivera."
- And Luis shot Bob ?
You ask him.
"Until we find Luis, Julio, we're going to hang onto you."
"Step over to the car, please."
"Let's go, Julio."
Right over here.
Let's go.
Eric !
I don't see anyone.
"Shift into Plan ""B""."
Luis Rivera hold up.
"Luis, you got to change up your routine, man."
I didn't do nothing wrong.
"Yeah, you wake up, and you're already wrong."
Let's get him up.
He doesn't get to win.
"Farm-to-table, huh?"
[phone rings] [ring]
- Hey.
- Julia:
How's it going?
"Oh, it's okay."
What's up?
Your parents want to hang on to the kids a little longer.
"I told you, you have to beat them off with a stick."
So I'm thinking an afternoon without the flesh anchors.
Let's do a little day drinking.
I could certainly use one.
Everything okay?
"Oh, fine."
How about that place down by the marina?
Sunday's all day Happy Hour.
I love it.
"Uh, I need to finish up here."
Give me an hour?
I may have to start without you.
It's one of the reasons why I love you.
"Okay, I'll see you soon."
Okay.
Gentlemen.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
"Dr. Barrett, I'm ready to sign the papers."
You have been a terrible drinking buddy.
Why?
You've barely said two words since you got here.
You're so quiet.
I'm sorry.
"Are you a robot, too?"
Yeah.
"I started to rust here, but Ohji fixed me."
"I'm usually prettier than this, but you caught me at a bad moment."
Because the Ruin's begun.
What is the Ruin?
"Is it going to happen to me, too?"
"Man, I don't know what's going on!"
"But, you really are beautiful, mister."
You aren't all beat up like me.
You're like a human!
"I have to get back, or else Ohji will be worried!"
Ohji will be worried!
Ohji will be worried!
Bye-bye!
I don't think you're beat up.
I don't.
You can have this.
It's the prettiest one I've ever found.
It'll keep you safe.
Thank you.
"Just now, that was..."
Luna...
Ringo!
"Humans will perish, just like us."
I'm a robot.
A robot kid?
I can't stand kids!
They have that new kid smell!
The world's on its way to Ruin!
It doesn't need any goddamn kids!
Die.
She drove off.
She's not rational.
Tell me the truth.
She's upset.
"Um, are you still with her?"
"Look, I told you..."
I told you we were having problems.
Are you still with her?
"All this time, you were... ..you were just lying to me about being separated."
"Technically, she was in Melbourne, I was here."
"Oh, my God."
I...
I just wanted to be with you.
"Oh, my God."
"OK, I can explain everything."
Do you know what?
Don't even bother.
Because I can see that the next word out of your mouth is gonna be a lie.
"OK, Grace, let's just be grown-up about..."
Just get out.
Let's be grown-up...
Just get out!
You heard her.
Hm?
"Now, you have fun."
That is an order.
You're going to enjoy bossing everyone around in Singapore?
Too soon to be funny.
Be happy.
Mwah.
"Rio awaits, and I've got a meeting at the office to get to."
"Oh, I'll miss you."
"No, come on."
Already?
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Now, do me a favor."
I want you to move around with her a little bit.
See if she's worth a shit.
Come on.
"Aye, aye, captain."
This is a fucking good burger.
Did you make this?
I'm on break.
How did you find me?
"Mm, girl's got to eat."
One of mine saw you here and told me.
Ahh.
"I'm not here for you, love."
Don't worry.
What do you want?
"A couple of my girls got picked up and started talking to the cops, saying my name, talking about my business."
I've never said anything.
"I know, Chris."
"That's why you're still here enjoying your new life, spending time with your sons."
The other girls aren't so lucky.
Anyway.
"Point is, if the cops do show up asking you questions,"
I hope you forget my name.
"Of course, Terry."
I'd never say anything.
Sure.
I know you wouldn't.
Ah.
Do you wanna leave ?
I like this place.
It's been a long time since we came here.
Your mother is gonna wait.
It was at least a year and a half ago.
"I wanted to take a book with me, and I forgot."
It was quite sunny !
You had to insist to bring me here.
As usual I dithered.
Aferwards I was happy.
Things were never the same after that.
"Try to sleep now, sweet heart."
Was it Francois who's just called ?
"Yes, he is on the way."
You didn't tell him.
No.
I don't want him to worry.
It's bad enough with you being upset.
This should be him.
Mom ?
Yes sweet heart ?
How do I look ?
Great.
Hi François !
Everything's alright ?
Yes !
How is he ?
Did he sleep ?
No even if he's really quite exhausted.
"He can't sleep, can he ?"
And he keeps asking about you.
"I go see him, and then I will make us dinner."
~ Um...
~ What?
Do you not think she has the right to know her husband was murdered?
No.
No-one has a right to know anything till I know who killed Mr Newcastle.
"We work for the dead, not the living."
Off you go.
Are you sure she can manage it?
She's never done it before.
Only one way to learn.
Are you ready?
"Is this your husband, Mrs Parker?"
"I-I-I mean, yes."
"It's Scott all right, but... just the shell of what he was."
What he used to be.
"(I'm sorry, Scottie.)"
~ All right.
~ Where did you find him?
"I, er..."
I don't have any details.
How did... he do it?
Do what?
Kill himself.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about his death.
"Don't know much for a copper, do you?"
Are you the tea lady?
When did you last see Scott?
Night before last.
Me birthday party.
Happy birthday.
~ Thanks.
~ Was it?
And she never asked any questions anyway.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk.
This is from Siam.
Come see my bedroom.
"-Tommy, will you take him?"
-Of course. I'll eat this fucking dog.
Love that crystal ball or what?
This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.
French.
"Janice and I were having so much fun, she started screwing up at work."
I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.
Fuckin' Janice can do whatever she wants to do!
Got it?
Got it?
"I'm who ya gotta run through, you understand?"
.
Hang up once more and you're gonna deal with me!
Get off of her.
You're an animal.
"Spider, on your way over here, bring me a Cutty and water, huh?"
-Did you guys eat?
-l'm starving.
-l'll play these.
-You'll play those?
Do I fuckin' stutter?
I'll play those.
What am I?
A mirage?
What?
"Oh, my."
"You have got a present for mommy, don't ya?"
You need a diaper change?
- I'll do it.
- All right.
You have at it.
- Go see auntie Nic.
"- Okay, baby."
Who's the best baby?
Not in your mouth.
Not in your mouth.
"Ooh, that's yucky."
Wait.
"Oh, gotcha!"
"It's okay, baby."
"Auntie Nic's not really a baby person after all, is she?"
"Okay, I know-- oh, not a ""baby person""?"
Then what's this?
"Oh, well, I mean, honey, of course you're a baby person."
It just takes practice.
That's all.
Maybe she just doesn't like to have her diaper changed.
"Oh, no."
She doesn't.
"None of them do at this age, but you'll learn all that."
"Actually, you'll just get a nanny, and she can deal with all that stuff."
Okay.
There we go.
We're all better now.
- What?
"- Thank god for nannies, right?"
"I'll make sure to get one that's a ""baby person."""
Might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
(PANTING)
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry, this is my downtime."
(yells) What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you?
I'm your new personal trainer.
- Please!
- Ah-ah!
The tall guy the other night in the casino.
The one that got chucked out.
What's his name?
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just the warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop.
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff.
He got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"It's OK, I've got my badges."
Why?
"Look, all's I know is that..."
is that there was a girl between them.
Some stripper who worked in Soho.
Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental.
"Blimey, the newsagent's is closer now we're in a smaller studio."
Shut up.
You're spoiling the magic for everyone.
Oh.
"Oh, look, the newsagent."
"Hello, me old darling."
"Yep, it's me, Richie Rich."
Don't faint.
Treasure the moment.
Here's a pic.
Put it in your box of precious things.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes, I'm sure."
"One of the cool type, are we?"
Gonna boast to your friends?
"""I met Richie Rich and pretended not to recognise him."
"Hee hee. """
What a sad little life you must lead.
Are you mad?
"- Perhaps a little zany, yes."
- Excuse me.
Do you have part one of Poncy Cooking with part two free?
- Certainly.
"One pound, please."
- Aha.
"I'm afraid I have no money so I'll just take part two for nothing, shall I?"
- You stupid slag!
"Come on, Richie."
"- One pound, please."
"Er, hurr..."
I'll give you a mensh on me next programme.
"Night, hon."
Sorry!
- Trauma.
"- No problem, I just have to hurry."
How come?
- Don't get upset.
- Why would I be upset?
I need to clean for...
Sandy?
There's a real estate agent coming by first thing in the morning.
I need more milk.
A...
A real estate...
"OK, I give."
Why?
I was going to tell you on the way home.
To value the townhouse.
Value?
I just want to see how much it's worth.
- I know what value means.
"- I'm not selling, it would just be good to know in case."
- You're going to be in Dallas...
- I told you I'd pay my share!
- It's too big for me and Maya.
- It's only a contract!
You don't know that!
And it might be nice to be close to Mom.
Mom?
"Yeah, in case I need help."
"Sandy, Mom dropped Maya on her head."
It was an accident.
"Mel, you can't just go and make changes like this..."
"Well, sir, I guess I am a lucky guy at that."
"You know, I hardly ever lose a coin toss."
"Go to the horse races in Hot Springs, bet on a long shot."
Damn if the son of a bitch doesn't come in.
My mom used to always tell me I was born under a lucky star.
CASHIER:
What you got there?
WOMAN:
A couple rolls of film.
"Baby, there's an article in here about Julia from Dark Memories."
That ain't Julia.
That's that damn twin sister...
With her evil self.
"No, it's not."
Can you tell him who this is?
That's Julia on Dark Memories.
Mmm-hmm.
Told you.
Got any maps of Houston?
We don't need no damn map of Houston.
PLUTO:
"Be cool, Ray, be cool."
CASHIER:
"Good, Bill."
How are you?
BILL:
It's real quiet out there.
We got the two most exciting jobs in town.
(MICROWAVE BEEPING)
LILA:
"Your other burrito's ready, baby."
He's watching me.
[PHONE BEEPING]
NATE:
It's already been over an hour.
Bar's closing soon.
"She's gonna come, I know she is."
"Whoa, wait."
Dan is Gossip Girl?
Gossip Girl?
You crazy?
"- Dan, what are you doing here?"
- I Loopt you.
Are you waiting for Gossip Girl?
"Yeah, and I know you don't approve."
I'm gonna go close the tab.
"This grudge-match thing, it doesn't seem like you."
What's going on?
- I don't wanna be irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?
You're Serena van der Woodsen.
"Gossip Girl might be right about me, but she's wrong about you."
"Without Serena, who would I have dreamt about?"
I might have spent my whole life on the outside if you hadn't let me in.
Which I'm holding against you.
[LAUGHS]
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
"- Wait, they're a team."
- A team of what?
"- Wait, why are you all here?"
- I got a text saying to meet you.
Ka-pow!
"Oh, Lightning!"
If you figure that out you just gonna be OK.
"Oh, yeah, that..."
That is spectacular advice.
"Thank you, Mr. The King."
"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history..."
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.
Yes!
...we have a three-way tie.
"Hey, that must be really embarrassing."
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!
Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.
"Well, thank you!"
Thanks to all of you out there!
Thank you!
"Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."
"No, not me!"
"No, you rock, and you know that!"
"Oh, yeah!"
Whoo!
Yep!
All right!
Got it!
"""First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. """
"Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick."
Huh?
"- Hey, kid!"
Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.
"Let's go, Mack."
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
"No, there's something weird about this."
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What do you got?
Contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
I don't have a wipe.
G-give me a wipe.
Just I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never Miss a show.
Thank you.
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
"My gosh, there's so many."
- Mine's 19.
- That's a good one.
Do you think it's gonna come up on the show tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
- Will you be at this Lenai Street address?
- Yes.
No.
She'll be at Robin Masters' estate with me.
I will be staying at my own house.
You can reach her at the estate or through Rick at the club.
You can reach me at my own house.
Won't you be more comfortable at Robin's Nest until your relatives arrive from the mainland?
OK.
"Mrs Greenberg, one last thing."
If you think of anything else...
- I will call you!
- Fine.
Thank you.
They make me so nervous.
"Now, why do I have to stay at this Robin's Nest?"
- Why does she have to stay there?
- Because they might try and grab her.
They don't want me.
They want Saul.
They don't want her.
They want Saul.
- You know who's got Saul?
- No.
Mrs Greenberg?
'Dr Haywood to paediatrics.'
Sorry you had to wait.
I was in surgery.
I'm Dr Kessler.
You are not my husband's doctor.
Are you Saul Greenberg's doctor?
- Yes.
Here`s to a very restful vacation.
Here`s to a very relaxing vacation a renewed love affair and a time of joy with our kids.
"You know, I`ve never told you this."
I know it`s been a rough beginning.
I think there`s something wrong here!
It`s the bed.
It will slow down in a second.
I got it!
hold on to this.
Enjoy it.
What are you doing?
"Let`s try this, my darling."
We haven`t done this in a Iong time.
Oh!
clark!
What`s that noise?
What`s going on?
Don`t you kids knock anymore?
"Sorry, we thought you were fighting."
Nobody is fighting in here.
It`s very late.
Where is Mom?
"I`m under here, kids."
Go back to bed.
"Go back to bed, now."
The bed was very soft.
"""Weird-o-rama! """
This is the same street Wyatt Earp kept law and order on.
It seems kind of dirty and touristy.
The Old West was dirty.
Everything isn`t like home.
"If it were, there`d be no reason for leaving home."
The ambulance is saying 15 to 20 minutes.
- I can take him.
- Caroline can take me.
"- No, I didn't drive."
- Then I'll wait.
You will not wait.
"Okay, you need to see a doctor."
- Tyler's driving.
End of story.
- Fine.
- Go.
- I'll bring my car around.
- I see you're packing.
That's a good sign.
- It won't be long now.
- Did you get the missing piece?
I am a fucking bastard.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna come over and hit me?
you've been waiting your whole life.
I'm in a chair.
Come on and hit me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Come over here and hit me.
I'm in this chair.
Now's your chance.
So hit me.
I'm nothing fucking like you-- nothing.
I'm never gonna be like you.
I'm not that little boy anymore.
Can I ask you something?
what's up? just packing your bags just leave?
- Yeah.
"No, you don't."
'Cause I just made it up.
"Don't you want a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?"
No.
You live there?
Cool.
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
"Next year, maybe."
"- Yeah, right."
- I am.
"My sister's gonna get a loft apartment, and she said I could live with her."
She won't even letyou sit in her car.
- Can we come in?
"- Yeah, can we come in?"
We'll be good.
"Go eat it outside, Robby."
Okay!
I just need to put on my jacket.
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.
My dad sleeps there.
"He'll be home, like, any second."
"We're each going to do it, and you have to tell us what the difference is."
"Like, how it feels different when she does it from when I do it."
Exactly.
"Thank you, Rebecca."
"You're welcome, Heather."
- But first we need a towel and-
- And a washcloth.
Right.
A wet washcloth and a dry washcloth.
"You're gonna win this shit, man, the cat's in the bag."
"I heard about Robert Ramirez, you put some kid in the hospital yesterday, dude."
"He wasn't in the hospital but, I think he's messed up pretty bad."
They took Robbie in handcuffs.
-Shit.
'You seen it?
Have you seen Wes lately?
Nope.
"You got this, man."
You'll win the whole race.
I have to.
[Door shut].
(Hollis) You've seen my belt?
-No.
Dam.
[Searching drawers].
Found that nice tie mom got you?
"Yes, it's right here."
I don't know how to tie it.
She always did for me.
-	 Know .
Come here.
Lift up your chin.
Here you go.
Here.
It's good.
"[Distant whisper, quarrel] ""I'm not dragging you in here with me""."
"""You boys are...""."
"""I'm not threatening you with anything, I'm trying to keep what...""."
"(Man) ""like you said there are children and I gotta keep every other weekend""."
[Door].
Come on.
Pretty...
Pretty... every one said...
But...
The taste of people change in any moment...
What is out of fashion is thrown in the drawer and never used.
Hey...
Am I Pretty?
What a soft feeling!
Although it's a little worn out
It's ok!
I'll borrow them!
Beautiful.
I'm just a traveler passing by.
Lost my way under the rain.
It's seems I entered your house without permission.
I'm sorry.
Will you let me go out soon?
That's a very nasty smell.
Even here it's all battered.
Up to be thrown in the dump indeed.
"But, before that..."
I won't forget...
"Before becoming useless, were wonderfully useful to people..."
Good work.

O-ume?
There's nothing I can help you yet?
"I'm sorry Princess, I'll be back as soon as I drop this."
O-Waka-chan!
Matsuki-chan!
Robbie.
Ease off.
You started this dance.
"He was stupid, you were stupid."
"Come on, let's just forget it and get out of here."
Come on.
"Thanks, Sonny."
"Forget it, man."
That's what I'm here for.
"Hey, I don't want to see you guys in here again."
"Yeah, we love you, too."
"Forget it, Annie."
You don't wanna be in the music business.
It's a jungle.
Exotic dancing ain't exactly the United Nations.
Neither is stripping.
I got a great set of pipes.
"Really, I do."
I agree.
But can you carry a tune?
"# Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?"
#
# My friends all have Porsches #
# I must make amends ##
"I need a singer, not a stripper."
I'll have my agent call you.
Sometimes it helps them if you pat them on the fanny.
"Oh, yeah?"
Thanks.
You got a baby?
"Well, in a manner of speaking."
His name's Noogie and I'm married to him.
My wife wants just what I wish for.
You must take Lajwanti's place in this family now.
We clash again!
As if we were separated in our last birth!
Jai's waiting for you.
There!
I've startled you!
I always say he's not in and you say you know!
"And you say ""You've told me"""
I've trapped you this time!
He's not in!
I know that.
How did you know?
You just told me so.
Damn it!
I'm trapped again!
Laxmi!
It's me...!
When did you arrive from outside?
I'm going out.
But when did you arrive?
I said I'm going out.
Okay?
Why have you locked that aunt in?
Chachi's gone out.
Impossible!
I just saw her coming up the stairs!
"This thing about in and out is a long story, Haribhai."
When aunt went upstairs...
"you saw her, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see when I went upstairs.
How could I see myself?
Stop calling here or I'm calling the police.
"Oh, my God."
Who was that?
No one.
Noannie.
"It's just some idiots calling saying stupid things, okay?"
Like what?
"Brian, it's stupid."
"Like what, Noannie?"
He says he hears I put out to white boys.
"He calls here again, you give the phone to me."
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
"This is all my fault, isn't it?"
No.
"No, don't you ever say that."
"Noannie, look."
"Look, this has nothing to do with you."
Come here.
Come here.
"I know, I know, I slept with my paralyzed boyfriend's best friend."
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
It would be great if you said something.
"Sorry, I'm just thinking how hard that must have been for you to tell me."
And I'm really glad that you did.
I just want us to be honest with each other.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Nope.
No.
No.
Okay.
You're the one who makes me feel I've made a flop out of this.
"I'm telling you, the only one."
"Say, Jim, that's not bad."
That's good work.
- Have you always been able to draw?
"- Yeah, a little."
Come on.
Let me see you draw me.
Come on.
Let me see if you can get my puss on paper.
Go.
Come on.
A professional tried to draw me once.
He couldn't get me.
Couldn't touch me.
"Well, you shouldn't be hard to do."
"Well, come on."
Let me see you do it.
"How do you want me, full face or sideways?"
Look over there.
You're a cinch.
"You know, the more I see it, the better I like it."
The pan or the picture?
"Oh, why, the picture, of course."
Hm.
"I'm crazy about you, baby."
"You know that, don't you?"
"- Are you, Patsy?"
- Mm-hm.
Gets worse all the time.
It's got me worried.
- Why?
"Your husband is a lucky man, Mrs.Cole. I'm sure he knows it."
He's not my husband.
I mean he's not anyone else's either.
It's just...we're not actually married.
I bought the ring myself in Woolworth's.
I see..
"In love to run away with him, just...to proper."
Not to care what other people thought.
Uh...behind...
Better get moving.
Hilliard's looking for you.
Wants to discuss what you wrote about uncle Frank's death.
What did you think?
Too long obviously.
But apart from that...
"His...his final moments, believing Branigan and Johnnie are the sons lost in the last war."
Wooh!
Such an age.
You been gone.
Oh!
It's all me!
?
I still think we need a little bit more in terms of...in terms of backseeding.
Oh!
I'm...
I'm awfully sorry Mr.Hilliard. But Mrs.Cole has a train to catch.
What!
?
She must go.
Whoo...
It's a personal matter.
But will she be back tonight?
Where are you going?
is she your aunt?
Yes.
Why don't we go to your mother's?
She says that our house is too small and that you deserve better.
I think your mother's wrong.
Small things have their value too.
You're small but skilful.
I'm going to grow.
The house won't grow though.
You'll grow up and go to school.
- How far does your school go?
- Until 11.
You want to keep on studying after?
I'll go to Momenieh until I'm 15.
"For the final years, I'll go to Kermanshah."
Where is it?
"Over there, look."
It's over there.
Look.
The blue window.
- The blue window?
- And that's her son.
"I see, he's her son."
Yes.
Where's the cemetery?
Up on the hill.
I have to go.
I'll take the others to Hammad's.
Are you worried about them or your book?
My book. I have an exam tomorrow.
You'll come back?
"If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age..."
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
"- You got a hotel here, right?"
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
"We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me."
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am?
"You are where you need to be, honey."
"You don't have to this, Chase."
This is the only way to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?
Marcus?
It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.
Ready.
"You're sure about this, Chase?"
I've nothing but faith in you.
Chase?
I love music.
I like all kinds of music.
"Maybe he'll talk to you now, I think."
Prop him up in the chair f acing the wall.
I can't bear the sight of your handiwork.
"And don't put that thing away, in case."
In case there's more music?
"There he is, all tuned up f or you."
That's better.
"You're a stubborn man, Mr. Murdock."
"Your whole attitude, I find thoroughly aggravating."
What time is it?
That seems a little beside the point.
"It happens to be 10:45, or thereabouts."
"You're licked, Martinelli."
"Quarter to 11, manager, Hotel Southern will phone me here."
- Don't f all f or that.
- Shut up.
"Yes, Mr. Murdock?"
Do go on.
I'm interested.
He's just making with the mouth.
"Wrong, as usual."
Yes?
"-That, mostly."
"It's been pretty bad, Doc."
Where's Jim;
-Waiting at the hotel.
-Waiting;
To take the children home after you've seen them.
Oh.
Did he mind about my seeing them;
"I promise you, when I get my licence you can quit and go back."
I already quit.
"Yeah, OK, but you can dance"
- and go to school can't you?
- Not really.
"Alright, but it's kind of expensive for both of us to go to school, so, you know..."
It's not gonna happen.
"Drugs, med school."
Duh.
"OK, but I can, I..."
I got this.
I can control the drugs.
Duh!
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, you'll dance, you'll put us through school,"
- and then I'll...
- Decide you're too good for me?
"It's not gonna be forever, babe."
Stop talking to me and hope I get the idea?
How 'bout I be the doctor and you be the stripper.
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.
Calm down.
"- Cool, yeah."
Right.
- OK.
"When you come back, we'll get a little more coke."
We'll get out of here.
- We'll figure all this out.
Promise.
- Yeah...
Yeah.
- It's nothing.
- It's not nothing.
"You know, this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting."
Matt and Tyler hate each other.
You and Elena are on the outs.
I just...
I don't like it.
[SIGHS]
And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
"I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry."
Damon.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry I'm late.
"The dog ate my, uh..."
Never mind.
- What's with all the furrowed brows?
- I saw Isobel last night.
Isobel's here?
In town?
- You're late.
JOHN:
Didn't realize I was on a schedule.
What's with the sideshow?
ISOBEL:
Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn.
And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
- He's gay?
- Not right now.
He's very good to me.
"Hey, Cherie?"
[ISOBEL SPEAKS IN FRENCH]

This a Searider?
"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a Shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.
"I wanted a Searider, but my uncle wouldn't pop for it."
Your uncle like boats?
Who?
Paulie?
Paulie wouldn't know a cleaver from a fucking cleat.
Cut it out!

Have a good weekend.
I brought you a CD forthe trip.

You can't understand them.
Chicco's sleeping!

You have to tell me everything.
"If you show them you've got balls, they run."

Amy doesn't like spicy.
"Actually, she prefers no meat."
You work at a butcher shop.
Yeah.
"Okay, what about we make some hot sauce to dip them in?"
Good idea.
Remember that time...
No.
Not unless you tell me the time.
You got the fusilli stuck up your nose?
"Okay, whose idea was that?"
And Mrs. Ramsey called the fire department to get it out.
I was turning blue in the face.
I stuck it up both...
"Oh, hi."
"Oh, hi, Amy."
I didn't hear you come in.
"Hi, I take it you're Clementine?"
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
And who's this?
That's the guy I wanted you to meet.
"That's our son, John."
"Hey, John, say hi to daddy's friend Clementine."
No.

It's a great apartment.
"Thanks, yeah, we're good."
"So, how long have you been married?"
"Um, just a couple of weeks now."
"Oh, whoa, so you just got married."
- Sure!
"- Clean-up time, Jocelyn."
"Jocelyn, how are you doing?"
Where have you been?
"Hi, Nate, I need to pick up Sebastian's packages."
Really?
What are his packages:
Big or small?
It's his luggage from the trip to St. Bart.
It's that stuff back there.
"It's too big for you, Jocelyn."
We'll take it up.
- Thanks.
- While you're here...
- do you think you can help us out?
- Sure.
What is it?
We found this package outside our door this morning...
But it didn't have no telephone extention or return number.
"So we took it to the 4th, Time Square, but..."
- That's Conde Nest.
- Yeah.
"It was addressed to an Andre Leon Talley, but..."
Andre Leon Talley?
Let me see this.
"I don't even know where it came from, what can I do with it?"
I'll take it.
Thanks!
"Slow down, punter foot."
This isn't Sports Ilustrated.
Look what I just found in the messenger center.
- Where did you get this?
It's a case you worked on when you were a copper.
"Jesse, Alan's boy."
"He's back, Dad."
Jesse's come back.
Leave her!
Dad?
Look at him.
"- Take his face away from me, please."
"- Dad, he didn't do it."
He admitted to it.
And you believe that?
Dad I know he wrote you letters.
"- I destroyed them, they gave me the creeps."
- All of them?
- Yes.
What about mom?
Did she keep any of them?
You know what?
You're gonna have to ask her that.
"What is all this, Mark?"
It was 20 years ago.
Why are you bringing all this up again?
"Here we are, one chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir."
Enjoy it.
- Disgusted or not you must have read them.
"- Yes, of course I read them."
- And?
Well you know he wanted us to meet him.
Wanted us to a... to talk.
- But of course we wouldn't entertain the idea.
- Why not?
'Coz he killed your brother.
"Okay, I'm on my way."
Josh needs my help.
Esme's stoned.
- What?
- Yeah.
He wants me to go over and give her a talk.
- Really?
- Mm.
The first thing I got into trouble with as a teenager was smoking weed.
Mmm.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
It's delicious.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
I'm glad you called.
"Guess you want me to come down pretty hard, right?"
Yeah.
She'll listen to you...
I hope.
- She's pretty stoned.
- Is she?
It's not funny.
"No, I know."

Aunt Kate?
Sure.
Come out!
Come out in the end.
We got them all.
Is there one left?
We can meet together now.
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
What do you want?
"My name is Jurgen Hoffman, I'm a scientist."
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.
What do you know?
I've watched through this window.
I've witnessed the deaths from over there.
I know how and why they died.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
So you tell me why they died.
What difference does it make to you?
Now.
Come with me.
Wait a minute you come to my place and you want me to leave and you don't want to tell me why?
"Ok, you have a creature, an alien creature on your roof."
Where?
I study these creatures.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?
-No.
-Let me explain.
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.

Yep!
"She's fit, she's older than me, and she goes like a porn star."
"- Oh, right!"
"- Yeah, and she's got massive titties and I..."
"Well, I... fucked her hard and all night long."
What are you and this dirty horn bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.
"Going to an under-18 disco where she works, so you won't be able to."
I could go.
- What?
- I could go.
I'm 17.
You're 17!

There's looking older and then there's that.
You look about 30!
Gin is good.
Gin is good.
So... what's wrong with ya?
"I mean, other than the whole ""psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran"" thing."
Other than that?
Is... is there something other than that?
You tell me.
I'm just a chick with a drink.
No judgments.
Oh.
I get it.
You don't want to open up to me.
I know.
I'm not the touchy-feely type.
I got fired for being heartless.
Cooper apparently agrees.
Maybe he's right.
It's the baby.
He have 11 toes or something?
He's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
"He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect."
And I...
"I look at him, and I feel... nothing."
I can't... feel anything... ever since the...
"I mean, there's this pressure to be all ""mommy,"""
and I'm just...
I'm not.
I'm not ready or something.
I just...
I don't...
I don't want to deal with him.
- If she hurt you...
"- No, no."
She... she didn't lay a hand on me.
"I'm fine, really, I'm just..."
I'm just tired.
Whose body am I in?
You've seen Liana.
"That's what happened to your face, isn't it?"
"Dad, tell me the truth."
"Where did this, me, come from?"
I need to know.
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.
"Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent."
Did it have a name?
The baby?
Allison.
"From the day you became Allison,"
I vowed to protect you with my life.
But...
I failed you.
No.
Yes.
We should have left.
Gone on the run.
"I'm so, so sorry."
"Dad, don't."
You did everything you could to protect me.
I always will.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying that I love you.
"As long as I'm alive, you're in danger."
- They'll use us against each other.
"No way, we have a show coming up tonight."
Do the box again.
"Kids, didn't you hear me?"
We have a show tonight.
"Bye, kids."
All the best.
"Everything will be okay, my sweetie."
Give me a hug.
Barbuda loves you.
"- Bye, kids."
- Bye.
Here.
For you.
Maybe you'll need it someday.
"It's yours now, Maria."
"We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay?"
"Look out for her, Quico."
"Maria, let me go."
"Be good, sweetie."
"Bye, kids."
My ring fell into the sea and it was lost to me the waters gave me a seashell as a present for you
Come on and eat Maria.
Do you still like chocolate milk?
Yes.
So...
Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you?
But it's so pretty.
I've picked your school.
I'll take you to meet the principal.
She wants you to take a test.
But I've always studied!
In the circus?
"I mean, you call these problems?"
"""Oh, it's horrible."
"Someone wrote in the sky for me. """
I'd kill to find a little note in my diaphragm case.
Oh...
But that's just me.
Then maybe he should be with you.
"No, Joanne."
"Joanne, wait."
Wait.
This is the best party ever.
- Nice speech.
- It was horrible.
I thought it was great.
"Oh, happy people complaining."
"No, they deserve to be yelled at."
I'm Richie.
Lina.
"No, I know."
Um
"- You sat in front of me in Ms. Klinger's class, but then in fourth grade you were gone."

"He did, he kinda looked like a penis."
"Yeah, and the turtlenecks didn't help."
I like your hat.
Are-are you making fun of me?
'Cause I don't think I could handle-
"No, I like it."
"It's, um... jaunty."
Hey.
"Couldn't have looked like crap just a little, huh?"
Looks like it's gonna be a late one here tonight.
Yeah.
"No, no, everything's fine."
"Just a lot going on, back-to-back meetings."
Yeah.
"I love you, too."
It's complicated.
"Family, Leon."
Always is.
"So, you think my chattiness is annoying?"
"I think you asking me about your chattiness non-stop for the past 20 minutes is annoying, yes."
Want to know who else thought my chattiness was annoying?
Wendy.
She said it made me sound nervous and insecure.
- Like that's even possible.
"- Stop it, Tony."
"It was one little comment Gibbs made, okay?"
Nothing more.
"And as for Wendy, I believe you were right to turn the book on that relationship."
"Turn the page, close the book, but... yeah, I guess I was."
Oh.

[ Sighs deeply ] 1987.
Senior prom.
I was so excited.
"I had a cool tux, a hot date, and a plan to help my best pal Bucky Martin score a dance with the girl of his dreams."
Bucky Martin?
Sounds like a stud.
- He actually wasn't.
- Stop it.
"But I knew he could be, if he-- if he just believed."
"And then when I saw Cindy Lee standing alone at the punch bowl,"
"Captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty?"
Captain howdy?
"Captain howdy, that isn't very nice."
"Well, maybe he's sleeping."
You think?
What--Regan...
Why are you reading that stuff?
Because I like it.
It's not even a good picture of you.
You look so mature.
I wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't talk?
"Well, I didn't have my makeup man there."
Let me take an eyelash off your face.
"No, I didn't get it."
What are we going to do on your birthday?
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?
What can we do?
I don't know.
What would you like to do?
Got any ideas?
Mm-mmm.
No?
Let me think.
Let me think.
What can we do?
We never finished seeing all the sights in Washington.
"We didn't get to the Lee mansion, lots of stuff."
Shall we go sightseeing...
If it's a nice day?
"Yeah, let's do that."
"And tomorrow night,"

Yo!

I ain't no sailor.
Soy capitan.
I'm captain.
I've found Risdale.
"To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
Una poca de gracia
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
"Seriously, John, that ain't a trick question."
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
We're going to the seaside.
Pack a bag.
"Mi amor, Calum."
Mi gusto los churros a los chico.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
It reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, my dad used to take us to the seaside."
Me and my sister would sit in the back eating digestive biscuits.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time.
There's a bright side.

And tell him to let them air dry this time.
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
Everybody's gonna be there.
Ok.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I... don't know what to do.
I need to talk to you.
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"""May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel,"
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"Thanks, honey."
Not a word to Raziya.
"Okay, honey."
"If you ask me, Mom was a spy."
"She grew up in Algeria, right?"
- And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year?
- Yeah.
She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad.
Do the math.
Dad was in Intelligence.
- He was a cook in Intelligence.
- That was his cover story.
So the Algerian spy got her pregnant?
- Maybe he was an Arab.
- God forbid.
Maybe she was the spy.
Or a murderer.
Ever see her kitchen cleaver?
- I know.
She was a Nazi hunter.
- What?
Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz?
Since when did she have family in Oschwitz?
It was an educational tour.
We're Jews.
"Unless your father is a little Arab spy,"
- which makes you...
What's wrong with you?
"Man, where the gefilte fish at?"
It's in the fridge.
That shit's perishable once it's open.
"They ain't in the fridge, man."
"Hold on, man, I know I put that shit in the fridge 'cause don't nobody want no hot-ass gefilte fish."
"Just like I said, right behind the peanut butter."
"Ain't no peanut butter in here, man, just yogurt."
"- Where the fuck are you, Ricky?"
"- Where you think I am, man?"
"I'm in the motherfucking kitchen, bro."
I'm in the kitchen.
I don't see your ass.
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God!"
"Yo, TTD, call the cops."
There's a weird white kid in our house.
"What house are you in, Rick?"
- Ricky?
- Uh...
- Ricky?
"- Oh, shit."
- Ricky.
- Boy:
"I know who you are, asshole."
- You're not gonna get away with this.
"- TTD, call Spencer."
( car alarm chirps )
"Wayne, Wayne!"
( panting ) Wayne!
"Well, look what the breeze finally blew in."
"Better late than never, though, right?"
"and on top of that, my little timmy has a black eye for the christmas portrait this year because harley was too busy saving your butt, instead of walking him home from town."
"and i'm sorry i said ""butt."""
okay?
don't say that.
mommy is mad.
- bob!
are you gonna say anything?
!
"- she does have a point, cind."
- [scoffs] fine. fine.
[sighs] you know what?
"i don't need any of you guys, okay?"
"and, peepers, i'm really sorry about your eye."
- is aunt cindy mad at me?
"[door slams] - it's okay, honey."
just -- just eat.
"let's just wash the day off of us, okay?"
none of this happened.
[siren wailing]
- [sighs] hey!
what are you doing here?
"- oh, uh... nothing."
"i'm just -- um, just, uh, cutting school."
- oh!
"well, you seen wayne?"
- no.
why -- why would i have seen wayne?
- 'cause he works here.
"- well, um... yeah."
"no, i... i haven't seen him."
- okay. cool.
"there you are, my little worker bee."
Second one's almost there.
- Cool.
- And this device I invented... will monitor the vibrations of the audience.
- That's great.
- Just keep the music coming... from the baddest jazz trio in D.C.!
And I got some women lined up for you.
"Michael, I told you."
I don't want to meet anybody.
"Come on, Jeff."
You got to get over Stacy.
It's been four months since you broke up.
"You got to move on, experience life."
- You're right.
"- Anyway, first show..."
Debra's bringing her cousin Denise.
"She's kind of fat, but she's got a cute face."
"Cool, cool."
"Second, Anita's bringing her girl."
Says she's a ten.
- A ten?
- Uh-huh.
"Without a weave, she's a six."
That's cool.
I got to go.
Warden.
Just appease her.
"With this baby here, you won't be here much longer."
"Move over, Wynton Marsalis."
Cool.
"Aren't you going to say excuse me, Dre?"
Excuse me.
"Thanks again for calling, Mr. Reed."
This was an inside job.
"So I'm gonna get to see you sometime this week,aren't I?"
I don't know.
[giggling]
I guess that's a yes?
[laughs]
Get your hands up.
Don't--don't shoot us!
Give me the bag!
Now!
"Okay, okay."
Give it to him.
Give it to him!
The purse.
Give it to me.
He's gone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
(Leo) The receptionist's alibi checks out.
She was outta here by 10:45 last night.
Same with Marla's assistant.
Her roommate said that she was home all night.
That leaves only two people.
Marla and Gus.
Can you think of any reason that an artist would want to steal his own art?
Publicity.
There are more reasons for a gallery owner to do it.
Insurance.
Selling the work without having to give Gus a cut.
Maybe you should talk to Ms. Saffer some more.
You can't actually believe I took Gus's work.
What would you believe if you were me?
What do you mean?
I just...
"I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her."
"Blair, she's been kidnapped..."
I know.
She's probably traumatized.
"I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right?"
I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet.
You're basing all of this on nail polish?
Yeah.
Did you get a good look?
Yeah.
I know.
I think so.
Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped.
How do you know it?
"It doesn't matter, I just..."
"I think, I think maybe we should tie her up."
Tie her up?
Are you listening to yourself?
She's been tortured.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
Are you guys robbers?
"Sorry, Vivian, we..."
Who told you we were robbers?
Your leader.
He wasn't very good.
Connor.
I think it's my fault.
I think I took a wrong turn.
I don't know.
- Even money Stoker don't go the distance!
- Twenty says he does!
"I'll take that, and as much more as you got!"
Break it up!
Come on!
Nelson's working on his belly!
Stoker don't like it there!
Who does?
- What you trying to do?
Cop a Sunday?
- What's the matter?
Can't you take it?
"It looks like a home run, and it is a..."
"No, it's going to fall inside."
- You're doing swell!
"- How're you doing, Stoke, huh?"
"Okay, fella!"
"Okay, let's see that!"
That will be all right!
"Take it easy, Stoke!"
Take it easy!
There we are!
Give them a show!
"One more heat, and we'll call it a day!"
"Sure thing, Danny!"
Sure thing!
You're doing fine!
You're doing fine!
- I told you I'm gonna take this guy!
- He never laid a glove on us!
Ten seconds!
"Don't forget, if you try to slug with him, he'll kill you!"
Oh.
Marissa?
Look who's here.
Luke!
Hi.
Hey.
Mm.
Just grabbing a little grub before we take the boat out.
Boat?
"Yeah, I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea."
"Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch."
So you have no idea where Ryan might've gone?
I don't know.
He did say something about going down to Mexico and gambling on cockfights.
"I mean, I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys..."
Quit joking around.
Will you answer his question?
"Yes, I did."
I really don't know.
I do not know the guy.
I never got the chance.
"Hey, there's eggs."
"Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check."
Does Caitlin really need a pony?
"In a couple of months, she's not even going to like horses."
What?
!
I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.
We're not giving up China.
"Now go wait in the car, sweetie."
Mommy will be right with you.
"Aphrodite, Venus."
"Gaea, the Earth."
"And Selene became Luna, the moon."
"Ares, Mars."
"Zeus, Jupiter."
"And Cronus, Saturn."
"""The gods march in rank."""
Exactly.
"Now, according to Royal Observatory records, uh, this orbital alignment happens only once every five hundred years."
And it will next take place in two days.
"And that, I mean, if we are to believe Solon's riddle, is when the Treasure of Atlantis rises."
But where is the treasure?
"Well, legend says that it's hidden in the Tower of Fear."
"And, uh, the Greek word for ""fear"" of course, is, uh Thera."
"Uh, where's the picture?"
There-
- There--
There was a picture.
The picture.
Where's the picture?
Yes.
I'll show you.
"Ah, here we are."
"Yes, here we are."
That's it.
"And there I am, MacGyver."
"There I am with your grandfather, and there is the Tower."
"Professor, you know that volcano is still active."
"Yes, I know."
But there are ruins near the crater.
Simon took me there once.
That's right.
DUD:
Not very.
DETECTIVE:
So how did you ID this Ray Malcolm?
DUD:
Neighborhood snoop across the street recognized Ray's car parked out front.
Did they see him?
"Mmm-mmm, but she did see a black guy with glasses come out a little while later, get in Ray's car, and split."
"She didn't even know Ray's last name, but she thought he was staying a couple blocks away with some dopers, so we checked it out."
Can you separate it?
Mmm-mmm.
Not yet.
That Ray's package?
So who's this black guy?
"They call him ""Pluto."""
"Evidently, he's been hanging with Ray for the last couple of weeks."
They say he's from out of town.
Pluto.
That's it?
For now.
So who's the girl?
Fantasia.
Bullshit.
Good-looking.
Ray's old lady.
Here...
Listen to this.
(TAPE REWINDING)
(ELECTRONIC DISTORTED VOICES) What are you...
JACKIE:
"Hey, girl, I thought you were going to... (DISTORTED VOICES)"
"Bobby, look who's here."
Why don't we let Dr. Lockhart present the case?
-Absolutely.
-She's disoriented.
She's repeating questions.
I just wanna get another CT.
-How long here?
-About six hours.
"Luka, your malrotation in Exam 4 is puking blood."
-l'll check back.
"-Yeah, well-- ls she responding to commands?"
Yes.
Hand squeeze and eye opening.
"Rule of thumb, if the patient's exam is non-focal..."
"... andrespondingto commands, just observe and wait."
-Dr.
"Clemente, Ortho on line 2."
C-spine's clear.
Get her off the board.
Pulse ox 97 on two liters.
"When you say a truck, do you mean they were driving an SUV or a pickup?"
"SUV, it was blue or black."
It was definitely black.
"- Okay, Judy, we're going to sit you up."
"- Ow, my chest!"
"Did you see the driver or any of the passengers, ma'am?"
There were at least two of them.
"The driver was young, a teenager."
"White, black, Hispanic, Asian, what?"
White.
I'm not sure about the passenger.
Lungs are clear.
BP 112/78.
Or you're just acting blind to the truth that we're husband and wife!
And the way to Bela is the only thing I remember.
Can't you understand that?
"I don't want to understand it because I'm so tired of you, Migs."
"Well, I'm tired too."
I can't take it anymore.
One more chance?
I will change.
"If I would keep you hoping, you'll get hurt even more."
"Migs, I need you."
I'm begging you.
-I'm here for you now.
-What are you doing here?
.
This is wrong.
-Wrong!
-Wrong?
.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My heart and mind says you're the one I love.
You're the one my heart is screaming out.
"But what if, what if your memory comes back?"
How?
What if the accident really happened so I can come back to you?
.
I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What did she say?
.
"Hello, this is Joy."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
Yep.
"They're both cold, heartless war machines."
"Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
I hope my dad's all right.
I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
What about you?
I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq."
Looking for me?
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
"Yes, I did."
Stop!
He's mine.
You are not the true chief.
I am.
And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
- And so am I.
- And I to be here.
"Before I forget, I must give you Mrs Jennings' and Mrs Palmers' regards."
Oh.
"Miss Marianne, I hope you will not think me too forward, but I have brought you a gift."
- That lovely box.
- And its contents.
Please open it.
Whatever can it be?
"Oh, books!"
"Oh, thank you, Colonel."
It is only a very modest treasure chest.
"""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""."
- Will it not be too difficult for me?
"- Oh, by no means."
"You may find it even more exciting than ""The Mysteries of Udolpho""."
But I shall have hundreds of questions to ask you.
My children.
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.
"I had somethin' last night, ruined my appetite."
"Besides, I gotta get down the road."
Okay.
Thanks for the ride.
"Come on, I'll buy you a cup of tea and a bromo."
-Come on.
"-Okay, but I can only stay a minute."
Good.
"Okay, we open."
Come in.
-Where's the john at?
Ahem.
"Okay, you're not helping, really, with my nerves here, so I gotta go."
Goddamn it.
"Hi, I'm Lucy Miller."
Um...
You must be Maggie.
I'll be representing you.
"I brought warm, comforting beverages."
Or what's left of them.
The rest is on my new white shirt that I wore to impress you.
"Uh, can we sit?"
Great.
Oh.
Sorry about your chips.
Um...
"Look, uh, yours is not a hopeless case."
Seems pretty hopeless to me.
Hm.
I can see that.
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
They do have your son's voice on the 911 call.
I don't even know what happened to me.
I didn't mean to scare him.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
"You know, um, I'm scared too."
You're scared?
This is my first day in the field.
That's comforting.
I volunteered.
I specifically wanted your case.
A charity case.
Because I think I can help you.
Is that what you want?
"If we stay around here, we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Very good.
Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
"Jimmy, I don't know."
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
Okay?
"As soon as you talk to him, e's got to call me."
It's very important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this.
It's a couple of thousands.
"- Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry.
"I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time."
"Thank you, Sheriff."
But you know I can't go just yet.
"Well, why not?"
I'm not sure these tires can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
"Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?"
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
"Grazie, Mr. Lightning."
Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!
"I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!"
"All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got."
No!
"No, no, no."
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
"They say, ""Look at me!"
Here I am!
"Love me. """
"All right, you're the expert."
She thinks she's doing her job.
I am going to pull him from her class.
Don't overreact.
The agency said there was gonna be emotional scarring.
"Hey, give it back!"
How could you like to be his parents?
Where are my baby fish?
Mr. Michaelson bought them for his aquarium.
They were mine!
They were grown up.
It was time for them to have their own home.
You had no right to sell them!
"- Mikey, what's wrong with you?"
- They were mine!
Calm down.
They were only fish.
You don't care about how I feel.
You don't love me.
I hate you
Calm down.
Stop it.
"When Daddy gets home, we'll talk about it."
He's not my real daddy.
You're not my real mother!
I hate you!
I wish I never met you!
"Mikey, wait!"
( Door Slamming )
I'm sure there's an explanation.
If we could just get him to talk.
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.
He died of love.
"I mean, he must have been killed by a jealous lover."
Makes sense.
This was brutal.
"Marshal, could it be White Tiger?"
- According to my calculations...
"- Not him, right?"
- Could be.
"- Yes, yes."
- After serious consideration...
- It's him.
Not him.
The Marshal is right.
I came from the North to GuangZhou just to catch White Tiger.
Minor cases like this should be settled at your level.
"If you don't solve this, you'll come to regret it."
I'll regret it!
"Marshal, Marshal!"
"Marshal, you're here all the way from the North."
Come for dinner tomorrow.
- OK.
"- Please, please, please..."
"Sifu Tam, we haven't been asked to perform our lion dance at the start."
Why not?
They asked Wong Fei-hung.
Wong Fei-hung again?
His birthday's in a few days.
"Junior, deliver a birthday robe to him."
He'll like the robe I make him.
"Foon, it's my birthday in a few days."
Are we ready?
"- Yes, Sifu."
- Getting ready for the theater.
Theater?
Sure.
It's Laura's opening night.
- I forgot.
- You promised to come.
"Yeah, but..."
- I couldn't stand it tonight.
- Why not?
I had my share of amateur dramatics today.
You're mean.
It's supposed to be really good this time.
Can't we lie in bed and watch TV instead?
How original.
"""A Streetcar Named Desire""..."
perhaps it's on TV tonight.
Vivian Leigh instead of Laura Kirsch.
"Marco, I have to go, and I want to."
- You can come here and watch TV.
- Yeah?
"Yes, I'll tell Laura you're ill."
Yeah?
"Yeah, see you soon."
"My God, they're full to bursting."
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
Please.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
I weigh what I weighed...
How much do you think this exclusive casserole set costs?
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.
Really.
Please try to forgive me and understand.
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.
If I'd known it was down there...
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.
Please try to forgive me.
"If you need anything, just call me."
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.
"Phil, when you get a chance, take a look at this article."
It has been a day!
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.
Had me running back and forth.
I can't wait to get out of here.
No.
I'm talking about the one right there.
No.
"Look over there, girl."
Stop.
He's all right with me.
He's cute.
Of course he's cute.
That's why I'm telling you to look.
"You having a problem there, Jessica?"
Yes.
"I put my money in there, and it keeps eating my money."
I can see through their clothes.
This is weird.
That's hilarious.
Get me some soup.
Yep.
Uh-oh.
"Thequestionis ,willthe  House pass the bill as amended?"
This is a 15-minute vote.
"Oh, my God."
My ass is killing me from that shot.
But I feel pretty good.
Really?
- Ma'am.
- What?
"Oh, boy."
Here we go.
It's like I want my baby to live.
I don't want my baby to die.
"Maybe think of it more of as a bill, which in a very real way is what it is."
- Mm.
- There's Pierce.
He even walks dumb.
"Every time I see him, I hear circus music."
"Come on, Owen."
"It's your time to shine, you dim fucking bulb."
- He voted no.
We lost the vote.
- Oh!
We are victorious in defeat.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
"Okay, so I lost the vote."
I won by not winning.
"God, I don't know how I feel."
"Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head."
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
"Hey, you speak Italian?"
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
"Abbandando, meet my nephew!"
How's business?
"It's good, it's good."
Fanucci's mad.
Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy.
"People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount."
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure.
He wants double from everybody.
Even from my father.
"I'm a friend, right?"
So you'll let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
"You've always been good to me, ever since I came here."
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
"Oh, no!"
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway.
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
- Don't bother.
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's not very...

It really isn't.
"You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole."

Station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
"""I didn't mean what I just said."
"And, anyway, you said worse."""
It was a declaration.
"- ""Stupid bloody fool"" was good."
Did you think of that beforehand?
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
No.
What I'm trying to say is that... if all of this stopped... the sparring and the jibing and the insults and the arguments...
I'd miss it.
"Even if I were dead,"
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.
On and on and on and on and on.
He'll be coming soon then.
Though I hope that's after the bill is passed through.
Why do you look so weak?
Eat some of the chicken that you love and be strong!
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo is so pitiful.
I know Chairman Cheon Jae Man too...
That person did that...
There is no trustworthy person in this world.
Everything is pitiful.
Everything is scary.
Unnie take this.
What?
This is a man's?
Give it to Go Ki Joon!
Go Ki Joon!
?
Did you change to Go Ki Joon!
?
Unni... do you not have any sense?
You and Go Ki Joon go well together.
Me and Go Ki Joon ssi?
You two date.
I came for Da Hye's tutoring.
Go in.
Is this what you came to find?
You really are fearless.
Even entering the President's study.
It seems you don't know when to stop.
Stopping...
Doesn't quite suit me.
Let me ask you one question.
What is the reason that you're doing this?
That's all.
"Keep an eye on them, Seymour."
"Company, attention."
Fall out for five minutes.
"Oh, Quigley."
Come here.
I've already warned you a couple of times this week.
Look at yourself.
"Well, what's your excuse this time?"
Walking around on my knees to give my arches a rest.
Let me see your hands.
Ever try using soap and water?
Let me see the other one.
I thought so.
You heard what Mr. Jeffries said.
That's your last warning.
If you're late again you'll be dismissed.

"""Coming:"
"Edward G. Robinson in Dark Hazard. """
- We've gotta get a load of that guy.
"- Yeah, he's not bad."
You got a Mickey Mouse on the bill today?
"No, not today."
"What, no Mickey Mouse?"
"- No, no Mickey Mouse."
- Why?
He's making a personal appearance in Jersey City.
"Oh, you're trying to kid somebody, huh?"
"Well, open the door!"
Okay.
"Hi, Wilbur, how are you?"
I'm in no mood to get engaged today.
"Do you feel all right, Wilbur?"
I'm fine.
"What's on your mind, baby?"
"Well, Mrs. Brendan wanted to see you in her office right away."
Why?
She didn't say.
I'll walk back with you if you want me to.
"Okay, but no swans."
No swans.
Get my coat!
"Sure, sure."
Skeets!
Yes?
(WHISTLING)
Nothin'.
Wilbur's a very remarkable boy.
"In this day and age, it's so difficult to rear a child properly."
Yes.
I wouldn't give you 10-to-1 on a boy like Wilbur living to grow up.
"Oh, that's a little on the pessimistic side, Mr. Hoolick."
"All right, I'll make it 8-to-1."
"Oh, really."
"Here he is, Mrs. Brendan."
"Hello, Mrs. Brendan, did you want to... (STUTTERING)"
Surprised?
Of course he is.
I've had a hard time catching up with Wilbur.
Now you have him back safe and sound.
I can smell it.
"You know, somehow Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of."
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
"What are you thinking of, Buck?"
"Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking."
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
"It's getting late, Jack."
Think I'll say good night.
"Not guilty, Your Honor."
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
"Oh, boy!"
"Hey, somebody pinch me."
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
"My, oh, my, oh, my."
I do declare.
Hey!
"Hey, boss!"
Boss!
"Come here, quick."
Hmm.
Look at this.
"Oh, my."
Oh.
"Lookit, lookit!"
Tell me if I'm dreamin'.
"Oh, I shouldn't worry about that."
He's an actor.
"Unless you review them, have intercourse with them, or do both simultaneously, they don't remember you."
"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce you now to a young man to whom we all owe a great deal."
Soon we hand him back to the RAF for a very different kind of shooting.
"Until then, he is our very own American."
- Mr. Carl Lundbeck.
- Hi.
Hello.
"- Alex Frayle, director."
Hi.
Good to meet you.
Wyndham Best.
How do you do?
I'm playing Johnnie.
"Carl Lundbeck, Flight Lieutenant."
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Mr. Hilliard.
- If I've got the right--
Mr. Ambrose Hilliard.
Yes.
"Sir, I saw every Inspector Charnforth picture there ever was."
Just used to go right back and watch them again.
Oh!
"""You see, someone has made a mistake."""
"""A simple mistake, but easy to miss."""
Yes!
Oh!
"Sir, I need to wire my mom."
There's our secret weapon.
Now you write him in.
Do yourself a favor.
"When you get home, turn on the Hallmark channel."
Just live in it for a few hours.
"Brian, just stop, all right?"
"- All right, but I just think..."
- Brian.
"Oh, shit, that's Dad's room."
Dad.
You!
You told me to go into the light.
- What?
"- Oh, yeah."
There was a light.
"I almost walked right into the goddamn thing, you ungrateful little shit."
You wanted me dead.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
And I'm a freaking five?
I said you were making a comeback.
I'm a goddamn ten.
I'm just...
I'm just glad you're alive.
"I know you are, kid."
I'm just breaking your balls.
Look at this.
I've been up ten minutes.
Already my Tinder is blowing up.
"Yeah, all right."
"- How do you feel, Mr. Farrell?"
- Never better.
These comas are a dynamite way to catch up on your sleep.
I might need another one in a couple of months.
Being single is exhausting.
Says...
"Emily Post, I've heard."
"Well, Emily post is also a divorcée, so she would definitely be on my side."
And a delicious man like that shouldn't go to waste.
Don't you want Paul to be happy?
Of course I do.
"Yeah, he's-- he's lost his wife, and you are recently divorced, so..."
So...
you don't mind playing Cupid?
"Also, certainly, a thank you to Coach Masters for his-- his help on the field."
- Paul...
- Yeah?
"You remember Stephanie, Jacob's mom."
Of course.
Hi.
How are you?
"You may not be aware, but Stephanie is, uh-- she's recently divorced."
"Oh, well, that got to the point."
To the--
"Oh, you're setting us up."
It was my idea.
I know.
"But at some point, I thought, ""Why be coy?"""
She's right.
"I mean, you're both single, you're both smart and nice."
Smart and nice.
Wow.
"Stephanie, can I offer you a refill?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Here you go.
"Woof, woof."
Hello.
I've come to see Rose and Lily Starling.
I'm not to talk to papers.
I'm not to let no one in.
I'm not from the papers.
I'm from the Ministry of Information.
The Film division.
Film?
And then you went to Dunkirk?
We meant to.
But the engines stopped five miles out.
Broken bearing.
We never got there.
"But in the paper...it said, you got home troops."
This steam tug on it's way back gave us a tow.
Soldiers spilling' over the rails.
"So we pulled someone in, see."
Someone seen us docking' and put it in the paper.
They got the wrong end of the stick.
Didn't they?
"Dad said, we'd be a laughin' stock."
"Said, ""You mustn't tell the papers""."
But you write in the papers.
For the pictures?
Can Lily ask you somethin'?
Yes.
Have you ever met Robert Donat?
The famous actor?
No.
"No, I haven't I'm afraid."
Dad!
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
I think I can stand that.
[Greta snarling]
DAVE:
Scrub right here.
[Shower running]
[Monique gasps]
What the?
Oh well.
"Hey, this isn't so bad."
[Monique giggling]
"Dave, what's that?"
[Doorbell ringing]
I'd better see who it is.
I'm gonna check the breaker box.
The breaker switch jumped off for some reason.
"Hey, who was at the door?"
MONIQUE:
"Whoever it was, they left."
"OK, Richard."
"Stand there by the front, over there"
A little closer to the center.
That's about right.
"OK, now, I'm gonna kick the car out of gear."
"OK, you got it."
Can you hold it?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I can hold it."
I'm not gonna push it far off hill though.
"Well, uh, tell you what, now."
What I want to do is to kind of ease up on it a little bit.
"Like, you know, let it... as if you"
Were gonna let it roll forward and pick up a little momentum.
"Thank-- Thank everybody, please."
"- Yeah, just let us know."
- Just let us-
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- If you get some more info.
- If there's an update.
- Yeah.
Um...
Guys.
"Look, this is the hard part."
Pete's gone.
"- Yeah, I know."
"- No, I mean, like, when someone is missing..."
"Hey, we've had more manpower on this than we've ever had looking for someone."
"I mean, I've got the fire department involved in looking for him and I hate firemen."
- No.
"- No, it means a lot."
- Yeah.
"- Ricky, thank you."
- No.
What Iâm trying to say is...
"You know, someone in Pete's condition?"
He didn't go anywhere.
He couldn't have gone anywhere.
He's gone.
He's in the river or something.
And it's hard when a body doesn't--
Doesn't turn up.
"Look, this isn't the first time I've had to have this talk, but... when it's people you know, it's hard."
"- What are you trying to say, Ricky?"
"- Horace, he's gone."
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr. Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr. Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
Hey.
"Hey, Benigno."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
Want to come?
I'm meeting my editor.
"People, please, move out of the way, please."
Keep this door open.
"Come on, open the door."
- Bring him in.
Is he conscious?
"- No, ma'am."
"- Oh, my God."
- Calm down.
He's going to be all right.
He's going to be all right.
We'll cut him right here.
Gauze.
- That's good.
- On your left.
"Thank you, nurse."
"Dr. Simmons, take a look at this."
Heavenly father...
I know everything happens for a reason... so I'll just leave it in your hands.
Amen.
Excuse me.
I need somebody to talk to about my friend.
I'm worried about his condition.
What time you get off work?
I just want to discuss his condition.
Visiting hours are over.
Good night.
"You're doing much better, Mr. Reed."
Don't try to talk.
You need your rest.
"My name is Vanessa, and I'm going to take great care of you."
Understand?
Just push the button on the side of the bed... and I'll be there.
"- Oh, this is your car, right?"
- Yep.
See?
Fixed it.
Okay.
You're backing up?
Just fucking go straight.
"I took a precision driving class, Dan."
I think I know what I'm doing.
"Ma'am, we've lost Pierce."
I'm sorry.
We should have hired Navy SEALs instead of those two actual seals.
How do you lose a whole person?
"A cuff link I get, but not a person."
Okay.
She said she's losing her voice.
Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.
"- Oh, my God."
- Jesus.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"She said you fucked up, Ben."
And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.
You need to get him out.
"- She didn't say that, Gary."
"- Yes, she did."
"Everyone, shut your fucking holes!"
The president is not sick.
- You guys are.
You're parasites.
You're like an infestation of mediocrity.
I don't care if you're a 1950s radio broadcaster.
Go!
Thank you.
Get out!
Do you still love me?
I gave you my reasons.
Do you still love me?
"Say ""I do not love you."""
Say it!
Say it!
I do not love you.
You're a liar!
"You did the right thing, coming to see me."
I do not have anyone else.
You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?
Yes.
"You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love."
Only one course remains open to you.
What do I have to do?
There's someone you should meet.
Who?
His name is Guibourg.
Who is he?
He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.
Where shall I find him?
Monsieur Guibourg?
Yes?
I need your help.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the Marquise de Montespan.
And how may I help you?
I need to reclaim a man's love.
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
"-Oh, that is cold."
"-No, it's not."
It's clear.
"You're gonna keep me in my place, are you?"
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
"Well, I'm not moving, for your information."
"You can work your tough-girl thing, but I know you're in love with me."
That's irrelevant.
"Kind of tired, babe."
You know?
-You're up early.
"-I know, and I'm not happy about it."
-You need some Valium?
-I don't wanna get back into that again.
"Yeah, that wouldn't be good."
Try swimming.
It helps.
-So how are you?
How's work going?
-Good.
-Just not sleeping enough myself.
"-Oh, I'm sure."
-Hospital's been busy.
"-A lot of psychos, huh?"
"No, just a lot of pained souls."
"Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex."
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex.
I like her a lot.
My job with you always comes first.
I promise.
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
"I like the other one better, the one on the trolley cars."
What do you think?
I don't know.
"Oh, my God."
It's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that.
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
"I can't believe it, either."
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember your predecessor, Marissa Kessler?"
Murder victim?
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Randy and the Captain are probably already there.
It should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24. 24. 24.
Are you done?
Sorry.
Let's do this.
What's the guy's name again?
"Yes, certainly I am."
Do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault?
What?
What?
I was too permissive?
"No, no, no, no."
"I'm not talking about the liberal child-rearing sense, Mom."
You blame everybody but yourself.
"You go out of your way, it's me, it's Kevin, it's Dad."
Where were you in the picture?
Do you ever think about that?
I don't see any ocean out there.
This is a terrible place to come to.
Please!
Please!
Just one minute!
One minute!
It's for my little girl.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
This must happen every night.
"Yeah, it's like ""Sophie's Choice"" in here."
What do you need?
I need a grass Hawaiian skirt for a hula.
"There's miriachis, which would be Mexico..."
Coconut cup?
Closer...
Ukelele...that's a good sign.
Sorry.
"No, don't tell me that."
Don't tell me that.
"Look, I'm sorry."
Judgment Day.
"Hey, everyone, Dermot O'Leary's about to defuse this bomb."
You ready?
Yeah.
Do it.
Return?
"Return, enter."
"Oh, shit!"
Jesus!
Oh!
Looks like we need a new mayor.
What in the name of Satan's arsehole is that?
!
"I told you to save him, not blow him up!"
"Sorry about that, boss."
Sorry about that?
!
Is that your fault?
"Well, it was O'Leary, sir, he, er, completely went for it."
He went rogue and started typing things into the computer...
I didn't go rogue.
"Anyway, you said you 100% trust me, I didn't go rogue."
"Oi, big boy, look at me, yes."
"Explanation now, yes!"
"OK, I thought the killer and the kidnapper was Miley Cyrus."
Did you?
Yeah.
"Right, why?"
"She had motive, there was a bypass going to go through the old people's home."
"I thought the old people loved the VHS, she knew her way around a VHS."
And the...
And the delivery of the ransom note was in VHS.
um... i'm sorry that i called so late -- or early -- but i'm worried about mom.
i think she's leaving us.
and i'm sorry if i woke you up.
and merry christmas.
[phone beeps] [sighs]
[doorbell rings]
- right on... [weight jangling] ...everything.
[speaks indistinctly] uh-huh.
[dog barks in distance] make sure you're in focus.
[breathes deeply]
well [chuckles] finally come to your senses?
want to spend some quality time with the rattail?
- do you have a second to talk?
- yeah.
"it's gonna have to be on the road, though."
i'm leaving for yuma tonight.
- oh.
"well, it's christmas."
"- yeah, well, i got a match tonight... [sniffs] ""x-man for xmas."""
"hey, you know what?"
you should come.
- hmm.
"well, that's kind of what i wanted to talk to you about."
- really?
[birds chirping]
- is it christmas yet?
"- yeah, skoal."
it's christmas.
- where's mama?
- i don't know.
"[phone rings] [phone beeps] hello, mama?"
"- no. hey, buddy."
"Pussycat, nice."
"Station him, park him for a bit."
"Oh, there's another animal coming along, what's that animal?"
Kangaroo.
Kangaroo and a pussycat.
Yeah.
They're fighting.
Yeah.
Who's winning?
The pussycat.
Let the pussycat kill the kangaroo.
OK.
So who's won?
Pussycat.
That is your spirit animal.
"Aah, that's nice."
You could've been anything you wanted to be in the world and you chose a pussycat.
You're a curious goat.
"Yes, I know, but..."
What I need you to do now is call to your guide.
"Make the cries of the pussy cat to the heavens,"
Sleet and I will join you.
DERMOT MEOWS SLEET BLARES
"It's a very quiet pussy cat, Dermot."
"Sleet, Sleet, that's great, can we hold the goat for a second?"
"Keep going, Dermot."
Sounds like a very sad pussy cat.
Or an owl.
"Sounds more like an owl, doesn't it?"
More like a sort of...
"Imagine, just a bit angrier."
HE HISSES
Michael's father had a Winchester single-shot.
I think I may still have it.
Soyou want a beer?
You kiddin'?
Doug is sleeping peacefully.
- You gave him something.
- Maybe.
"Well, half ofsomethin'."
Sam got in touch with his buddy at the U.S. Attorney's.
Bringing Doug in tomorrow mornin'.
Great.
We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You thinkyou can let the job be whoyou are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think thatyou can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been--
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."
Don't deny it.
Fine.
"Isn't it interesting that she turned out to be... well, who she turned out to be?"
- What shall we make ofthat?
"- Madeyour point, Fi."
We could've missed something.
All right?
"Look, here's the plan."
We're gonna...
"Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them."
Then we'll run.
There is no plan.
What are you gonna do with that?
I don't know.
I shouldn't have borrowed that money.
"No, Blair, this is not your fault."
Okay?
It's not.
All right.
Two kids come back from Christmas break.
"The first kid says to the second kid,"
I had the best Christmas ever.
"Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team."
What did you get?
"Second kid says, I only got a sweater."
"First kid says, why."
Second kid says...
"It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy."
I know you're scared.
"No, it's..."
Actually kind of funny.
I'm pregnant.
What?
Oh my God.
I'm not.
I...
I just wanted to know what it would feel like to say that.
"I know what Anna is, and I know that you know."
"So tell me, do you have any idea where she is?"
No.
"But, Jer..."
"Jeremy, wait."
Jeremy.
[SIGHS THEN GASPS]
Isobel.
- What are you doing here?
"- I'm your mother, Elena."
I wanna be more involved in your life.
- I don't want you in my life.
- I understand that.
You already have a lot of people you care about.
But I've been studying.
Let's see if I got this right.
"There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie."
Gonna stay away from that one.
"The sad little brother, Jeremy."
And there's Caroline.
Obnoxious Caroline.
"I got all of my info from her, by the way."
"She had no idea who I was, and she wouldn't stop yapping."
Aww.
And there's Matt.
"Friend, ex, Yappy's future ex."
Lots of connections there.
- Matt's not involved in this.
"- He's involved with you, isn't he?"
"Look, you shouldn't be here."
You need to leave.
No.
You didn't even think about it.
what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just got to get a key.
No problems?
I'll take care of it.
Tell him what you were telling me.
Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.
Americans change their money over into French money and send it back here.
Calm down.
It's beautiful.
totally untraceable.
but I got a plan.
he's a piece of work.
all cash.
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it.
It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.
It's beautiful.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Oh.
Oh.
"Very well, Eric, uh, as you wish."
What a IoveIyIittIe bride I'IImake
Mydear I'IIIookdivine
Thingsare working out according to myuItimate design

The sea witch!
"Oh, no!"
She's gonna-
- I gotta--
Ariel!
Ariel!
"Ariel, I was flying-- I was--"
"Ofcourse I was flying, and I-I saw the-- the watch--"
The witch was watchin' the mirror... and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?
"I mean, when it's important?"
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun sets on the third day.
"Ariel, grab onto that."
"Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you."
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
- Wh-What about me?
What about me?
- You!
Why won't these people let me do my job?
I know!
What's that stuff you're always playingwith?
"""Silly Putty""!"
It calms me down.
"'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""?"
I love them.
- They're the best band!
"- You know ""Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""!"
"Totally! ""The Americans"" is my favorite song!"
"That's impossible, no one in the States knows them."
I saw them when they went to London last March...
- in Cambridge.
- That's insane!
I was there!
Get out of here!
You were there?
That's crazy!
I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?
"- Well, I designed that, actually."
- Do you know them?
Bob Green and I went to Eton together.
"Paul, I've been looking everywhere for you."
"Everywhere except my office, I guess."
I heard you were in the shitter.
Roxanne needs you to discuss the concept for the cover shoot...
"Pardon me, Jocelyn."
"Hey, cut it out."
You can't go through his drawers.
- Does he not smoke?
What is this?
My mother says she's well.
Has she eaten or not?
"Yesterday evening, she took her a meal."
She didn't touch it.
My young uncle fed her.
He's fallen out with my mother.
They don't speak.
Why?
He wanted to feed her?
No.
They fell out a long time ago.
"Why is he your ""young uncle""?"
- How many do you have?
- Three.
- Are the others older?
- Yes.
Bravo.
Where are they?
"One is in Ahwaz, the other in Kermanshah and I don't know where the third one is."
Don't they visit their mother?
"Yesterday evening, my uncle told my mother that his holidays were over."
But they've fallen out.
How did he tell her?
My uncle speaks to her but my mother doesn't reply.
- The others aren't coming?
- No.
"Yesterday, my uncle told my mother that he has to go back."
He's leaving then?
Yes.
What about us?
I don't know.
I have exams that I have to take.
H i.
Very funny.
So I guess you've heard.
Sharon's dad is okay.
That's great.
"No, I hadn't heard."
I'm obviously the last person in Pittsburgh to hear.
- So you're friends with Sharon now?
"- Well, so, you are, right?"
Look.
"We all know what's going on around here, okay?"
- Which is that you are jealous.
- What?
And you.
You are totally flipped because...
Rayanne finally did something nice for once in her life.
Which she did by taking Sharon to go visit her dad.
And now both of you just want to be sure that you both still are friends.
Which you are.
So shut up!
Let's kill him.
"Say a prayer, Vasquez."
I'm going to kill him.
"- l've been knocking, but..."
- What?
Your mom let me in.
I came to drop off your bag.
- What are you listening to?
- A group you probably hate.
"Okay, I'll go."
I'm glad your dad is going to be okay.
My father almost died.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know.
I don't want to let them down.
"No, of course not."
"Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not so very far off.
"No, it's not so very far off."
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
I've ordered cutlets Milanese... and semolina... pudding.
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?
Yes.
"I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister."
Ah.
His office.
"Last night, he was working late."
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I am unable.
Mr. Hilliard?
Mr. Hilliard?
"I'm afraid, my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did so myself.
"You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers missing from his left hand."
"I'm sorry, we try very hard to... to make a whole person."
For the relatives.
Oh!
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent.
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
bob?
bob?
[baby crying]
- have you seen tim?
- no. why?
- he isn't here?
- i don't know.
i just got here.
- why don't you ever know anything?
- i... i know she's -  he might not even -  hey.
you're all here!
come on. come on in.
- honey.
"oh, honey, what happened to your hair?"
and where are your glasses?
"- look at me, mom."
i'm cool!
"- i don't understand why she -  can you calm down, you beast, okay?"
his haircut ain't gonna cost you nothing.
"it's a freebie, and i can't believe i'm even saying that."
all right. hop down.
[grunts] - aah!
"- i think you might still need these, though."
come here.
- this is lovely.
"yeah, he's got it."
"- so you just remember that cool comes from the inside, okay?"
mwah!
hee-haw!
- how did you pull this off?
- let's just say that... mama made me do it.
"- mama, can we open our presents now?"
Hey.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
"Look, I wanted to say thanks for the other night."
You always drink like that?
I thought you left.
I did.
I am.
"Ryan, we're all set."
You ready?
"Hi there, Marissa."
What are you doing?
Nothing.
We're just hanging out.
"Oh, look, it's somebody's birthday."
I guess my invitation probably got lost in the mail.
It's my friend Summer's birthday.
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.
That's what I heard.
I don't know.
That was a guess.
You guys are up to something.
"Dude, what did you tell her?"
I didn't tell her anything.
I think the black turtleneck in August tipped her off.
"Okay, I was going for stealth, and also it's slimming."
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.
You should probably be off.
Newport social scene awaits.
"Oh, yeah?"
Why won't you tell me where we're going?
This is pretty far away.
"Irene Bentley, I'm arresting you under suspicion of assisting an offender."
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man recently?
No.
"Thank you, sir."
Yes?
"- Excuse me, sir."
My name's DC Ashton...
No.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man before?
"- No, sorry."
- Sure?
"Yeah, I'm sure."
I didn't know you were back.
We've brought in Renee Bentley.
I came back to join the manhunt... but I've just been sat in here for half an hour.
You need to see this.
Hudson and I found it in the Bentley lock-up.
It matches the bracelet Julie-Ann was wearing when she died.
"Yes, sir."
Understood.
Absolutely.
"Thank you, sir."
Super's finished the next-of-kin visit.
Think I'm gonna head off and see 'em myself.
Could you pass these on?
"It's the Guv's watch and wallet, and his warrant card."
"- Sarge, if you need a WPC..."
- Tennison...
"Like you said, I need to keep busy."
It's his wife and kids.
SlPOWlCZ:
"Ernie, listen to me."
- What?
- Was there anything good?
- What do you mean?
"If you stop now and nobody gets hurt, you won't have to go away."
"But before any of this, was there anything good in your life?"
"Yeah, I had my chair set up how I wanted."
Chicky and me had some things worked out.
"All right, you got your chair back, and I'm going to put Chicky in jail but I never noticed any shortage of whores in town."
"Now, come on, Ernie."
"What do you say, huh?"
"Come on, Ernie."
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Just relax now.
Come on.
That's it.
And he has to absolutely speak to me?
"Okay, I'll be right down."
KELLY:
You okay?
"- Yeah, thanks."
How you doing?
No fun busting this guy.
I think he's gonna get ROR'd.
- The booking's clear.
- Thanks.
DONNA:
"Detective, here's your file."
- I gotta take you to get fingerprinted.
- Thanks for the coffee.
Turn the cannons on them!
Turn the cannons!
"Break them, Lo!"
What's happening?
I can't see what's happening to my boys!
What's happening to my boys?
"Major, give me your glasses."
There's a rebel.
Take him prisoner.
"Will you help me up, please?"
"Sir, could you tell me what your name is?"
Who you are?
I would like to see General Hancock.
Do you know where General Hancock may be found?
"I'm sorry, sir."
The general is down.
- He's been hit.
- No!
Not both of us.
Not all of us.
"Please, God."
"Sir, we're having a surgeon come as quickly as we can."
"Can you hear me, son?"
"Yes, sir."
I can hear you.
Will you tell General Hancock that General Armistead sends his regrets?
Will you tell him how very sorry I am?
"I will tell him, sir."
I will tell him.
"General Webb, sir."
"Let go of the horse, Major."
"Major Sorrel, I said let go of the horse."
- Hold on.
- What?
I hope this is the fever talking.
This lack of compassion and tolerance is very disappointing.
- That is not the little girl I raised.
- You guys are disgusting.
What was that?
"I told you, we should've had more Jewish friends."
[Whispers] You never told me that.
"Yeah, you suck!"
We're friends of the Jewish people!
- We don't have any.
- We've got a couple.
"No, not one."
Nick is half Jewish.
Who's Nick?

"Vanessa, hey, it's Nate."
"I need to... oh, shit, this guy is rich."
"Hey, uh, uh, I need to know if you sent that product, okay?"
"It's very important you call me, so pull your head out of that big mound of coke and..."
- [Beeps]
- Hold on a sec.
I think this is you.
Hello?
- [Laughing]
- Hello?
Vanessa?
"So you still coming down to Fort Lauderdale,"
I didn't do nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Stacey, put up that gun and listen."
You're sunk.
"I know it, big boy."
I just want you to listen to what this rat's gotta say.
Remember what happened to Limpy?
"In about two minutes, you're gonna get worse."
"Honest, Stacey."
I ain't done a thing.
"In two minutes, you're gonna get this .38 between the eyes."
"Don't shoot me, Stacey!"
I didn't never snitch on you.
I ain't talking about you snitching on me.
I'm talking about something I learned from Shake Edwards.
"No, I don't know nothing."
I'm talkin' about you framin' Ross into this joint.
Honest.
We never framed him.
[SCREAMS]
Start talking.
I can't.
I don't know.
"Wait, wait."
I'll talk.
Okay.
This is a confession without coaching.
"And it's gonna spring Ross, so remember it."
"Okay, canary."
Start singing.
Who framed Ross?
I did.
I don't want a dime extra.
And you're not gonna touch him again.
You hear me?
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again and I hope you don't...
I don't give a crap if he gives you a reason.
"You're not gonna touch him again, just say it."
"Billy, let's go."
You need to calm...
You need to tell your little brother...
"Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!"
"You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me?"
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...
Billy!
Billy!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
Hey!
Get out!
You are barking down the wrong tree!
Billy!
Go!
"Jesus Christ, Billy!"
"What are you thinking, man?"
Get in the truck!
"Barking up the wrong tree, Billy!"
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck.
Keep your little brother away from me.
Start the truck.
Start the truck.
I'm trying!
Segovia?
"Yes, to the jail."
The jail?
Yes.
I need to see Benigno Martin urgently.
I know it's irregular but it's a matter of life or death.
The Director is waiting for you in his office.
For me?
Where's his office?
The officer will accompany you.
This way.
On the right.
"Empty your pockets, please."
"Hey, wait, don't run!"
Wait.
It's there.
At the end.
Good morning.
I'm Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
"Dear Marco,"
It's still raining.
I think it's a good omen.
When Alicia had her accident it was raining.
I'm writing minutes before I escape.
I hope that all I've taken is enough to put me in a coma and reunite me with her.
You're my only friend.
I'm leaving you the house
I prepared for Alicia and me.
"Wherever they take me, come and see me, and talk to me."
"Tell me everything, don't be so secretive."
"Farewell, my friend."
Thank you.
This is good stuff.
Real good stuff.
Why are you driving me nuts?
Know how much I cried waiting for you?
You did?
I'm sorry.
Know how hard it was for me?
I was crying on the porch because of you.
Let me ask you something.
Please be honest.
Please.
"That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room?"
I'm getting sick of this.
It's that again?
I don't know.
Don't know anything anymore.
"Joongrae, don't lie to me."
"Please, don't lie."
Do whatever you want.
What did I do so wrong to deserve this?
What did I do?
I'm sick of it all.
"What's wrong with you, Moonsook?"
That's not important.
Somebody walked over me.
"You two walked over me, huh?"
"When I was outside, you two walked over me."
"I thought I was dreaming, but it was real."
I don't believe this.
"Walk over me, did you?"
How dare you?
"I don't mean that, but there's a..."
"Well, there is a certain way to do it."
"Oh, you mean little girls come with a set of instructions?"
No.
"No, what I mean is there are different kinds of kisses."
There.
Is that clear?
No.
Unless you mean little girls and little boys should kiss like this.
"Yes, yes, that's it."
Is that what I was doing?
"No, I'm..."
I'm afraid it wasn't.
You mean I was doing something like this.
Yes.
(STUTTERING) Yes.
That looked like what you were doing.
And I should have been doing this.
"Yes, that's it."
Now I'm all confused.
I forgot what I'm not supposed to do.
Wilbur.
"Oh, yeah."
I remember now.
(STUTTERING) That's enough!
"Hello, Bob."
Hello.
"Look, you stick to the little ones."
The big ones are mine.
"Now, don't... don't be silly."
I was just telling Willy here how to protect himself.
I don't think Wilbur needs protection.
What is it?
What's wrong?
"Sorry, it's just..."
Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits...
It's cooler.
"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
It is very cool.
Bow ties are cool!
"No, the room."
The room is getting colder.
She's coming back!
What's she going to do?
Is she going to punish me?
Uh... uh...
She's learnt not to melt.
"Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast."
She's going to eat you.
Run.
"Children, what is exp..."
Who the devil are you?
!
What are you doing in my house?
It's OK!
"I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs... kissing!"
"Captain Latimer, in the garden, there's snowmen!"
"And they're just growing, out of nowhere, all by themselves - look!"
"Good evening, I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife!"
This dwelling is under attack!
"Remain calm, human scum!"
So!
Any questions?
Okay.
Thanks very much for calling us.
Yeah.
Appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
( Clearing Throat )
Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today.
There was an accident at Ben's house.
Is Ben all right?
"Ben's all right,"
- but his sister's boyfriend is dead.
- What happended?
Some bizarre accident.
He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi.
I've been doing research into Mikey Trenton's background.
I really need to talk to you about this.
"Yeah, okay."
You go to your class.
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
"Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax."
"""Electric chair""?"
We were so stupid.
"Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid."
He was probably just changing the station or something.
I went in to answer the goddamned phone.
Do you believe there was some pervert on the line?
I'm glad you're not dead.
God!
I wish I was.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
Huh?
[ Gasps ] I'm falling!
"Oh geez, I'm falling."
Guys!
"Yeah, but if he did have a jet pack, he could just put it on upside down!"
"Uh, they still cant hear me!"
My phone!
I dropped my phone!
Why do my powers just keep coming and going?
I was just so happy to be home.
Wait!
That's it!
Happiness!
My floating power's tied to my emotions!
"[ Groans ] Right, just like all my stupid powers!"
Ooh!
"Okay, right, I can control this!"
I just have to think happy thoughts and no negative thoughts!
"So, what makes me happy?"
Donuts?
"No, I'm not gonna get any."
The beach!
"No, that's where I'm going to die."
[ Thud ]
Mom?
"Oh geez, those feelings are complicated."
"Come on, come on, brain, time's running out!"
I just need something that makes me happy!
Something I can always depend on to cheer me up!
♪
My guys!
They spent all night with me just to keep me company.
"Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager."
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
"In English, please."
- Sorry.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know.
I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
"If I were him, I'd only sign for 1 5."
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
"Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me."
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
"Of course, Mr. Vermont."
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
"You know, Americans are sticklers for details."
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
"Higaki, we're counting on you."
- We are counting on you!
- We are counting on you!
Isn't this what idiots say?
Don't be jabbering around me.
Apologize Higaki.
I can't forgive what you said just now.
"If I lose, I'll kneel on the floor to apologize."
"Higaki, you know what you gotta do?"
The day I lose to that chibi is the day I die.
I'm a pro.
Sixth match.
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.
You... are the pillar of Seigaku.
"Ah, you don't have to be so bothered, it's just a tennis game."
"But chibi, it doesn't matter what kind of genius you are, I won't give any chances."
I'm the real genius.

"Damn kid, dares to look down on me."
- I'm gonna get a palliative-care specialist...
- There must be something else you can do.
- To come down here and discuss your options.
- I will try anything... anything.
"I will try an experimental drug, uh, uh, more surgery."
"Uh, anything!"
I-I-I have to spend more time with my family.
I am not ready for this!
You...
"I'm sorry, Arthur."
You're sorry?
!
You're s-sorry.
"Mr. Janson, you need to wait in your room."
- Dr. Black will be with you.
"- I'm, uh..."
I'm trying to get to the elevator.
I heard there's a lobster truck outside.
I'm from Maine.
I-I can't pass up lobster.
"Oh, I-I can take him."
Hello.
I'm Jacob.
I'm a fellow traveler here.
"Uh, Larry..."
Larry Janson.
Do you like lobster?
"Well, my... my religion forbids shellfish, but I-I-I'd be happy to take you."
You just wait right here.
I'm just gonna get my coat.
God bless you.
And you.
"Mother, go now."
And remember...
"If anyone give you food, don't eat."
"Those crimnals, they mix something in the food."
And then they steal all the stuff.
Don't tell your name to anyone.
"Keep that in mind and wait... 25000, you might need it."
"Enough mother, stop crying."
"You have the gun, Right?"
Yes mother.
"You have the ammo, Right?"
Yes mother.
My son going to murder for the first time.
Mother don't you worry.
Stop crying.
Buying for the kid.
I don't have 100000 in the bag.
Which one is going to Pondi?
"The one, which is leaving..."
What are you looking at?
"This, Paharganj's peace."
It's Karolbagh's.
"It's can't be Karolbagh's, It's Paharganj's."
Khurana's stuff.
This not Khurana's stuff.
This is my wife.
"I'm not talking about your wife, I'm talking about her bra."
It's Khurana's stuff.
He sells this cheap stuff.
Why the police?
Stand in line everyone.
Open your bags.
"She loved me, you must understand."
"What, you think I don't understand love?"
It's better for the other.
- What's next?
- For what is above.
But you talk to God?
Could you not remain just for two minutes?
It would be sad.
- What isn't?
Open your eyes.
- I don't know how to see.
- But I know inside and I see later ...
- And have I came inside?
Young.
Want to check?
- So I'll be like your bitch!
"- No, you would not do."
And is this what you want?
"You are truly a beautiful asshole, cousin."
It's André.
"André, that's my cousin Leon."
André is a guy who fucks good.
"It is well established by my mother, and I was placed in his lap."
"Marivaux is nice, but side slut, he prefers me."
And once in America that could be done?
Mr. de La Fayette will give the instructions.
Aglaé!
- Aglaé!
- I come!
There is Simon there?
Who has two ...
There are two ...
- Capote.
- Capote?
- Capote.
Sweet tooth.
"Straight-up fag, Mr C."
- Flaming!
"- Thank you, Mr Ricard."
We can now promote you up to kindergarten.
Anybody else?
"Once, twice..."
"Miss Johnson, I apologise if any of this is over your head."
"If you see me after class, I'll give you some chapters."
Anybody?
It's a non-fiction novel.
"Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up."
He created a new genre.
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.
He took hardcore crime out of the ghetto and placed it in America's backyard.
That's what makes the book special.
"Yes, that's part of it."
That's all of it.
We got a debate going on now.
Capote wasn't first.
Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same.
"Wasn't nobody trying to read them, though."
A lot of people read them.
A lot of people like who?
You?
Didn't think so.
"Hey, yo!"
"Mr C, Mr C."
- His doctor?
I don't know.
"Oh, wait a minute. it could be a Dr Kessler."
"Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here."
"- Could you check with him, please?"
- Sure.
Let me check.
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I went to the market for five minutes and he's gone!
Where is Saul?
"- Take it easy, Lena."
- Rick won't tell me nothing!
- What's happened?
- Saul may have had a heart attack.
"- Oh, God, no!"
- It's all right.
We don't know yet.
- Is there any word?
"- No, not yet."
"Dr Kessler will be here in a moment, but he knows nothing of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack."
And international Life Support haven't dispatched an ambulance since last night.
Where is he?
What happened to Saul?
Where is he?
"Please, where is my husband?"
"Oh, Thomas."
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?
Why don't you just go and find my Saul instead of torturing me!
- Lena!
Officer?
"If she doesn't pay, it comes out of my pocket."
Why call the police?
We'll make her parents pay.
Do you really need the police?
I feel bad for her.
"What, are you willing to pay what she owes?"
"No, but..."
"She won't tell us her address, she's a runaway."
Hey!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey!
He's not coming back.
"He hasn't replied yet, right?"
You were tricked.
Shut up!
He said he's not doing that anymore.
He tells that lie to everyone.
Get your hands off me!
What're you doing here?
Ow...
Let's go.
He went and fought for her.
What about you?
They must be in round two.
Take it easy.
I have to go.
"Does your husband do this to you, too?"
"No, he won't even lay a finger on me."
Sergeant Fujita must be asleep with your kid now.
Don't...
"You're a naughty wife, leaving the kid to your husband."
"- Oh, the setup is all wrong."
I'm bound to wind up behind the eight ball with you.
What do you mean?
"Well, by your standards, I'm a wrong guy."
- You're the sweetest guy in the world.
"- No, you don't know what I mean."
- You don't know my racket.
- I don't care about your racket.
You sure?
"Not now, I don't."
Hello?
Mike.
That guy gets in your hair.
"- Hello, what do you want?"
- I'll tell you.
- You better get down here fast tonight.
- For what?
This Joe is on the loose.
They're stringing with him.
"I'm telling you straight, the guy threw me out."
You're frozen out.
Tell him to get here.
Tell him what he tried to do.
Louis is burned too.
He said Joe tried to hold him up today for cash.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, listen, you tell Louis I'm getting right down there."
"- Yeah, right away."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- What's wrong, Patsy?"
"- Oh, no, nothing."
Nothing at all.
There's been a breach in the sim room.
JEANINE:
Get me a remote feed.
I wanna see who the hell is in there.
"The cameras are down in the sector, too."
I'm sending guards there now.
Let's go.
Bring up every cell.
Now.
Show her.
Tori finally found a way to get 'em out safely.
EVELYN:
How many others?
Every last one.
Let's go.
SOLDIER:
"South corridor, 40 yards down."
Tris?
"Tris, come on, we gotta move."
"Tris, we have to move."
I can't.
I can't.
My mom died protecting whatever's inside of this.
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.
"Tris, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna get outta here."
I have to do this first.
"Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but you have to trust me, please."
"With my life, apparently."
MAN ON PA:
"All security teams, be advised, breach in..."
Do it.
MAX:
We had you in the top three for St Trinian's with Ricky from Kaiser Chiefs.
Did he do it in the end?
Yeah.
You weren't available.
LAUGHTER
Cheers(!
) That was a narrow miss.
Yeah.
What did you do before you became fabulous?
You were a beautician?
I was a beauty school dropout.
"Oh, lovely."
From Grease.
Now you're getting down to my level.
So that means you can look at people and make judgments.
Be very honest.
OK.
"Noel Fielding, Rob Brydon."
Two out there guys.
If you had to...
Give me a minute.
"If you had to pick, if you had to single out one for being a little bit styly..."
"Oh, I don't know."
It depends whether I like smart guys or Camden guys.
Suddenly there's a rivalry between us.
I like a bit of both.
Do you?
Oh...!
LAUGHTER
Did I?
"I wasn't, was I?"
I just didn't imagine I'd be having a threesome with Rob Brydon.
You didn't tell me about Amiri.
What's that got to do with it?
The difference between us is that I don't bug you.
Hide as much as you like.
"No, Dorona, the difference between us is that Ricky is crazy about you, God knows why."
"Amiri, on the other hand, just doesn't love me."
That's why he left.
"And yes, I'd love to be a surrogate mother for you if I could."
"Sure, sure."
"Look who's here, Elijah the Prophet."
Raziya says it's okay.
What?
You could have asked what my size is.
I asked Haziya.
You can come in it's a public place.
- Why did you come?
- To the sauna?
I'm cold.
To Paris.
Was it my brothers' idea?
- Then why?
- Because I love you.
- Those are just words.
"- True,"
- but they're kind words.
- For who?
- You're so beautiful.
"- Yeah, sure."
You're naked!
So what?
This is Europe.
Everyone goes in the sauna naked.
"Goodbye, gone."
When do I start?
Let's go.
"- Listen, this isn't a great time for me right now."
- Oh.
"- I'm sorry, I apologize."
"- Oh, Iâm sorry, just give me ten minutes, though."
"Just give me ten minutes and then you won't have to see me again 'til tomorrow, at work."
Horace.
- You want an interview now?
"- Yes, please."
"I mean, that's what you said and I'm in a hurry."
I have popsicles in the car.
Popsicles melt.
And then it's juice.
"Who likes juice, Horace?"
Please?
"- Sure, have a seat, would you?"
- Thank you.
- Okay.
"Now, I know this job starts tomorrow, but Iâm gonna need next weekend off because Iâm gonna go to Chicago."
They're having a bit of a--
"Like, a little party thing that I want to go to."
And I like going to parties.
- In Chicago?
"- Yeah, in Chicago."
"The land of pizza, yes."
This is a nice place.
Do you have any termites?
Everything's wood.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
"Union or no union, if you,re not ready, you,II pay!"
"- We,II see about that."
"- Yes, we will!"
"We,re not afraid of the minister."
"I,ve got a few things to tell him."
If you bother the minister with your problems -
This is the control room.
"hello, Schneider."
Did you drop something?
"This is Dr. GoIdberg, eminent psycho-futuroIogist, and his assistant, Mr. -"
Very interesting.
What happens here?
"That,s what we,re here to show you."
follow me.
This is our team.
"It,s an honor."
What is it?
"You're a Brahmin who's here to cook for Jai, right?"
But Jai is a non-vegetarian!
How will a Brahmin cook that?
That's between Jai and me.
Why must you interfere?
Okay.
I have something else to say.
What is it?
That's between Jai and me!
"I'll tell Jai, of course!"
"Atleast you tell me, Ratna."
"I will speak to Jai, too."
Okay.
Sit here and wait for Jai.
I'm off for a bath.
Father?
I don't understand.
you're...
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
xxx
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!
No one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this.
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not going to make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
"You... have to understand... that when I found her,"
I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.
"She was just lying there, helpless."
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl."
xxx
No.
No!
It's all right.
Take what you need.
I can't.
"Yes, you can."
"I mean, it's neutral."
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
So it could be whatever.
"It could be an office, it could be a guest room a gym, a baby's room..."
[LAUGHS]
"Wait, did you mean ""neutral,"" or ""gender-neutral""?"
- I don't know what you're talking about.
"- Oh, really?"
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
BEN:
Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.
But I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
[UP-TEMPOED MUSIC PLAYING]
JARRAD:
So that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
[GIGI LAUGHS]
"Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office."
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?
I met you.
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?
- Of course.
"- Oh, great."
Here is my info.
"- Nice to meet you, Janine."
- Nice to meet you.
"Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi."
"Oh, wait."
So how are we doing this?
What?
"We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice."
You gotta be kidding me.
You start there where the road begins.
You finish down there where the road ends.
Holy shoot!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
How long is this gonna take?
"Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days."
Five days?
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!
"Then if I were you, I'd quit yapping' and start workin'!"
"- Hook him up, Mater."
- Okay-dokey.
Freedom!
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie and then...
then took the boot off.
Whoo-hoo!
"Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!"
"California, here I come!"
Yeah!
"Oh, feel that wind."
Yes!
No.
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Outta gas?
How can I be outta gas?
"Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are."
"But how did, how did... you...?"
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.
- Ka-chow.
Sex with a minor was all they could get him on.
Why was that?
She wouldn't cooperate.
Said he was a genius and apparently that's what geniuses do.
I wouldn't know what geniuses do.
I'm just a dumb arse cop.
I know nothing about art.
"Sleep well, Mr Greene."
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
I hear you had a big win.
"Oh, for God's sake, Barney."
Alright!
He was a man that I met at the Adelaide conference.
He's English.
And he is now safely back in Devon with his wife and he will never ever come back here.
What's his name?
Does it matter now?
You don't know him and I'm never gonna see him again.
OK!
OK.
John.
Bartrop.
John Bartrop.
There.
You happy now?
Bleeding saints.
Recognise this?
Guido Reni.
In six months the streets would have made him ugly.
He would have died in a crack haze down some lane.
"I gave him that, his moment of absolute perfection."
!
"The same woman, twice, and she died both times, the same woman!"
"Doctor, what are you talking about?"
"Something's going on, something impossible, something..."
"Right, you two stay here, stay right here, don't move an inch."
Are you coming back?
Shouldn't think so!
But where are you going?
"To find her, to find Clara."
Ha-ha-ha!
But Clara's dead.
"What's he talking about, finding her?"
"I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains after all."
Where are you going?
Short cut.
Through there?
I hate this place!
Don't you think it's creepy?
"No, I don't believe in ghosts."
Clara!
Oswin!
Oswald!
Watch me run!
Ha-ha!
Miss me?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
I'm an alien from outer space.
"I'm 1,000 years old."
I've got two hearts.
And I can't fly a plane.
"You're running away with a space man in a box, anything could happen to you."
No cameras.
It's the perfect spot.
"See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau, his daughter and heir. (WHISTLES)"
"Harry, wait."
I need more.
I just crossed a pretty scary line for you.
You owe me a proper explanation.
I owed Freddie Lau money.
Gambling debts from his casino.
But this has got nothing to do with me.
"I don't care how you get your kicks, Harry."
"But if I'm going to have your back,"
I need to know it's coming from the right place.
(BUZZER)
It's Harry.
(BUZZER)
"- Hello, Josie, is he in?"
- Mmm.
Harry's here.
JOSIE:
Napoleonic.
Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia.
Me and your brother fired them on the heath last night.
Half-brother.
Is this official or unofficial?
You better come in.
70 grand.
I need you to um... look after it for a while.
"Who does it belong to, Harry?"
- It was in transition.
- From you to...
A man who died this morning.
Leave now!
Now what?
Why don't you answer your phone?
Answerthe damn phone!
The papers are not interested in warphotos anymore.
I'll see what I can do.
Do something on kids.
Kids always sell.
People want to see hope.
"OK, I'll ask the fixer."
Send me something in two days.
"Why are you so late, my son?"
School ends around this time.
"It's been half an hour, my eyes were glued to the clock."
What's half an hour in Istanbul?
What's this radio station again?
Radio 'Holy Water'.
I am scared.
Istanbul is a dangerous place.
I know...
You called me 26 times today!
I can't wait to see you get out of this filthy place.
"As if ourhometown were cleaner, look!"
Neverdeny yourroots.
I wish I could.
May God forgive us.
You're beyond mercy...
Allah has struck you already.
"Allah be praised, I'm fine."
Sure.
"Get up girl, put this away... wash your hands... heat some rice for yourbrother."
What's going on?
(BLAST ON HORN)
(ANOTHER BLAST)
(HORSE NEIGHS)
(NEIGHS IN PAIN)
(GUNSHOT)
"Thank you, young man."
What a magnificent horse.
Must have been a great hunter.
Yes.
Yes.
"I'd invite you to my home for a drink, but I've got a house full of fops."
Guests of my wife's.
I won't let her move to Paris so she's trying to bring Paris here.
"Still, it's her money."
And I love her for it.
(LAUGHS)
"Where are you staying, lad?"
At the inn?
That is either Monsieur Chopin or Monsieur de Musset.
- You haven't invited Alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'll be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not Alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- Felicien Mallefille.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
We don't talk to the priest.
Just between us.
Sometimes he says something.
But that's it.
But I'm not the priest.
No.
You're my father.
I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me.
Sometimes I'd like to slap you face!
No.
Better hit me with your belt!
Like Elena's father.
And who's Elena's father?
"A beast, who else."
"Well, let's calm down."
I'm calm.
I assume I was bad at you.
But you were too.
Me?
Why?
You never give up!
You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel.
If he were 15 you'd be so happy.
15 is a much more similar age for you.
That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15.
He seemed nice.
Normal.
Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult?
Then when there's someone older you guys lie?
And you lie to me?
Tell me.
You lie to me.
"No, they'll think I liked you."
"Thank you, sir."
Bloody silly place to die.
Captain Murray's dead.
Bury him.
"And what then, him?"
"We're lost, aren't we?"
So we'll be heading south towards Lisbon and home.
My orders are we continue north.
What for?
What are we doing up here anyhow?
"Did you ask Major Dunnett or Captain Murray to explain their orders, Harper?"
No.
"But with all due respect, Captain Murray and Major Dunnett were proper officers."
"Now they're dead, there's no shame in going home."
We go north at dawn to Casa Antigua.
"Carry on, Harper."
We've been having a chat.
We?
Me and the lads.
And?
We're not continuing north.
We want to go south.
MEN Aye
- What the hell do I care what you want?
Eh?
who the hell do you think you are Harper?
Do you think the British army is a bloody d-d...?
"Democracy, sir."
Comes from the Greek word demos.
It means...
"Shut up, Harris!"
- She's messing with you.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I kept texting her telling her you insisted we bring something.
- Where is Daddy?
"- He'll be here, a few minutes."
"Which reminds me, I should finish dinner, huh?"
"Luke, would you take our bags up to my room?"
"It's the first one on the left, the one with the Hello Kitty poster."
Allison.
We sleep together.
I'm not gonna be a hypocrite.
"No, no, of course not."
I didn't raise you that way.
It's sweet that you care what I think.
Come on.
"So, what do you think?"
- I think he's really nice.
"- I know, right?"
And cute too?
He's adorable.
"Oh, honey, hand me the meat thermometer, would you?"
I have not made a roast chicken in I can't remember how long.
This thing does not look done.
- This is not...
- Is she here?
"Oh, at 150 at least, don't you think?"
Mom.
When?
Heh.
Tonight.
Are you freaking kidding me?
Tonight?
I found her.
"You know, there's a town car waiting for you at the airport."
I don't need a fancy car.
I just hopped on the bus.
Saved you some money.
So this cruise...
You just happened to have a layover in Seattle?
"Well, I've always wanted to check out the Space Needle."
I understand you can see mount Rainer from the top.
"Oh, really?"
Anything else you want to check out?
You gonna take me or not?
"I got back-to-back surgeries, ma."
You gotta give me a little more notice.
"Yeah, yeah."
I gave birth to five doctors.
I know the drill.
"I can wait, maybe meet your colleagues."
- Is that Mark Sloan?
- Yeah.
Mark Sloan.
"Oh, mrs."
Shepherd.
You look great.
"Oh, damn."
Catch up later?
"Uh, oh, perfect timing."
"Um, mom, this is Meredith."
"Meredith, finally."
Hi.
"My son has been acting like a dog with his favorite bone, hiding you away."
I hope you're free for lunch.
So h-how am i gonna get these doses of sage wisdom
When i'm living at the dorms at n.y.u.?
I'll appear to you like obi-wan.
Now go young jedi.
All right. bye. have fun.
Our kids graduated high school today.
And i felt... old.
And so i wanted to do something young and crazy
And you're the only one i wanted to do it with.
Something I found in Chuck's room.
Well then I bet it's good.
Are you dressing for someone?
Yes.
Someone I hope is finally ready to love me
The way Cyrus loves you.
Cyrus told me.
You told Chuck how you felt and...
He ran away.
You seeing him tonight?
Yes.
Don't let him get away again
Oh..
Hey..drunky.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Dan.
You're here.
There's something I have to tell you
And it's only because I'm drunk
And I'll probably never see you again.
I um....
Oh God.
I have to go.
Ah-ha!
Just the man I'm looking for.
Wow.
"Look, a spot just opened up in the lawn dart game"
- In the park.
"- Oh, that is great news!"
"Is what I would say if I could go, but I can't."
What?
"No, we've been waiting for months for this spot!"
You don't think I know that?
I'm the one that put us on that waiting list.
But I can't go because
I've got to wait here for the police to come and arrest me.
Right...
"Well, good luck with that, Baberella."
"Oh, do you want to be on the visitor's list"
In the unlikely event they allow me one?
"- No, I'll just wait for you on the outside."
- OK.
No.
[ Baber sighs. ]
- Hello!
- Oh!
"Hi, sweetie!"
Hi!
Oh!
Uh-oh!
"Cooking turkey bacon again, the gateway meat."
"Well now, some would call it the gateway to heaven!"
"Not Muslims of course, just people who like bacon."
Are you OK?
You seem a little tense.
"Uh, with your mom and a six-pack?"
You don't really help the situation.
You could at least try to be nice.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me.
I'm not that evolved.
So a movie tonight?
Whatever you wanna do is fine by me.
- But I'm late and I gotta go.
- Okay.
All right.
And the keypad is for texting which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.
"Anna, it's Jeremy."
Uh...
- I haven't heard from you in a while.
"- Ha, ha."
- Okay.
"- I didn't break it, I swear."
I was showing Harper what you taught me.
Marvelous device.
- Who was that?
- Jeremy Gilbert.
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Of course not.
- What do you think?
- Very respectable.
That's the goal.
I can't say that I miss corsets.
Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys.
And her ATM card.
- What's that?
- I'll explain later.
Wow!
It's so pretty!
Now you're becoming a great barista.
Right?
Unnie.
Your dad passing away must be really hard.
Your dark eye circles are going down to your chin.
Huh?
Cover it up a little before you head out the door.
Hello!
Da Hye!
Na Na unni!
You came.
Did you finish the things for your dad well?
Ah... well.
It turned out like that!
We are getting married!
Didn't I say you guys suit each other well!
Congratulations!
Thank you!
Na Na unni quit...
and Lee Yoon Sung's not there either.
The Blue House has become so tense...
"Well, but you said as long as you have me you'll always be happy."
Ah that's why marriage...
it's a really important decision.
Take it back!
"Take it back, unni!"
Da Hye!
"If you guys are busy and can't come, I can send you guys my bank account number."
You can put the wedding money in there!
"Be happy, Eun Ah."
I mean which is understandable under the circumstances.
What about the other girls?
I guess it slipped their mind.
Jill's all wrapped up in her wedding.
"And you know, Becca just got that huge movie, so... it's ok."
"Happy birthday, Dale."
Hi.
I have a reservation under um Squire or Hallie.
Thanks.
Surprise!
You didn't think we were gonna forget did you?
I kind of did.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
"All right, guys."
Let's dance!
Whoo!
"Make a wish, but don't tell anyone or it won't come true."
Ok.
What could I possibly wish for?
Ok.
Whoo!
Happy birthday.
"Thanks, you guys."
"You're drunk, Jill."
You never cared before when I was drunk.
And it's Dale's birthday for Christ's sakes.
"All right, you have got to lower your voice now."
Because now you're making a scene.
"You bet your last, Drew."
Because it's nothing they've never heard before.
"You are so... self centered, Drew."
[Feigns laugh]
"It's gonna be a ""Day in the Life of a Chicago Firefighter"" sort of thing."
"We have a slow day, and you're just gonna reinforce the stereotype that all we do is sit around and eat."
"You got a problem with it, lieutenant?"
Go for it.
Drug tester's on his way.
"And again, this is mandatory."
"Hey, chief, there's a kid outside looking for you."
Thanks.
Good.
You came on by.
You said it was cool.
"It is, it is."
What's your name?
- Ernie.
- Ernie?
Chief Boden.
"You hungry, Ernie?"
"Hey, everybody."
This here is Ernie.
He's gonna be eating some turkey with us.
"- What's up, Ernie?"
"- Hey, Ernie."
"Hey, I need a sous chef, chief."
"Get over here, little man, we got a turkey dinner to prepare."
- Go ahead.
- Come on.
"First thing we gotta do, taste this gravy."
Tell me what you think.
- Good.
- It's good.
Where'd you find that mutt?
Why do I get the feeling you're getting the bigger half?
Let me ask you something.
If I'd have offered you less would you have been polite and taken it?
Of course.
You got what you wanted.
I like to kiss the pretty ones.
There's another pretty one.
You got BankExchange.
- How did you know?
- I saw the kiss.
I saw the smile.
How'd you get it?
I didn't say no.
But he'll take a bath on those leases.
It'll just take him longer.
"- Something for him, something for me."
- More for you?
"No, no."
More for the city.
"Hey, cigar."
Sneaking in a drink for Sydney?
I was.
Now they're both for me.
Helps Frank Anselmo go down.
Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for.
But I'm left holding the bag.
What are you complaining about?
The bag's full of cash.
Minus a year.
You can weather a year.
You can weather 100 years.
I've got partners.
I may not be back till 1 0:00.
"[ Woman #2 ] Yes, Mrs. Pauley."
Maku just called me.
"Oh, how is he?"
Worried.
"Someone just visited him, looking for Diane Westmore."
"[ Magnum Narrating ] Faced with a tough problem, some people drink."
Some eat.
"Me, I swim."
"I was pretty sure Maku recognized Diane, but when he suggested he call some friends and get back to me,"
I decided not to push it.
- [ Barks ]
"- Hi, guy."
Where's...
Apollo?
Zeus.
Apollo.
Patrol.
[ Dogs Bark ]
Enjoy your swim?
[ Chuckling ]
"Oh, whatever it is, Higgins, the answer is no."
"My, we are suspicious, aren't we?"
I won't give up the Ferrari.
"I wouldn't dream of asking you to, old boy."
I won't move out of the guesthouse.
"Well, I should bloody well hope not."
And I won't let someone move in either.
Never entered my mind.
You want me to take out your sister?
She's married and living in Sussex with four monstrous children.
All right.
"You know, we gotta ask god's will"
"In your life, and he'll change things."
I think he talked to me today.
I'm sure he did.
"Oh, regina."
"Oh, baby."
"- Oh, look at me."
- ma.
"Now you know, like saul,"
"You can pick yourself up,"
Dust yourself off and go on forward.
You know?
"And listen,"
I owe you an apology.
I don't ever want you to think
"That i'm not proud of you,"
Because i am.
You're a very ambitious woman
And a very strong woman.
You're my daughter and i love you dearly.
"i want my daughter back, ma."
I owe her so many apologies.
- Oh baby.
- I don't know what to say.
I think i have missed every opportunity.
I...
I'll never have a chance to be a good mother.
"- Oh yes, you will."
- And i lost the man that i love.
"Oh regina, it's not over."
"And i'm gonna apologize to you, mama."
"- For what, baby?"
Nothing!
Be careful who you get your information from.
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.
"If you killed someone, I'd cover for you too."
Is that wrong?
Let's go to Marina's house.
"No, how could he be the father?"
He's 87 years old!
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
- Hello?
- It's me.
"Hi, Marina."
I wanted to know what's happening with Malaga.
When will they call me?
"Look, there was a problem with your contract."
They're not hiring anyone until next year.
Talk to them.
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
I have to get out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
Let's meet.
At the usual spot in half an hour.
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.
It's okay.
Coming!
Who is it?
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know. """""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
-What's your point?
-You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"-That's my job, isn't it?"
-That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just... .
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
"Carter, there's no way I can get my hands"
On that much cash in an hour.
Not as a private citizen.
There's nobody in the government you can ask?
No one who'd even entertain it.
"And in any case, the request would go into the system and alert the leak."
"Okay, okay."
I have an idea.
I'll get back to you.
Carter?
Hey.
So you can change.
Or I could get you something else if you want.
"- No, thanks."
- All right.
"Isaac, um... is everything all right?"
You seem...
I don't know.
It's been a rough year.
Other people wanting what's mine.
"You can always get out, you know."
Yeah.
"Look, I got a deal about to go down with some Dominicans."
Right?
They're gonna move my product on the north side.
That'll put me back on top.
I'll be a'ight.
Yeah.
What?
How's Nicole?
"She's fine, like I said she'd be."
"What, you called to talk to her?"
# I need you to know that I love you
# I want to be the man you hoped I'd be
# To find my place amongst the crowd
# To see your face
# And know
# You're proud of me. #
Hewitt?
Was Baker not on your tram?
"No, sir."
That'll do it.
Here they come.
"Purcell, boys."
Too early for Humperdinck.
"Sorry, I'm not sure where I should stand for the microphone."
Probably best if I conduct.
"Get a chair for Miss Riall out of the way, Lionel."
Right you are.
Should I just warm them up?
"Oh, I don't think we need bother with that."
"Round about this tempo, boys."
Once through for luck.
"I didn't get the chance to ask, are we all here?"
Apart from Baker.
Baker?
But he was so excited about it.
Did he send a message?
No.
Just didn't turn up.
So he's out.
"Well, I'm very disappointed."
I had great hopes of Baker.
Aren't you disappointed?
Does Otto know about this?
The deed's in my name.
"After the stroke, we transferred it all to me."
"Audrey, this sale's a mistake."
The market's shit right now.
It's better to ride it out.
I need the money now.
- Because of the investment.
- Yes.
"I need everything I gave to Victoria, and I can't tell you why."
"Well, I'm your attorney."
I'm exactly who you do tell.
What if I loan you the money?
- In cash?
- Yeah.
Now?
[chuckle]
How could you possibly...
"A while back, I put some money into a dance club in Hartford."
"A couple days ago, the other investors bought me out in cash."
- [phone rings]
- Uh...
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
This is Audrey.
Tell him it's Otto.
You need privacy.
"Oh, Hi, hon."
"Uh, could you hold on a sec?"
"Um, it's Otto."
Would you mind stepping out a moment while I lie to my husband?
"Thank you, Lance."
Porter said Lance pulled you into a sidebar.
Teaching me.
Here it is madam 42 it'll be perfectly fit.
"Dad, listen to me."
Brother.
"Not 42, give size 40."
42 will be perfectly fine.
"Brother I said not 42, give size 40."
What are you saying?
How do you know?
It's my size.
Do you know better or me?
I can tell the size of bra by looking at the blouse.
You know my nature.
Her husband even ask me for her size.
150 please.
Here.
Give me a bag.
What's the bag for?
You're going to wear it anyway.
"Dad, You'll have to leave for Pondi."
There you'll have to meet our designer who's worked on our valentines collection.
Actually I've seen the designs on the internet.
You just need to go and make an agreement with her.
Okay I'll go.
Don't you worry.
And if you like the design give her 100000.
She need it.
Okay.
What her name?
"Shut up, Not yours."
Leave the bra.
Speak.
- lt's okay.
"But look, I landed it right?"
That's all that matters.
I don't think so.
- l don't think that's all that matters.
- Say what you mean.
I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you landed the account...
- and you're fired.
- What?
You're fired because I love you... because I don't want to lose you.
"No, no, Patty, it's okay, I can fix my responsibilities."
"I know, but you're not happy, you're not."
You're...
Something has to change.
- What will we do?
I mean...
- l don't know.
- What will I do?
I don't even...
- l don't know what you're going to do.
I guess you're finally going to figure it out.
"- You know that girl, Angela Chase?"
- That redheaded girl?
Yes.
Some redhead.
It's out of a bottle.
- Anyway. is she avoiding us?
- l think she is.
I think we make her physically ill or something.
I thinks so because...
Angela.
Look at you.
What do you look like now?
"Master, I think he looks like a lily"
You all think so?
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Master Shi, we found on your apprentice"
Zhou Sanzhao's silver ingot
This is indeed strange
We hope you can clear things up for us!
"The silver ingot is engraved with the word ""San"""
"Y es, ""San""!"
San is on it!
Y es
Where did you get it?
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me
What?
Zhou Sanzhao is the most notorious murderer
How will he gave you money?
That's right!
"He didn't really give it to me, I..."
"Master, he's lying again"
Y es!
He's lying again!
Where did you get the money?
"Gao Jian, tell dad the truth!"
"Quick, otherwise Master will punish you!"
Zhou Sanzhao threw money... at the prostitutes
So I dressed up as a woman and got his money
Dressed up as a prostitute?
Good idea!
"Y es, yes, he does look like a woman!"
What the...?
..
Murder Squad...
"What are you bringing in here, you guys?"
!
This is crazy!
Successville.
"She's just a bit delusional, I'm so sorry."
"Sit down there, Elsie."
There you go.
"We're cops, Goddamn it, Cyrus!"
You're cops?
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you were cops?
What's this shit about?
You've made an enemy of one of the most powerful men in Successville.
How did I make an enemy?
"Work my arms, Dermot."
How did she make an enemy...?
"Both of them, Dermot."
What did I do?
I just...
What did you do?
"Yeah, what..."
You made me mad!
"You know what, you're crazy."
"You're dressed as an old lady, you have two pairs of glasses on and you've got a head scarf on."
"Screw you, buddy, I'm just a nice old person trying to help people!"
Really?
Yeah.
"How did you try and help Simon Cowell, when you pulled past his office the other night?"
You know what I did?
"Yeah, I missed you in sixth period."
"Yeah, I kind of skipped."
You can get your jaw off the floor now.
He's got you skipping school?
"Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed."
Alright.
Lucas!
What are you doing?
I'm taking care of my little girl.
You are such a trouble maker.
"Daddy stop it, come on."
Don't.
Stop.
"Hey, sit down, Rake Boy."
Hey.
I'm never gonna live that one down.
Probably not.
"It's okay, he can be way worse."
What have you got there?
- You're reading Faulkner in school now?
"- No, I just love his stuff."
So what did you do last night?
I saw you with Peyton.
What are you talking about?
You two just looked pretty friendly.
"Well, that's because we're friends."
And what are we?
"Well, I thought that we were dating."
"Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton."
How messed up is that?
Brooke!
What was that about?
Have you ever seen him in our apartment before?
No.
It's not fucking normal.
Did you tell him about the camera?
No.
- Were you planning on it?
"- No, never!"
Then what the fuck is he doing in the apartment?
I said I don't know!
"Okay, is he dangerous?"
"Well, he takes bets from shady assholes like me."
"So, yeah, he's dangerous."
But...
I don't see Marcus here.
That's his goon.
"If I were in trouble, he'd be in this photo."
"Well, what if he's sitting over here?"
Out of view?
(CHEWING)
"I was up early this morning, and I heard him moving around in his room."
He came out about an hour ago.
Hasn't said a word.
"I don't know what those red pills are, but he's taken at least two of them already."
(SIGHS) Can you guys shut up for a sec?
(DIALS)
(BEEPS)
MAN:
Yeah?
"Hey, Ivan, it's Jasper."
I know.
How's it going?
What?
- Me?
- And then he literally zipped his lips and threw away the key.
What's he gonna tell you?
"What, am I a fortune teller?"
You gonna put him in a room with me?
"Stripped, bound, and shackled."
"I told him nobody would be listening, but I was lying."
Man of the hour.
Who's speaking?
You have zero idea what he wants to tell you?
Invite me to Ruby's talent show?
Where are you?
"Market, crossing Geary."
DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.
"All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds."
I'm headed out the door.
"If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here."
Get an ambulance!
"Stand back, sir."
"Hey, hey!"
What did you have to tell me?
They stopped looking for... ffor me.
Who did?
Who?
They didn't keep looking...
Who didn't keep looking?
The whole world's looking for you.
Who?
Hey!
Hey!
He...
"He took mine, so I..."
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES
Hello?
Elizabeth?
SHE SOBS
The policeman...
He came back.
Where were you?
"Don't lie to me, Elizabeth."
Number five.
What did we agree about going upstairs?
Something bad always happens when you go upstairs.
I'm sorry.
Did he see you?
"The policeman, did he see you?"
I hit him.
I had to.
I had to get out of there.
"One day we're going to have to find a way to give all this back, aren't we?"
"I'm sorry, Mr Sellers."
Shh.
Get some rest.
"Peggy, where the hell are you?"
Call me back.
The poster design meeting with Elaine Markham and Peggy Scott?
"I'm so sorry, my partner's been delayed."
"OK, that's not a problem."
Jesus Christ!
I almost registered you as a missing person.
"I bet you didn't, though."
"Well, we didn't get the contract."
Probably not surprising as half of us didn't even show up.
I don't care about the stupid contract.
Leave Franz alone!
"You're in love with him, aren't you?"
"You don't wanna work for me, huh?"
- No!
- Say that again!
Let me go!
"You two, come here!"
"You're my friend, you saved my life."
"Here, take my crown."
"Franz, my dear Franz."
"Hmm, what's up?"
I just don't get this.
"Franz, don't you think we should move somewhere else?"
- Why?
"- I got money, I'll borrow you some."
Why?
I like it here.
You sent that guy away and tonight we're stuck.
We have a replacement.
First-class.
Who?
- He's a decent man.
- You'll see how I'll change his mind.
"I wanna move, to some suburb."
Come in!
"Cilly, a man is waiting outside for you."
Just seeing a tax return paper makes me go crazy.
I just don't know.
"Reinhold lets you know that they need someone tonight, you know the deal."
They want Franz to come over.
Reinhold sent this paper.
He wants you to come over.
"Said it was an accident, but-"
"I sentJasper away, and I ran."
Who are they?
They're your new best friends.
Stay here.
Ah.
"Well, what a piece of work she is."
"So, Evelyn used you to do the grunt work to track him down."
She shows up and finishes the job.
"And when she kills him, everyone comes looking for you."
She seemed so nice.
"Mike, she went through Lucy to get to you."
- Yeah.
Call Lucy.
Evelyn's not the type to leave loose ends.
- Right.
Oh.
Almost forgot.
That's for you.
- Evelyn has the Charger?
- Yeah.
It's gonna need some work.
- And your gun?
- Removed the trigger bar spring.
"Oh, that sounds like something you would do."
"You guys really do have a lot in common, don't ya?"
"Look, Fi."
"I know you're enjoying this, but now's not the time to say ""I told you so. """
"- This isn't like you, Michael."
"- Well, then go ahead-"
I know.
Fiona...
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I should have done the minute...
"And don't you shake your head at me, young lady."
Maybe there's still time.
"If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish and just be..."
Just be...
Just be miserable for the rest of your life.
"All right, all right."
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
"Boy, what a soft shell I'm turning out to be."
"Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya."
"If you wanna be a human, the first thing to do is dress like one."
Let me see.
[Sniffs]
- [Barks]
- Max?
What?
Huh?
What?
Max!
"[Wolf whistles] Ya look great, kid."
- Ya look sensational.
- [Barks]
[Gasps]
- [Pants] - [Sebastian mutters]
[Barks]
[Eric] Max!
Max!
"- Quiet, Max."
- [Barks]
You know you're in trouble?
Me in trouble?
You must be kidding.
I'm perfectly alright.
Listen:
Fat Pig knows all about your plan.
And he's coming to get you!
That means I'm really in trouble!
Get away from there immediately!
- Where to?
- Go into hiding with a friend!
As an inspector has no friends but lots of enemies.
Then go to No.1 Hua Shi Street right away.
Where is it?
"Don't worry, I'll get someone to contact you."
"Our password is ""l am woman""!"
"If someone says 'l am woman,' that means 'He's a friend.'"
"Hurry up, let's go!"
Scram or you'll run out of time!
Open the door... I've already run out of time!
"Inspector, why are you still here?"
You're...?
I am woman!
We are women too!
Other policemen are coming.
They're not women.
"Inspector, run!"
"Dear sisters, so long for now!"
Go after him...!
So many people!
Go after him...!
"Uncle, I am woman!"
- What's the matter?
"- You know, Frank."
You look terrible.
You should take a vacation.
I don't want a vacation.
"I got 18 years in, you know?"
I save up my time.
I put in my hours.
I'm eligible for pension in 6 months.
I don't want any vacation.
So what is it?
Get the deputy mayor off my ass.
"""Shrimpboats""?"
Him.
Yeah.
You couldn't handle him?
It was easy.
That's what I'm saying.
It was too easy.
Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love
What was that?
Milton and I are great Rodgers and Hammerstein fans.
"""When you walk through a storm, keep your head up high."""
It's not your signature on the probation report.
Now watch your mouth.
That was quite a risk you took.
The guy was wrong.
"No, Mayor."
I don't care if he is from New York.
Why don't you drive it?
"Well, it doesn't run."
"I mean, at least not that I could figure out."
Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
- Be more of a girl right now.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Why don't you come take a look at this?
"Elena, remember the old Camaro your dad used to have?"
Of course.
- I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
- Wow.
"Well, I don't like sports cars."
They're too hard to make out in.
"No, it wasn't that bad."
"- I'm sorry, man."
"- No, no."
Don't worry about it.
"You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good."
She's good with you.
"You know, I wasn't sure, but she's happy and I'm glad."
"All right, let's take a look at this."
Ouch.
Damn it.
- Need some help?
- Damn it.
Stupid shoe.
Ugh.
Pick up your other foot.
Ahem.
There you go.
Thanks.
I think.
Get out!
Get out!
I helped you!
Out!
Shame on you!
You rat!
You swine!
Get out!
"""She's so gentle, so faithful..."""
I almost killed you... like I killed Ida.
"I want to go straight, but it's too hard."
Guys like me never get a break.
I'm going for a drive in the country with Karl.
I'm tired of doing nothing.
We've got some accounts to settle in Weissensee.
Ede and Biberkopf have to go along.
- You're taking Franz?
- Yeah.
When will you be back?
Tonight at the earliest.
All right.
"Hello, young lady."
My friend Biberkopf sent me with a message.
He'll be home late tonight.
He asked you to come by?
Not exactly.
I just thought I'd come over and patch things up from last night.
- What do you really want?
- I told you!
"And there's nothing wrong with calling on a pretty girl, is there?"
"I thought, ""It's a beautiful day."
"Let's drive out into the country."""
[Radio Chatter]
"[Man, Indistinct]"
[Horn Honks]
I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.
I can't get any more time.
"- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?"
- You're not gonna get it.
We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car over there.
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"Jimmy, give it up."
Give it up.
It's all over with.
"If there was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew it.
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.
"Walter, listen."
I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I— I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Hey!
Hold— Hold on!
Hold on!
"Break it up, both of you!"
Will you two break it up?
Stop it now.
These gentlemen came to see the house.
They were just leaving.
Good afternoon.
- Who is that?
Do you know him?
- The watchman?
Never seen him in my life.
"Take a stroll, Jesus."
Drive.
I'll tell you where to go.
Go inside.
Go on.
Have a seat.
"Eugenio, give them something to drink, it's hot."
"The heroin Rodrigo found was mine, but he didn't find it, he stole it."
But I didn't kill anyone.
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.
You've already met.
She's not psychic.
Fermin was at the farmhouse the night the girls were killed.
He knows more than what was in the well.
But there's a price.
What do you want?
Withdraw the Civil Guard from the Point.
Okay or not?
- Okay.
"- Tell them, Fermin."
I saw the man who threw the bag in the well.
- What did he look like?
"- I didn't see his face, it was too dark."
"But he was normal, a normal person."
Of course I am.
I'm fine.
"Hey, Mom."
Mom.
"Hey, Mom."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
"Uh, I was just making sure you're alive."
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
"Yeah, um, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home."
I'm sure the neighbors would appreciate it.
It wasn't a party.
It was one guy.
Don't be so judgy.
"Yeah, well, I talked to Roberta at the Grill."
And there's still a bartending position open if you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Yeah?
- Don't act so surprised.
I just...
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there is back rent due."
"- There's back everything, Mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- It's Caroline.
Easy.
Yeah.
Come in.
-
- It's true.
She took him in and soon they knew each other as only people can who've had a couple of sessions on the Ouija board.
-- (SHOP BELL) -
- Someone's trying to get through!
'Ey up!
It's Noddy!
Good morning.
What can we do for you?
That's what a person my age should be dressed like!
Not like this!
Call that dressed?
I put more than that on to go to bed in!
"Can we help you in any way, or is it t--too late?"
"Razor--sharp responses, you'll notice."
"Still, we shouldn't mock the afflicted."
Pity about his eyesight.
There's nothing the matter with his eyes!
He's wearing shades 'cause he's cool.
I should think he is cool!
His shirt's open to the kneecaps!
"We're over here, sir!"
He's Mutt and Jeff and all!
-
"- Here we are, sir."
-
- Get off!
-
"- Watch it, creeping up on people!"
-- (ROCK MUSIC BLARES OUT)
-
"- Watch it, creeping up on people."
That wasn`t funny!
A noise like that could impair the kids` hearing.
It was real!
"It looked real, didn`t it?"
I thought it was real gun.
Didn`t it look real when I fell down?
What?
Didn`t it look real?
What?
"Are you happy now, clark?"
She`s deaf.
What`s the difference?
It was fun anyway.
Let`s have a drink.
"Pardon me, sir?"
Catherine said we just stay on 50.
I was thinking of shooting over to 54 and zipping down to liberal.
What for?
The House of Mud.
What`s that?
The largest freestanding mud dwelling ever built!
"The pioneers didn`t have bricks, so they used mud."
"They didn`t use mud, they used sod!"
"Right, Audrey."
"When they ran out of sod, they used mud!"
Let`s skip The House of Mud.
Dodge City was enough for one day.
Catherine and Eddie are expecting us.
It`s living history.
"But, if you`d rather see your cousins it`s okay by me."
"personally, I`d rather see a pile of mud than Eddie."
Knock it off!
"Oh, right, yeah."
Them the ones with the pointy houses?
"Pyramids, yeah."
"Please, guys, you can call me Rambo."
"I said Rambo could join us for dinner tonight, eh, Grumio?"
"Fine, yeah."
There is no dinner.
Right.
First-class slaving.
It's cool.
I've got my dad's charge card for the Emporium if you wanna run and grab some stuff.
Wicked.
"I mean, I'd rather not run but..."
"So take the sedan, if you like."
Yeah.
I do like.
Excuse me.
"No, no, no, not you again."
Shoo!
Hop it.
I will not allow you to ravage our luxury foods.
"How about I buy 'em, then?"
Ptolemy Hachmenenet?
"Is the name of my master, yes."
He sent me to fetch his scran.
"And I am absolutely delighted you chose us, sir."
Pray tell what your master is craving and I will do my utmost to help.
I thought you might.
"Well, he mainly likes meat."
Lovely.
Shall I fetch a basket?
"Get a trolley, I would."
"Evelyn, I appreciate all the effort you've put into this... but there comes a time whereyou have to walk away."
Come on.
Isn't there something I can do to persuadeyou?
There's nothing you can do.
[ Chuckles ]
Know what I love about Miami?
"Apart from you, of course."
The cheap labor.
"You know, I can get a kid offthe street to do a hit for about, mmm, grand."
"Well, ifl flirt with him a little."
"Say, now, isn't that Lucy?"
Lucy!
Lucy!
[Tires Squealing]
"- Michael, I am so sorry."
- It's notyour fault.
"Yes, it is."
You taught me better than that.
It was so stupid.
I should have been more thorough.
- I've got guys headed to her hotel right now.
- It won't matter.
I know.
I just feel like I should do something.
You should.
"You should be careful, 'cause she's still out there."
- [ Cell Phone Rings ]
- Right on time.
Yeah.
- [ Evelyn ] Changeyour mind?
- Enough ofthis.
"You want to deal, you deal with me."
We've got to get it back.
Get it back?
It's absolutely a matter of life and death.
"Well, how do I pull the check out of the bank?"
"You know the manager of the bank, don't you?"
Yes.
Tell him you want it back.
"But that's highly irregular, I..."
"Look, get me that check back and I'll give you $5.000."
"Well, I'll try."
"I don't guarantee anything, but I'll try."
I'll be waiting for you in the coffee shop.
"Something else, sir?"
"Another cup of coffee, please."
You've had six.
"Well, make it seven."
"Yes, sir."
Hello?
This is Mr. Sabourin.
Has Mr. O'Hara come back yet?
"No, sir, he hasn't."
"By the way, Mr. Sabourin, Wentworth Drug is up two more points."
Isn't that nice?
"Yes, yes, thank you."
Well?
Let's talk about me.
What do I get?
What do you mean?
$5.000.
"Oh, no."
"No, Mr. Sabourin."
That check was stubbed.
I don't have time for his crap.
- You think he made it up?
- I don't care.
- Why would he?
"- Wait, what does it mean?"
That I'm a bastard?
If Raziya's parents hear this they'll take her back to Brooklyn with the kids.
"I'm done for, don't you get it?"
Fuck!
Why did she keep these marbles?
What a moron!
Did she expect me to play on her grave?
Who saves marbles?
"Leave it, just go to sleep."
"I'll clean up, okay?"
"Mom, what did you do?"
What are you all dressed up for?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
From where?
What are you talking about?
"Doborobon, don't ask me and I won't ask you."
O-bo-kay-bay?
(Okay?
)
No-bo.
At least give me a hint-.
You're not 5 years old any more.
- Was that a hint?
- Was that a hint?
- Are you repeating what I say?
- Are you repeating what I say?
Do you know what this is?
So I'll call you later.
"Hey, do you mind..."
"uh, driving me home?"
No yoga?
No.
We missed it.
"Um, yeah."
I guess.
"Ok, when did that start and did you know?"
"Well, I mean, I kind of guessed, but..."
Does she know about... you two?
What's there to know?
Hallie should know better.
Seriously.
Anybody that knows you would know that you are so hot for him.
"Becca, I'm not so hot for him."
No.
He's your friend.
And it is so typical of Hallie.
She's a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
It's...
Damn it.
She is a fame whore.
"No, she's not."
"Oh, God!"
"Hallie, it's just frustrating."
It's so much right now.
She doesn't deserve that.
Hallie was there for me when I had that swine flu.
Every time I've broken up with a quasi boyfriend.
And I don't know what I would've done about that stalker if it wasn't for Hallie.
Bastard !
- I know you ?
- You should.
"Well, I guess more people remember me."
Dan Winslet.
Freshman year.
Dansy the pansy !
"What's up, man ?"
I want an apology for what you did.
"Whatever it was, get over it."
"Man, wait !"
He didn't even remember what he did to me.
So he took your life... . and you took his.
Mortality clock.
Counts down the remainder of someone's life.
Or their life sentence.
"Eric, the powder ?"
You were right.
Some of the trace we found in Bob's apartment was cocaine.
What was it cut with ?
"Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and five percent bisacodyl."
It's a laxative.
"Now, we have this mixture in our library."
It's Julio Pena's cut.
Calls it the Colombian Health High.
"Yes, well, it's time for Julio to come down."
"- Good afternoon, gentlemen."
- Julio Pena ?
I wanna know why were you at Bob Keaton's apartment today.
Lily white doper ?
What you think ?
I'm guessing that you might have killed him.
He just wants to show off.
Give me 30 of that!
How much is it?
- 15 Mark.
- 15...
"Here, 20 for you."
Keep the change.
"Give me something to drink, I'm quite thirsty."
Life is just wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
Let me introduce you:
this is my friend Casanova from Casanova.
Make room for him!
Meet these 3 beauties from Pankow.
"Move over, I wanna talk to my friend."
"Reinhold, it's always a pleasure to see you."
No you gotta put him on a radiotor to warm him up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't get mad at them.
"Go away, children, go!"
"I tell you, women are trouble."
"But at home, I have a wonderful one."
A gem!
Then why don't you bring her along?
You better leave the woman you love at home.
They're just too curious.
Now what?
"They do nothing but steal and cheat, these criminals!"
- Criminals?
- And Franz is starting to scare me too.
Franz?
He was in jail already.
- Sorry.
I think I took the last one.
And the bread?
All we have are the ends.
This is like The Hunger Games.
"You do know those books aren't actually about food, right?"
"Sorry, guys, I'll hit the market today, I promise."
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Are we out of... ?
- Everything!
"- Bacon, we've got bacon."
Have some bacon.
Come on.
I made it last night.
I want everybody home for family dinner tonight.
- Five p.m. Yes?
- Wrestling won't be done...
- What about dance?
- Do I hear six p.m.?
Anybody?
"I have work, I was just gonna eat there with Daphne."
But I will eat here instead.
"Um, I'm supposed to go to the batting cages with Connor."
"Batting cages, as in baseball?"
"Yeah, Connor and his dad go all the time."
And they invited me.
"I think that's great, sweetheart."
I never knew you were a baseball guy.
I haven't really played that much.
"But who knows, maybe I'm really good."
"- Yeah, maybe."
Either that or you don't know what's funny either.
I... don't know what's funny?
"I'll have you know, at camp,"
"I was voted ""Miss Whimsy""."
"Why, was Miss Irony killed in a canoe accident?"
"Hi, Dick."
"- Oh, uh, Mary."
Just doing some reading.
"Some physics reading, you know."
Okay.
"Say, uh, an amusing joke just came to me you know, out of the blue."
"Knock, knock."
Okay.
Who's there?
Who's there you say?
Nina!
Nina who?
"Ah Nina, she's right here!"
Please let me host that fundraiser!
No!
- Oh!
"Ben Littmeyer just called, he's gonna be a few minutes late for lunch."
"Oh, another lunch with Ben."
I see.
How funny for you.
"Well, would you like to join us, we could make it a threesome?"
I don't go that way Mary.
Fine!
"And last but not least, garlic gum."
"Oh, uh, Harry, how would you like a nice piece of perfectly ordinary gum?"
Okay.
"Mmm, garlicky."
Brand new and just for us!
Written and presented by Alfons Harmann.
The 99 Euro Show!
"Toni, there is no show."
You're joking right?
That's a joke?
!
Yes.
I forgot my glasses.
I can't see the keyboard.
Then get your glasses!
God damn it!
Now go!
"Sure, sure, ladies and gentlemen, of course you all want to see Nora again."
"Well, before we get started with the quiz show, here once again is Nora and the Pope dancers!"
Me again?
Yes.
Now what?
"It doesn't matter, just sing it again."
"Once again, from the top."
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
A lively hotel.
It's dinner time.
Everyone's dressed up.
The first guests are taking their seats.
And now we're going to the cafeteria.
If I were him I would do the same thing.
What's going on here?
We're having a going-away party.
It's probably for the best.
What?
That your brother takes a vacation.
Anybody else?
"No, I don't think so."
Wasn't Bertrand JoyaI with you?
"Yeah, but no..."
Was he there or not?
"He was there in the yard, but he wasn't with us... at the hotel or in the car."
alright.
So when you got there?
He ran away.
And you caught him.
Yeah.
You ran after him?
"Yeah, well Touchy ran, me... with the pick up."
With the pick up?
In the corn?
"Yeah, I've got a bad leg."
So then... you caught him and you brought him back.
What did you do to keep him from running away?
You locked him up?
You aimed the gun at him?
What?
"No, no, we thought that was too dangerous."
Same with locking him up.
We didn't want him to break anything else.
So...
We didn't...
we didn't lock him up.
"In that case, what did you do?"
Did you tie him up?
You tied him up?
You tied him up?
Just like that?
"Wait, don't!"
"Please, don't!"
"Are you gonna talk, Joe?"
"Ok, start giving the kid a workout."
Oww!
"Please, don't!"
Shut up!
Cut it out!
Ok!
Will you talk now?
Ok.
I'll tell you.
Anybody still live in my old Westchester home?
"No, it's closed up."
"Well, out by the swimming pool is a great big..."
"This is the last stop, Joe."
What?
Come on!
"We're saying good-bye, papa."
"The kid, too?"
"Sure, with our love and kisses."
"He must be hotter than a firecracker now,"
And we got enough hot stuff as it is.
"Yeah, you can get to know the kid better!"
Then maybe all 4 of you can live together!
"How are you ducking bullets, Joe?"
"Yeah, the feds will be shooting at you from all sides!"
Thanks for the bus fare!
They ain't getting away with a thing.
That dough ain't going to be theirs for long.
Was there much?
The box looked real full.
- I'm concerned about this one child...
- Shut up!
"Respectfully, all right?"
"Respectfully, shut up."
Because we've got organs.
"I whish we could get organs delivered, instead of having to pick them up, you know?"
I hate flying.
"I always feel much closer to death on a plane than in the OR, don't you?"
I do now.
I met Izzie the other day.
She's very pretty.
So you--you think she's the one?
I-I don't know.
"Well, I mean, we're at that age, right?"
"Marriage, babies..."
That the plan?
I don't know!
I'm sorry.
"I-I don't make plans, okay?"
"If there's a future there, great."
"If not, whatever."
I'll get over it.
I always do.
Okay?
Okay.
I think it's nice.
Your date.
I think you and the pig murderer make a really good couple.
Okay.
What are you gonna do on your date?
What are you ganna talk about?
- Why do you care?
Fine.
It's very viscous.
It's a...
Cab-Merlot blend.
"Okay, okay, okay."
"Bob, do you know what the wine is?"
It is a blend.
But it's a blend of spit.
Because it's from the spit bucket!
What?
He's right.
Bobby wins.
What?
!
"You drank spit, Rick."
You drank a lot of it.
What?
You poured that from the spit bucket?
Why did you do that?
Because I knew Bob would know what it was.
Why would Bob know that?
"Because we went to see Sideways, and after that we went to the wine bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink from the spit bucket and he did."
That's disgusting.
And that's how you win a wine-off.
Ah!
Wine fight!
"No, no, no."
Not the jacket.
"Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere."
That's for lying on your profile.
I'm sorry.
"Look, I'm a middle-aged man who's just trying to get back out there and..."
Who asked you to lie?
They asked where my uncle was.
I said that he'd left.
They asked how he was and you said he'd left.
We don't want anything from your uncle.
They asked me.
I said that he had left.
They asked how she was.
It wasn't about your uncle.
Have they taught you anything at school?
Yes.
You don't give an answer until you're asked a question.
"Yes, I've been taught that."
I don't want any more bread.
You understand?
"If you have good news, come here."
"If not, don't bother coming back!"
All right.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Put the bread down there and go.
"Hello, engineer."
My mother wants to know if you want the milk cold or hot.
Warm it up.
Good day.
"There's nothing more to say, Mrs Godarzi."
As I told you before.
"No, it's the same."
What?
"No, we don't know what to do."
What does that mean?
"That's impossible, Mrs Godarzi."
"Keeps calling me, says.."
..a little investment can take me far there
"But I say, I am too old to settle in a new place."
Johnny bhai.
My money is stuck somewhere.
I will rent the room as soon as I get it back.
Play chess with me every night.
Stay for free as long as you like!
When are you coming to get us?
I'll be there soon!
Why?
Has something happened?
"No, but just come and get us fast."
I'll be there don't worry!
"Hello, Kavita ma'am..."
Mukesh here.
Who Mukesh?
There is no Kavita here...
Don't call back again.
"Hello, Reena ma'am."
This is Mukesh here.
You haven't called last few days so I thought I should call and inquire.
Wrong number.
Mrs. Kajal?
This is Mukesh calling.
Usha ma'am.
This is Mukesh calling.
Mrs. Vandana?
- Wrong number.
"Sorry, I won't call back again."
"Hello, Sarika ma'am... I have told you not to call here..."
Don't call back again.
Let's go.
"No, no."
We can't do that.
"What, you got a better idea?"
"Come on, dad, our window's closing, and we need to dine and dash now."
"Excuse me, sir."
Sir!
Wow.
I can't believe you did that.
"Yeah, neither can I."
That is so not you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
"So, where are you and Martin going?"
Dad.
What?
"Come on, I don't wanna talk about that."
"We're just gonna fight, ok?"
"Forget it, then."
It's ok.
"Well, I should get back."
"Oh, Martin said that you had 'till 5:00, right?"
"Sarah, I really just... just wanna tag along with you, see how you spend your time."
I'm not gonna interfere.
"I'll just sit there, won't say a word."
What is it you think I do?
Steal cars?
Vandalize private property?
Beg?
"Sarah, I have no idea what you do... and that's why I'm asking."
This is a life drawing class.
"Yeah, sorry to disappoint."
-Start with the truth.
The super saw you leave her apartment before water came through the ceiling.
Let me ask you a question.
What question did you just ask me?
What was the question you asked me?
When the last time you saw her was.
"I told you the last time that I saw her alive, right?"
"-When I saw her after, she was dead."
"-Why didn't you call it in then, Mike?"
I had a couple of changes of clothes and shaving stuff in the apartment.
Where's the stuff now?
"It's in my locker, John."
Couple of shirts and some shaving stuff.
"Come on, let's go."
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
KELLY:
Let's go take a look.
"Beautiful, beautiful."
Great.
That's beautiful.
Embarrass me in front of the department.
Great!
-Nobody's gonna embarrass you.
ROBERTS:
"Yeah, right."
-What's it look like?
-l don't know.
-He deny the super's story?
-Says he was there after she died.
-Only time he was there.
-Believe him?
It's Dave and Sharon's engagement party.
That's what I'm saying.
"Obviously, we don't report it tonight."
There is a dead fucking st-rotting corpse in the storage unit.
You can't smell anything as long as we keep the door closed.
Wow.
It's been down there a week.
What's one more day?
Uh-uh.
Look.
"We let the party happen, we look at tomorrow's photo... and if it shows the cops taking our testimony and shit, I'll call 'em myself."
I have to admit.
I am kind of curious to see one more photo.
All right.
Fine.
One day.
But... one day.
(MUSIC)
- What time is it?
- Twenty till.
"Well, just in case tomorrow's photo shows the end of the world-"
(INHALES) I'm going to enjoy myself.
Do you want to dance?
And he adopts his classic glazed-over look.
What?
(CROWD CHEERING)
(MUSIC)

Hmm.
You son of a bitch.
(MUSIC)
"Operator, you have got to be kidding!"
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!
Jesus Christ.
Can you believe this?
He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for Christ's sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy.
"Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit!
"Why don't you let me-- no, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
"Operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the hotel excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator,"
I've given you the number 4 times.
"What do you do, take an illiteracy test to get that job?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, God damn it!"
[Ring]
[Ring]
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Ok.
I thought I just went to bed.
Yeah.
"Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?"
Ok.
"Oh, just remind flo about that blue belt."
"Yeah, I'll see you."
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking.
"Let's take a look at the board because the last show,"
Stephen Moyer blazed through with a 139.3.
"Well, he's on ""True Blood."""
"Yeah, he's a vampire, so they can do stuff like that."
"Tony Hawk is on there, Bret Michaels still."
"Now, this is mid-pack."
This could be really good.
Just go down.
It's fine.
"You don't have to, like..."
"Just follow me here, way down here."
"God, I'm so embarrassed."
"Buzz Aldrin, Bridget Marquardt, still enjoying being underneath an old man."
You guys want to know her time?
[ Cheers and applause ]
"Lake Bell, you did it in one minute..."
Fifty...
"Oh, dear."
"Five-point-four, bumping Buzz Aldrin."
Congratulations.
"Listen, you did a wonderful job."
"Lake Bell, everybody."
Congratulations.
Whoo!
Wood:
Coming up...
"All right, we can do it."
Hit it!
...It's payback time for Adam.
[ Laughs ]
"Welcome back to a very special episode of ""Top Gear,"""
"where we have given complete control to our very own man in plaid, Mr. Rutledge Wood."
"Master, we shouldn't show them too much of our sword fighting."
"Master, they'll imitate our Chin Kang Fist."
The Wu-tang won't imitate your Shaolin fist.
The Shaolin won't imitate your Wu-tang sword.
Don't despise our Wu-tang kung-fu.
"I think sooner or later, we'll have a competition with Wu-tang."
I'll be expecting you!
"Alright, go!"
"Mr. Hong, Chung-Ian, come!"
"Mr. Hong, please drink it!"
"Come on, bottoms up!"
Bottoms up!
"Don't hesitate, drink it!"
That's more like it!
"- Chung-Ian, serve them well."
- Please excuse me.
I've got to go out for a walk.
Please don't leave!
He feels shy around women.
Not like me!
Yes... you're more handsome.
Ridiculous!
What do you mean?
Don't stop me!
Please be more polite!
That's none of your business!
Don't get angry!
"Shut up, or I'll beat you!"
Get up!
Let's go and have a look.
What's happened?
Don't go!
"-Oh, yes."
Please come in.
is your husband at home?
[SPEAKS in spanish]
"Morning, morning."
Would you like a cup of coffee?
"No, no, no, thanks, Mr. Fuentes."
We just want to go over what you told the detectives the other day.
-l told those guys everything I know.
-You were home alone?
Right.
My wife works afternoons.
I work at night. I'm a cook.
"It says here that you were at home, you could hear Mr. and Mrs. Garcia..."
"... arguingallday, then there was a scream."
You ran into the hallway and...
... Mr.Garciacameout ofhisapartment with the knife in him...
-... collapsedinyourarmsanddied.
-Exactly.
And Mrs. Garcia said she stabbed her husband?
-That's correct.
-You weren't home?
-l was at work.
-Were you friends with Mrs. Garcia?
We didn't socialize.
We keep to ourselves.
What's the problem?
Why are you asking questions again?
-To be sure statements are accurate.
-Everybody knows she stabbed him.
"He beat her up, she took her revenge."
-They're gonna lock her up for that?
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No.
It's a laminate.
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.
It looks exactly like it.
But it is like one one-hundredth of the cost.
Oh.
I still wanna go with the real wood.
What?
You can't even tell the difference.
It's not the point.
"Well, what is the point?"
I just...
I don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.
"If you're not wood, don't try and look like wood."
I don't think that it's pretending.
"This is a lie, Ben."
Just be up front and tell people what you really are.
"Okay, you're right."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Maybe we should just go look at the grills and we'll come back.
Okay.
I slept with someone.
- I said...
- I heard you.
You tell me this in Home Depot because you know I hate a public scene.
"No, that is not why I'm telling..."
I knew it.
(Bicycle bell rings)
"And remember, best behaviour, Simon."
"Ah, Peter!"
"Susan, you remember Peter Kingdom, don't you?"
"Yes, of course!"
How very nice to see you again.
"And you, Mrs Barkway."
"Um, go ahead, my dear, I'll be along shortly."
"Hello, Mrs Barkway."
And Simon!
Something of a surprise.
I heard you were dead.
"- Funny, I heard the same about you."
"- No, no, no, very much of the living."
"Well, ""As a dog returneth to his vomit,"" I suppose."
"Um, Professor, I was rather hoping we might discuss my speech."
"Of course, of course."
I've had the porters prepare your old rooms.
Come and see me when you've unpacked.
(Hums happily)
(Rock music blares)
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Hey!
(Music off)
- Keep the noise down.
"This is a place of work and I'm in charge, so you do as I say."
- Mind if I make some calls?
- Whatever.
No sex lines.
PROFESSOR BARKWAY:
"Janet, please, we must discuss this sensibly."
"Janet, please, the research."
Mommy just has to have some tests done.
That's all.
There are more schnitzels in the fridge.
I'll make some.
Leave her be.
Have a seat.
I'd rather stand.
Would you like something to drink?
- No.
How's your father?
He's in the hospital.
- What's wrong?
Do you really care?
Yes.
I saw a picture of the musical in the hallway.
You and Dad are embraced.
How idyllic.
"That's all over, Goni."
All the big hits in this theater were his.
His name is on half of the posters in the hallway.
No one can take away the credit for the things he did.
"Yes, but no one's giving him any work either."
Including you.
How old are you?
25.
Why?
Did you know that my son is 21?
"I came to talk about Dad, not your son."
Do you know how long he's out of work?
I know.
You used to be friends.
There are things you don't know.
Go!
"Konichiwa, Jessie."
"You know, I like you, I think you're a fantastic personality,"
I just don't think this is the way to achieve your objective.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Last suspect was sweet shop owner Alan Sugar.
"We had to be quick, because like a badly stocked spice rack, we were running out of time."
Hello?
Hello?
No-one home.
No.
"Listen, O'Leary..."
Yeah?
Mayor Cowell was going to close this place down.
Hygiene or some crap.
So they've all got motive.
"Oh, yeah."
"Listen, do you see what I see?"
Sugar ain't around.
He must be upstairs.
Yeah.
Maybe we should get his attention.
"Well, no, maybe we should just look around and try and find clues."
"Smash, smash this place up a bit."
Smash the table.
I don't want to...
Let him know we're here!
Like really smash it up.
Argh!
We're here!
PHONE RINGS I've got...
"O'Leary, I've got to take this."
Addons
- They divert attention.
- No one cares about it.
Nothing is kept in mind.
Asshole.
No one will know of this incident.
"Addons Eli and me again, Jo."
This has created Addons The best video game.
"Addons Of course, all about my identity, will be removed."
"Addons Before your death, to be watched again and again ..."
"Addons Eye for eye, my dear."
Addons What have you done with my daughter?
Please.
It's okay?
Addons I'm afraid not.
Addons That's very nice and interesting.
I do not believe it.
You're a liar.
He is calling your name.
Addons
- I think it will stop ...
- Do not believe you.
"Addons I and my family, Jo."
Addons like you.
Addons I am very busy.
"Addons Busy, with wild animals."
Cursed be you.
He and an honor to be your daughter?
Have you ever thought why her daughter was murdered?
"With a father like you, it's no wonder."
Addons 6 minutes into the deadly crash.
"Addons Goodbye, Jo."
"Where, sir?"
Behind that vision in white.
You ready?
I'm frightened to death.
You're in the circle now.
"You've got the prettiest feathers in the room, now spread them."
"Right this way, mr."
Fisk.
Look at our jim fisk.
"Oh, that is mr."
"Jim fisk, eh?"
There she is.
Where?
"Right over there, behind that railing."
With my maid!
And my dress!
Here she comes.
"Don't worry, i got ammunition."
"You make a fool of fleurique, eh?"
"You steal my clothing, eh?"
"Here, throw these."
"Well, if you don't want to throw them, eat some of them."
They'll cool you off wonderful.
Look at the food mr.
Fisk buy.
Mm-hmm.
I think i'll let her wear the dress for tonight.
That's very considerate of you.
"Well, now that we're all friends, let's get together."
"They made a mistake about your table, jim."
We waited for you over there.
You want to know how that lucky piece landed?
Put me down!
Put me down!
I can't go!
I've got to stay!
Put me down!
Stop!
Stop this sled!
Whoa!
What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
"- Oh, no, no."
You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Later on you'll thank me.
"I hate you, you beast!"
Let me out of here!
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!"
Whoops!
Ha!
- Let's go!
Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
"It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share."
"You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty."
Can you cook?
"Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook."
Huh.
"Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?"
I'll do nothing to help you.
"I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me."
Want you?
I don't have a cat.
You don't have a cat?
"Well, how do you explain this?"
"(STUTTERING) Well, uh, maybe the wind blew against it and knocked it over."
"Nancy, there's somebody in here."
Are you accusing me of hiding a man in here?
"I'm not accusing you, Nancy."
I trust you.
I don't trust Wilbur.
How can you pick on anyone as sweet and fine as Wilbur?
"I know him a lot better than you do, Bobby."
Leave me.
Wilbur is not what he seems to be.
"Oh, you found that out, too."
The first night.
First night?
"I know he seems kind of silly and awkward, but inside he has a fine and sensitive spirit."
"""A fine and sensitive spirit""?"
Wilbur?
I don't want to talk about it anymore tonight.
I've had a hard day.
Why don't you go to bed?
I will.
I will as soon as I take my shower!
(SHOWER STOPS RUNNING)
Wilbur?
Yeah.
Oh.
(EXCLAIMS)
(DOOR OPENING)
BOB:
Nancy?
I love this scene.
You're terrific in it.
It's almost one take.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yeah.
"One-Take Cera, huh?"
One-Take Cera showed up.
"No, no, no."
We did multiple takes.
But what I mean is it's one angle.
- This was like...
- Almost one take.
There's one cut.
- I love that part.
- Me too.
One-Take Cera...
Did One-Take Cera show up?
Because One-Take Dennings never showed up.
- One-Take Cera did not show up.
- Okay.
But that's because One-Take Sollett was not on the premises.
I don't even think One-Take Graynor has ever been uttered before.
I used to say before we started to shoot a scene:
"""This is One-Take Dennings."
"One-Take Dennings."""
"And I thought maybe I would get it in one take, but it never happened."
"In ADR, One-Take Dennings maybe showed up once."
- There you go.
- She did show up.
- In post.
- She showed up for post.
She was in L.A. the whole time.
"Laurie, mom!"
I want to show you guys something.
I had an idea.
"Actually, something mom said gave me an idea."
So I took the van to...
"Here, just come with me."

Meet the Winebulance.
"So, you're out of wine, but you don't want to go to the store, so you call Gulfhaven's only mobile wine bar."
What do you think?
This is the greatest idea ever!
Or the worst.
Laurie?
I think it's great.
"No, really, Travis."
"I-I-- actually, I think it's brilliant."
"[ Chuckles ] Oh, hey."
"Here, take a flier."
I knew Travis was a genius!
"God, you know what?"
"I have to say, ""You were right."""
And you can really tell he's been working out.
"Uh, you can't."
He hasn't.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"""Ochie and Friends."""
Great.
"And who is Ochie, or what is it Ochie?"
"They're, like, these beings from, like,"
"Far, far into outer space."
And they're in their own kind of solar system.
But they have to go to a totally different planet.
"And they're only, like, 12."
But they still get all this stuff.
And they get rockets.
It sounds too good for Troma.
It sounds like big Hollywood.
We're a small company.
"You guys haven't seen any of our movies, probably?"
No.
Our movies are kind of raunchy.
So it sounds pretty good.
"Let's get together, and maybe I can be helpful."
And I'll certainly try to help you with it.
"It's nice of you to help your brother, too."
Yeah.
Good older brother.
"Well, we'll try to-"
- Troma team will help the Ochie team.
"Anyway, have a great day and thank you."
Thank you.
Good luck with it.
Thanks.
Bye.
Was it...
Too much tongue?
- N...
- Not enough tongue?
N...
"Well, not enough."
"No, Kendall was right."
This is not a game.
"If Austin Elektra is in fact The Phantom, then we are walking right into the lair of a serial killer."
I'm sorry.
"Repeat everything you said after ""not enough."""
"Oh, God help us."
[Computer beeps]
Esposito:
"Hey, Kev."
Hey!
"Hey, hey."
"Hey, hey."
"What's up, partner?"
Castle and Hayley might be onto something.
Turns out that movie director was in New York during two of The Phantom's murders.
What about the third?
"Based on financials, there's no indication of where Austin was."
Which means he could have been here committing that third New York homicide.
This could be our guy.
"Yeah, I'm gonna keep digging."
"Oh, and, uh..."
[Computer beeps]
"What is this, bro?"
"What are you hiding from me, and who is Tyler Ross, and why are you running a background check on him?"
Tyler's nobody.
"Um, well, you see, um..."
"–Oh, sure I can."
"The truth is, the people we save from the worst day of their lives... never gotta see us when we have to face ours."
"Hell, and why should they?"
"We took the job, not them."
"–No, that's not right."
"–What you gonna do, man?"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
–Fleetwood's got a warehouse full of stolen merch.
–No.
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.
–We get you some new digs.
"–I can't let you do that, all right?"
"Hey, I'm just..."
I'm just trying to do some good.
"You know, and deliver some karmic justice."
"Now are you in, or are you out?"
Easy.
Don't suck on his tailpipe.
One second.
–Yeah.
–It's me.
–Where are you?
–Home.
"–What, our home?"
–Yeah.
The keys still work.
–Are the kids with you?
–Yeah.
We're all here.
"Oh, thank you."
–This doesn't change things.
It was in Algeria.
That's where she met him.
Met who?
Maurice.
"He wasn't handsome, actually."
"He was thin, black as night, but she didn't care."
A 16-year-old girl.
Our father wanted to die when he found out.
He made her life hell for a whole year.
He locked her in her room so she'd jump out the window.
Until they decided to run away.
Only I knew where they were hiding.
I was afraid for her sake so I told.
That's the big secret?
That Morn had a lover when she was 16?
What was his name?
Maurice?
Maurice what?
- Was he older than her?
"- No, he was just a boy."
An orphan.
They said he was a Communist.
- That's why they kept them apart?
- No.
- Then why?
"- He was an Arab, I think."
An Arab?
- Are you sure?
- I'm not sure about anything.
"Okay, what happened when they got caught?"
They sent her to Paris and made her have an abortion.
Why?
Thank you so much for seeing me.
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks a lot.
- Let me get that.
It's my pleasure.
So how can I help you?
- They're going to throw me out.
- Who?
- Morty Brill.
- No one'll throw you out.
He says I'm under-occupied.
Can I help it if my daughter moves out?
Isn't she entitled to a life of her own?
Of course.
How is Helene?
- Still working at the navy yard?
- Thanks to you.
"So what can you do for me, Mr. Anselmo?"
"Well, it's simple."
See that Mr. Brill obeys the law.
You're grandfathered in over there.
"If he says you're not, call me."
A landlord like Morty Brill looks for ways around rent control.
How would he understand a law meant for working stiffs like you and me?
"Thanks, Mr. Anselmo."
Thanks a lot.
Mr. Schwartz is right outside.
"Thanks, Clara."
- I'm sorry.
- Would you come speak to my club?
Which club?
Terrible Tiles Mahjong Club.

"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This is my home.
It is!
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
What a catastrophe...
Didn't you find her?
Yes.
Amelia.
The husband tried to throw us down the stairs!
She was completely fat!
They say us singers end up fat.
I'm sure you won't.
Laura says hi.
How is she?
-Fine.
She's still my guardian angel.
Always worried about me.
She asked me how were you doing.
And what was your answer?
That you look so great!
And what do you think?
I think you have a normal look.
"A moment ago, I was thinking how would you look without beard."
Taxi!
Luisa!
Make him come to the concert!
"Hey Max, if you don't come, let's not wait another 10 years huh?"
"Do you like singing, right?"
Yes.
It's what a like the most.
And do you like that song you sang before?
I know that poem is yours.
It'd be better to say it was.
I wrote it more than 20 years ago.
How were you like back then?
Without beard.
- Internet?
- We can help.
Find out what makes us hostage.
Must enter the cabin.
Addons Your job is not complete.
I tried ...
I tried!
Addons Do not let him reach the trunk.
Addons stopped him!
Addons you have 3 minutes or she would die.
Can see and hear everything you do.
You should not mix.
"But, you have to do something, Gwen."
- I have to get out.
"- No, no, no, please!"
Addons three minutes.
Gwen Addons and you fail in your mission.
"Addons View Hi, if you die, Just like your friend ..."
Addons not have to kill his brother.
"Addons Come, Jo, you lose the show."
Addons I think you like these things.
Addons may prefer younger men.
What is your problem?
Addons I put a mirror in front of you.
Addons To see how good you are.
Addons Although ...
Addons All of us have blood now in our hands.
"No, please, do not do this."
It's the only way to save my child.
Please.
No!
You should get the boot.
"So, when did you get back from the States?"
2 years ago.
2 years?
"I know, I know."
I should've contacted you all.
"But you know how it is, it's just work and"
I married an American.
Stuart's a workaholic.
"And, well, I've got a little girl now, Nico, she's nearly 6."
"Ah, she's cute."
I have 3 myself.
Which is at least one too many.
"I kept meaning to, I kept putting it off."
And then one month turned into 6.
"I don't know, I don't know..."
You don't have to explain anything to us.
"We're big boys, aren't we?"
Here we are.
It's happened.
The 4 of us.
Grown up.
And Slade running a shelter.
How did that happen?
Says the doctor...
"Private doctor, actually, so..."
My socialism has gone out the window.
Blame the Americans.
"Well, assuage your conscience."
Come and visit.
See how we do things.
I might enlist your services.
I'd like that.
"Gigi, he is not interested."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Alex, this is jacked."
The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
- It's not black.
- Look at it.
Not a black shirt.
I see it.
It's not black.
This shit is black.
"If a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested."
He took mine first.
Then he gave...
"And also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
That's cute.
What happened?
"Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight."
[GIGI LAUGHS]
Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
Don't call him.
He doesn't like you.
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.
"- Well, I'm just trying to help."
- I know.
Thank you.
Sure.
"I gotta get back to work, but good luck."
"Okay, bye."
"Hey, buddy, you home?"
CONOR:
Yeah.
You're responsible for the death of hundreds of people.
You know the punishment for that.
Listen...
I've found a way to live with the blood on my hands.
But can you?

Why won't they come out?
"All I know is it put me in a sleeping sim, and then I woke up to all hell breaking loose."

Thank you.
For helping us.
I wish I could do more.
I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.

We will.

But I think I found a solution.
Because he didn't want to go to a foster home.
He didn't want to leave and I didn't want him to leave either.
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these... these pod people and the first cool person I meet, it's like, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
Police want to ask us some more questions.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
I'm sorry.
Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
It was an accident.
"Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
"Then we got some questions for you, too."
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
"You, too."
Vic!
"Come on, dude!"
–Tell me you're leaving!
–That which doesn't kill me...
Come on!
Come on!
Let go!
Vic!
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
Now snap out of it and be a part of this family again.
"- Okay, fine, I'll go sledding."
- Good.
Because your attitude is starting to affect the children.
Just look at Bill.
"Come on, come on."
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
Murphy family fun day starts now!
"- Ah, Christ, Bill."
Maybe he won't notice.
"- Hey, Frank!"
Hey!
Looks like your boy dinged my dangler.
I thought that was my job.
You sexy thing.
Excuse me.
Vic?
Sorry about your van.
I'll pay for the damages.
I can't take bread from my main man who lost his gig.
I remember once I was out of work for a whole winter.
"Oh, wait, that was a vacation."
Hawaii.
"Hey, Frank, you should go to Hawaii, man!"
It'll do you wonders.
"See a volcano, drink a volcano, be a volcano."
"Have fun in Hawaii, Frank!"
This isn't my snowmobile!
He's such a kind soul.
"He's a drug addict, Sue."

"Brian, don't be an idiot."
"Hey, Dad... whoa."
I need to talk to you for a second.
I didn't know he had a daughter.
I need you to fix my car.
I was planning on fixing that after school.
I can't wait that long.
"I mean, I need to leave town."
I've got to get out of here right now.
"T ell me about it, lady."
We all want to get out of here.
Are you late for an appointment with a client?
Are you a religious fanatic or something?
No.
Why?
Oh... 'cause you're just the most understanding man
I've ever met.
Thank you.
"Wow, look at this place."
What is this?
This is the...
T anapaya Wet Lands.
"Souta-kun is a good person, and kind too, and we get along well, and it's fun to spend time together."
That's why...
"I was being two-timed, huh."
Two-timed?
- Eh?
Why does that sound like a question?
"Well, it's a regular two-timing, right?"
"You were continuing with your boyfriend, and also going out with me."
Going out...
Eh?
!
"Umm, Saeko-san."
"Saeko-san and I were going out, right?"
I asked you to go out with me and you said okay.
Eh?
Ah...
Yeah.
- These two months.
"It's just been two months, but."
"Well, look, we even kissed, right?"
"Ah, but, we didn't have sex."
"Oh, I see."
"If you don't have sex, it's not called going out."
So it's not two-timing either.
...What?
!
Is that how it is?
Is that how society works?
"Saeko-san is correct, and I'm wrong?"
I don't know what's what anymore.
Wait.
Let me collect my thoughts.
Sir...
I'm a blind man.
How would I know such details about the car?
Am I the one driving the car?
Who drives it?
My driver.
Until a couple of months ago.
After that?
He didn't maintain.
the car properly
"Also, I didn't use it much."
So I had to relieve him from his job.
No one used the car after that.
I take an auto or cab if necessary.
So...
No one has used the car for 2 months now?
Yes.
Anything else?
We will contact if anything else needed.
I have some work now.
So... 2 thugs came home...
Your sight?
"Greetings, Sir."
"- You are Moorthy, right?"
Sculptor Manoj's Driver?
I was working as his driver 2 months ago.
Didn't you continue after that?
"No, Sir."
Don't lie.
You have driven his car and got it into an accident on the 18th.
I'm working here for the past 2 months.
It has been while since I last saw Mr.Manoj.
"Come to that window, Come on."
"Take your photo, It came to me by mistake,"
Yes Sir!
"It's your photo, You came here for this,"
"Ones, Twos, why it doesn't explodes?"
"You are the sharp shooter,"
I don't wear kafan to people but under garments.
"You didn't came here to kill her, Then who came here to kill her?"
"Third Laxminarayan, who came to me,"
"There she is, there she is, Stop!"
Stop!
Stop!
"Come on Pintos, Come on Pintos, No, No, Papa!"
Please!
Please!
Please!
"Please don't press the remote,"
Is he your father?
"Namaste,"
"No, No, He is not my Papa,"
"Every one calls him Papa, that's why I call him Papa too,"
"D'melos Yadav Gangster,"
"Nobody will move, Other wise I'll shoots,"
"Take out, who ever have what,"
Laxminarayan!
"You came here to kill me, to kill D'Melos Yadav."
Ones!
"No, Papa!"
Twos!
"Don't press the remote, Bomb will be explode,"
Where is that Bomb?
"In your Bag,"
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- [boys] yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's yo-yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
I was thinking...
I only smoke when I'm with you... wonder why.
I can't thank you enough...
for the other day... for tonight.
You're such an inspiration.
The way you've changed.
"""Evolved"", I guess, is a..."
"better word, into this beautiful... smart... very sexy..."
I think I must have loved you all along...
I just... didn't know it.
What an idiot.
Ha...
"Hannah, this is... this is ridiculous."
"Gregory, I really can't talk now."
"She can't not talk to me forever, I..."
I've got...
"Gregory,whatareyou doing?"
There're certain things I have to explain to her.
"I think it's a little late for that, Gregory, don't you think?"
What!
?
"I said, ""I think it's a little late for that, Gregory""."
"No, I don't think so."
What Rose and I have goes far beyond what normal people...
What's all that noise?
"What are you trying to say, Gregory?"
"Gregory, what is going on?"
Could you just...
Gregory!
Hannah!
What!
?
Let's go in.

"I'll be okay-go on, and hurry back!"
I know there's a cave up there
They're in there for sure!

Okay!
Let's go!

Yu-lu...
Take care of her well
One's clear.
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm a little nauseous.
It takes me a couple days to get back up to terminal.
- What's going on?
- There was a shooting across the street.
- Anybody you know?
"- No, but still."
- Kind of scary when it happens so close.
- Yeah.
So I heard you' re getting released today.
"My next round of chemotherapy's in about two days, so I thought I'd come by, say so long."
- How's your mom doing?
- You mean is she still pissed at you?
"No, I didn't mean exactly that, but..."
- She's still pissed at you.
- Good to know.
"She's upstairs with the ""doc."""
Does she know you' re here?
I kind of snuck off.
I actually might need one of those basins.
I think you need some IV Compazine.
- That sounds good.
- All right.
I'll go tell your mom you' re here.
Will you watch him for a minute?
I'm not a child.
"Yeah, Marky!"
"Yeah, Marky!"
- Yeah!
"- Look, Cohen, I think we need to really talk."
- Hey!
There you are.
"Look, some guy just puked all over an amplifier, and... -"
- Why was that tattooed girl just telling you about vomit?
"- She's, uh..."
She's my boss.
I actually work here now.
- What?
- Yeah.
It was the only way I could get those tickets.
- But why?
"- Well, I needed the tickets to show you that I could be selfless, and I needed to be selfless to get you to stop"
"- Cohen, that was really sweet. - Pathetic and sweet?"
"- No, just sweet."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, God."
Oh.
"Come on, I'm sor..."
"Summer, just wait a second."
- You are unbelievable.
"- Not in a good way, right?"
- I thought you just wanted to be friends.
- I do.
"- Oh, well, then what was that, that kiss?"
- I don't know.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So this whole night wasn't just a plan to get me back?
"- No, absolutely not."
You can reach your weight-loss goals.
We did.
But only if you reach for the phone and call Canyon Valley...
Now.
How far away is that place?
Couple of hours.
[ Engine revs ]
Sam:
"We were really, really moved by the online testimonials."
"Oh, yeah."
That was some powerful stuff.
Maritza:
And you boys are both certified personal trainers?
Yeah.
"Yeah, personal training brothers."
"Kind of like Hans and Franz, but, uh, less German."
[ Laughs ] And you're certified in...
Makin' people sweat!
Yeah.
Kickin' ass and takin' names!
That's how we do!
Uh...
[ Both chuckle ]
"Uh, to clarify, uh, what my brother's trying to say is, w-w-we both have a passion for-for fitness and helping people."
"Oh, us too."
Hm.
"In fact, that's how we first met."
I was Maritza's first client back in Peru.
"I was on a student visa -- homesick, stressed, eating my troubles away."
"Oh, he was the size of a casa."
"Oh, it's true!"
[ Chuckles ]
"Why, I haven't washed or even powdered and here you are."
"You know, you gotta be careful."
"You sitting around in a damp thing, you catch a cold."
"especially when you been exercising hard, Iike bowling is."
"-well, you're the teacher, aren't you?"
-Yes.
-What do you teach?
-english.
"well, I never was a very good english student."
-How long you here for?
"-Why, I don't know yet."
You gonna shack up here?
"I thought I would, if it's not inconvenient for you all."
Good.
traveling wears me out.
"well, take it easy."
What was that?
"Oh, those cats."
"Hey, stella."
"What did you do, fall asleep in there?"
"well, I guess I'm gonna strike you as being the unrefined type, huh?"
"You know, stella spoke a good deal about you."
"She said you were married once, weren't you?"
Yes.
When I was quite young.
Yeah?
What happened?
-Yeah?
What happened?
-The boy....
The boy died.
I'm afraid I--
The red one.
Hey.
"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
- Where did you get that?
- What?
- Combination.
- Personnel.
Pratt matched at County.
"Yes, I know."
He keeps bitching about it.
He needs a locker.
Thought I'd spare Elizabeth the chore.
Heard you had some trouble with Romano yesterday.
He was right.
I took too long making a decision.
You don't have that luxury anymore.
I never really thought I did.
Mark's gone.
That means you've been here longer than any other doctor.
People will look to you to step in and fill the void.
Big void.
"Yes, it is."
I can't do this.
Will you do this?
Thank you.
Shotgun to the face.
"This is gonna be fun, huh?"
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.
"No, no, no."
It was a metal meteor.
- It ate his boat.
My dad says...
- Ah...
It wasn't any of those things.
"What would you know about it, Poindexter?"
- Hogarth!
- Shh...
Don't make me come over there.
(A CAPELLA MUSIC ON VIDEO)
(EXPLOSION)
(WHISPERING) It's about 50 or 60 feet high and it only eats metal.
"Shut up, you little spaz!"
It's probably been sent by foreign enemies to take over the country.
We should bomb it to smithereens before it does.

Why's a nice girl like you serving coffee to a guy like me?
Particularly when I have the right to refuse service to anyone.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
"I, uh..."
"I'm usually, hmm... (LAUGHS) Not like that?"
(LAUGHING) Right.
"Oh, it wasn't your fault."
Hogarth just...
I think he's lonely.
Yeah.
"Well, he's a good kid."
"Hey, come on outside."
I got something to show you.
"The sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... ."
Biggest thing here is the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"Come on, I need a witness."
-It's around the corner.
-Don't pull so hard.
It's like a chomp out of the side of the car.
"It's like a bite out of a sandwich, Iike a--"
"What are we looking at here, Mr. MansIey?"
"Something big, Marv."
Something big.
hello!
Come out!
"Hey, big metal guy, I got food here for you!"
metal!
"Crunchy, delicious metal!"
Come and get it!
"So I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh?"
The shutoff switch.
You saw me save you.
So where are you from?
"You came from the sky, right?"
From up there?
Don't you remember anything?
Maybe it's that bump on your head.
Do you talk?
"You know, words? ""blah, blah, blah,"" like that?"
Can you do that?
"well, you get the idea anyway."
Let's see.
See this?
"I'll miss you, Son."
"I'm sorry, Dad."
- You're fired!
- What?
Fire me?
That does it.
You can never be my son.
- A little to the left.
- Huh?
"Oh, very well."
You can never be my--
- Eeeeeeee!
- [ Gasps ]
"Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!"
[ Sighs ]
"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV... saying we didn't want you in our family..."
- but those were just actors playing us.
- How do you know?
"Because one of them hung out with me for a week, trying to get my character down."
"Yeah, me too."
That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia.
"The point is, the real Simpson family missed you a lot... and we're really glad you're home."
[ Kisses ]
- I love you guys.
"- Right back at you, Son."
[ All Sighing ]
"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman."
"Cowabunga, dudes."
[ Kissing ]
Give it a try.
It's like kissing a peanut. [ Chuckling ]
[ Kissing ]
Only they want him alive.
They don't want him dead.
"You see, before Saul retired from the Masada Team, he was a deputy commander and he knows operating procedures, he knows names, lists."
They will keep him alive at least for a while.
- It's all right. it's OK.
- 'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.'
"Lena, we're going to have to tell the police."
- No.
No.
- Lena.
No.
Saul knew we were being watched.
Our people are coming.
They will take care of this.
There is nothing for the police to do but stand in their way.
Please.
"Please, Tom, trust me."
Please.
I have been through this before.
Please.
Please.
"'Dr Haywood, you're wanted in paediatrics."

"Lena, look, you asked me to trust you."
"- You're gonna have to trust me, OK?"
- OK.
"Feeling calmer, Lena?"
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
"Mr Magnum, did you find out why they kidnapped her husband?"
- They must be meshugina.
- What?
That's Yiddish for crazy.
- A drink?
"With her drinking, how am I going to control myself?"
I'll get you one right away!
Wonderful!
She'll sure get drunk!
is this my heart beat or yours?
Or are our hearts beating as one?
Someone's knocking at the door!
Never mind him!
Answer the door!
How can I leave you alone?
Go and answer the door first!
"OK, stay where you are and reserve a place for me."
Collecting garbage removal fee!
This is the fee for 3 months.
Don't you ever bother me again.
But you haven't paid for 6 months.
Can't you just take this first?
Nobody's going to disturb us now.
You take a shower first!
Good idea.
Get all clean first!
I'm taking my shower.
"Bridget, I'll be real quick."
I mean I'll be quick at taking my shower!
Sure!
"Gosh, how can I say such silly things?"
Bridget!
"Robin darling, I have to go."
See you soon.
"Love, B!"
Robin darling!
Where's your dad...?
...He wasn't... my dad...
What this stuff?
I like puzzles.
I'm wanna go home now...
I wanna go.
Are you gonna let me...?
What are you gonna do to me...?
...I told you we couldn't be friends...
Hi...
Are you Larry...?
can I talk to you for a minute...?
Sure.
Sorry to bother you.
..How's... she doing...?
It's been... quite a night
They had to give her almost six pints of blood...
We're still waiting to see if her body rejects it.
I won't keep you too long.
I just want...
I need to ask you about the description you gave.
Of the little girl.
"You said she had long blonde hair was around twelve years old, and wasn't wearing shoes..."
- Right?
- Right!
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Maybe...
Looks like a guy in our building
Did he have a daughter?
Like the girl you described?
I don't know.
"However, chamber three was undisturbed, and the undisturbed chamber and the grave goods that were found in another, uh.."
"in the area, give us a r.."
Uh reason to da..
"to, uh, to-to date this, uh, find as we have."
Um...
"Any questions, then?"
No?
"Okay, that's it for the day, then."
"Um, don't forget.."
"Michaelson, chapters four and five for next time."
"And I will be in my office on Thursday, but not Wednesday."
"I had it, Marcus."
I had it in my hand.
What happened?
Guess.
Belloq?
You want to hear about it?
Not at all.
I'm sure everything you do for the museum conforms to the lnternational Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.
"It's beautiful, Marcus."
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.
There's only one place he can sell it:
Marrakech.
"I need $2,000."
Look..
"Listen to me, old boy."
I brought some people to see you.
Look.
I got these pieces.
"They're good pieces, Marcus."
-Look.
"Today, on the Golden State Freeway two boxes of deadly baby food were lost."
This baby food is contaminated with botulism.
"The boxes are marked ""Dalecki's. """
Why do I do that?
I mean just...
I'm too nice a guy.
I don't believe this.
Hey.
Hey.
"Yeah, you."
What do you think you're doing?
You were doing 68.
"You know, I could give you a citation for that."
That's 13 miles over the speed limit.
Thirteen miles.
Do you know that?
"Yeah, all right."
Just keep it under 55.
And consider yourself warned and advised.
Boy.
Why am I such a nice guy?
Now you stay by the window and watch.
Every move is a picture.
"Now, go on by the window."
Is she still out there?
"What ""Uh-oh""?"
Is she with another guy?
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
Maybe he heard about Melinda.
"If he's here, it means we're in trouble."
But what did we do?
"Now, uh, take me back to my hotel, please."

"[ Woman ] Going for a ride, kiddo?"
"You know my rules, Bobby."
It's after curfew.
"You weren't thinking of leaving, were you, Diane?"
Not with two years left on your contract.
"You can't hold her, Jessie."
"Think not, kiddo."
"Of course, if you want to buy her contract, it's worth at least 20 grand."
"But I like you, Bobby."
I'll let you have her for 1 5.
You haven't got 1 5?
That's too bad. [ Chuckles ]
"Well, I suppose I'm just gonna have to keep her."
"Well, of course you can visit Diane... for a more reasonable fee anytime she isn't occupied."
"- Dutch is gonna have to kill me, Jessie."
"- That's up to you, Bobby."
"Bobby, no."
Get in the car.
"Diane, get in the car!"
No!
[ Man ] There's a fight.!
"- All right, Jessie."
I'll stay.
- Sailor!
He's right as ninepence.
- Have you seen the size of that TV?
"- Full HD, of course."
No!
I need to put some paper down first.
"You can sit where you like, young man."
- You like that?
- Thank you.
"Of course, it's not as good as fresh from the vein."
Hang on.
We were told there wouldn't be any killing.
We wouldn't have brought him here otherwise.
I don't appreciate your tone.
"Given the company you've been keeping, it's understandable that you think that we're all cold-blooded killers."
What's that supposed to mean?
We have a much more civilised arrangement.
"Now, this is like a proper vampire house."
- Ooh!
"- No, no, no, the bulb's gone."
We stock up on the old eco-friendlies.
Comes with...
Watch your head!
"Here we are, through here."
- Ah!
"Ow, ow, ow!"
- All right?
"Oh, I don't know, I don't know."
- Aaah!
- Ha-ha-ha!
There he is!
Heh-heh!
Whoo!
"Well, I think we found our target."
No.
"No, no."
"Oh, I'm so stupid."
"Oh, Mr. Dellaman."
"Hi, Special Agent Henson, FBI."
Thank you for coming.
We're grateful for the warning.
"Well, you should know that our people will be at the rally regardless, looking for the individual planning the attempt."
"Once word gets out Mr. Dellaman won't be attending the rally,"
I'm sure she'll be long gone.
"I hope that won't be the case, but unfortunately, you may be right."
Have a good day.
(Angela) Jerry.
I said 12:30.
Grandfather's gonna be here any minute.
[sighs]
What's wrong?
Hey.
Are you okay?
What?
The girl was only after the papers.
Sondra?
The papers are gone.
She took the papers?
I tried calling her.
The line's disconnected.
I even went to the coffee shop.
Turns out she doesn't even work there.
She totally faked me out.
I don't believe this.
"How could you let this happen, Jerry?"
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
- It's the tour.
You can't do it.
You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it.
Cancel the tour.
Cancel it.
Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
"- You're messing up here, John."
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!
Russ McCallum and the governor Harris toured the Edgewater Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
"Sifu Wong, I propose a toast to your health."
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
"Cheers, everyone."
I'll help myself.
- It's an honor to know you.
- Don't mention it.
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
It looks like I blew my chance to be Sifu Wong's student.
Let's get out of here.
We're like brothers.
We'll find a way.
I've got it!
What?
You have to continue with schemes to show your heroism.
I promise this scheme will work better.
I don't want to be a hero.
You've got to appeal to Sifu's compassion.
"Good, that's the look!"
Let's go!
"- Sifu, we're in trouble!"
- What is it?
"A band of robbers was raiding the bank and Mousy was brave, he stood up to them without thought for his own life."
He beat them.
- What happened next?
- It's bad.
He's severely injured.
Were there any police around?
They disappeared when the robbers arrived.
"Hiya, Sangita."
It's Nicki.
Hiya.
You all right?
No.
Not really.
I just did a pregnancy test and I... tested positive for baby.
You neverI
I'm pretty sure I followed the instructions OK.
"Well, you're gonna have to go see a gynaecologist."
What good's a bush doctor gonna be?
I'm pregnant.
I know I am.
"I haven't had a period since the ""Eurovision Song Contest""."
- And what does Moz think?
"- That's just it, see."
It might not be Moz's.
What d'you mean?
"Well, he's got a one-in-three chance."
There's only one thing for it.
I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna tell him the truth.
I'm just poppin' out to get some tampons.
"- Get us some fags, will ya?"
- Course.
Sure.
I'll get you some fags.
Why not?
China.
Good to see ya.
- Broke up with Psycho Paul.
- Smart move.
"As a rule, never date anyone whose nickname suggests anger-management issues."
"Um, cool."

Now I get to go yell at 1 2-year-olds.
"Um, Karen, thank you."
Uh...
This is a good thing you've just done.
"Well, I hope so."
[Rick] And you called him at home?
And you still have the messages from yesterday?
I need to know if he's getting these messages or not.
"Okay, well, look, if he calls in, just tell him again."
[dialing]
- Who are you calling?
"- Uh, Miles."
You've called 700 times since yesterday.
Cell phone.
"Oh, well, that makes it all make sense."
I think Miles may be in flight.
He just got back from vacation.
As in fleeing.
A fugitive from justice.
Should I put a hold on the concrete?
"Judy, I'm not allowed to talk about it."
Because I'm not.
If you could please respect that.
"Lily, I need you to come in here for a second."
- How much do you know about it?
- Excuse me?
- Lily.
- What?
Stop pretending.
You know what I'm talking about.
The King's?
Yes.
You've come to me because all other efforts have failed?
I have.
How far are you willing to go to reclaim his love?
To own it it forever.
As far as I need.

Everything is under control.
Carry on.
A-ha!
"Take that, prohibition."
Is it?
It was right about then that a question started nagging at me.
Is Phil sexy?
Hey.
You feel like doing something a little crazy with me?
What?
No.
What?
No.
"Hey, honey."
"Phil, honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
I'm at the beach...
Long story.
I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor.
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
- I'm kind of busy.
- Okay.
"Cam, there's something that Claire would never approve of that I've always wanted to do."
Always?
We're gonna want to put a blanket down on that backseat.
This was a huge mistake.
I am jammed in the backseat with a hairy Peruvian biter.
It's spring break '92 all over again!
"Well, speed bump coming up."
Hold the leash taut.
It's supposed to keep her calm.
I got lucky.
I don't think this one's a spitter.
Ohh.
"Uh, I spoke too soon."
He's my brother.
[ Breathing heavily ]
I knew you were a lost cause.
"Unlike your sister, you're weak."
"Good to see you, too, Larry."
How could you do this to her?
To us?
Do what?
[ Scoffs ]
This.
"Oh, that."
"Oh [scoffs] yeah, that."
You know what that means?
Huh?
Now there are hunters here!
"It's your fault, blanco!"
"If you didn't starve me, maybe -- Listen, freak!"
Your sister and I spent years building this operation.
"And if you think I'm gonna let your gluttony destroy it, you got another thing coming."
I want you out.
Now.
I'm not leaving Maritza.
"Well, I got news for you, pal."
"She doesn't want you here, either."
Either you leave... or I'll make you.

You shouldn't be stuck in some stall balling.
And isn't there someplace else you'd rather be?
"- With my mom, but..."
- But what?
Where's she at?
At the hospital with him.
But it's... it's kind of upsetting there.
- You should be there.
"- l know, but..."

"Oh, my God."
We have to go with Sharon to the hospital.
I'll get Tino to drive us.
He loves hospitals.
"And Ricky will come, too."
The four of us.
Right?
Come on.
I have really been cutting Bio a lot.
"So, I should probably skip the hospital."
So I'll see you later.
Hey.
is this where you come to smoke?
"I'm always doing that,  I'm always asking questions I already know the answers to,"
"- So, are you crying or something?"
- l guess.
- How come?
"- Because I'm lonely,"
"Because I have no friends,"
"Because I'm a terrible, terrible person,"
Because of my friends father is in the hospital.
And he could die.
"I mean, why am I lying to my husband about whether or not I put gas in the car?"
It was stupid.
And we each thought the truth would destroy the other person.
Funny how that happens.
But we all want to have sex with someone new.
"It's risky, it's exciting, and that's okay."
But divorce over that?
I would never leave my husband for a better orgasm.
"Thank you, honey."
Do we have to do it in here?
"There's a private office downstairs, I think."
Mmm.
"Oh, God."
Hold that thought.
Hang on.

Is everything okay?
"Let me get you another drink, okay?"
There's no need to rush.
We're here to take our time.
You want me to wait?
You know what happens to those that wait.

They come.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, excuse me."
"Neil, there you are."

I don't know if I can fix it.

"- Oh, no."
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
You know what?
I quit.
He can suck it.

"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.

She said it stinks.

This is why Liz is wrong.

I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What?
What do you mean?

You mean this eye?
"Okay, this eye, it doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."

"Yeah, but he had a gig last night and he probably didn't get home till late."
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.
- Just call.
JOSHUA:
"Oh, honey, no, on speaker."
I don't think so.
"- No, thank you."
I really don't eat meat.
I'll just go ahead with the penne.
- Spicy?
"- Yes, please."
Thanks.
"So, how are..."
Will and the boy?
"Let's forego the small talk today, Shelly."
- It'll make me feel cheap.
- Let the big talk begin.
Have you seen this?
That's my...
"That's my file on you, Senator."
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?
Have you read it yet?
How did you get it?
Have you read it?
- What do you have to say for yourself?
"- With all due respect... um, Senator..."
- it doesn't matter what I have to say for myself.
"- Oh, it doesn't?"
"It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, all you can claim about me..."
"claim, is that I had sex..."
- Deviant sex.
- Who says it was deviant?
I do.
"And what I say, the people will believe."
And you know why?
Because I'll have a very big microphone in front of me.
"Wow, you must really hate me, Shelly."
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.
She got kidnapped by the Janjaweed.
Her name's Clare Somersby.
- The aid worker.
- Yeah.
She's going to die.
"Along with a lot of other people, if you don't help me."
Please?
There's no sign yet of Stonebridge on any of the satellite feeds.
Widen the grid reference.
What about Matak?
According to his office he's away on an official engagement.
"No, he's stalling."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
See if she was arrested as well and get me on a flight to Khartoum.
I'm going to have to deal with this personally.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
(DOOR CLOSING)
Thank you.
I need a phone.
I have done all that I can.
For you and the other one.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
What do you mean the other one?
Hendricks.
He came in last night.
He'd been in a car accident.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
I have to go.
(SINGING)
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.
"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
I should go.
Hang on.
"You might as well stay for the beginning of ""Saved by the Bell"", if you want."
"Okay, how do I look?"
Good.
How do I look?
"- Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
"- Wait, how much did I weigh at birth?"
I don't know.
It was your birth.
"But you should know, shouldn't you?"
"I mean, if you're my dad."
"Listen, she doesn't suspect that we're not father and son."
She's not going to be trying to catch us out.
When's your birthday?
Quick.
- August 19.
- Okay.
Who's my mum?
Your mum's your mum.
"So you were married to my mum, but now you've split up?"
Yeah.
Whatever.
Does it bother you or me?
"No, I'm comfortable with it."
But I think you still have a few issues.
"It's not funny, okay."
- Only cause you're a...
"- You love her still, don't you?"
- Christ's sake.
- I know you do.
- You love Mummy.
What?
"Award-winning footage, Kyle."
Think you might be thinning a bit at the back though.
Steve?
Steve!
Idiot!
"Oh, yeah, about the film..."
I've decided to go another way.
"OK, yeah..."
Two points to the kindergarten.
"You've slowed me down, that's all."
"I've got the bait, and I'll be back for your wolves."
He is right about the bait.
"Yeah, I mean wolves can't resist it."
Although...
"Since I've got it, it's probably no use to him."
Very stealthy.
Thank you very much.
I think I'm ready for my close-up now.
This is for all the wolves out there.
Howl it with me now.
I remember the scent.
Then it went dark.
- Then I saw that man...
- He smelled bad.
- And then Shannon.
"- Yeah, but then Tom."
Which means we must have been trapped.
- Then released.
- By Tom.
We probably owe Shannon and Tom our lives and we can't even thank them.
What are you going to tell your parents?
Make him shut up!
I can't make him talk and shut up at the same time.
I've had enough of this!
Enough!
I was giving him a truth serum.
We've given it to him three times... and all he admitted was that he was a homosexual.
Thirty cc's of Pentothal to have him say he's homosexual.
"It's a deginning, no?"
We've already wasted a lot of time.
Mougeotte.
Dear Mougeotte.
Tell us where the microfilm is... or I'll put a dullet in your head!
I don't know where it is!
I don't even know what microfilm is.
I don't know!
Telephone.
What?
No need to look further.
They have it.
They've arrested Martin and Dupré.
Bastards!
They've infiltrated our ring.
You sold it to the other side.
Excuse me?
You chose the wrong camp.
Too dad.
No!
Don't kill me!
I didn't do anything!
The house is surrounded.
You haven't got a chance.
Give yourselves up.
Can I steal you for a sec?
"I, uh... inadvertently lip-kissed your mom."
Greg.
I didn't enjoy it!
Why do you even have to say that?
There's no way everyone's staying quiet about Grandma.
You don't think so?
Care to make it more interesting?
I'll bet on it.
It's on!
When have I ever high-fived?
"You know, when I was a stewardess, before every flight, I had to get on the scale."
"And if you weighed over 118, they put you on diet pills and only let you fly out of Jersey and Detroit."
That's terrible.
"No, no, no."
It kept me looking fantastic.
Mom!
That's degrading.
"Mama, where's my stress ball?"
Oh.
"Honey, we'll find it."
And I feel ya.
"What, so now she's using a stress ball?"
When the need arises.
"Knock, knock!"
Happy Thanksgiving!
- Viv?
- So fun!
Greg saw me through the window and waved me in!
"Hi, everybody!"
Look at your table!
Yeah.
"- ""Happy."" Happy, Dick Nixon."
- You remember him.
- Nice to see you again.
- You're obviously making him happy.
- Ohh!
"Repartee, Dick!"
Marvelous!
"- [Chattering, Laughing Continue]"
- Whatyou predicting?
Your boy Goldwater gonna split the party?
"- Some say you are, Rocky."
- Letme tellyou something.
"Every time the Republican party is a home to extremism, we lose the election."
- You oughta know betterthan anybody.
- Yeah.
This guy Goldwater is as stupid as McCarthy.
"And McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now, did he?"
That's right.
[Nixon] I hate these cocktail parties.
"John, I'm in hell."
I'll be mentally dead in two years and physically dead in four.
"Make some money, Dick."
Prove yourself to the Wall Streetcrowd.
Let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
I don't know.
I miss making love to the people.
I miss entering a room.
I miss the...
"pure acting of it, John."
I gotta get back in the arena.
[Fanfare]
"Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime!"
"Listen, Herr Mac..."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
"Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to."
Take your hands off me!
Take your lousy hands off!
Wait a minute.
"Wait, I..."
I can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that.
Wait...
I'll tell you everything.
"Yes, I know you will."
Let her go.
Whiskey.
Shoot them.
Shoot them both.
My medallion!
"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
"Boy, you're something!"
"Yeah, I'll tell you what."
"Until I get back my $5,000, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
I'm your goddamn partner!
"Cairo, city of the living."
A paradise on earth.
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Oh... oh, no."
Cute.
What an adorable creature.
Clap on!
"I said, the plate."
...that you're holding.
Get out!
This home is temple for us!
Right?
"You're right, sir."
Go on... don't mind this!
Go away!
Let me not see you around again!
"Thanks, Laxmi."
You have awakened us today.
I wonder how many thieves we have at home!
"She'll play Alibaba and drive away the thieves, grandpa."
"I threw her out of the gate, sir!"
"I'd throw her out of town, if I could."
I'll find another maid in a couple of days.
Why a maid?
Why not a male?
We can find a good cook.
"With a maid around, maybe..."
"You win, aunt!"
A male would be perfect.
I'll find a cook soon.
That's okay.
What do we eat till then?
I'll cook.
I did it for 5 years in my house.
No thank you.
You people have been flesh-eaters!
"You must help her, Laxmi."
I can't stand the smell of flesh in this house!
"Marion's the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy."
What do you mean?
"Well, I mean that for nearly 3,000 years, man has been searching for the Lost Ark."
Not something to be taken lightly.
No one knows its secrets.
It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
"Oh, Marcus."
"What are you trying to do, scare me?"
You sound like my mother.
We've known each other for a long time.
"I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus."
I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance.
You're talking about the bogeyman.
"Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am."
"Nice to see you again, Dr. Jones."
Thank you.
Shh... shh...
Shh...
Give him space!
Give him space!

Allow me.
"Remember all those secrets Jenny amassed when she was trying to protect you, Nelly?"
"Well, now the world knows them too."
Looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind...
PENELOPE:
How can you do this?
Letting some girl from Brooklyn carry on our legacy?
Ever heard of a foreign queen?
"Besides, her dad is marrying Lily Bass so I think that makes her richer than all of you."
Not enough.
JENNY:
"Okay, so starting next year, no more headbands, except for this one."
"- Thanks, you can keep the change."
"- Oh, big spender."
"Hey, Mom."
It's really cool here.
I've already met some great people.
Yeah.
"All right, all right, you were right about Portland."
I think I'm gonna love it.
All right.
"Listen, I gotta go, all right?"
I'll call you soon.
NATE:
"I'm done for the day, if you guys wanna see a movie."
Let's do it.

Hold on.
Hold on.
Hello?
GEORGINA:
"Be her knight in shining armor, of course."
"Evelyn, this is Fiona."
We work together.
- Hello.
Thank you.
- Pleasure.
Evelyn.
What happened?
I went to the courthouse to try to get an emergency custody hearing.
-Some guys were at my car.
They knocked me down.
-How many men were there?
"- Two, I think."
- You think?
Could there have been more?
Probably the same guys that came by Doug's place.
"Michael, ifJasper's caught up in the middle of this, I will never forgive myself."
"Please, you gotta bring him home."
It's all right.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
- What happened to the trademark Westen emotional distance?
- She was upset.
Obviously.
Where's your head at?
"Fi... if you're gonna help me, you can't have this attitude."
Attitude?
"If you're gonna be like this, I think I'm entitled to an attitude."
- Maybe I should do this one alone then.
- Maybe you should.
He was pretending to be unconscious.
I gave him another injection.
Now he doesn't have to pretend.
He has a weak heart.
You can only give him 30ccs within...
"Listen, we know what we're doing."
Is there anything else?
I've located the woman.
She is at the Robin Masters estate with a man named Magnum.
"- Yes, Mr Masters?"
"- 'Higgins, it's me.'"
How did you get this number?
I had it changed.
"'I was lucky, I guess."
I have a little problem.'
- How perceptive of you.
"- Higgins, I can't get out of the car."
'The car?
You've wrecked the car?
'
"No, I haven't wrecked it."
I just can't get out of it.
- Where are you?
- In the Audi.
The Audi?
"- Very clever, Magnum."
"- 'Just get the dogs, Higgins."
'Get the dogs.'
"Tommy, this is silly of you to bring me to this fancy house."
You wouldn't want me to take you some place sleazy?
That would be more in character.
"- More tea, Mrs Greenberg?"
"- Ben, don't."
"I know you. 0nce you get worked up, you start a fight."
Will you come to the market with us tomorrow?
"As a matter of fact, Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us to the marketplace tomorrow."
- Yeah. I think I'll cancel out.
- Sit down and eat your dinner.
- We
- We'd love to go.
"- 0h, we'd be delighted."
I don't know why he gets so worked up over unimportant things.

"What's he saying, Mrs Drayton?"
"He's the teller of tales, Hank."
Isn't this exciting?
Just like the county fair when I was a kid.
They got everything but the balloon ascension.
(Chuckling)
What's so funny?
Did you ever see a balloon ascension?
I was thinking.
You know what's paying for these three days in Marakesh?
- Me.
- Mrs Campbell's gallstones.
Not so soon.
How about tomorrow?
Let me tell you something.
"No need, just drop me a line."
Some chick is crazy about me.
I'm irresistible!
That's a good joke.
"Very funny indeed, good night!"
You are jealous.
"Guess, who's come to find me?"
The boss's fiancee
B.?
"How dare you call her B., only I can."
She calls me Robin darling too!
Robin darling?
Are you kidding?
"She's so sexy, she even tried to seduce me."
Tore everything off to rush and take a shower...
You mean her?
Me of course!
But she told me to do so.
Do you get it?
But it's very clear what she wanted to do.
Why is she lying on your bed?
I haven't done anything yet!
How dare you steal my first girlfriend?
I didn't.
Don't deny it.
This is the end of our friendship!
Did you go and visit him?
Yes I did!
Did you tell him to take a shower?
She might even die.
How is she?
She went on a hunger strike outside the King's chambers.
She's been out in the cold for four days and nights.
The wretched woman.
She's trying to kill herself.
The King is ignoring her.
Now that Jumong is dead the King doesn't need a hostage.
Why won't he let her go?
He still wants to win her heart.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
Your Highness.
"Hurry up, take her to her chamber."
"Yes, sir."
"Your Highness, I'm here."
How do you feel?
You've gained consciousness but you'll die if you don't take this.
Please drink some.
I'm ready to die.
I have nothing to fear.
You're dismissed.
I have something to tell you.
I'm the assassin Prince Daeso sent to Jolbon.
I told Prince Daeso that I'd killed the Commander... but he's not dead.
Is Jumong really alive?
"Whatever you need, Mom."
Whatever you need.
Hey.
How was the pier?
"Okay, I'm not being funny, but there was literally one shop."
Are you serious?
"- I know, right?"
- Yeah.
There are more shops than that... in jail.
"Well, I'm sure you found a way to have fun."
Did Mom seem weird to you?
"Um, not more than usual, but she's fine."
Don't worry.
Well...
"I will be in my room, avoiding risky activities."
So... yeah.
Mom just went off on me and made it clear she doesn't want me to ride.
"- Well, did you talk to her about it?"
- Have you met Mom?
Good point.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway...
"How have you been, Dad?"
How's your time-out going?
It's been pretty quiet.
A little too quiet without you guys.
But tell me about that cute little island you're on.
Did Rosie meet the queen yet?
"The queen, she is in London."
And it's...
It's cool.
I met some new friends.
That's enough!
You're mistaken.
No mistake!
Witnesses?
I will be a witness.
He is Lun Taichen.
He's your father's old accountant.
"And he caused your father's death, by betraying him and watching him die in jail."
And then he drove your mother to insanity.
Shut up!
Who are you?
"I'm Old Honshu, Jeng's old servant."
"I know you stole that factory from them, and then all their land, and after that you got rid of every last one of their servants."
"But here you are, hunted by the police."
"You, you, ran away that night."
"I met you a few years ago, and I've been following you ever since then, just waiting for the chance to get my revenge."
I want to see you die before my very own eyes!
You're telling lies!
Honshu!
You go!
Right.
Come with me!
Uncle.

He escaped.
You okay?

You mean the usual?
Yes.
Although I've never won this thing.
"And this year, I definitely don't have a chance."

"Sure, I'll tell him to call you."
"Hey, where have you been?"
I've been holding the room upstairs for you.
You have no clients left.

"For heaven sakes, why?"
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.
What could've done this?
- I told you what.
"- Oh, yeah."
(SNICKERS) Strange invaders.
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
Yeah.
They're sending someone to take care of the whole thing.
"Jeez, Earl."
You really are crazy.
"I mean, who in the hell would the government send?"
"Kent Mansley, United States Government, Unexplained Phenomena Department."
- Marv Loach.
I'm the foreman here.
- What happened here?
Not sure.
"Sometimes the line'll snap if the weather is bad, sure."
"But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that, whoa!"
It's got me beat.
It's almost like it was bitten off by some enormous beast.
Enormous beast.
"Yeah, what do you think?"
Escaped gorilla?
"Uh, what department is that again?"
Bye-bye.
"Doctor, this is an emergency."
This man has been shot.
Come on in.
Let's have a look at you.
Here you go.
Let's get some of these things off so we can take a look at it.
Easy...
There.
Now get up here on the table.
Alright.
Now turn a little bit.
Let me take a look at this.
When did this happen?
Just a little while ago on the street.
Hm-hmm.
You know I'm gonna have to report this to the police.
You know who did it?
"A sniper, I think."
"Hand me a shot, please."
"Sniper, huh?"
Is it serious?
"Well, if you mean are you gonna die?"
I don't think so.
"You know, one of the greatest dangers arising from a gunshot wound is infection, but... they have a cure for that now."
This just came out.
I've had some very dramatic results with it.
What's it called?
Penicillin.
There we are.
My forceps.
Does that hurt?
"""Take this, all of you, and eat it for this is my body."""
"When the supper was ended, he took the cup."
Again he gave you thanks and praise.
"He gave the cup to his disciples and said, ""Take this all of you, and drink from it."
This is the cup of my blood.
"The blood of the new and everlasting covenant, the mystery of faith."""
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
-Did you do that?
-Uh-huh.
-Do it again.
-In time.
"No, now."
In time.
"Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
You speak Latin?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.
What's that?
Holy water.
You keep it away.
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
"You know, I'm, like, in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
Um....
- There are divisions in this country...
- That's because you created them.
- I did not create them.
The Democrats did.
"If it's dialogue you want, you're more likely to get itfrom me than from people burning down cities."
- Dr. King said the same thing.
"- Oh, please."
"Do you know, young man, who a great hero is?"
Abraham Lincoln.
- Abraham Lincoln.
- Lincoln.
"Is he beautiful, huh?"
He believed in common ground.
He broughtthis country together.
- [Applause]
- I love thatman.
I love him.
I wantthe son of a bitch who gotthatagitatorto be fired!
- I have another question.
- There's a little girl sitting here.
- A little girl sitting with a sign.
- [Ziegler] Bag the spook.
- Can you see the little girl?
- Okay.
[Nixon] There are three simple words:
"""Bring us together."""
"That is what I want, and that is what the greatmajority of Americans want."
And that is why I wantto be president.
- To bring us together.
- [Applause]
"- Give me a break, Mary."
"- Now, you all know me."
Look at him.
"He's like a cage fighter, all wiry and feral."
"- And rich too, don't forget."
- Ah... he's perfect.
If only he wasn't talking to your boyfriend.
What boyfriend?
"You do actually love Paul, don't you?"
"Honey, right now, I can't even remember his name."
"So what do you do, Justin?"
- I'm an Army man.
"- Wow, respect."
- Seen any combat?
- Afghanistan.
Three tours.
Can't seem to get enough of the blood and dust.
"So you're with Eleanor, right?"
"For my sins, yes."
"Though, I'm not..."
I'm not convinced it's going anywhere.
- And we've done it but considering I...
- Are you and Gemma an item?
- got back...
- Why?
You interested?
No.
"No, she's not my type."
She's right up Felix's street though.
"Yeah, right."
What's the joke?
You think she's too good for him?
"Well, he made a move at the end of summer term."
Didn't work out too well.
"- No, Tommy."
- I promised Rosemary.
- What the fuck did you tell her?
Nothing.
She asked me to look out for you.
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Look out for me.
"And when you see me, don't stop."
"That way, you're not breaking any promises to anybody."
"Tell me, Paul..."
What?
Why do you want me under your train?
It's just...
I've had... two people die under my train this month.
"Jesus, you're a serial killer!"
No.
They weren't my fault.
They got this rule.
"If you have three in a month, they pay you off."
Ten years' wages.
Lump sum.
Mm...
What were you planning to do with this pay-off?
- Buy more books?
- Get out of London.
"Go and live in Scotland, on an island."
- Get away from everything.
- Really?
Life in the fast lane get too much for you?
Youth is wasted on the young.
"You know, somebody famous said that."
- What were you planning to do on this island?
I'm so hungry.
"I thought there was a cracker, or like some fruit left or some shit."
I don't know.
Put that away.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Are you here to hurt me?
No no no.
No no.
"No no, we don't wanna hurt you."
Okay.
Not at all.
I'm sorry about him.
Yeah.
"We're robbers, and we're stuck down here with you."
You're robbers?
Yeah.
You don't make any sense.
We were pulling a heist.
I'm the leader.
He's part of my crew.
"Yeah, don't, don't judge us on our rugged exterior."
Find anything yet?
Nothing.
I think we just should have sent that text.
"Look, it was a good plan, okay."
"We found the jammer, we killed it, we could have gotten a phone call out."
So no one knows that you're here?
No.
Wait a minute.
Why would you rob this place?
"We, we thought it was legit."
There was no one here.
Where's Cutter?
"Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?"
- They catch him.
- What's that?
Who?
"In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter."
Who's they?
Priests or what?
Very bad men.
They'll give him torture.
"Go help, quick."
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
"And you'll run back just as quick, too."
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing!
I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right.
We'll go together.
- No.
"Tommy, what's the matter?"
"Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out."
"Don't worry, I'm not taking him."
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
I'm not sick of you at all.
And wow!
"It's been a good like six months, right?"
What?
Six months?
Then the Ice Land sign is like eight months?
You think we'd only last a year and a half?
I don't know.
I don't want to be presumptuous.
- I don't know if you're married orwhat.
- I'm not.
"Well, I'm separated."
We separated last month.
I was thinking... that Tyrone... was like 20 years away at least.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
"Well, actually I was thinking..."
"Tyrone is, like, when we die of old age."
"And this is, like, our whole life together, this block."
"See, that's perfect."
- Let's do it thatway.
- Okay.
"Well, guess it can't be avoided."
Everyone dies.
I could walk you to your car.
"Maybewe should just be glad... that we lived this long, good life together."
"You know, it's so much more than most people ever get to have."
- Okay.
- Okay.
"- Well, don't be afraid."
- Okay.
"–Uh, is it really necessary?"
"–Yeah, do you mind?"
"–No, not at all."
–Great.
Follow me.
Hey.
Fleetwood's been checkin' in with his parole officer... doin' community service and scrubbing' graffiti.
Sumbitch is totally clean.
You?
I ran some of the names he had in his Palm Pilot.
He had four two-strikers in his address book.
You need a new C.I.?
–Doesn't everyone?
–I'm gonna hit the head.
"Then we can go do some arm twisting', huh?"
"–Vic, we need to talk."
–What's up?
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.
He was supposed to burn that.
"Well, apparently, Armadillo burned him first."
Claudette wants to run your financials against Tio's records.
Fine.
Let her.
–You sure?
–Trust me.
She's not gonna find anything.
–What's Joe Clarke doing here?
–You know Joe?
I remember his picture in the papers.
He can't be here.
"Hey, he's a friend of mine."
And he's also an embarrassment to this department.
- Deal.
And stop bothering me about my hair.
We're interfering with your personal life?
I'm closing it ... relax.
God knows what he'll start thinking in his head now.
"Hey, what happened?"
"- There is nothing wrong, man."
Relax.
- Not that.
What about the booklets?
I've solved that problem.
He'll send them home.
69 Rafet.
It's super.
"Come on, I will take care of this."
It was obvious that something like this would happen.
"I'm telling you, I'll take care of it."
Don't do this.
"Oh, this is bad."
Can you please put yourjacket on?
"Ok, I'm putting my jacket on."
"Wait, I'll end this issue."
What's this guy's name?
Mert!
Yes?
"Hi, this is Zeynep Erez."
I'm Mert's new guidance counselor.
"If you have some time, can I have a word with you?"
Don't feel sad dear.
"If he wants to get divorced, then divorce him."
Don't say it like that dear.
It just hurts.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
The powder Mulan gave us...
we need to use it.
We gotta knock him out.
"Well, that's riskier."
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
Who's Milah on the tattoo?
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was once.
I got doughnuts.
I got jelly.
(Chuckles)
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix... this high-end jewelry place.
The manager was a drunk.
It's our honor that Brother Y an invites us here
We'll do whatever you need us to do!
"Come, come!"
"Gentlemen, help yourself!"
"Don't be shy, feel free to eat!"
Who are you?
Where is that woman?
She is cooking in the kitchen
I'm the youngest apprentice of Thunderstorm
Youngest apprentice?
T ake that old fart here
And see if this kid is lying
Y es!
Lying?
I'm telling you the truth
My name is Gao Jian
How come I've never seen you before?
Master said that I didn't practice well
So he kicked me out.
I just came back to see how he is doing.
If you release me
I'll pour wine for you!
"Master, Master!"
How are you?
"Master, I'm Gao Jian!"
Gao Jian!
"Zhengzong, is this one of your apprentice?"
Y es!
"Master, so I can be your apprentice again?"
T ake him out.
He's not allowed here... without my permission!
"Dad, take the medicine!"
Seeing these people...
Nagasaki...
That day...
I can feel it.
Okay.
"Even if it's okay for you, it's still too short for Clark."
His feet will stick out.
He's the same size as John Wayne.
How about using this to add length?
We did make fools of ourselves.
Don't you think so?
I guess you're right.
I really feel ashamed.
Where's Clark?
He stepped out into the garden with Grandma.
I wonder if it's all right.
I wonder if they can communicate.
I think it's all right.
They seem to be talking just fine.
I am terribly sorry for not knowing about Uncle.
I'm really sorry.
That's all right.
You were born and live in Nagasaki.
And still... we didn't realize it.
That was wrong of us.
We were wrong.
That's all right.
My father told me...
"""Clark, go..."
"""and do whatever you can for your aunt. """
That's what he said.
That's all right.
"Dude, rule number one; we will stop calling her ""girl."""
Really?
Why is that?
"We used to say it before, what happened?"
Things have changed.
Watch your mouth if you don't want to mess up our mood.
What are you saying?
"Dude, we barely convinced him."
Take it easy.
"Okay, fine."
I won't say anything.
We're blessed.
What's up with your hair?
Tie it up.
Hey 3012 Mert.
"Sir, I give up."
"I've forgotten the way of the school, but... you haven't forgotten my school number."
Do you really know all of our numbers?
"Shut up, you ill-mannered wretch."
Sure I do.
"This is 6024 Sinan, 5947 Kaan, 6813 Gamze, 5018 Uluc."
Fix your tie.
Well done!
"Let's hope for the best, sir."
You were a businessman; what happened?
What happened with your job?
"I took a medical report, sir."
I'm on holiday.
"We'd better go to our class, sir."
"As you know, the bell has rung."
Really?
Are you serious?
- Was this where you got carsick?
- I think it was.
- What do you mean?
- Pete got really bad...
"Well, on this night we were towing the Yugo, and I was facing the Yugo."
So I was driving backwards outside.
It was about 15 degrees.
And you had some bad food.
It smelled like gasoline.
And I think I ate some bad flan.
- Yeah.
- Bad what?
"You know, it's the old bad flan."
- Flan?
- Yeah.
You never had flan?
Flan like the pannacotta kind of flan?
It's like the Mexican dessert.
It's just like lard.
- It's just like caramel flavored lard.
"- No, it's not."
- It's like custard.
- It's cream.
"- Yeah, it's delicious."
- It's a damn flan.
- I'm not saying that it's not good.
"- Okay, so did you get all...?"
"I threw up on the process trailer, is what happened."
- You did.
- And I didn't finish the day.
"Christo Morse, our AD, saved me."
He directed the last quarter of the day.
Are you serious?
Seriously.
Seriously.
I'm glad you think it's funny. making money.
We want you to throw a fight.
I said no.
One thing led to another.
It ended up with me smashing the guy's head in. offered me a deal. they'd set me up with a new life somewhere.
this is somewhere all right.
I fight once in a while.
It stops me going out of my mind and gives me a bit of spare cash.
the Feds don't give you any money?
man.
the fucking assholes-- they literally give me just enough to survive.
That's why I took your deal.
sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
Well... it's good.
We are on.
And the money?
Open book.
Who knows?
000.
But there is one thing.
what's that?
You're fighting Victor.
Do you really have to do this?
Yeah.
I don't want any part of it.
Forget about that shit.
Focus on the job at hand.
Come on.
What's wrong?
You okay?
- Yeah.
Everything's fine.
- All right.
I don't want to hear about it 'cause it isn't true.
That isn't Artie.
"I don't want to believe it either, Pete,"
But it's true.
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't even be reading that."
Pete.
We should be out doing something.
"Pete, his real name isn't even Artie Nielsen."
It's Artie Weisfelt.
He used to work for the NSA.
He was a cryptographer--a code breaker--
When he was in his 20s.
They recruited him right out of school.
They had him decoding soviet communications.
"He intercepted letters, phone transcripts."
Then they think he turned.
He contacted one of the people they were spying on
And he started selling secrets to the Russians.
"And his file, it just ends."
He was never prosecuted.
It's like he just disappeared.
"But it's him, Pete."
What?
It's definitely him.
You're under arrest.
"No, no, no. listen to me."
I have to take this.
we can book an open fight.
that's when we're all gonna get paid.
Hell yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Cheers.
- All right.
man?
Where's your punk friend of my sister's?
Huh?
How would I know?
I'm gonna ask you one more time nicely.
I told you-- l don't know.
all right? I don't have anything to do with your beef with Brandon.
Shut up.
Shut up!
Tell your friend to stay the fuck away from my sister.
You understand?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
You make sure he gets the message.
You got that?
clean your tools ever?
Can you hand me a socket wrench?
is this it?
What is this?
Does this look like a socket wrench?
I don't know what that is.
wrench.
It's a socket wrench.
How about I just sock you with this-- this giant hammer?
I thought you were sweet when I met you.
You want to make me a sandwich instead?
Butthatwas a mistake.
The White House was full of Kennedy people then.
Itstill is.
- Who do you think's behind this?
"- Well, you have C.I.A. People all overthis place."
Helms has seen to that.
And then there's Kissinger's staff.
"Kissinger himself, I believe, may be the leaker."
- Kissinger?
- He's obsessed with his own image.
He wants his Nobel peace prize a little too much.
"And as the late Dr. King proved, even an ape can win a prize with good press."
"Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office."
"He comes in here ranting and raving,"
- dumping his crap all overthe place.
- [Laughing]
"Could you prove it, Edgar?"
"Mr. President, I always getmy man."
"Yeah, you do."
This damn tie.
- Could you help me?
- Yeah.
"See, I'd be bugging myself."
Who'd getthe tapes?
No one.
Your property.
And itwould prove your case.
Why do you think Kissinger is taping allyour calls?
For history.
Hmm?
His word againstyours.
And right now...
"A little too friendly for me, apparently."
"Uh, never mind."
Her name is Audrey.
All right.
Audrey.
Got it.
- You good?
- I need a favor.
My father isn't sick.
He's been faking his illness.
Why would he do that?
That's what I want to find out.
Why not just ask him?
He left the country.
With Emma.
"Look, there must be someone else that knows about this."
"His... his bodyguard, Donnie, I've left him messages."
"So far, nothing."
I'll see what I can do.
All right.
Hang in there.
How often do you see an escort?
Once a month or so.
I just started doing this.
"Uh, I got a raise at work."
The dating pool is depressing.
It's full of boys in skinny jeans and baseball caps.
"It's hard to find, like, men."
Women are like wild horses.
"You stroke 'em, put 'em at ease."
Whisper in their ear.
"In my experience, the more high society they are, the more they like to be manhandled."
Vuitton Gellys.
I loved it.
Did you see Fendi broche bag?
- I've got to have it!
- It's gonna be a success.
I'll make 4 pages on it.
What's that deal with that Vogue stealing on your stories?
I heard there was a curry.
"It's Yuri, dummy, we're talking Russians, not Indians."
It's not me.
I won't work for Vogue anymore.
They didn't airbrush me properly.
- The designers are butchers.
- Butchers?
Now I have my own private airbrusher over here at Skirt.
Paul is such a sweetie!
- The duke with the Macintosh.
- I love working with royalty.
I love sleeping with royalty.
"Who are you, the fourth Mallard sister?"
"Not quite, Olivier."
I don't do exiles.
I like my men underfed and overbred.
Can you give me a tiara?
"Anyway, this one has got polo fields... and the largest private estate in all of England."
Whores!
All of you.
"Hey, man!"
Do you know where Jocelyn is?
"French fries, yeah!"
"- See'ya, Alex."
- Peace.
Mr. Gold?
Hi.
Peter said you were here.
Shouldn't you be in synagogue?
Uh... no.
How are you feeling?
- Better.
- Good.
Then I won't feel bad about saying this.
Your son is going to lose.
"Without Alicia, he will lose the governorship."
"Uh, I-I don't know..."
"She was on our side, Jackie."
"Alicia was offering to help Peter, then you got involved."
How did I get involved?
This friggin' house!
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Your past, your future, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?

I am truly lucky in that sense too.

"If I was you, Harry,"
I'd fold while I still have some bus fare left.
All in.
"Turn them over, big lad."
Shame.
I was hoping to take that shirt off your back.
"This game is over for you, Detective."
MAN:
He lost it all again?
People don't gamble because they want to win.
"They gamble because, secretly, they want to lose but with you... (LAUGHS) it's not even a secret."
"That's very poetic, Freddie."
You should write it down.
I don't want someone like you to owe me this much money.
"Viljanen, goddammit."
Get up!
Show me...
A disgrace to the entire brigade.
Does he live here?
I'm too scared to sleep.
I can come and keep my finger in your navel.
Easy...
You're moving further down.
"Down, until I can feel your tongue... ah."
Don't turn it off or the neighbors will hear.
"No, I wasn't talking to you."
"He hung UP""-"
What happened to the smell?
-I threw Hakkarainen out.
Don't take any new idiots in.
-Of course not.
The red Batman has moved into building D.
"He's an old friend of mine, Jesse Viljanen."
He was just named firefighter of the year.
He was torching the garbage can!
"-He's a nice guy, really."
I think he's repulsive and nuts.
"What's eating you, Jemina?"
"Grow up, Mom."
Don't let your boy play with matches anymore!
Will you come and work at the office when you get better?
Are you sure?
Yes?
I see...
Goodbye.
You must not torch garbage cans.
- do you understand?
- Right.
We're here to find out what Gene Hansen was doing the night he died.
I got it.
"If you suspect someone, don't accuse them."
Don't let on that you suspect.
Okay?
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
You come directly to me.
- Do you understand?
"- Okay, okay, can we just go in now?"
All right.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Don't you think we should go in separately?
You don't think I fit in?
"Yeah, sure, narc."
"Okay, you take the customers."
Don't let on that we know each other.
What?
So what are you serving?
This is a private club.
"It's okay, Wynter."
This is Vicki Nelson.
She's doing some work for me.
She'll have some questions for you.
Please feel free to give her any assistance that she needs.
Taking a walk on the dark side are we?
"Unfortunately, I live there."
How long did you know Gene?
Since eighth grade.
Drama club.
"Ain't no problem at all, Sheriff."
Anything I can do to help.
It's working.
Come on.
"Are you all right, hon?"
Did he hurt you?
"I'm sorry, look..."
"The sheriff's upstairs, all right."
We have to warn him.
I need you to help me open the door.
Can you do that?
Okay.
I'm gonna hook this out through the door.
Okay.
"Then you turn it on, all right."
"Catch you a cup of coffee, Sheriff?"
Homemade iced tea?
"No, thank you."
I'm sorry.
How long did you say you lived here?
I didn't.
"Well, how long?"
Long time.
And not a lot of decorations in this nice house.
"No, never had that for that kind of thing."
Is that right?
"Well, my wife Betty, she..."
She took care of all that stuff before she passed on.
"Nothing quite like a woman's touch, huh."
My wife died just last year.
"Well, my condolences, Sheriff."
Suppose it'll get better with time.
We got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
I wanted to radio but...
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
The villagers are on the move and it doesn't look like they're gonna a picnic.
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
"Alright, get back there and sit tight."
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord!
What?
She took the retrovirus.
- You said it wasn't ready.
- It's not!
Not by a long shot.
What'll it do?
"To be honest, I have no idea."
"Colonel Sheppard, come in."
Go ahead.
We'vegotanotherproblem.
Ellia's gone and she's injected herself with the retrovirus.
Why would she do that?
She must have overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
Please.
You've got to find her before the villagers do.
And to remember that it's never too late to recapture who you were.
Or to aim for who you want to be.
Take a seat.
Where have you been?
I was just out looking at the stars.
You were stargazing...
every night this week.
How about the truth now.
I've been sneaking out.
Obviously.
Why?
To try things.
Such as?
Um...
I've been testing myself.
Getting stronger and faster.
"I know I shouldn't let people see me, and that's why I do it at night."
I
- I don't know what to say.
I expected that it would take you longer to get comfortable living here before we were ready.
We?
"I have big plans for you, Jessi."
And I need you to be as strong and as smart as you can possibly be.
How do we start?
"Well, first thing's first."
You need to get some sleep.
We'll talk about it further in the morning.
Okay.
LISTEN
WHO IS THIS
Amanda.
What happened?
- this is wonderful.
- Cilantro.
So what do we do?
Do we confront her?
"Oh God, no."
"Geez, I don't want to know if it's true."
What sort of attitude are we supposed to have?
Are we suppose to have an attitude?
I already have an attitude.
But it may be my mother's attitude.
I don't want to get hysterical about this.
Why shouldn't I be hysterical?
She's fifteen. I should be hysterical.
"Danlelle, lf you have on my sweats I'm going to kill you,"
Do you understand me?
- Can I taste whatever it is?
- Sure.
"- Cilantro, I love that."
- Very good.
I thought with the tomato it would sharpen it a bit-- l think it's great.
is that the fillo stuff?
Honey?
Who's Jordan?
No one.
- You mean Jordan Catalano?
- ls that his last name?
I don't know.
You brought it up.
I met Rayanne's mom tonight...
"and she was all excited about your new boyfriend, Jordan."
Boyfriend?
That's a laugh.
Shliemann!
Wake your men!
"Indy, the torches are burning out."
"Go on, get out of here."
Hyah!
Sallah!
Hello!
Hello!
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
"Slimy pig, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Marion!
Hang on.
Don't...
-Indy!
-Don't fall!
"Marion, I got you!"
I got you!
Hey...
And you just left?
Yup.
So it's over?
I don't know.
She says that every time and then she goes back to him.
Well maybe I'm just being paranoid?
It was time for the bi-monthly...
breakup post modern.
Who said what...
did I handle it well etc.
Can I ask you something JP?
What baby?
Come back to bed.
How many girls are you sleeping with?
Baby why you so drama?
So what?
So drama.
"I mean why would he hang out with me for six months, and text and call... everyday?"
Last night I was trying to make this really good point.
We just had sex JP.
It's good.
I just had your penis inside of me.
But that sounded...
a lot better in my head.
Ouch...
- Sorry.
Last week bird crap this week balls in her face.
Ah it's typical.
Is it true he has a monster schlong?
I don't know where she gets her information.
But that's absolutely true.
"Working on it, sir."
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[CHIEF SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
He says you're very kind.
Tell him if his people are afraid that we'll go out and get them.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[CHIEF SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
Captain MacDaniel will take a patrol out tomorrow morning and pick them up.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
He says he'll deal with you alone.
He'll come with you and you only.
"Tomorrow morning at sunrise, or never."
That's pretty positive.
Sunrise it is.
[MULDOON SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[CHIEF SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
KOWALSKI:
Here's another one.
Let's move out.
KIRBY:
Freeze!
You suppose that old chief is wearing more than one face?
I don't think so.
But we're sure going to respect your hunch.
We'll back off to the river again and make a detour.
DOC:
Cut him down.
NIM:
"Do you want to hear the story, sir?"
"I know the story, but go ahead."
Charlie came in the night to take the young men.
Don't you have anything to say?
Why you ask him?
"I'm asking you, he's not your dad."
I'm asking you.
Why look away?
Why do you bother?
He came between us when we'd problems.
Lisa...
"Lisa, aren't I good to you?"
"Exactly, aren't I good to you?"
"It has been 3 years, don't you like me?"
What're you saying?
You knew him before me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Then why go after her now?
That makes me the third party.
The air is great here.
"I can smell the grass and flowers,"
Nice smell...
Trying to sound poetic.
I like him this way.
What?
I can change if you like that.
How?
I've been observing him.
He expects nothing back for his money.
A direct and righteous man.
Bad-tempered but has a good heart.
The world needs people like him.
Don't change.
I've never heard anyone praise him.
Bad-tempered but a good heart.
"I was doing it in her sleep, but you woke her up."
I did wrap the blade in silk.
She's not hurting too much.
Come!
Do you want to finish the job?
Mary...
I love her.
And me.
- Do you love me?
"- Léo, yes!"
"Speaking of which, she told me again that I made love to her like nobody else."
Then she told me that it wasn't important.
"My father, my mother, you."
Love.
"The same feet, the same toes,"
the same footprints.
Footprints change with the sole of your shoes.
"The mud without marks, that's me."
You're cold.
You're warm.
You're hot.
You burn.
You kill.
Do you want to finish me?
Don't piss about!
"Take off your sneakers, so they think we aren't here."
I won't give her up to anybody.
No.
She belongs to me.
"If God made us, he would have made us different."
The rats have made off.
I'm offering you quiet on the Western front!
"When it comes to eating, you're always first."
Come on.
A little soppressata.
You even have to try the mussels 'mpepata.
Atrumpet!
We've mixed you up.
Know what they say when someone's really mixed up?
That he mistook one thing for another.
A dick for a spigot.
"It's not hard to talk like us, just take off the Iast vowel."
"For exampIe, banana becomes ""bana-n""."
"- Sofa becomes ""so-f""."
- Then it's easy.
"plate becomes ""pIa-t"", this would be ""for-k"","
"""kni-f""."
"- male, ""ma-I""."
- You wiped us out!
But these letters don't get lost.
- We neverthrow anything out.
- We recycle.
A simple vowel becomes a word.
"An ""E"" becomes affirmative."
"An ""O"" is a warning."
A guy says...
"An ""I"" means go away."
"And a ""U""?"
"The ""U"" and ""A"" are together, it's amazement."
Like when you see a beautiful woman.
You strike it lucky?
Orthe new director shows up from milan unexpectedly...
- Try ordering a dish.
"- Between us sure, but..."
You're home early.
Evan was my rebound guy.
But of course.
I feel in love again because he seemed so perfect.
But... he was perfect for Steven and Smiley Pete as well.
No no no no...
And Phil was my rebound of the rebound.
Bad!
You bad baby!
Uh...
That's when I decided to move to Los Angeles.
"What better city to replace perfect boyfriends, long term commitment... and heartache, with short term happiness and superficiality..."
At least it seemed like a good idea at the time.
"Well, fast forward a few years."
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Dale.
That's me a few years later.
Sucking face with my kinda sorta boyfriend JP.
He's a fashion photographer.
Remember that cover of Charlize in the green evening gown?
JP took that.
God I'm already name dropping...
That's so lame.
"Baby, give me your foot."
My foot?
You ever had your toe suck before?
"No, J. P..."
I...
Ok...
Delicious...
"What, no good experience?"
Bye baby.
I was flattered to hear we looked alike.
But do we?
So I thought about it.
And I think I know why he said that.
"Can't really explain in words, but somehow we are a bit alike."
"The way we talk, for example."
Really?
You're nicer than I thought.
Thanks.
So why did you ask to meet?
Don't you have a real reason?
No.
"You're just so pretty, and very close with Director Kim."
So I just wanted to know more about you.
What do you fear most in your life?
Obsession.
Obsession?
I'm afraid of betrayal.
Did your husband betray you?
Is that why you're getting a divorce?
"Director Kim told you that, too?"
Yeah.
"Yes, my husband betrayed me."
That's nothing to cry about.
Just divorce him.
And live right when you can forget him.
And what about you?
Why do you cling on to him?
I did?
Two nights ago.
Don't lie to me.
"Oh, I get it."
"You just got out of juvee, and now you're talking about... going out there trying to start some more shit ?"
- [ Laughs ]
- That shit ain't funny.
"You act like you don't know who you are anymore, Derek."
And what's up out there for anybody who ain't you ?
"I'm still from this neighborhood, but you ?"
I guess that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
- Or gives you some.
"- Shut up, Lip."
Sorry.
I know what's out there.
"Ain't like you can't get past it, but you're too busy getting in your own way to see that."
"I had some help getting in my own way, didn't I ?"
[ Chattering ]
[Cheering]
"Hey, wassup ?"
What the hell was that ?
I was trying to block the ball.
Stupid bitch !
[Girls Yelling]
"Good going, Sara !"
Get off !
That's it !
"Nikki, back off !"
[ Chattering ]
"Oh, yeah !"
"Oh, yeah !"
"- Yeah, yeah !"
- l like that !
- [ indistinct Yelling ] - [Gunshots]
- [ indistinct Yelling ]
- What is this shit ?
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
one after another.
right?
I would not say it's something.
Bills-sama is a God.
There needs to be a God to build
And a God who destroys to maintain balance is it not?
he is someone who can destroy anything in the universe.
You can not do anything against him.
That seems to be exciting!
Goku!
do not try anything stupid.
You heard right?
Understood?
Yes I understood!
I will do nothing unless he does something bad!
What happened suddenly?
Heaven...
What happened?
Bills-sama...
So that's the God of Destruction...
Hello I am Goku!
Kaio-sama was very nervous.
Well that guy is strong?
with a monstrous Ki.
Kaio-sama!
I want to see how I can fight him!
In the next episode of Super Dragon Ball:
Decisive Battle on Planet Kaio-sama!
Bills.
This is the incredible power of Super Saiyan 3! {\blur1.5}I see little kids hurrying off
{\blur1.5}Colourful backpacks on their backs
{\blur1.5}If I was a kid like them... {\blur1.5}What colour would I choose?
Beautifully put.
"So, given your dad's age, I'm guessing your condition isn't a new thing?"
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.
"Right, sorry."
"So, is somebody else looking after you?"
Just Dad.
He's not doing a top job.
- Great.
- Oh.
"Nina, no."
We are not getting involved.
We can't let a teenage vampire
- loose on the street.
- Er...
I'm 46.
"- There you go, he's 46..."
Really?
"Not emotionally, he isn't."
"Like he said, he's still effectively being breast-fed."
"Well, if you're offering."
"Oh, can you not ask my girlfriend to suckle you, please?"
"Look, you're just gonna have to pull a sickie and take him back to the house."
- Why?
"- Look, this is Mitchell's territory."
He'll know what to do.
This is not our problem.
But it's only till his dad recovers and then we can leave them both to it.
All right?
- Oh!
"- Right, you're going home with George."
"- What, to your kennel?"
Keep your paperwork clean.
"Jade, uh ..."
- There was one thing I want to talk to you.
- Tell me.
I do not want to do this anymore.
- What does that mean?
- I want out.
- What will you do for me does not work?
- I do not know.
I work in construction or something perhaps?
- Was funny.
"- Yes, people could not figure out exactly."
Now ...
So what about your little sister?
What about him?
Well ...
He can not look the same again now.
You know what?
"May look nice, but the right way to go Mike how much money you will earn?"
"Saatliği 15, 20 dollars?"
"Do not forget where you come from, Mike."
I'm very easy for your life.
But much more zorlaştırabilirim.
Become a smart boy.
Destroying a beautiful thing.
"Jump in, little sister, get new clothes."
And Mike ...
I have you with us and says otherwise.
I take good care of his nose.
"Angel, finished all the homework and dinner seven."
A very good girl.
"See you tomorrow, Mike."
"And, uh, jake's... (chris) all right, guys, first contestant is walking out,"
So the challenge has begun.
Please remain facing forward.
"Your first question is, ""who are you the least attracted to?"""
(gia) I need this rose really badly
Because I don't have a group that I belong to.
"I'm kind of, like, solo,"
So this rose is really important for me
To keep myself safe and to keep jake safe.
"That is a direct hit, and a point for you, contestant."
(bell dings)
Here comes the next contestant.
Who are you least attracted to?
That one did not miss.
(bell dings) on william.
Who are you least attracted to?
And now...
I'm here to kill Choi Eung-chan.
I am... the City Hunter.
Da-hye's own cafe latte.
It's so pretty.
You're now a real barista.
Right?
Nana.
Was it hard burying your father?
Your dark circles are hanging low.
Are they?
Cover them up.
"Hello, all."
Da-hye.
Nana.
Hello.
All checked?
We've interviewed eight.
We're on to the other two.
We've searched from Cape Wrath to Carlisle.
He hasn't got a roof over his head.
You're on Storm Island.
- Storm Island?
- Now you know how it got its name.
You were swept into the bay.
Everything always is.
"Please, don't get up."
- I've frightened your little girl.
- He's a boy.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I must cut his hair.
Was anyone else on board with you?
"David, we really must put the poor man to bed."
"No, I was alone."
Didn't you bother to get a weather report before you left?
No.
- Did you notify the coastguard?
"- David, what does it matter?"
"Because if he did, there may be men out there risking their lives looking for him."
- And we can let them know that he's safe.
- No.
I...
I...
I did not notify the coastguard.
I'll just turn the bed down.
- I've never seen anybody so exhausted.
"- But, Mummy..."
They love him.
"Sorry, I have to go into the garden."
"We don't have anything important to discuss, do we?"
Why don't you come back tonight at 8.
They'll be asleep then.
Don't I get to wear a hat?
You look way too healthy for a 60 year old.
I bet you still exercise.
-Yes.
I think you're afraid of getting old.
-That's nonsense.
You still live in the past.
"-Not at all, I look ahead."
To tomorrow.
-Tomorrow doesn't exist.
"For you, tomorrow is a repetition of yesterday."
That's nonsense.
I take my responsibility.
Because I've not forgotten everything that's happened.
I'm prepared for what's coming.
What's that?
The next war?
It will always be different from the previous one.
Useless.
"We're simply getting old, you and I."
But I accept it and you don't.
The war was your heyday.
And you want that back.
I'm out.
Then I'll do it alone.
Your son?
-Yes.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. Lemelle, allow me to introduce Miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
- It was the noise.
- It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
- Poor thing.
- Perhaps.
"But I cannot sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
- No.
"- Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
- Thank you.
- Safe and sound.
Do not wonder the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
- Yes.
"- Good night, Miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me!
- Hurt?
"No, no."
I need you to help me.
I need to escape.
There's no leaving.
They will find me.
"The wolves, they will find me."
- Let me try to find Dr. Cairn for you.
- I have failed him!
It was beautiful.
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge.
we'd rob the airport.
it was better than Citibank.
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy andme.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
Fat Andy.
Frankie the Wop andFreddyNo Nose.
who was Sally Balls' brother.
Then you had Nickey Eyes andMikeyFranzese.
nicknamed because he said everything twice.
get the papers.
not coats.
Suits are up on Thursday.
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?
You don't want furs?
I'll take them away.
I want them.
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.
to live any other way was nuts.
those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks were dead.
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
we just took it.
they got hit so bad they never complained again.
It was all just routine.
Of course I've thought about it.
It's all I think about!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Or have you just thought about yourself?
Do you think that this is good for him?
That kid is gonna hate us if he has to grow up listening to us fight all day long.
"So that's it, then."
What about me?
- Am I just so easy to walk away from?
"- Lisa, I love you."
Don't you fucking say that to me!
"You have no idea what love is, Chris!"
Lisa.
Listen.
We have a problem and we have to face it.
"Oh, you're right, Chris."
You are absolutely right.
"Get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!"
You know what?
"If you want to go, go."
I release you.
Go be free.
"But don't you ever expect to see me or your child ever again, ever!"
"Lisa, stop it."
"Jesus, stop it."
Just go.
Please.
Go.
- You're staying at a motel?
"- No, it's a hotel."
And it's really very nice.
We will film our return journey for people.
And that's that.
What do we do at Atomium?
Mr. Lloyd?
"Come on, let's go."
"To tell the truth, I did not expect the king to endorse my plan."
But we had to leave Turkey and return to the EU.
"Here we are, with a woman dressed as a king who reflected on the concept of freedom."
"Please, do you have to do it right now?"
"Yeah I have to, I'm itchy."
It's unbearable.
I'm almost done.
But what is it?
Maybe it's the shock of the news.
The secession of Wallonia.
Think about how it feels.
Do you know that we have many French words in Bulgarian?
Really?
"- Yes, how..."
Lift.
Bidet.
"I want to show her Mascia, Ivana and Pavlina."
My three daughters.
Three daddy.
"- Stay silent, Ana."
Do you have children?
No.
All right.
"He still has time, he's a man."
Made in Istanbul.
It's better than the Bulgarian ones.
I keep it.
"Your satellite is on, by the way."
That screen is badass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologise.
Is this gonna be every weekend now?
No.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
"But I am earning double time, so there's a bright side."
So when the laziest boy in the world wakes up tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said bye.
And tell him to let them air-dry this time.
I don't want him banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
I mean...
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
And everybody is gonna be there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
Maggie?
"Oh, no."
"I mean, yes."
"Yes, when you are designing a bridge, always remember,"
"""Make adjustments,"
"""go get it energized."""
"That's good advice for life, too."
"So, Professor Mosby, is this Maggie someone special?"
No.
I...
"She's just this girl I've been into for a really long time, and, well, tonight could be the one chance I have to go out with her, so..."
- Is she a hottie?
"- Yes, Jamie."
She's very attractive.
And if we can just end class right now...
- Betty?
"- Maggie may finally be available, but what about you, Professor Mosby?"
Are you ready for a serious relationship?
Totally.
"I mean, I think so."
Maybe.
I don't know.
What do you guys think?
"- Oh, my gosh."
I totally forgot about this.
- What is it?
It's a homework assignment from when I was 15.
Write a letter to your 30-year-old self with a list of goals you hope to achieve.

But Alicia woke up.
Benigno should be told.
"Given his mental state, I think not."
He could do something crazy.
But Icant lie to him.
"I'm his only friend, he trusts me."
I'll do it.
It's not a dilemma for me.
I'll tell him that Alicia is still in a coma and the baby is dead.
But you must promise me that you'll say nothing.
What about bail?
"It'll be very difficult, and expensive."
But we can try.
Number eight.
You got wet.
- Three.
- Okay.
"Sorry to ask this right after we ate, but did you sleep with that girl, Sunhee?"
No.
Then why'd she stare me down?
Did you two talk?
That's none of your business.
Did you have sex?
Just tell me the truth.
Tell me.
I'm just curious.
I didn't.
I told you I saw everything.
She really just came in and left.
"Plus, she's married."
And I really do not see her as a woman at all.
I'm serious.
So stop talking this nonsense.
"- Ouch, it hurts."
- Why are you lying to me?
Why are you being like this?
I interviewed her because she resembled you.
"I was missing you so much, but you weren't here."
So I just interviewed anyone.
We don't look alike.
And you know how she looks at me?
She got this contempt in her eyes.
Why would she?
She means nothing to me.
She's just nice.
"Actually, I feel sorry for her."
"Go on, and what else?"
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
"Look, tell me."
"Burnt down, a man's worth $4.40."
- Excuse me?
- That's what you said.
- When?
- In the car.
"When all's said and done, you know, carbon and minerals."
A human being's worth less than five bucks.
I said that?
"Well, you know me, I talk a lot of shit."
"But if you say I said it, then I suppose I should believe you."
What about it?
We walk.
Both of us.
"Well, you might walk but her..."
That's impossible.
She knows too much.
She's got the codes.
She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.
It's gotta stop.
I'll get you a prescription for Ativan.
That will stop your conscience bothering you.
Yeah.
"Well, take a look at that."
It's a copy of the broadcasts.
The ones she stopped.
Number 14 might be of interest.
- We're closing forIunch.
- Want to come with us?
- Where do you go?
"Home, we all live nearby."
- When will you be back?
- At 3.
- Imagine that!
- But we stay open until 6.
- Coming?
"- No, thank you, I'm not hungry."
I'II stay here and work.
Enjoy yourIunch.
The time will pass quickly.
It's just two years.
"- CostabiIe, is this yours?"
"- No, Mr. Director."
- would you Iike a coffee?
- Excuse me?
- What is it?
- I have to get by.
You're here to listen to the critical issues I've noticed and want to talk about with you.
Where's VoIpe?
You'II refer.
There are two urgent points:
safety and working hours.
I'd Iike a steel door and cameras inside and out.
"Start time: 8 am, lunch break from 1 pm to 2, work ends at 5 pm."
I wish to remind you that this is italy too.
Objections?
I told you he'd make us sweat blood.
Where's Mattia?
Maybe you don't understand how it works.
An investment to be clear.
Not a fucking handout!
That said...
I did remind him... of the night we shared together.
"And how it would be a tad embarrassing if, uh... well, if anyone found out about it."
"Which is technically blackmail, I suppose, but whatever."
I filmed it.
You see?
Suck it.
I think we can all agree.
That the truth hurts.
Here.
This will help with the pain.
"Thanks for the party, guys."
She's dead.
"Get lost, you bloody queer!"
Oops.
We're done here.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year's out and in the end we're all still breathing.
Gin - fucking gin!
Gin - fucking gin!
Yeah.
"We'll be celebrating later, aren't you?"
"Uh, Jesus Christ!"
"Oh, we're going to be right at the end of that--"
Get off me.
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower you were to be in heaven!"
- It's the old lad.
"- Oh, bad to be on that!"
"- You have to go, Carlos."
"You can ruin your life with your muñequita, but you're not gonna ruin my bodega!"
"- You have to go, take the keys."
So I worked on a new color for this guy.
That's a great color.
I've got to show you something.
"I just finished these panels,"
I wanted to know what you thought.
"Jenny, go work on this."
"We'll talk about this, okay?"
You all right?
How you've been?
"Hey, Carlos?"
How have you been?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
"All right, what do you got here?"
"So, what do you think?"
It's good!
Good.
Good.
- I based that one on the old man.
- How is he?
He's fine.
Listen... can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
"Who, Raquel?"
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're ready?
"'Cause you only get one chance with her, you know that."
These are good.
Raquel:...which I assume is how you got the idea for this.
Get Inspector Robin to protect me tomorrow.
Yes Sir!
"Darling, go buy me an ice-cream!"
I want you to apologize to this lady.
"None of your business, I like it when he hits me!"
I still want you to apologize to this bitch.
I know you'd be checking the view here.
I've got a great scheme for us.
Hang on. I want his apology.
"Just say 'sorry', out of pity for him."
I never have to say sorry!
That's true!
"Come on, let's go...!"
No way.
He has to apologize!
He's lnspector Robin!
Inspector Robin.
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
Don't bother with me.
Apologize to the bitch.
Sure thing.
"Sorry, bitch!"
I beg your pardon?
Let's go!
Who the hell's lnspector Robin?
Great...
Shame on you...
What do you want from me?
"This scheme will benefit the human race, lt will benefit the entire world."
But how will it benefit me?
"You can be the greatest unknown hero,"
But how will it benefit me?
Thank you...
for your help.
Your dinner is getting cold.
"I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests."
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
"Oh, Amanda."
"Hey, hon?"
Where the hell are they?
"This could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down."
Meet her at the door.
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.
Offer her a seat.
Yes.
Care to demonstrate?
Would you like a seat?
No.
"No, no."
You have to pull the chair out for her.
Oh.
And then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
Not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
Right.
Not too fast.
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.
Does it look okay?
?
I love this.
"The lights, the table, everything."
And the window in my room.
How'd you even get the idea for that?
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"- Don't buy all the hot dogs, OK?"
- I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch,"
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."
"No, no, no, he's OK!"
- I need you to talk for two minutes.
- About what?
- Anything.
- All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm hereto inspect your chicken nuggets."
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'!
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live!
"Let me hear you say, ""We love you, Tracy!"""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
- Are you drunk?
And you were right.
The strudel was excellent.
"Damn, we should have grabbed a couple of those crescents to go."
Oh well.
"Jacob, what happened to me after my father died?"
"Honestly, I don't know."
You hated me.
You left Berlin and I left the business.
And we never spoke again?
"Oh, I'd phone, you wouldn't take my calls."
I have no idea where you went or what you did.
"Started a new life, thought I could leave the past behind."
"So much for that, huh?"
"We don't just ring the doorbell, right?"
"Look, why don't you, uh, stay here."
I'm gonna go look around.
(speaking German)
Marta.
Don't move.
Hi.
Hi.
How did you?
Dog seems to know you.
Maybe.
Do I live here?
It doesn't look familiar.
"Huh, no labels."
"Well, someone's got expensive taste."
"Men's clothing, no women's."
I must not live here.
Gotta be something to identify whoever does.
You definitely know whoever lives here.
Hey!
Sam.
What's going on?
Divorce papers?
"Wait, Josh is asking for a divorce?"
"Not just a divorce, Erica."
He wants to wipe me out.
"Claire and Josh, separated at birth."
"He wants you to pay him $80,000?"
Yup.
Yup.
"Because, according to him, he ""put me through med school."""
That's ridiculous.
He didn't.
"You know, all of the signs were there, even from the beginning."
I--I just didn't even wanna see them.
Like what?
Like...
We just never talked--
"Never about anything important, never about how I felt."
"So, of course, after a while we become like strangers..."
It was like he had this made-up idea in his mind of who I was... and now here we are.
"You know what's really, really pathetic?"
"I just wanna run away from this whole thing,"
"So I go to Goblins like some desperate loser, looking for Kai."
Kai.
Really?
"And, uh, how was that?"
He wasn't there.
"He quit, actually."
What?
!
And I tell you what would cure them.
"Agood, old-fashioned trip to my ohio father's woodshed."
"- Right, Julie?"
"- Right, Dad."
That's what these bums need.
"Well, Kurt, thanks and congratulations."
"- Thank you, sir."
- Yeah.
Okay.
"Thanks, everybody."
Bye.

"Now, stop this pussyfooting around."
"I mean, dead kids."
Howthe hell did we give the Democrats a weapon like this?

I've got to find a good accountant.
Hey!

I can buy 20 good accountants!
I hit the jackpot!
Captain just won the lottery!
Hey.
"Next time you call me Captain, it's because you're on my boat!"
Yes!
"Oh, my goodness!"
I'm a rich man.
Everybody leaves.
- Look at this.
Natalie.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry."
I didn't know where else to go.
What happened?
Are you okay?
You haven't heard?
What?
What time is it?
5:00.
One minute after.
Turn on the news.
What...
What channel?
Any channel.
A major scandal involving the Gold Rush lottery.
"As we told you this morning, there were two winners in last night's jackpot giveaway."
"Eugene Maddox, a truck driver from Rockaway Township and Leland Stottlemeyer, a highly decorated officer with the San Francisco police."
"Now, according to the rules, these two men would split the $212 million grand prize."
"Mr. Maddox, what do you do for a living?"
but I was part of something.
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school?
My father was always pissed off.
he was pissed that my kid brother Michael wasinawheelchair.
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me what's this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.
He knew what went on there.
I didn't care.
The way I saw it everybodytakesabeatingsometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What?
You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me.
Look.
Come with me.
Is that him there?
No.
How about him?
No.
That's the guy Get him.
"Nothing can be done now, Kaabir."
I belong to him.
But Saiba belongs to me.
Maybe in another life.
Maybe this was destiny.
Father has asked me to get Jilaan's head.
Then take mine along as well.
My heart shall always beat with Saiba's name.
Have you ever heard your name in that Muraaki's heart?
"Muraakis only have courage, they don't have a heart."
Jilaan is a Muraaki.
He has as many wives as the wars he has won.
He must have done this hundreds of times.
He must be having hundred more Saibas.
- I have only one.
- Jilaan loves only me.
Is Saiba happy?
Then I shall learn to live.
Only Paathar will feel lonely.
"Don't forget me, Saiba."
[PRAYER]
Jilaan-Saiba.
Celestial lovers.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
I am no ordinary thing.
Then what are you?
"I am something you should forever and forever, keep with you."
Isn't one forever enough?
No.
For you it will be another victory tomorrow.
You are my victory.
"Sir, it's a powderforfireworks."
My nerves come from coffee.
How much do you drink?
"WhereverI deIivermaiI, they offer me some, by evening I'm a wreck."
"If it's just coffee, that's easy."
Everything can be fixed.
Except thatjerk's motorbike.
- Want to shoot some fireworks?
- Can I?
"No, that's dangerous, these here, at most."
"This is called crackling Fuse, the otheris called a sparkler, hold it like this..."
I'II come with you.
We can't ride double.
You have to Iearn to say no.
- But I'II drive.
- Do you know how?
I'm the Director!
How do you start it up?
Mr. Matarazzo.
hello.
- I'm the new director.
- It's kind of you to come.
- Let me offeryou coffee.
"- No thank you, we have to go."
I open my home and you refuse my coffee?
"Thank you, we don't drink coffee."
Some fruitjuice then.
This fruitjuice will give you new life.
Are you sure we can drink it?
- It's not coffee.
- You're sure?
Fruitjuice.
"Listen, kalaya's mother, she was a prostitute."
Your sister?
Yeah.
She has a bunch of kids.
She try to get them out of Thailand.
She doesn't care how it happen.
So she sells them to drug dealers.
This isn't the first time something like this happen.
Can I see her?
Kalaya?
Kalaya?
Hey!
Kalaya?
Kalaya?
I need an ambulance.
Someone stole my palm pilot.
"Oh, well, welcome to the club."
Jake left his wallet in his suit coat.
300 bucks.
"Yeah, and one of the secretaries is missing her disc player."
"Can you excuse us for a second, Jake?"
You bet.
You gonna talk to Liz about this?
About what?
Jeremy.
Are you serious?
He was out there the whole time.
"Well, even if it's true, I'm not gonna call his mother and accuse her only child of stealing from us."
Agnes:
They found 4 small balloons of heroin in her stomach.
One of them leaked.
She gonna be ok?
- Did you bring back my photo?
"- Oh, no."
I'm not done with it yet.
I'm still in the brainstorming stage.
"Well, if you get stuck, you should enlist Michael."
He's got creativity just rolling off of him.
"Yeah, I always work alone."
I'm a solo artist.
Of course.
She's still brainstorming.
Yeah.
It's like this complicated process that-
"So, tell Ellen about the shoe guy."
Did you go back to the store?
Yeah.
And turns out he's a killer of children.
"So, oh, well."
What?
"Why does he say ""the tall one""?"
- Because he wants me to do it.
- He's crazy.
You'd leave teeth marks all over it.
You'd choke on it.
He could see that I have a sensuous mouth.
This is crazy.
Someone should call in the authorities.
"Obviously, I would do it better."
We need an impartial authority.
"Hey, Peter!"
Peter Swersey.
"We are going to giveyou a ""jimmy ha-ha."""
- Do you know what that is?
Ethel?
"Is that you, Ethel?"
I wondered what happened to you last night.
Can't talk.
Due in the lists in 10 minutes.
"I'm coming, Mother."
Watch where you're getting the blood!
Christ!
- How else can we choose a champion?
- We could call an election.
Election?
"Oh, no."
Nonsense.
It wouldn't be fair to the knights.
- They could draw lots.
- Draw lots?
Bless my soul.
"You might as well do it dip, dip, dip, my little ship or one potato, two potatoes."
Or even hide and seek.
"48, 49, 50!"
Coming!
"The cardinal said, ""I asked for 13 vergers."
"Why have you brought me 13 virgins?"""
"Now, we're in the garden and a thousand voices said as one man:"
"""Ave, ave, passed through this way."""
"Ave, ave, what?"
- Why do I need to say ave?
- Just sit back and let something nice happen to you for a change.
Looks like they've chosen a champion.
Can you see who it is?
It's my boss.
Christ.
"Oh, well, this is just great!"
That didn't go so well.
"I'm not pointing any fingers, but do you ever put that thing on vibrate?"
- Good morning.
"- Yeah, right."
"Dad, Dad, Dad."
Come on.
"We can either discuss this as adults, or you can act like a child."
"""...or you can act like a child."""
Which is it gonna be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Ike Cortez.
Manhattan Monthly.
- Alex Rose.
"Well, let's dive on in."
Feel free to ask me anything.
Great.
"Okay, first question."
You work for your dad.
Does that ever get awkward?
No.
Never.
Next question.
"If there's one guy Alex Rose could date right now, who would it be?"
Don't you have anything on there about hobbies or something?
I don't care if you're seeing him!
I just want to know what's going on.
Really?
You don't care if I'm seeing him?
"Well, of course I care, but I can't come barging in here yelling"
"""I have mixed feelings!"""
"Agent Gibbs, follow me to the hospital."
"DiNozzo, you put him in a car back to headquarters."
I'll meet you there.
"Gentlemen, welcome to the party."
It's BYOS:
Bring Your Own Shooter.
I brought mine--
"Tyler Elliott, my lead investigator."
"Gibbs, Vance, NCIS."
"Agent Gibbs, bravo."
"Big doubts about you going in, but you were way better than expected."
Meryl Streep better.
Ah.
Take that as a compliment.
"This one tells it like it is, to a fault."
Been there for the real thing.
"Are you confirming that all our marks were hit, Doctor?"
(door opens)
"On the money, Leon."
Break out the champagne.
Opening night was a success.
Well done.
McGEE:
"Hey, where you been, we've been calling?"
What's going on?
"Man day is over, and he is still ignoring us."
I am not going to be ignored.
"Glenn Close, Fatal Attraction."
"Good one, Ziva."
"Your impression of ""hot lady with crazy eyes"""
"is dead on, by the way."
"You are a, uh, sphinx of a minx."
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
I know he was planning on pulling an all-nighter so he's probably still in the sack.
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
"This only works when they're scared of you, remember?"
Jack-off.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
- Combo.
"- Yo, what's up?"
You seen Badger?
"Don't you cover for him, bitch."
"I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer."
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
Got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
"You'll have to be patient, I'm afraid."
We have the situation under control... but there might be some damage to the skull and brain.
"We have to do a CT-scan, but we can't do it here."
And we can't get a helicopter in weather like this.
Can't you drive her there?
It's too much of a risk.
Her condition is critical.
We might lose her then.
Lose her?
A coma.
"What's a coma, Dad?"
Go home and get some sleep.
There's nothing you can do here.
It was...
It was like a snake.
Shaped like a snake.
Pardon?
Has he been treated yet?
"No, I'm OK."
It's nothing.
Come on.
"Hello, sweetheart."
I just can't get you out of my mind.
I miss you.
Really.
Do you actually love me?
Then come over here right now.
"I'll undress you, you'll undress me..."
- Why don't you answer?
- Hello?
- It's me.
What are you doing?
That's for you.
"You, at least you don't kill."
My woman.
My cross.
My skin.
Anything else you want?
"Shoo, or do you want a bow on top too?"
"No, I'll go to her!"
"Don't sweat, she's here!"
It's done!
"Hold me against you, against him, against me."
"Stop me from running out, from drowning."
Plug me.
Whatever floats your boat...
Life is good.
Can you smell it?
Take a breath!
"They watered the street, to make us grow on the paving."
"Yes, I do love you."
We've got everything!
"Our weaknesses,"
"Ideas,"
History!
"But what's keeping us on our asses, waiting for the Cossacks to strike?"
The burden of Money?
The phantoms of Culture?
The Final Solution?
"If we don't turn to face the Cossacks, it might hurt a little, get me?"
In '44 we won the Battle of the Rails.
The Final Solution?
Stale bourgeoisie farts.
"We need to take the middle ground, the power of living people, the workers."
Using the artifacts-- but that someone--that someone is Macpherson.
And I can prove it.
Remember?
"Artie, we've both seen you like this before."
"No, no, no, no."
He planted this on purpose.
He wanted me to find it.
Otherwise he would've been much too careful.
He's taunting me.
Would you listen to yourself?
You are leaping to wild conclusions
Based on nothing.
"And meanwhile, your team is falling apart around you."
"Oh, they're not falling apart."
Myka and Pete are fine.
Are they?
Did you know the tsuba's now under Dickinson's control?
Did you know Bering and Lattimer had been detained?
They're at the hotel.
I'm taking you all off this case.
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wh--what if I'm right?
What if it is Macpherson?
"Go home, Artie."
"- Artie, where are you?"
- It doesn't matter.
New orders.
You two stay in the hotel and you wait for me.
I will take it from here.
What's the matter?
That's good then.
Excellent.
I'll stay for a few more weeks for the peace and quiet.
We'll take the next boat.
"If you'd been really ill, I wouldn't have told you anything."
This is why I'm here.
He's in Holland for a week.
"Good morning, Mr Haverman."
"Morning, sir."
Here you are.
Your morning portion.
The doctor says you'd better stay in bed.
"Yes, I understand, nurse."
Thank you.
"Later, after the visitor will have left."
Don't be too long.
You have to be fit for the cure.
Busybody.
That's what I'm ripping those assholes of the insurance company off for.
450 guilders a day.
-462.50.
What?
-I work in insurance.
"Oh, yes."
I know where he is.
And what he's doing this week.
It's Niels for sure.
I have to tell you something.
It's such an old case.
"Back then, you swore we'd liquidate him."
I'm not well.
It's been so long.
"If you feel hungry, you can take it out and eat."
That's a good idea!
Master.
Come on.
Good!
"Thank you, master."
"Come on, don't mention it."
"Shit, I've stuffed my ring too."
"Foon, can you get my ring back for me?"
"Sure, master."
"This is chicken leg, my ring is still inside."
Not this one?
"Oh, it's full!"
"Master, would you mind looking for it yourself?"
Alright.
He's taking my bag!
"As it's stipulated by court, although it's not his wish to be baptized, we still welcome him to join God's family."
Let him go.
Why a woman's baptismal time is so short...
But a man's baptismal time is so long?
Why did you fight?
Your nose bleeds!
I didn't beat him.
None of his business!
Look!
I hate blonde!
I think it's acceptable!
Damn you!
Put all the dominos back.
As well as my mahjong too.
"And the chair and table, all set!"
What?
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order
Sonny.
like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking
Don't be like that.
Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
too.
You're a funny guy.
Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried.
I'm hearing bad things.
Wait.
"Is that going in my file, too?"
"Now we're not going to recommend you leave the school,"
Because ms.
Rinsky would like to handle this directly.
"Dear, I blame myself."
"When you acted out,"
I should never have banned you.
"I mean, I'm an educator."
I believe in second chances.
"Therefore, you are now the opposite of banned."
You're gonna be the new room mommy.
"You'll be in charge of the phone tree,"
"And the school's pets are gonna be yours on vacations,"
And every Tuesday and Thursday...
Crossing guard.
"Oh, come on!"
And please...
Get help with your drinking.
Brick needs a mother.
Will do.
"Let's go, frankie."
"Oh, my god, aunt Edie."
I can't believe you just sprayed that guy right in the face.
That was nothing!
I've been teargassed in the face!
What?
!
Why?
"Oh, we were at a jazz club, and some of the white kids"
Wanted to dance with the black kids.
"Oh, my god."
I'm happy with you.
It's important for me to make his heart remember what his mind forgot.
But what matters the most to me is if he's safe.
Don't!
"Go ahead, Migs."
Take care.
It's already morning.
"Sorry, I got lost."
I even prepared food for you.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't understand what happened.
What?
You went to Bela?
.
Go ahead and explain your lies.
I'll make believe that nothing happened between the two of you.
I'd still listen!
Are we going to fight again?
.
"What, do you want me to be pleased?"
.
Don't I have the right to ask where you've been?
That Bela is really unbelievable.
"Because if I am the mistress, I would think of the wife waiting for you."
There.
Answer it!
And I want you to answer it in front of me.
Here!
Are you happy now?
.
Didn't you tell me that Bela is kind?
Maybe she's using her kindness to steal you from me.
- No.
No.
It ain't nothing.
- I just...
"- So that's your fine friend, is it?"
"The dirty, filthy brute!"
"If ever a man dared lay a hand to me like that, I'd..."
Well...
Aren't you going to introduce me to our charming visitor?
It's Marcia.
"This is my friend, Mr. Hyde."
"You've heard me speak about him, haven't you?"
"Oh, yes, Marcia."
I've heard a great deal about you.
I've never been interested.
Until now.
I've got to be toddling along now.
"- Toodle-loo, lvy."
"- Oh, no, no."
"Don't go now, Marcia."
"After all, this could be very interesting, the three of us in friendly discussion."
I can't keep my friend waiting.
"- I'll be dropping by, lvy."
"- Yes, yes, yes."
"Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia."
Your ideas differ from mine.
It would be a charming experience to change them.
Ivy found it that way.
"Didn't we, dear?"
Nice material.
Goodbye.
Very nice material.
I have aliens at home.
"So relax nicely, don't think about anything."
Life is beautiful.
You don't understand!
-I can't go any further.
-I know.
"-Life is beautiful, isn't it?"
-But I really have two aliens at home.
-A visit from another planet.
"-Well, great!"
"So you will rest at our place, and when you get out of here, you'll be as fit as a fiddle, won't you?"
-Doctor?
-Yes?
-We are full.
We are full.
So you won't rest at our place.
"But you'll go and rest in nature, and you'll be as fit as a squirell."
"Sister, write down."
Nature is the best doctor.
"Doctor, haven't you had enough of us yet?"
No?
-Don't you feel tired?
-Let me see.
You look bad.
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I'm only a bit overworked."
"Cursed, fucking job!"
Where are you screwing around?
!
"-What's the matter, boss?"
-Watch your language!
Fuck watching my language!
I guess you could say I've had a romance with the West... since I was old enough to read.
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.
"You know, I never learned how to ride."
Is that right?
Glendolene.
"It's a nice afternoon, John."
I enjoyed my lobster.
"And I know Mr. Horn did, too."
I'm glad you liked it.
"- Excellent afternoon, John."
- Joe.
Tom.
Giddap.
"The way I see this, you'll be a stock detective."
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch... and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.
$200 for every rustler that goes somewhere else... to ply his trade.
- Who do I report to?
- To me.
"And as far as you are concerned, you and Joe Belle never discussed this."
"And for that matter, neither have I."
Twenty-five.
Do I hear 25?
Would you bid 30?
Thank you.
Now a half.
Would you bid a half?
Would you bid 35?
40.
"Thank you, sir."
Now a half.
"Hey, boss!"
Come
Must you wear such a big head on that small head of yours?
My old friend!
Mouna?
Seediqs from Toda
"You from Tnbarah Clan, over here!"
"Hey, young man, don't you make trouble here"
The tallest one is Mouna Rudo of Mehebu Clan from Tgdaya
You've come all the way here with so little meat for exchange?
Those of you from Toda are so shameless
Why don't you offer your hunting grounds to us for free?
"Mouna Rudo, don't be too proud"
I'm not afraid of you
"Mouna Rudo, I'm Temu Walis"
I'll cut your head off when I grow up
Temu Walis?
You won't have the chance to grow up
Is that Temu Cire?
"No, it's Temu Walis"
I mean that grown-up man
I don't know.
"Not someone famous, I guess"
"Gather up, young men!"
Come on!
Bring your weapons!
Come with us!
Quick!
Put these away!
Quick!
All young men come with us!
Run!
- Hey!
You don't show the finger to the Boss.
Aren't you ashamed?
You thrashed Bajrang's men in Rajanwadi.
When someone's fit for a beating he's bound to get it.
But where's Bajrang?
He's been missing since you thrashed him.
No matter where the rat hides... you're going to blame me for it.
Boss.
You're acting too smart because Bajrang is still missing.
What will you do if you find him?
I will lock you up...
lock you up for assaulting him.
There's your man.
All the pain you took delivered him.
Now you beat him up along with me.
Now you'll be arrested too.
But... proof?
C!
C!
TV!
CCTV!
CC...
Inspector.
It's all about perspective.
Two strands of hair in a glass of milk seems gross... but on a bald head it seems too less.
From my perspective... the Boss did justice to the farmers.
Because...
The Boss is always right.
- Say it louder.
- Hail Goddess!
- Boss...
"No, I'm not coming, I'm going to the fields."
"Come on, get in..."
No. I'm going to the farm.
"- Come on, I'll bring you back."
- No.
Why haven't you got out?
"Go on, get out."
Take the wheel.
Give my colleagues the keys.
Don't forget.
"Will he make it, doctor?"
"Yes, he just needed oxygen."
A jab and a respirator will put him right.
We've sent him to town.
Oxygen will save him.
- Where are you going?
- Down there.
There's a sick woman.
Perhaps you could see her.
All right.
- Do you mind?
"- No, no problem."
It's a miracle he survived.
He was lucky.
The stone got stuck before it struck his head.
Then some stones gave way.
"He was trapped, as if he was in a tiny cell."
He needed oxygen.
"If he gets oxygen, he'll pull through all right."
He was covered in dirt.
"""lf my guardian angel is hhe one I know,"
"""he'll prohech glass from shone."""
- Where the hell is he?
I wish that I had a friend like you.
"You will, one ofthese days."
Drop your guns!
Your right hand still works?
Well enough.
It's still fast and accurate.
You've got no way out.
Why are you doing this?
"You tell me, what's the alternative?"
- Where's the money?
- Give it to me!
I'm one step ahead.
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?
Maybe I'm no longer a professional.
I wish I could start all over again.
It's a pity...
- Give me the cash.
- Where isJeffrey?
Give me the money first.
We owe it to him.
Hypocrite!
Do all killers have a sense of honor?
The world has changed.
Honor is now a dirty word.
"Sidney, sometimes I think you're not human."
You're more like a dog.
At least we have one thing in common:
We both use guns for a living.
But our motivations are different.
Right?
In some ways dogs are superior to men.
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes
I think to myself
What a wonderful
"Yes, dude!"
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
"I'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man."
You couldn't wait till I got out of the shower?
May I remind you that we both just ate 30 burgers... and four large orders of fries?
"Don't worry, in a little bit, I'm sure it'll hit you too."
It may be.
But I'm gonna wait till you get out of the shower.
"Well, don't wait too long."
We've got to leave for the airport in an hour.
"Ooh, that burns."
- An hour?
"- Hey, and, Roldy?"
Yeah?
Nice pubes.
Ooh wee
Ooh wee
When I step into the party all the ladies wanna know
My sister preferred to studyNDominion Over Living Things.
(SlZZLlNG ) how does she seem to you?
Perfectly horrid.
-And her head?
N-Bulbous. something pressing on her brain.
Ntwo teaspoons of wishful thinking.
You can't imagine the thingsNthat go on in that place.
I can. the people will rise against her.
(spitting )
That should do it.
Blow.
thank you.
There's someone hereNwho would like to speak with you.
-Absolem?
N-Who are you?
(coughing ) but not that one.
-How do you know?
N-You said so yourself. but you're much more her now.
you're almost Alice.
l couldn't slay the JabberwockyNif my life depended on it.
It will.
So I suggestNyou keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
You seem so real.
Sometimes I forgetNthat this is all a dream.
(coughing )
Will you stop doing that?
(laughing )
(WHOOSHlNG ) I've always admired that hat.
Chess. would you considerNbequeathing it to me?
How dare you?
you know.
It is a pity about all this.
I'm sorry.
I wish I'd come to see you sooner.
Big Brother!
Did you come to see me?
You'd better hurry or you'll miss your plane.
No.
I've decided not to go.
But what about your work?
"Shinjiro, you go and see how Grandma is doing."
Is something the matter with Grandma?
There's something strange!
Grandma is sleeping.
Snoring up a storm!
How is she?
"She ate some rice porridge, but she's asleep again."
"Shall we go to bed, too?"
It looks like we're going to have some rain.
Shall we close the sliding doors?
Grandma!
The bomb!
"What's the matter, Grandma?"
Grandma!
What's going on?
It's the bomb!
"You two, quick!"
Put this over you.
This is best for the bomb!
There're many who survived because they were wearing something white!
"The sooner, the better."
Let's take her to the hospital right away!
She's sound asleep now.
Maybe we should leave her as she is a little longer.
Ellis?
You look so pale in corduroy.
Your friends are they?
I got a letter...from the Commission document bombed down in the provinces.
"An exhibition in London, straight after."
And that's for gallery.
Ellis!
Would there be Sunday trains do you think?
"Only that I need to get back to London, Monday mornings."
What are you talking about?
Coming to see you.
"You will be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course!"
After the script is finished.
Umm..get out of that actually.
I don't want to get out of it.
I don't want to let them down.
No. of course not.
"Now, I leave on Monday."
"Umm, I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not very far off.
No.
It's not so very far off.
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
"I ordered cutlets, Millenezi."
And Cimbalino pudding.
So...so you are Mr.Ambrose Hilliard?
Ye..yes.
I...
I'm Sophie Smith.
She didn't even bother packing her bags!
How she was fed up with my poor cop father!
And he with her.
It killed her.
She wallowed with those pigs.
"In their dough, their drugs, their shit!"
"Mommy, mommy, my mommy!"
I followed.
"They fed me, they dressed me, they beat me, but they never sullied me."
"I'm like her, I'm like her,"
"I'm like her, like her..."
like her...
I'm like her...
"Mommy, mommy... mommy!"
My mommy...
Now that I am King... and that the Queen is Queen...
"""Impossible"" is a French word."
I'll never marry you.
Leave the ending to me.
I need this money!
I need this money...
It's too swell.
Expatriation!
What is that?
"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, the big surprise!"
Your mother's corset exploded.
"Ambulance, firemen, four nurses, two obstetricians."
"Nine and a half pounds on arrival, incognito for seven months!"
A triumph!
It's all your doing...
Madam's my age.
"""From each according to his faculties;"
Nita Caglar?
This is the name she spoke.
A Kurdish girl.
Okay.
She works a little for me.
"Without a permit visa, but that shit, I'm helping people."
How old is she?
15.
"A friend of his daughter, perhaps?"
Zana lives in Sweden with his mother.
What does this have to do with it?
When was the last time you saw her?
Six months ago.
Where is she?
She ran away from home.
Reported her as missing.
Why did she do it?
How should I know?
She contacted?
-I Would say is yes.
"If I do not get hysterical, does not mean I do not care."
Perhaps you do not have children.
Then I'll tell you something.
They are like a part of you.
But you can not make them be better.
"So if there is something more, take me to the police station."
One more thing.
I never liked cops.
No one died?
That's great!
Have you managed to track down the girl?
Let's wait for the experts.
I do not hit on your mom.
You always kiss her on the cheek and try to make her like you.
"You're like, ""Oh, that dress is just perfect for the season!"""
Why does your voice always get higher when you do an impression of me?
That's her.
My heart is racing.
I need that stress ball.
You can do this.
Stay calm.
Don't let her get to you.
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Do it for me.
"Okay, I can see I lost you."
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Okay.
Relax.
There's no way she can make an entire family Thanksgiving about herself.
"Oh, God."
She upped her game.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"I'll just take this heavy bag upstairs, then."
- All by myself.
"- Okay, great."
Be careful of that clicky elbow.
What happened to your mom?
Absolutely nothing.
She is looking for attention.
You didn't ask?
She could be really hurt.
"Oh, please."
That thing isn't even bolted into her head.
- I should go help her.
One minute and 11 seconds.
Oh.
"Oh, this is a wonder spot, Jeeves."
I bet this reeks with romance.
"- I hope not, sir."
- Yes.
"Anyway, it's a nice place for rest and quiet."
"I consider it the most peaceful spot in the whole of England, sir."
"Good egg, Jeeves, good egg."
I—
I wonder what's happened to our passenger.
That Ethiopian fellow seems to have evaporated.
"You'll probably find him down the road, sir, draped on a bush."
Do something about it because it worries me exceedingly.
I'll go and have lunch.
"Yes, sir."
Hello!
Hello!
"Yes, sir, Massa Gabriel, I's coming."
- Us plays the horn too.
"- Well, come on."
"Come, come."
We're there.
- Where?
- Here!
- Ain't I in pieces?
- You're as right as right can be.
Will y'all give me your word I ain't dead?
"Come on, come on."
Get out of the car and buzz off.
Is us in Leeds?
Leeds is many miles from here.
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
"Well, what we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there."
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.
"In other words, normal."
You keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Well, of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
"I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean."
Um....
"No, I, uh--"
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I don't know.
I was gonna take....
I was gonna take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Hello?
Sharon?
Shit.
God.
Sharon!
"What do you mean, leaving Regan by herself?"
Her window's wide open.
Yeah.
It's good woodwork.
- That's this place.
- Full marks for observation.
Mm-hmm!
Yep!
"Alright, there we go."
Ah!
"- Oh, shit."
- What's up?
I just forgot I don't have my phone.
"I keep going for it, I forget it's not in my pocket."
"And there's, uh... no TV here, so..."
Welcome to the 19th century.
"No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi."
Yeah.
No wonder people were seeing shit.
Probably were just bored out of their gourds.
"Well, that's the leading theory about ghost sightings."
The mind plays tricks when less stimulated.
"Fewer distractions, people saw more ghosts."
Isn't that a nice piece of info?
"Well, they got literature, though."
"That's pretty sweet, right?"
"Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual last time that I read a book."
To think people used to do this on purpose.
I know.
Crazy.
Why?
"- You know, I don't think I've..."
"- Shh, alright?"
I need to get into some old-school shit here.
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.
8-1 -7.
6-9-0-1 -0.
Sorry.
Little last-minute broadcast come through.
I'll inform the authorities.
You do that.
- Wanna hear my latest theory?
- Sure.
We're coordinating troop movements in Afghanistan.
- Long-term tactical formations.
- Yeah.
"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."
Could be.
"- It's good, right?"
- Yeah.
Maybe it's all just some sort of awful experiment.
"Stuff two people in a box, see how long it takes for one of us to kill the other."
- That's nice.
- Give me something.
We're up two hours early next shift.
- You guys been waiting long?
"- No, you're good."
- Good shift?
- Yeah.
Got to catch up on sitting alone for 70 hours.
What the hell?
Stay where you are!
"Wait, we're trapped in the house."
Stay where you are.
The pair of dead bodies inside.
"Our friends, okay."
Blair.
"I'm sorry, she does that when she's scared."
Everybody down on the ground now!
Do it.
"Officer, you're not listening to me."
"This man is a murderer, okay."
He killed both of our friends.
That's a lie.
"Just do what I say, and we'll sort this out."
Sheriff.
"I couldn't say anything before, but, they've been holding me hostage, and they're robbing' my house."
That's a fuckin' lie.
Don't believe him.
Everybody shut up!
You will talk only when I say so.
Is that clear?
"Officer, you gotta listen to me."
Shut up.
"Take these, cuff yourselves to that post right over there."
What about him?
He said shut up.
You shut up.
"No, you shut up."
Everybody shut up!
"Let me take care of him, all right?"
Just do what I say.
"- Remember, bust them, you buy them."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Hey, you know what you're doing?"
- We're running out of fuel.
- You're lying.
"The aircraft was topped off to tour Honolulu, not island hop."
"Take a look, you see that?"
That's ten minutes max.
- It's 15 to Molokai.
"- Look, just find a way, all right?"
"Spoke to Honolulu approach, your bird is 6 miles east-southeast heading towards Molokai."
"Okay, copy that."
"Chin, over there."
They should be in that direction.
Got them.
About three miles east.
Don't lose them.
I'm coming around.
- What's going on?
- What do you think is going on?
"All right, here we go."
"Everyone, hang on."
This is gonna get ugly.
- They just went down.
- Yeah.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Got a single gunshot wound.
He's dead.
Family's gone.
He took them hostage.
"Look, just let my wife and my son go, I'll do..."
"None of you are going anywhere till I get off this island, all right?"
Get a room!
I know you and I are history.
I just hope that we can reconnect on some level.
Maybe even be friends.
Yes!

Sorry?
There's a what?
"""without the classic distraction maneuver"
"""known as the 'bait and switch.'"
"""The key is picking the appropriate unsuspecting target."""
So we're really gonna do this?
"I mean, I want to find her, man."
"I really do, but... this guy and his family?"
- That'll make us just as bad as...
- Ava.
"You know, one of those books said you can't cheat an honest man."
"Yeah, I read that."
I still don't get it.
"- Hey, thank you."
- You're welcome.
"It's like there are people who set themselves up to be taken because they're, you know, greedy or selfish or mean."
You know what?
We need some ground rules.
"Lately, he's taken in two disciples and taught them kung-fu"
"They're not bad, I hear!"
Okay-find a way to get him here!

Can we do it?
Yes-with this!
"How'd you like to help me do some good, serve up a little karmic justice?"
–Joe...
"–Hey, 20 bucks says we bust him on a felony before nightfall."
These assholes could win a lottery and still not keep their noses clean.
See that little prick?
"He got one over on me, man."
–You know that ain't right.
"–Yes, I know it's not right."
–Then here we go.
–Lookee here!
–Jesus Christ.

–Who's the nigga now?
–Hey!
Step back!
Yeah.
Here.
Go get yourself some new gear on me.
"Go back to your party, burn out whatever brain cells you got left."
"Come on, bitch."
Hit me!
I could use another couple million.
–Put the camera down.
–Come on.
Show's just startin'.
"Hey, let go of him!"
Let go!
–Back off!
–That's all right.
I'll just buy me a new one.
"Hey, what's this?"
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.
Are you off-duty?
"I had laryngitis, remember?"
I was sick this whole time.
You didn't sound like you during this.
- During this stuff?
"- Yeah, during all this stuff."
"Aaron Yoo was really driving that van, by the way."
Confidently.
- It doesn't sound like I have laryngitis.
- I don't think you sound that different.
"It's because Self, our PA from heaven, used to bring me hot beverages."
- We miss you.
- I love Self.

"Hey, I bet that wasn't looped."
I was with Jonny...
I was with Jonny during that moment.
ADR.
Whatever.
"I'm not trying to show off, I'm just saying."
You know what though?
This is bad because I'm loving watching this and not saying anything interesting.
Don't look at it.
"- Yeah, look away."
- I can't look away.
"Hey, I think I should..."
- This was freezing.
- This is from cold.
- This awkward...
Redemption costs.
"And on my watch, you fucking pay up front."
Everything you know about Latif.
Or I put a fucking bullet in your head right now.
Latif has a spy at the top of British intelligence.
"Neutralize him, and you'll stop the atrocity Latif has planned."
He can't finalize the arrangements without him.
Who is he?
I need a name.
When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe, as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
You fucking prick.
"Shoot, then."
(DISTORTED EXPLOSION)
Fuck.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hello, Maggie."
I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
(DEVICE BEEPS OFF)
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
These children are dangerous to us.
also to their own selves.
We can't cure it.
"Therefore,"
"I have to tell you... that we've decided for their sake, to lock them up indefinitely."
Benigno!
David!
Stand up.
Where's Anais?
Let's go!
Anais didn't make it.
But we save a child.
Your child.
Don't move!
Make them wear it.
Tell them to wear the safety clothes.
I can't eat slowly when I eat hot things.
"If you eat it, will you die?"
Eat it quietly!
"Son-in-law, it looks like your food is too hot for you."
Would you like to drink some cool beer?
Beer?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
Would I die if I drink it?
!
"Dad, he has to drive later."
"Da Ran, I don't have a car since the accident."
"Yoon Jae, your body is still not well since the accident."
I think I will sleep well with just one drink.
"Please pour it for me, Father-in-law."
"Dad, Dad, me too."
Please sit down.
How do you like it here?
"It's a beautiful country, isn't it?"
- Yes.
- Could I see your papers?
"- Oh, come on."
You can overdo things.
- I'm supposed to check all civilians.
Certainly.
Don't get worked up.
There you are.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?
"To the radio room, to check everything."
These militiamen are fanatical.
They'd frisk their own granny.
- We have nothing to hide.
- But it's unnecessary.
He's just a busybody who's seeing how far he can go.
Who is he going to call by radio?
The Holy Father?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Priests have a sense of humour too.
Everything's all right.
Open the gate.
We're going to the depot now.
We'll be there soon.
- I'm sure it's hotter here than it is in hell.
- It might get even hotter.
"Oh, I see, yes."
We're nearly there now.
This is the fuel depot.
Let's bring him in.
"Deep-dive every team that competed in those races, Patton."
Especially Dana's.
I'm hoping that a hacker can find a fellow hacker.
"(chuckles) Come on, man."
That's what I'm all about.
That's why I do what I do.
"Well, go do it."
"Come on, Christopher."
Where the hell are you?
(line ringing)
(phone ringing)
(door closes in distance)
(phone continues ringing)
(sighs) (beeps)
(train passing)
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
I come here to give you a friendly warning.
Stay away from Tucker and his mom.
You understand?
(laughing):
What?
"Get out of here, right..."
But I don't think you heard me.
"Look, I may not be Tucker's dad, but I'm not gonna let anything happen to him or his mom."
"So, if I were you,"
I would just... stay away.
- Or what?
"- Well, trust me."
You don't want to find out.
"You see, that's my boy and my woman."
I'm going to kill youraunt.
She nevertells me anything.
"Look at his gorgeous eyes, his pearly teeth."
"Mom, don't embarrass him."
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
!
"What's that hair, pussy boy?"
It looks beautiful.
Don't you ever risk your life like this again.
Mom...
I'lljoin the army.
Silly boy.
F... ing liar...
My son would never upset me...
"I'm so broke, nobody will give me a job..."
You can find so many jobs...
I can send you money...
How the hell can you?
My aunt is having a hard time...
What now?
"Because of the army, I haven't seen daylight for years."
You can go-go dance in the army...
"Cihan, go get some air."
Yourdaughterwill come back as a man from the army.
Save it for your hairy ass.
Excuse me?
"Cihan, come on, son."
"Sorry, dear."
How did this army thing came up?
Look what the military did to yourbrother...
Yourfather...
I don't want to loose you either.
Absolutely authentic.
And the staircase came from Switzerland.
Ah!
Do you like it?
I know this house.
I have been often here when Jimmy Edwards owned it.
The banker.
It brought him lots of luck.
He made millions.
I'll take it.
"You'll never be sorry, Mr. Sabourin."
Isn't this a rather large house for you?
"Oh, I don't know."
In Europe I lived in a palace for some time.
So did I.
But when the king was unfaithful...
I moved.
You know the price is $300.000 furnished.
I'll give you a fairly substantial deposit.
$5.000 in cash.
I'll sigh the rest of the papers tomorrow.
"You really make up your mind fast, don't you?"
"Oh, you!"
"Yes, sir?"
Who do you work for?
"No one, sir."
Now that you have bought the house.
You're working for me now.
"Thank you, sir."
I want dinner for two tonight.
The best you can get.
"Get a cook, maid, anything you want."
"Well, it's impolite to kiss and tell."

"- Where's Stewart been, Katy?"
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"Here are your birthday pancakes, big brother."
Don't fuck with tradition.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
BOTH:
"Happy birthday, Wayne."
Jinx.
You owe me a Coke.
"Well, see now, that you can get in the States."
"What you can't get, though, is Crush Cream Soda."
- BOTH:
"We got you a present, Wayne."
- Two Cokes.
We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family.
Can we skip my super-soft birthday party then this year?
Hard no!
"It's not a birthday thing, it's an efficiency thing."
"Uh, if you can be one thing, you should be efficient."
We got you an appointment with a matchmaker.
Get the...
Take a...
"Well, start walkin'."
"Well, you won't do online dating."
"There's no more MoDeans, so you can't meet girls there."
"You're handcuffed, cowboy."
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean it.
He's all right.
I didn't mean to...
He's fine.
"Calm down, be brave!"
- You stay there!
-Jeffrey!
Let's get out of here.
Then you can arrest me.
Let's getJenny out of here.
The car's outside.
Come on!
I won't let you put me behind bars!
Throw the gun down.
You wouldn't kill a cop.
Thankyou.
You could have killed me with one shot.
I don't kill anybody until I know they are the real enemy.
- Do you really know me?
- Fate controls everything.
The only person who really knows me turns out to be a cop.
You could always give yourself up.
No.
I made a promise.
I keep my word.
"Sometimes, I really envy you, your freedom."
It's something I don't have.
"I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me."
I have the same problem.
You're an unusual cop.
And you're an unusual killer.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"-Tomorrow, Iet's all go there and see."
-Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a Iong time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide."""
"""We are two eIopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
Something's weird.
An old lady from somewhere came to visit Grandma.
So what?
-I'm not really reading it.
-You just looking at it?
I'm skimming it.
-Is it helping?
"-Yeah, it's informative."
-It's good for an overview.
"-What, like a primer?"
"-Yeah, something like that."
"-Getting the basics, a light survey of popular culture."
-Are you teasing me?
-No.
Should I be reading the Journal of Medicine or the Harvard Review?
Would that be more appropriate?
-Something more scholarly?
"-No, come on, Al."
I was teasing.
"I could harass you about those porno magazines, but I didn't even bring it up."
Wha--?
Come on.
I don't care about the porno magazines.
-I just didn't know you liked Juggs.
"-Oh, God."
-Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.
"-Please, stop it."
Your breasts are fine.
Your breasts are perfect.
Really.
"Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers?"
Where did you come up with that fucking number?
I'm guessing from what you said.
"Well, I'm 16 years older than you."
That's a lifetime of fucking.
I had an affair.
And how did that make him feel?
"Sad, maybe?"
"The reason they're so powerful is because they got the resources, you know?"
"They got investigators and a shit load of money, 200 or 300 little creeps running around there that can search the internet or research whatever they need, you know."
Big operation.
They got everything on everybody.
- Well--
- Sorry I'm late.
Didn't you even know I was late?
We started the trial.
- I'm sorry--
- I know.
I was there for some of it.
It's not going so good for your team.
"I don't know where this came from or what it means, so don't ask."
That right there is the last favor I do for you.
Hi.
How's it going?
"Oh, no."
What happened to your hand?
Please go away.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Um... what?
Oh.
"We got a couple of creeps, too."
Right.
Okay.
So... these are Stoltz' military records from the Marines.
-What are you looking for?
-Where is that box you used to keep all my stuff in?
- The memory box?
- Sounds about right.
I don't remember.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Look.
First place.
The trophy was bigger than you were.
"Can we speed this up, Ma?"
I need my medical records and my birth certificate.
All right.
Here.
"How about your report card, huh?"
You could have been valedictorian... if you hadn't been suspended so many times for getting into fights.
- I never could figure-
"- Mom, I don't need my report card."
- Your father used to get so angry.
- I don't want to talk about Dad.
- I just need my stuff.
- Fine.
Here.
All right?
-I don't want you to think you're keeping those.
"-No, I'm just gonna make copies."
I'm gonna take a trip.
Work.
"The last time you said that, you left for 10 years, Michael."
It's not that kind.
"Did you ever think about leaving, Mom?"
- I didn't chop them up.
- I donated them to science.
- Donating my ass!
How much did you get?
Two grand a body.
- But the benefit of medical research...
- Who'd you hawk them to?
Who'd you hawk them to?
A guy named Russ Bianco.
"I call a number, and he meets me."
You Bianco?
"Yeah, where's Mogan?"
"Ah, he couldn't make it."
He knew I needed the cash.
Name's Elliot.
I work in the morgue with him.
You got a city ID?
Fresh off the slab.
"- Uh, he's not an addict."
- No.
That guy's in better shape than the stiffs Mark usually sends me.
Brain hemorrhage.
Tox screen clean.
So...
Nice gig Mark's got going here.
How's your supply?
Always looking for more.
Why?
One of my cousins works in the Manhattan morgue.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call./ All right."
You wanna give me a hand with this guy?
That's... pretty damn well.
"So, when you say you want a partner..."
"Yeah, that's not exactly true."
I don't want a partner.
Ah.
I want you as my partner.
I've heard good things.
I want to find out if they're true.
"If they're good, they're definitely true."
What scares you most?
Don't think.
Just answer.
Bees.
You know what scares me?
Mediocrity.
"Safe choices, hedged bets, a willingness to settle for the easy and familiar."
"I would really like to take back ""bees."""
Geez.
Married?
I didn't even know you were dating.
'Cause it's none of your business.
You don't tell me when you're screwing your stalker.
"Hey, careful."
They're starting to get too small.
"Oh, right."
Mr. big balls.
"I'm just saying, they're gonna dry out when you fry them."
I'm baking them.
"Oh, you're killing me."
"So, uh, how'd you get the kids not to tell me?"
Really?
The never mentioned Ollie?
I didn't come here to give myself a blowjob!
?
What if the sultan never visited his daughter?
What if there was no fruit basket?
The snake would have bit heranyway.
"Oh, c'mon..."
Destiny is not a choice.
Do you really believe that?
"You know it all, don't you?"
Could you stay out of this?
"Gross, what a shit hole!"
"Not forme, thanks."
I agree.
"Imagine; they're swirling around in silk skirts, and red leggings..."
Your new clothes don't mean you're no longer a bear.
And fancy clothes don't make you a princess.
Save yourwisdom for yourcook book.
Was it a long night?
Why?
Show me yourflat.
This is not a good time.
Ljust want the best for you.
When are you sending me the samples?
I am finalising them.
Are you happy with them?
Absolutely.
Have to go now.
"I am worried about you, Daniel."
No need.
You're such a good photographer.
You're wasting yourtime.
"You know, I'm always here for you."
Sounds like a real mystery.
Does it?
"Anyway, in the end he finds this very thin string that links everything."
I think that might be hard to get across.
People only believe in things that are very sound.
"But that string, even if he finds it, well, it's something like a soul."
There is nothing bodily.
"It's very, very light."
Damn it.
Not interesting?
It's interesting.
I don't quite get it.
But you have a way with words.
I like people who are eloquent.
I don't trust anyone who can't logically explain himself.
Really?
- What the hell?
- So adorable.
- What's his name?
- Dori.
"You're Dori, huh?"
You're so cute.
- How old is he?
- He's eight months now.
"You're eight, are you?"
"- Sorry, but we got to go."
"- No, I'm sorry."
"Bye, Dori."
Scared?
"Yeah, I've been bitten once, and never been near a dog since."
What's there to be afraid of?
He's so lovely.
The marriage shall take place on the same day.
And it shall happen with Sheen only.

Take care!
- Bye!
Are you okay?
Oh god!
You shied away?
The priest shall be on the way.
You shied away?

"Friend, we have brought Sheen's mother to the hospital."
I got to know that she had a heart attack.
"Don't know if we should tell her, or..."

-No!
-You'd better take your boy and go.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
"If you keep this up, someday I'll do what you keep accusing me of."
I don't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex!
"In that way, you're just like him!"
Don't you say things about my father.
He was a wonderful man!
-Wonderful.
-Fine and good to you.
That's what you told me.
So don't blame him for anything!
"Wonderful, and fine, and good."
That's what I told you?
I lied.
I lied about him because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
-Then why did you marry him?
-I didn't!
And he didn't marry me because he already had a wife!
"-You don't mean that, mother."
-I do mean it.
-Don't you understand?
-No...
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison!
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
What could it be?
We're waiting.
Gamze came here too.
The three of us are waiting.
What's Gamze doing there?
May God watch over you guys.
Did we buy those devices so the three of could stand together?
I congratulate you guys.
Is this all you can do?
"Ok, dude."
Calm down a little.
"Now, put your phones on silent and wait until you hear from me."
We won't give up.
We still have time.
We will keep waiting.

Come on.
Hello?
They arrived at a shopping mall.
I am following them...
Is everything alright with you guys?
"Things are a little bit complicated here, but you keep following her."
"My dear Candan, it is such an untimely devotion to music."
Here's your mobile number.
"Now, I need an address for a recording company."

"- Yes, speaking."
"Professor, I am calling from Bemol Records"

-This is Cevat Ceyhan.
"- How can you say that, Uncle?"
"No matter how much you teach a donkey, it can never become a horse."
"- Come on, now!"
"- Phone for you, Baba."
"Yes, mother. I am coming."
Why?
What happened?
is everything fine?
Mother is feeling somewhat ill.
"Uncle, I am moving."
"All right, then, Uncle."
What happened?
The car has broken down.
Let's check what's wrong.
I don't understand what's wrong with it?
It's become a problem.
The problem has been solved.
Excuse me...
Did you think that person to be the hotel's doorman who parks cars?
No.
Then you give your car to strangers just like that?
There are some people who don't look like strangers in the first meetings too.
Do you believe that he will return?
He will return.
He will surely return.
A girl...and a car!
"How wonderful, Lord!"
I pray at the shrine.
But He gives everything to him.
Anyway...

"Still, you are sitting here?"
What are you doing?

What the hell?
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Please hurry and cross!
Hurry!
You can't stop traffic!
Hello.
- I'm sorry for being late.
- Hello.
I'm sorry.
Are you having some problems in your life?
Excuse me?
"Oh, I don't have any problems in my life, editor."
"I haven't been getting any sleep, and I overslept."
You must've had a good sleep.
"Yes, that's correct."
"All right, let's start the meeting."
Yes.
"It fits perfectly, it doesn't need any adjustments."
I'll make that decision.
All right.
Did you gain some weight?
"No, I didn't."
You must've been slacking off on your exercise.
Did I gain weight?
Why isn't your groom here?
"He's coming, he'll be here."
Did I gain a lot of weight?
"Do I need to make fun of ""Star Wars"" or something"

- Whoa.
I don't remember having that in my storeroom.
"Yo, guys."
What's going on?
[ Chuckles ]
Why aren't you out at the party?
- The thing is...
- We're in a weird situation.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
"I get it, fellas."
It's okay.
"I mean, look, you're 17."
"Life's crazy right now, and the one thing you can really count on is your best friend."
It's natural to kiss a little.
"You know, just see if it feel all right."
Dude!
We're not gay.
We didn't kiss.
"Uh, duh!"
[ Laughs ]
I did not kiss my best friend in high school either.
At all.
Ever.
"We are always pulling back a strange new layer on you, aren't we?"
This is just the greatest night!
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
Proof?
"Hell yes, proof!"
I'm not the kind to talk shit without backing it up.
I go on long-term disability.
At 75% pay.
"And then do what, shay?"
I fish off Navy pier for the next 20 years?
It's dumping gas!
- Get a hose on there!
- Go!
You're going in there?
You need to get back behind the lines.
"Mouch, get this kid safe."
I'm not gonna pretend like I don't remember peeling you off the floor after that woman broke your heart.
I know.
I just always thought she was the one.
Come on!
Get down!
[Children cheering]
When can we go back inside?
"We have to check with the gas company, ma'am."
And they'll tell you when it's safe.
"Ms. Simpson, I was looking for Leonard to get the keys to the shed."
No one's seen him.
"Oh, God."
"Everyone, stop."
We're going back in.
[Dramatic music]
?
Leonard!
Down here?
Call out!
You guys smell anything?
Are we sure they cut off the gas lines?
"Oh, I shut it down myself."
- Don't ask!
That's 20 Navel...
"Er, Navy!"
"Navy Cut for you, Mrs Turner, and for you, Mrs Ellis."
-
- Thank you.
-
"- You get worse, Granville."
-
"- Keep taking the pills, Granville!"
-
"- And who is she browning herself for, is a question that springs to the lips."
It can't be her husband.
Have you seen him?
It's the way he walks.
Nobody's going brown all over just for him.
Can you imagine him with nothing on?
I bet we'd have to if we saw him with nothing on!
He's fixed her up with some wonderful kitchen units.
Has he?
-
- What are you glaring at me for?
-
- What am I g--glaring at you for?
Look at all them opportunities you missed!
They only came in for cigarettes.
That's all they ever come in for.
What they come in for is up to them.
What they go out with is up to us!
Can't get a word in edgewise with them two.
They never listen.
-
Please.
You're frightening me.
"Can't you stop that, man?"
This is a hospital.
Abel to Security.
"Abel, are you down there?"
Abel to Security.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not frightened of you!
I'm interested in getting some hours in the sleep lab...
"I only sign off on the paperwork, Elmer, as I think you know."
Good luck.
Dr. Massingale.
I heard you need volunteers in the sleep lab.
"Elmer, that depends."
On what?
Whether you're interested in working or flirting.
"You've got a bit of a reputation, I'm afraid."
- As a flirter?
- And for being a practical joker.
I'll be the best sleeper in the house.
"Okay, but you..."
"What's going on, may I ask?"
"We waited, and then we held the meeting without you."
"Really, Dr. Hook?"
Very funny.
But regardless of what Dr. Hook says... the meeting begins when I arrive.
It ends when I leave.
Any questions?
Have a seat.
Any time.
Any admissions since yesterday?
- Good!
Why isn't the sign up?
Hi everyone.
"Well, at least it's finished."
When do I get the money?
When this thing is up.
Tell me Nora.
Wouldn't you rather work over there with us...
Instead of wasting your time over here.
Oh no!
We're wasting our time.
What's going to happen to us.
We won't survive!
He's got a screw loose!
"By the way, does your brother have the money?"
"Yes, he has the money."
You can pick it up right now.
Finally some good news!
"Great, right?"
Maybe something will actually come out of your hotel.
Although I would fire the bellman.
He's got a screw loose.
Tom?
Tom is the way he is.
"But you Toni, how are you?"
I don't have a screw loose.
I'm an entrepreneur.
But I shouldn't say that too loud.
And what else are you?
The sign goes up tonight.
It's taken long enough.
"Hi there, I heard you have my money."
I won it last night at his casino.
You owed him this much money?
- Double it.
- Harry!
- Don't start with me.
- You need to get a grip on this.
How does a man who spends all his time fighting the bad guys get into so much trouble with his own side?
Hmm?
"- Thank you, Rich."
- Pleasure.
Here.
"Look, um..."
There's something else.
What?
Will you have a look at this?
"(LAUGHS) I didn't take you as the bangle type, Harry, but then jewelry creeps up on the best of us."
- Where did you get this?
- It's hard to explain.
A woman?
- You dark horse!
Take it off.
- I can't.
"- Well, let me try."
- I've tried.
It won't come off.
"Well, how did you get it on in the first place?"
- I haven't a baldy.
"- Wow, that must have been some night."
Right...
- I have no idea what this is.
- Really?
Or where it comes from or how old it is.
"Yes, I am."
- No.
"Dr Brandon is his physician, but he's on vacation."
I've treated him in the interim.
- Look.
His name's on the prescription.
- I didn't know.
- Did you prescribe those for Saul?
"- Yes, I did."
- Does he need them?
- They're nitroglycerine tablets - only to be taken in case of a heart attack.
Has Mr Greenberg suffered a seizure?
- Ruben?
"- Yeah, I'm back."
- How is he?
- He's still out.
His heart seems steadier though.
You have any problems?
"No, I left the ambulance in a dirt road off the jungle in Koko Head."
"But coming back, a coastguard cutter was dropping black flags in the water."
- It must be some kind of a warning.
"- Yeah, maybe to keep us in."
Don't worry.
"We'll get out of here tomorrow, no matter what."
- And the woman?
- We'll get her too.
- Give him an injection!
- What about his heart?
The hell with his heart!
inject him!
Hello.
He tried to escape.
Are you sure about this?
If the bag is   so give it to Marie.
Okay.
- Do you want him to die?
- Who are you?
Lisa's boyfriend.
It is our son.
Why do you help him?
- We must first know what has happened.
- At the expense of his life?
We only need new identities.
Give us a chance.
Murderers must serve their sentences.
Armed men entered the apartment.
Frank defended us.
"If he is innocent, He has nothing to be afraid of."

Guess who I just saw.
Half a million on two legs.
A friend at Kungsgatan have seen Wagner.
He is heading for North Stan.
See now picking up speed.
- Wagner are Kungsportsplatsen.

Others are looking for the reward.
Two shots to the head should be enough.
Let's go.
"So, uh, what do you want to talk about?"
"Well, um, do you know my name?"
- Uh...

"- Yeah, a lot."
You?
Yeah.
"Look, Cory, I know I've been forbidden to give you any advice on any subject ever again, so if there's any information you'd like to voluntarily offer about the current events of your life, I'm listening."
- How was my date?
- Yeah.
- I had a real good time.
"- So, what was your technique?"
"Look, I know you know everything there is to know about women and I don't know anything, so I did what I do best..."
I was real nervous and I nodded a lot.
Did she like that?
"I don't know, but when we were done,"
I asked her if she maybe wanted to go out again.
"She said, ""Yeah, I would."""
Cool.
- Cor?
- Yeah?
"So, how did you nod?"
"I mean, was it like this or...?"

I suggest you make yourselves useful and join 'em.

Got you that from the hospital shop.
Can't stand that stuff.
Such gratitude!
You look like you could use it more.

He fled back to his country before I could walk.
You can study with some other teacher.

I've always admired that hat.
"Hello, Chess."
"Since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?"
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.
"I would like to look my best, you know."
It is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
"I was rather good at it, was I not?"
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
"I love a morning execution, don't you?"
"-Yes, Your Majesty."

"We don't know if the Holy Grail is in Montserrat, but there is a time door."
Of course.
The grail of all grails.
They are accepting the conditions because they want that door.
And how do they know about a door that even we aren't aware of?

Hello.
Did you come alone?
Where is your partner?
I saw them kill him hidden behind some bushes.

The important thing is that you're alive and you're leaving this hell.
Quickly.
- You're kidding me.
- You're squandering my money.
You've been studying for seven years and you're only half way through.
- I'II get it together.
- Marry Michelle or earn your living.
- But dad...
- It's all arranged.
"You get a car, a house, and 25000 a month."
You can't force me to marry her.
The wedding is in two months.
Your friends are not welcome.
And your mother says she's waiting for some grandchildren.
"Hey, Marc?"
"What are you doing, you fucking faggot?"
"- Fuck you, bitch."
- What's going on?
He tried to kiss me.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She was dancing.
I thought you'd finished with her.
- It's nearly closing time.
- There are still five on the list.
Who hasn't gone yet?
I saw Christian and Johannes.
Johannes is too drunk for it.
Will you do Christian?
I am too sore.
"- Of course, baby."
- Thanks.
How do you feel about your mum and dad?
- What are you doing?
- Why won't he talk to her?
Binding over boyfriend is key.
- Here's some water.
"- Great, she'll need some."
- Here you go.

I have some mints.
I'll leave them here.
"I'm okay, I just..."
- I gotta get back to work.
"- No, you go home."
I'll put you in a cab.
Here you go.
"- She's sick, buddy."
Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?
Listen.
"Go home, cuddle up and get some rest."
Youve gotta take better care.
You're working too hard.

- Without any photos?
I need to have her photographed.
And you wanted her to be a witness.
Now don't get worked up!
"But, Bruno, she'll wake up."
She must go away before she gathers her wits.
We can't let that happen!
And I know exactly what's awaiting her when she realizes.
And that is terrible.
I feel... as if it were me.
Attention!
"Photographing now, Miss!"
The camera will click shortly.
What's the matter?
You're not at the dentist's!
Why the sad face?
A passport is not a wanted poster.
It's not so bad.
"Please, a bit more pleasant, Miss!"
Well then!
...
Well then!

See?
"When you smile, you look quite pretty."
"Excuse me, please!"
It almost makes me sorry that I must get you an ID card today.
I want you to be strong.
I know I will.
Because you never let me down.
"Penguin, still there?"
"Yes, right here."
You can leave them at home safe with her mother?
"-Daddy, what are you talking about?"
-What are you talking about?
"Sorry, kids."
The career of his father came to an end.
"No, Dad."
"No, Dad."
Let's take a look around.
Can you see any way out?
"Yes, only creating a pair of wings."
-Can you move?
"-I'm stuck, pal."
"Okay, everybody, move away from the edge we depart the edge."
"Okay, do not move until I return."
Where you going?
I'll see what I can do by their father.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
This is another small step for a krill.

"- No, thin like you're not eating properly."
Oh!
"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we doing this now?
- You were out for a date on our anniversary?
!
- How do you know it was a date?
!
I just wanted to see you.
I haven't asked you if you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to because I just can't.
- He's a friend.
"- Oh, well..."
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"- Well, that's very convenient, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
What?
Aren't you?
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."

OK?

"Yeah, you guys..."
- This was very late.
I remember it was the last thing in the night.
"- Andy was around for hours, though."
- Yeah.
"In fact, this was the same night as the convenience store thing."
- Right.
"- So this was, like, 6 in the morning."
"We started shooting the next scene at about 5, 5:30."
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
- This...
That.

Let's talk about that.
That is so good.

"Right, then, Moz, we'll be off..."
"Right, then."
"See you, lads."
"Russian, Polish, I've got no idea."
Everybody's having a good time.
How did he get this off the wall?
I think the girls will hold out for quite a while.
"Let's do ""Russian Nights"" then."
We could do whatever we want.
They're really good!
"Good then, we'll have ""Russian nights""."
It doesn't exist?
There is no quiz show.
But you showed it to me?
That was just a starting point.
The starting point was good.

"I me,he promised to pay me back."
With interest.

Who are you?

And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.

Or at least nod your fucking head!

Curse!
Why you not think about it in our lives?
I just want to train to get stronger.
Wow ...

That's why I do not want to come across Bills-sama.
Huh?
Who is that Bills-sama?

I knew it!
You're hiding something!
That's why you're acting so weird!
Is it a person?
There is a God.
It has the same level as Kaio Shin-sama.
he is coming here.
no problem.
He is a very cold and a very awesome God.
An awesome God?
"He is also called ""The God Of Destruction"
If there is something he does not like the the planet and lives ends up being destroyed.

I'm just a government employee.
Which government?

There were.
"In fact, there are still a couple of holdouts--"
"Texas, a bloc in the East."
"The new federal government's been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming."
"Colonel, this is an emergency."
You have to go to Jericho.
The fighting could be happening right now.
"I am very sorry, ma'am."
"Casper, you see she gets back to the medical unit."
"Come on, ma'am."
Get 'em out.
Why?
Get 'em out.
Clear everyone out.
You listen...
This place is where you survive.
"You make a stand here, you hear?"
We will.
I'm sorry you have to see this.
You been through enough.
"Dad, Dad, stop."
"You're stronger than you think you are, though."
Always have been.
"I love you, son."
"I guess I zigged when I should've zagged out there, huh?"
Rashad!
What'd they say?
She's there.
We're getting her exact location now.
Good.
Have my men dump him into the ocean.
"Uh, okay, whoa."
Whoa.
You can't just dump him.
I'm involved now.
"His body washes up on South Beach, there's gonna be an investigation, an autopsy."
It won't take long before those drugs are traced back to me.
What do I care?
It's not my problem.
Let me at least just take the body back to the hospital.
We'll dump it in the incinerator.
Nobody will know.
"But we got to move fast, 'cause security comes on at 4:00."
You got the information you needed.
Let us take care of this.
"Mr. Hamady, you saved my life."
It's the least I could do.
Fine.
Take him.
I'm done here.
Jesse!
How long has it been?
Four minutes.
Four minutes?
We're cutting it pretty close.
Come on.
Let's get out of here before Jabbar sees us.
I know nothing about bullfighting but a lot about desperate women.
Yeah?
And who told you I'm desperate?
You gave me that impression.
You don't care about bullfighting.
You're interested in my relationship with El Nino.
"Tell ""El Pais"" the answer's no and leave me alone!"
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Get me out of here!
- What's wrong?
"Get me out of here, please."
There's a snake in the kitchen!
Give me the keys.
- The door's open.
"- Calm down, and stay here."
My purse...
Thank you.
Take me to a hotel.
I'm never going back to that house.
Which hotel?
"- The Eurobuilding, for example."
- Very well.
"Don't tell anyone about this snake business, please."
- Only my family knows about it.
- Don't worry.
One thing I respect is other people's phobias.
"After all you've done,"
I feel bad about saying no to the profile.
Sleep on it.
I'll call you tomorrow for your decision.
Thank you for everything.
"- huh, you dipshit?"
"- Uh, Gene?"
G-Gene?
"Uh, no, I'm not coming to Fort Lauderdale."
Why would you think that?
What?
[Chuckles]
"Because you're still using the corporate credit card, you dummy."
"Listen, Nate,"
I don't know why you're doing this.
I don't know if you're trying to embarrass me.
I don't know if you're trying to sell this product to another company.
"Hey, man, I thought you cared about this company."
[Laughter]
Of course I care.
"What are you talking about, man?"
- I care more than anyone else.
- Shh.
I put so much on the line for this!
"I lied to my wife, I lied to my family"
- because I care so goddamn much.
- [Laughter]
"I told you he would cry, right?"
"You girls owe me shots, shots, shots."
- Am I on speakerphone?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Me and the ladies,"
- we needed a new drinking game.
- [Laughter]
"So, uh, listen, I'll let you go."
"You drive safe, sweetheart."
[Laughter]
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm going to need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
All photos now.
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
Or what?
You're going to kill me?
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
They'll be heading out soon once they've juiced themselves up for the night.
(SHOUTING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
That's him.
"That's the one we kill, no matter what."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
MATAK:
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
Yes.
Thank you.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Colonel Grant.
(GREETING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"Sit, please."
It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
- Then let us work to resolve it.
"- Indeed, yes."
You should disinfect it.
"Yeah, later."
"You know, earlier with the coroner, maybe I went too fast."
You weren't too hot for the idea.
"No, it's OK."
I'm sorry.
You didn't want to.
"Not really, no."
What is it?
"well, you know..."
I'm retiring in 3 months.
"Yeah, so?"
This case looks complicated.
"I might still have to go to court in 1 , maybe 2 years after I retire, so..."
We started and that's what counts.
You sure?
"Yeah, sure."
Found anything interesting?
"Yeah, actually..."
"Come, I have a question for them."
Who wears high heels?
We found fresh tracks.
"we just need to take prints, it'II be easy to find."
"He must be talking about the girl, the dancer."
The dancer?
What dancer?
You never mentioned a dancer.
"He didn't see her, she stayed in my truck until he left."
"When he came back, she had gone back to the hotel."
What's her name?
Samantha... so she said.
"A cutie, fully equipped."
I'm sorry.
There was nothing to be done.
She has moments only.
"We saved the world, Clara, you and me."
"We really, really did."
Will you go back... to your cloud?
No more cloud.
Not now.
Why not?
It rained.
Run.
"Run, you clever boy."
And remember.
It's Christmas.
Christmas Day.
And what about the Intelligence?
Melted with the snow?
"No, I shouldn't think so."
It learned to survive beyond physical form.
"Well, we can't be in much danger from a disembodied Intelligence that thinks it can invade the world with snowmen."
Or that the London Underground is a key strategic weakness.
The Great Intelligence... rings a bell... the Great Intelligence?
Doctor?
"I never knew her name, her full name."
"Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment manager, Starship Alaska."
Souffle girl...
Oswin - it was her.
"Run, you clever boy."
And remember.
It was souffle girl again.
"I never saw her face the first time with the Daleks, but her voice, it was the same voice."
Doctor?
He was in for sex crimes.
Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
Hello.
How are you holding up?
Fantastic.
What's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
A whisk?
That would be it.
We're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You here to see Johnny Holt?
"Yes, I am."
We found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
"If he gives you any problems, let me know."
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
Whisk.
I knew that.
Never seen him before.
There's traces of your blood on him.
My blood's all over this city.
"Been shot nine times, knifed five."
We believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
Do you recognize this boy?
You implying I'm into kids?
Because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
Right.
"Right, you prefer to rape grown women. forgot."
They said it was rape.
Please don't disappoint me!
"Amida Buddha, please turn back."
"No, I'll never go back."
I'll beg the Chief!
Behave yourself!
I want to go in!
Brother!
Behave yourself in the temple!
I want to be a monk.
Who's your chief?
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
Mercy!
Mercy!
Shaolin was founded because of our ancestor's determinate spirit.
"Brothers, what's your opinion?"
We'll obey our chief!
Thanks!
Amida Buddha.
"From now on, you'll be known as Tat-chi."
"Since you're now a monk, you must remain single and stay here to practice and to train yourself."
Obey all our regulations!
Thanks!
"Tat-chi, you've learned kung-fu before, so you needn't start from scratch."
"Tomorrow, you'll practice with the Four Escorts."
Yes!
"Fat-tao, I'll hand over Tat-chi to you."
Yes.
Tat-chi!
Have a rest!
I wish to continue.
Tat-chi has made good progress!
Chin Kang Fist is really mysterious.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's a miracle it's still here.
The guys forgot it and didn't lock the car.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You're kind.
"Here, even if your car's gold, no one will touch it."
"Opposite the school, the students are curious."
It's best to lock it.
All right.
Are you in telecommunications?
Telecommunications?
Yes.
This place is a world of communication.
Why're you here?
"Yes, that's obvious."
I've never seen a woman serve before.
Where did you spring from?
What?
"You have parents, don't you?"
Who served your father his tea?
My mother.
Why say you've never seen such a thing?
All women serve.
They have three trades:
"by day, they're workers. ln the evening, they serve and at night they work."
Except for your mother.
Thanks all the same!
I've told you time and again not to park here.
Park next to the engineer.
"When you start it up, you pollute the cafe."
Color me impressed.
This mode's got some serious power.
I'll say.
Let's turn this guy black and blue.
[all grunt] [growls] What?
I'm seeing red.
"Red rangers, it's time to get fired up."
"[grunting] [groaning] [groaning] At least it took five teams to beat me. [argus] If these setbacks continue,"
The prince will lose his mind.
Something must be done.
Leave it to me.
I've been working on something big.
It's a waste to use it on this little planet.
Consider this a test.
[grunts]
Maximizer.
Watch.
We no longer need zombats.
And we can enlarge more than one monster at a time.
[all] Huh? They're doing it without zombats.
Now they can grow four at once?
[alarm signal] That'll be Gosei.
[Gosei] Rangers.
You can see the aliens have new capabilities.
But you have some too.
"Along with your new powers, come new zords and a special skyship."
Summon them.
Thanks.
We're on it.
Summon skyship.
Wow.
Sweet ride.
"- Well, thank you."
And I love your scarf.
Really brings out your vagina.
How come I have never thought of that before?
[ Grunts ]
[ Chuckling ] That's funny.
[ Whispering ] How can she be above me?
Do you realize she's a woman?
- Yes.
Why are we whispering?
- Because they can hear everything!
"- She's a topflight chef, Steven."
She ran her own restaurant.
- Ohhh!
"I don't care if she's a world-class balloonist... who can whistle ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"" out of her ass!"
- This should've been mine!
"- You're preaching to the choir, buddy."
- What?
Pino doesn't trust me?
- Why would he?
You stole his Vicodin.
- We don't need another chef.
"- Yes, we do."
"We're getting slammed, okay?"
And I'm just giving her the scut work.
"You're still my go-to guy, huh?"
You're my right-hand man.
You're the Sundance to my Butch.
"- Oh, good."
So I'm actually in charge.
- No.
What's she ever done that's so great?
She's very classy and even prettier in person.
I must say this could change everything.
Yes!
"Oh, are you gonna finish that sandwich?"
I've been driving all day.
-Please.
-Thanks.
Now we're just gonna need some proof of employment.
Some what?
Some pay stubs tax records.
Just something I can submit to the board.
Miss Montana pays in cash.
Is proving this going to be a problem?
Of course not.
[Growls]
How'd it go?
Stupid proof of employment.
Tax stubs.
No cookie.
I drove 200 miles just to say...
You want proof Cookie Lady I'll show you proof.
Hey uh why didn't you just use the emergency Hannah kit.
You keep in your car?
Because I forgot!
[Mimicks cat snarling]
Yes Miley the directions you gave me were perfect as usual.
Now if I could just find that incredibly competent and extremely attractive.
Admissions woman that you described.
[Gasps] Oh wait there she is.
You are the best.
"Kiss, kiss."
Bye.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
"Combo, you seen Badger?"
Don't you cover for him!
"I ask you a straight-up question,"
I expect a straight-up answer!
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
You've got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I can only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
All right!
"Let's all go back to work, for Christ's sake!"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos have been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
What's this from APD?
I been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me.
–Nothin'.
"Hey, it's cool."
You can tell me.
No.
It doesn't matter.
I gotta get back.
"Seeing the way you stiffed your partner, I figure you're just one big hard-on today."
–Excuse me?
–You know what an officer-involved shooting means?
It means that we're all involved.
–I told the truth.
–When it comes to your partner's career... the truth is like grits.
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.
You goddamn rookies.
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.
That's real...
That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.
And this is silk right here.
This will look real good with...
"Drop the clothes, ladies."
"Although, you have got to have that one."
–She's keeping that one for free.
–Wait...
Whoa!
"–I got receipts for all this, man!"
"–Oh, yeah?"
That's funny.
I got a police report for it from Dress For Less.
"Dealin' stolen merchandise, Taylor."
"I was thinking, ""How am I gonna back up?"""
I don't even know how to drive forward on a stick shift.
- I can't believe you left her there.
- I can.
Good.
I think that's the first time anyone's sympathized for her character there.
People cheer.
I love how she checks her boobs to see if there's something wrong.
"Her boobs must be misaligned, that's why he backed away."
- That's so funny.
"- It's so sweet, though."
That's so funny.
"- Mike, you're..."
This is terrific.
- This is a great moment.
This is really late.
- Oscar.
Oscar.
- Right?
Really late.
"- Yeah, it's probably 5:30, 5:45."
"- Well, maybe a Golden Globe."
Look how great.
That was really me doing that.
I really actually did that.
"Mike, you're a handsome act..."
Good actor.
I just want to sum this up.
"If you wanna give us any compliments, feel free."
"- Yeah, go for it."
- You guys are handsome.
You're so good.
- Knew it.
- Okay.
"All right, well, uh, what does his relationship status on his Facebook say?"
"""Facebook""?"
"I don't know, Grandpa."
We don't have a typewriter.
- Snap.
"- Oh, come on, Facebook is on a compute..."
"No, no, no, stop talking, because the more you say, the older we get."
"Okay, fine, I won't say anything."
"No, no, no!"
We can actually help this child.
"Unlike Lark, she's telling us what's wrong in words we can understand."
"Yeah, we're gonna tell you"
"- what you do here, okay?"
- Yes.
Just go over there.
"No, if we get too close, he might recognize us."
"Okay, well, uh, here."
He won't recognize us.
(stammers) He didn't know what we looked like before.
"Yeah, of course."
"Hey, will you put this on my birthday list?"
"Yeah, okay, one stupid hat."
Got it.
"What's up, Broseph Stalin?"
You looking for something special?
Maybe for a special someone?
You work here?
"- Yeah, we do."
We for sure do.
- Yeah.
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"My sweet, little, innocent..."
Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
"It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!"
"Oh, my God."
Ted... did you...
Big-time.
Nice!
High five!
Wait!
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family,"
I'm pretty sure you banged my mom-- mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney, let me ask you something."
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."
Who's your guitar-player-biker- who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa- but-said-screw-it- and-went-medium bad boy?
"Marshall, your hand!"
And then what?
We depose those in power.
And once you've done that?
"Once you've killed Jeanine, who's in power then?"
"See, that's the part that she always conveniently leaves out."
Don't you tell me this isn't about you.
This is only about you.
I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.
Where?
They took shelter in Candor.
"As far as I know, they're still there."
Think about it.
"If we were to combine forces, Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable."
That's not gonna happen.
"Thank you for your hospitality, but we'll be leaving in the morning."
"Four, maybe this is..."
"Tobias, please, reconsider."
Don't you call me that.
My name's Four.
"You wanna tuck him in, or should I?"
(DOOR SLAMMING)
"Well, this..."
This meal looks lovely.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you about her.
(SIGHS)
No more secrets.
Okay?
(GASPS)
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
"Yeah, I know."
He's in the city on important business.
- He'll be back soon.
- Uh-huh.
That's what you think.
Everybody says he quit us for something better.
- That's a lie.
- What did he hang it on a limb for?
He didn't run out on us.
I'll beat up any guy that says he did.
"Well, I was only telling you what everybody's saying."
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
Stinks.
"What's the difference, if it's a nice room?"
"Besides, you're only gonna be here a little while."
- Get down to that hospital.
Go ahead.
- I'll keep calling you.
Get that mug anything.
I don't want him to die on me.
What's the matter?
Just when I get everything set up at school.
I have to knock off that gorilla.
Don't tell me you're worrying about that joint?
Yeah.
Go on.
Get down to the hospital.
- Go ahead.
Beat it.
Go ahead.
"- Okay, okay."
So?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be... your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
21 dollars more.
- No!
- That's okay.
"Oh, come on."
"Sifu, Mousy's a good man."
Please let him be your student.
Mousy!
The injuries weakened his legs.
Your injuries are unique.
I'll have to give you a unique treatment.
How unique?
Your heart has been displaced.
I'll have to open your chest to heal you.
We'll open your ribcage and adjust the position of your heart.
We'll then close your ribcage and sew you up.
Then you'll be better.
He can handle it.
"Sifu Wong, is this knife suitable?"
Just about.
Hold him down!
I'm OK!
I'm OK now!
Come back.
Pay your respects to Marshal.
I'm known for being magnanimous.
"We're like brothers, and none of his ideas worked."
Forfeit for you.
"Sifu Wong, hey..."
Go and stand guard.
"- Sifu Wong, we're going."
- Glad you came.
Take your time.
We're on our way.
♪ It's such a joy to be entertained
♪ We'd be invited to more dinners...
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
Mike and I know this country.
- You don't.
"- No matter what you think, there's a missing chimp out there."
We can help find her.
"Captain, I'm afraid they make sense."
Our first responsibility is to find Sally.
"Well, ok, we'll release them."
"You guys better remember-- anything happens to Sally, you're gonna be responsible, you get that?"
"Believe me, Captain, we're just as concerned"
- about that chimp as you are.
"- Yeah, well, we'll see."
"Hey, no guns."
"It's just a dart rifle, Captain."
Here.
Look for yourself.
(CHATTERING)
(ROARS)
(JUDY SCREECHING)
- Got it?
- Yep.
There we are.
"Now I'll secure the tarpaulin, and then I'll call one of my men to stand guard over it."
Ok.
I'm gonna check in with Paula.
Marsh Tracy calling Wameru.
"Paula, do you read me?"
- Come in.
- Wameru.
"Go ahead, Dad."
"Paula, we found the space capsule and Sally's spacesuit"
- but no helmet.
"- Well, Dad, where's Sally?"
"You're just jealous, Peku."
"You're a fucking tease, bitch!"
I'll tell everyone not to talk to you.
You're a traitor!
And you can donate this virginity barometer to the nuns!
Can't you just wear women's clothes?
This is so embarrassing.
You're the one going through people's grocery bags!
How do I look?
-Like a pervert dying to get laid.
Dad...
"You didn't have to, honey..."
I'll fight for you.
You picked these in the yard.
I rang your doorbell.
I brought you flowers.
Tore them from the ground.
I worked!
"I humiliated myself for you, Marjukka."
-Oh boy...
You're insatiable!
"I've got something better in sight, you stupid monkey!"
"You've got a guy here, I can smell it."
Go or I'll ask your Mom to get you.
Tell him to come out.
Hello.
Garbage Jesse!
"This won't do, Jesse."
You're far too crazy.
And lemma hates you.
I'm beginning to understand why.
L---
"If not, you'll have to bottle it into him, but do be careful."
You can choke a beast that way.
"Anyhow, nurse is on the job."
Yes.
I have the distinct impression that I'm under supervision.
Hmm?
Is she always like this?
Aye.
Funny how they are in their ways.
Judy here thinks she's responsible for all the stock on the farm.
"Well, sheepdog..."
"Keen instinct, I suppose."
"Oh, it's more than that."
She likes to take charge.
"Newborn calves, new kittens all get licking and nursing treatment from old Judy."
It'll be all to the good for this little chap.
It might give him a new interest in life.
"You're a rummer, all right, are you, lass?"
"Hello, James."
"- Hello, siegfried."
Savaged?
"Hammer blow, actually."
I trust you weren't using it on a patient at the time.
Sorry.
Can I do the honors?
That's okay.
- Come on.
"Thank you, James."
Pleasure.
James...
- Mm-hmm?
May I ask you a very Frank question?
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
She's given her statement.
Read it.
Shiv brought me to Kurukshetra... which is 142 kilometres from Delhi... and raped me in this car.
Enough.
I'll handle it from here.
Heard that.
Anything that you say anything that you don't say... will definitely be used against you.
Ayushman you don't know...
You don't know that rape is a serious crime.
No bail and along prison sentence.
You'll live like a dog get that.
You're trying to trap me in this.
Dimple's lying.
- You know...
- Who's lying?
She's lying.
Will a decent girl defame herself?
Did she bring you here?
Did she bring you here?
You didn't bring her.
She... drugged the water.
She made you drink it.
She got you unconscious.
Listen boy.
It's all about facts and figures.
You were stuck on her figure.
And the fact is... that you're a bloody rapist.
Understand.
Come out.
Ayushman what are you doing?
Come on.
Ayushman this is wrong.
Lots of cake.
We love cakes.
"I got the green one for you, that's your favourite, right?"
I'll have the marzipan cake.
"No, the Goosey Whipped Cream."
"- You're far out, Thomas."
- Sure I am.
I'm expected to be.
- Stop it.
- Bums like me are skinny.
"I'll get so fat, people won't see the bum."
They'll nod and say:
What a good citizen with a double chin and all.
- Why don't you eat your cake?
"- I want to stop, Thomas."
I can't take it anymore.
Really?
Then I'll have it.
I can go on all day.
I don't know why.
Stop it!
You know what I mean.
"I'm talking about us, not the cakes."
About us?
Our relationship and stuff?
"Crisis, intimacy, presence, closeness."
- I'm serious.
"- Listen, the two of us have a pact."
We love each other.
"Even when we're apart, we're together, anyway."
"It can't be any different, Tilde."
- It's an old pact.
They sing the song too slow.
Slow?
"There are horses and a carriage, so they should sing it faster."
I'll handle it.
"It's a big problem, Daddy."
"I promise I'll handle this big problem, Goni."
Now can I have a good-night hug?
Daddy.
Get up.
What's wrong?
Your pills.
"Get up, do your exercises."
What did we say?
"10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the evening."
Well?
"Okay, okay."
Any messages for me?
"Someone called in the evening, but I said you were performing."
They didn't leave a message on your cell phone?
I didn't check.
It was a guy.
Goni.
You must have 5 minutes to sit with your father.
How many performances do you have this month?
"Three, four."
But I'm just an understudy.
I'm sure you're a better pianist than the one you substitute for.
How do you know?
I know.
Is it enough for the rent?
I put all your pills in the plastic box.
Goni.
I don't like you!
Close cover before striking.
Close cover before striking.
My daddy told me never to play with matches.
My mummy told me never to play with matches.
"Oh, that's it."
He's gone too far.
"- I have to stop this, Al."
- Don't!
Ow!
There's someone here to see an Annabella Wilgis.
Annabella Wilgis?
- He's here!
"- Who's here, the killer?"
- He's coming.
- Sit down!
Who are you now?
"My name, young man, is Annabella Wilgis."
How dare you speak to me like that.
Here he is.
"Your interrogation of my client is over, Detective."
Your client?
"- Darren Russem, Ms Wilgis' lawyer."
- You're her lawyer!
- Miss Wilgis is not here voluntarily.
- She came in as a witness!
- Are you torturing my client?
- She came in voluntarily!
You don't seem to understand the scope of my client's disorder.
She asked you to meet her here?
You called ahead because you knew you'd need a lawyer?
"Five minutes, that's all I need."
A great gift.
"Oh, this ..."
Ordudaydım before the priest.
- What does it mean?
"- ""Self-sacrifice"" of the Latin."
I have tattoos and 4 had a friend like that.
"1 word, it's all a aradaydı."
So ... what other elements fell?
"Freedom, Family, Blood and Courage."
I fell to sacrifice?
Do you know what it means to altruism?
No.
One thing to say bless.
"Me and my friends, in Afghanistan, Special Kuvvetler'deydik."
"Our mission, to destroy the production of heroin."
When the rocket hit 3-dağlardaydık us.
I'd survived a single.
"Of course, after something like that You can not predict who would survive."
... And So I've been a priest?
"I became a priest, because I can do it thought it would be the hardest thing."
"Pretty stupid, huh?"
So ...
Looks good.
How are you?
Are you okay?
You know what?
I think your brother will be here soon.
I'm sure the job was just.
- He comes back to you until we ilgilenebilirim.
OK?
- Okay.
- Hey.
"Well, uh, just a minute."
"Dr. Alison, what's your off-the-cuff estimate"
- of Sally's condition?
"- Stay with her, Sergeant."
"Yes, sir."
"Here, Sally, let me help you."
This is Dr. Alison from the consulate.
"Without a complete diagnostic check-up, which we can only do properly at a medical office,"
I would say she is really a super chimp.
"Her heart has a steady beat, and she appears to be in astonishingly good health considering her fantastic voyage through space."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I want to get back"
- to my famous patient.
- Message received.
"I'll be needing you, Doctor."
Thanks.
"That's right, Nagoro."
We'll keep in touch.
Out.
That's it.
We're gonna lift her.
Put your hands under her.
- You get that end.
- Right.
Up we go.
"1, 2, 3, lift."
Here we go.
Now we'll turn.
(SERGEANT):
"You'll be all right, pal."
(CAPTAIN):
Here we go.
I'll get her from the front.
"You know, the problem with the DOD is they design everything for desert warfare."
"If they just understood that 20% of the planet was mountainous,"
- then... ah!
Got it.

"Jack, do you read?"
[Static crackling]
This way.
So you really ain't have nothing else but this red coat?
[Chuckles]
"Monty, it's Jack."
Go ahead.
Monty:
We got the DNA on the killer.
Mae:
It's an Ian Wilson.
He's from New Zealand.
"Uh, 2015 earthquake triggered an avalanche that wiped out his entire mountain climbing expedition."
Authorities assumed that everyone in the expedition died including Ian and his wife.
"But somehow, he survived."
"Jack, he's not a monster."
He's a very damaged individual.
He attacked one of the Nepalis.
We're tracking him.
"Where are you now, Mae?"
"Uh, we are at the base of the avalanche, where his wife was killed."
♪♪
He's been here.
About a kilometer that way.
"Stick tight, Mae."
We're on our way.
♪♪
These might be the worst sounds ever made in this room.
It's not what it looks like.
"Yes, it is!"
This is exactly what it looks like.
Mason and I love each other.
"Nope, not buying it."
Mason's totally out of your league.
What are you guys talking about?
But you're going to tease me.
"No, we're adults."
I'm not going to tease you.
Okay.
[sighs]
I like Emma.
[mocking]:
Ooh!
So you like Emma.
"That's big, weird news."
"I would use it to my advantage, but you already do everything I ask without question."
"Well, it wasn't news to me."
I know everyone's secrets.
I was head bitch on my high school cheerleading squad.
"Huh, you know nothing about me."
Calf implants.
"I just, uh..."
looked at the brochure.
"Yes, Jack, I like Emma, but don't worry."
I have a foolproof plan to win her over.
"Unless it involves some kind of enchanted amulet,"
I find that hard to believe.
Boom!
Behold.
This is probably just a somewhat hilarious misunderstanding.
- Yes!
- This isn't what's important.
What's important right now is that we have to go to the old schoolhouse before it's too late.
"[ pigeon cooing ] Well, I can't really tell you how you got that rash if I don't have more information."
"It was about two weeks ago and my old college buddy was in town, and..."
Oh!
"OK, OK."
- I don't want to hear that.
- All right.
"So guys, we're going to tear this place down now, or what?"
Oh!
No!
Go back to the rash.
"You were saying, ""two weeks ago... ""?"
"Yeah, my old college buddy, hadn't seen him in a while..."
"- No demolition today, boys."
- But why?
This is the future site of the new Mercy mosque.
Yes!
"You totally saved the day, Ann!"
Mayors!
[ A cell phone rings. ]
Oh!
Oh!
"Hey there, hot stuff!"
Oh!
Hang on.
"Rayyan, Amaar just got arrested for having a bomb."
Ha!
Ha!
Very funny.
- (TRING)
- It caused a train wreck!
What did?
"Tell me again, Mansley, and this time listen to yourself."
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
A giant metal monster.
(GENERAL LAUGHING)
"Please, sir."
I've got a feeling about this one.
"That's lovely, Kent."
But let me try to explain how this works.
"If you told me you'd found, say, a giant footprint,"
I might send over an expert to make a plaster cast of it.
Hell!
You get me a photograph of this thing and I could probably get some troops over there!
"But you tell me you've got a ""feeling""?"
"All right then, fine."
You want evidence?
I'll get you evidence.
"And when I do, I'm gonna wanna a memo distributed."
"- That sounds swell, Kent."
- (TELEVISION PLAYING)
I'm gonna want that memo carbon copied and redistributed... (DIAL TONE)

Hi.
Thanks for the use of your phone.
"Well, thank you for the use of your phone, Mrs..."
Hughes.
Annie Hughes.
"If Hayes gets wind of this, we could have a firefight on our hands."
Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation.
He seems like a reasonable man.
That'd be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the armory?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
They'll side with us.
But Hayes posted two MACO there.
Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
Hold it.
Sorry.
That's going to leave a bruise.
All right.
Here with me.
We won't get to the bridge this way.
Captain!
"Captain, it's Trip!"
You shouldn't have weapons in here.
Go ahead.
"Major, Corporal Chang's been found unconscious in T'Pol's quarters."
Where's T'Pol?
"Not here, sir."
Hayes to the Armory.
"Armory, respond."
Stand down!
"You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?"
Tell them to stand down.
The captain relieved you of duty.
That's great.
What are you going to do... break every lamp in the house?
No.
Take the bulbs out.
You need some light?
You creep.
- Just lay down!
- No!
Listen to me!
"You want to be raped... strangled, and drowned in a bath of your own blood?"
If you want to keep your ass alive... you're gonna have to help me.
You better be strong.
Strong like you?
Let go!
Don't test me.
Why did you come here?
You better get some sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
I got to go.
"Someday that dam you built's going to break, detective."
What you got there?
Soap.
It's from the hospital.
"Surgical, antibacterial."
"She saw him there last night, right?"
She smells the same weird soap.
So you're going to bring her in... for a detergical lineup... like some kind of goddamn commercial?
What the hell are you doing?
Anyone at the Byzantine churches recognize the drawing?
"Hallstrom, Crowe's on 501."
Joe.
Hallstrom.
I will have to do something.
"- No, brother."
We have lost everything.
AII we have got is you.
"If anything happens to you, then where will we go?"
With whose support will we live?
"Sometimes I feel, you all have the same.."
..mother but you and your brothers are so different!
This is the difference between family and strangers.
Some family members become strangers..
..and some strangers become ourfamiIy.
Like our Krishna.
Wonder where he will be.
What must he be doing?
You all are looking for me and I..
..I was waiting for you all over here.
Is it so?
"Keep this in your pocket, Peter."
Now I will open this lock only after..
Take this.
Hey.. hey what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey..
No!
-Who is it?
Who is it?
Oh!
Brother..
"I beg of you, I appeal to you.."
..if you want I can even take you to a doctor.
But I swear you should stop having these dreams.
- What are you doing?
I got a 12-year-old with hypothermia.
I gotta warm him up.
- I'm doing my best.
What's our ETA?
- About three minutes.
"Seeing a rescue in action, live from Chopper Five."
Stay with us as Dr. Doug Ross struggles to save the life of this child.
What are you doing?
How's he doing?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
"Malik, we need heated saline IVs."
Warm up half a dozen to 106 degrees.
"Wendy, get heated blankets and a mattress."
"Jerry, tell Benton we may need him down here."
- Heated peritoneal lavage?
"- Yeah, that's right."
"Come on, let's go!"
Can you warm him up now?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
- Why's the monitor doing that?
- He's got runs of abnormal heartbeats.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stabilize his rhythm.
Come on.
He's in V-fib!
- Come on.
"- What are those paddles for, Dr. Ross?"
Stabilize his beat.
They didn 't charge the battery!
"- Oh, my God."
- God!
- Major?
"- Yes, sir."
Is that General Kemper there bearing toward us?
"I believe it to be, sir."
General Kemper.
I do hope you are not seriously injured.
"They tell me that it's mortal, General."
I do pray God that it is not the case.
Is there anything I can do?
There's nothing more you can do for me.
"But, General Lee, will you see to it that full justice is done for my men who made this charge today?"
"I will do so, sir."
"Thank you, General."
"Thank you, General."
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
I thought we were invincible.
Friends.
It is all my fault.
Hear me.
"Hear me, I pray you."
It is entirely my fault.
Hear me.
Hear me.
"Please, friends."
We must rest now.
We must retire and fight again another day.
And there will be another day.
"Meanwhile, friends, we must show good order."
Never let them see you run.
Do you hear me?
Never let them see you run.
Why so wound up?
Are you a first timer?
"2,000 rupees for each of you!"
"That's the rate, take it or leave it!"
The little fucker wants to play posh!
Drag him in boys!
Get in you faggot spreading filth on the streets!
Give the money first.
The motherfucker thinks he is prime piece of ass!
Let go of me!
Don't worry about the three of us you won't get past even one!
Open the door!
Let me out!
Stop the car!
Let me go!
What happened?
Come here...
Mukesh!
What happened?
Show!
"Look, I don't know what's going on with you but whatever it is, get out of it."
Forget the past... start afresh.
"Johnny, I won't give up what is rightfully mine."
Have you lost your mind!
What do you want?
I am not here for you...
My work has been stopped.
Your work?
I told your friend about it...
go ask him.
Who stopped it?
- What do you think?
He handicapped or something?
We believe he's of Korean descent.
My God.
North Korea and al-Qaeda workin' together.
This is bigger than I thought.
You couldn't wait?
You couldn't fucking wait?
We were about to have all the legal weed we wanted.
"You know, in Amsterdam, where we were going!"
"Thought you could get away with this, huh?"
"You thought that after 9/11 our national security was a joke, huh?"
Well... guess what?
What?
We knew you fuckers would be back.
- Holy shit!
"- But we're Americans, man."
- We love America.
We love America!
- Very much.
That's a convenient thing to say... after you try and blow up a plane filled with Americans!
- No.
"- No, we didn't do--"
"No, you see, you have the wrong idea."
My idiot friend here brought marijuana...
- on the plane.
"- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Zip it, Hello Kitty."
OK?
I know your operation's funded through drugs.
No.
"This is typical government bullshit, sir. l--"
"- Hey, hey, hey."
What's with your attitude?
You don't think I was worried as well?
What are you doing?
I'll take a taxi.
Why?
Hurry and get in.
I'll be more comfortable in a taxi.
You should go first.
You're trying to avoid me nagging.
Yes.
"Fine, do as you like."
Stop it!
Hurry!
"Listen, just listen, all right?"
All right.
Take a deep breath.
As deep a breath as you can take.
You're so mean.
This is why you woke me up?
"I was right, wasn't I?"
There's no one here.
I was really curious how it would be like under water.
You're such a pervert.
We...
We what?
How will we be living in five years?
How will it be in ten years?
How will our feelings have changed?
What kind of person will you remember me as?
And when will I be able to let you go?
Will I be able to let you go?
"In five years, you'll probably be a father."
Hey!
Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?
Fuck you!
You left it in my tip jar the other night.
Bullshit.
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
I...
"- Cut the crap, Stevie."
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They say that the guy in the photo doesn't exist.
This says he does.
"Trevor, Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about."
I'm talking about your ex!
Ivan.
- Who?
This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.
"Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you."
You're standing next to some fat guy with glasses holding a fish.
That's not me.
"Trevor, it's you."
Look.
You lying whore.
You get the fuck out.
Fucking freak.
You play that fucking well!
You fucking whore!
You fucking freak.
Now I know why you're afraid of doctors.
'Cause you're a fucking psycho!
My ex...
Fucking psycho.
- You mean the Veterinarian man?
"- Yeah, that guy."
I don't get it.
He sleeps with his patients.
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff
Why is that funny?
Back home we've puppy dogs and kitty cats.
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it partner, there are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share."
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.
"- I got a good one for you, Violet."
- Lay it on me!
"Oh, damn!"
- What?
- I think I forgot it.
"Well that's the good thing, Daze."
I'll be here if it comes back to you
"Ten, Nine, Eight."
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinkin' that, since how you're 18 and all and you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meals, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
- Don't you say a word against Norman.
If you'd brought him up with intelligence...
He has no interest in girls.
He never had.
He never learned a thing about sex in my house.
It was never mentioned.
"- Hello, Mrs. Page."
- Come in here.
- Where's Norman?
"- Outside, just going home."
- Stay right here.
- What's the matter?
Norman!
Come in here.
"What is it, Ma?"
- Where were you today?
"- What is it, Mother?"
You were seen swimming in the nude with Norman.
- That's a lie!
- How could you even think that?
You were seen clearly by two people.
"We went swimming, but we had our suits on."
"And by now, everybody in Peyton Place knows about it."
If anything is wrong with her...
"We didn't do anything, did we, Allison?"
- No.
- You better take your boy and go.
We didn't do anything.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
Keep this up and I'll do what you accuse me of!
Oh...
"Yes, super-gross."
Jack is a monster.
Jack should just crawl under a bus and die!
You better clear things up without hurting her.
Amy is my oldest friend.
[whispers]:
She's 30!
[whispers]:
She's actually 32.
Secrets.
"Welp, better go end things with Amy."
This is not easy.
Is something I'll probably say to her.
See you in half a minute.
[scolding]
"- Remember, okay, you work with Amy."
- Uh huh.
"In the same building, every day?"
- Great.
- Jack!
Focus!
"Come on, she's not some Carnaval trollop you can hit and quit in Rio."
"You work with Amy, okay?"
"So you better get out of this gracefully, or your life will be hell."
Okay.

"Carol, when you lifted the ban on office dating, you really pooped the bed."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Gordon, but getting rid of that policy was the best move I've ever made for this office."
Are there glasses?
- But of course.
Everything's supplied.
"- Oh, dear."
- What?
"Well, I was just thinking of Mother."
"This afternoon, she tried to tell me what happens on a wedding night."
She's a bit late.
What did you say?
"I said she was a bit late, didn't I?"
Henry?
Mr Faber?
What are you doing?
It's all right.
It's... just for the station.
Classified work regarding the trains.
I shouldn't really be telling you.
"- Please, listen to me."
- No.
Trust me.
- You're a spy.
- Stop struggling.
"Listen to me, please."
"Last night, the Luftwaffe's main target was again London."
Considerable damage was done to residential and industrial areas...
"David, be careful."
You're not in your Spitfire yet.
"Dearly beloved brethren, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."
He gives us the sheep and we... give him back the bones.
"Lucy, I think I've offended your mother again."
"I'm right here, David."
You may address me directly.
"No, Sonny."
Let her go.
"Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet."
"Don't do this, Sonny."
I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.
"Please proceed to the elevator, detective."
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.
Go!
Go!
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.
"Kill her, the way you were going to kill me."
"Sonny, get the nanites."
"Yes, doctor."
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.
That's V.I.K.I.
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
They'll infect her entire system.
Spooner!
What is it with you people and heights?
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.
"Oh, this is poor building planning."
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?
Yes.
But it just seems too heartless.
"Okay, we're good."
- Not one stinking customer.
"We had some really great times living at the old Newman Home, until we got pro contracts and our mom made us move back in with her."
Here's the thing.
"We've got a plan to save our home, but we need a sponsor."
And who better than three glorious hockey heroes from Charlestown's past?
- Good idea.
- Smart kid.
Who were you thinking of?
You guys.
- You'd sponsor us?
- I don't know.
Hockey's pretty violent.
We gave that up with the bar fights and the gambling.
Not our path.
"Look, it'd be great advertising."
"We'll be travelling all over the state, playing a new style of hockey."
Just think.
Zenovation on ice.
"Come on get it, boys."
Here you are.
Look at the pads!
- Here we go.
- All right.
You get one of these.
"There you go, guys."
There you go.
Goalie!
Goalie!
Good save.
Nice catch.
"Hey, my name isn't goalie, you know."
It's Henri.
"- Me, too."
- Good!
So that's the end of it.
"A few weeks ago, the beast was circling the village."
Farm animals and pets were going missing.
I tracked it to this area.
It's between two farms.
Prime hunting ground.
Good job.
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah.
See that tree over there?
Yeah.
Go and stand under it and leave me alone.
- What?
- Just trying to imagine what you were like when you were my age.
You must have worn a lot of black.
Here.
Don't break anything.
"So, what's the deal with you and Kyle?"
"He needed someone to put him on camera,"
I needed an extra-ordinary graduation film to kick-start my career.
We sort of found each other.
- So you two are...?
- For a bit.
Then Kyle...
"Well, I mean he decided that work was..."
"Great, let's share life stories while my camera battery drains."
"Kyle, your public's waiting."
"So, Kyle, tell us what's going on."
This is Shannon Kelly.
Hi.
The kind he always gets from the office.
Okay.
"I'll be right back, okay?"
Why is the door locked?
Sorry.
Reflex.
Hey.
That was the man who shot Haskell.
- Who was?
- The messenger who was just here.
- What'd he bring you?
"- You're joking, right?"
No.
It was him.
That was his helmet and his jacket.
"I'm sorry, I'm not following."
Ils there a reason an assassin would be delivering packages to me at home?
"He was here, so you tell me."
"III will take this as some kind of a reaction to the trauma of what you saw, and I will ask you..."
Did you see the man's face at the shooting?
No.
- Did you see it today?
"- No, he was wearing a helmet."
Was there something distinctive about that helmet or that jacket which tells you it was the same man?
No.
There wasn't.
"Okay, then."
Do you feel better?
Yeah.
"So, what was the delivery?"
"From the office, some files."
Why?
"I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader."
Get them all out of here.
"Come on, get out of here."
On your feet.
Hold them there.
"Naik, detail eight men for escort duty."
Bring them here on the double.
"Listen, you."
What became of Burgess sahib?
"- Come on, spit it out."
"- He can speak, but he won't."
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
"You never saw one of these things before, did you?"
"It's for growing daisies, isn't it?"
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
"- No, sahib."
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No.
Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
"By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling."
Never mind the second chorus.
Come on.
"Party, form a square!"
"Under cover, everybody!"
Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
Calvin.
"-Well, not precisely a man."
"Hello, detective."
How is your investigation coming?
-I thought you were dead.
"-Technically, I was never alive."
But I appreciate your concern.
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
"Basically, I fried an empty shell."
-I couldn't destroy him.
He was too--
-Unique.
It just didn't feel right.
You and your feelings.
"They just run you, don't they?"
"Two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps, detective."
"Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit to yourself."
No guards.
The override is disabled.
Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
He wasn't controlling them at all.
"Oh, my God."
"You were right, doc."
I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.
Who else had access to the uplink?
Who could manipulate the robots?
Use USR systems to make Lanning's life a prison?
Poor old man.
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.
So he had to lay down a plan.
"Don't worry your pretty, little head about that."
Pretty?
"While Hayley and I distract Austin, you need to look for this."
It's a false wall.
A secret room.
That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.
Exactly.
"Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer,"
I get equal credit.
No double-crosses.
Deal.
"That way, Mason Wood has to make both of us members of the society."
Let's go.
Hold on.
Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.
- No.
Deciding between something I brought and something that Rick's about to buy me.
I think I know the direction you'll be leaning in.
Oh.
You really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.
Austin:
Wow.
"Come in, come in."
Let's get some drinks in you.
Ooh.
Here you go.
Ooh.
A little something to loosen your inhibitions.
"Oh, don't worry."
We're plenty loose already.
Not after I've tied you up.
What is it that you want to ask?
"You see, I think Changwook and I both want you."
"If you happen to like both of us, who would you choose?"
"You see, this situation is making us awkward."
I think it would help if things are set clear.
So who's your pick?
"I like you better, Joongrae."
I understand.
Thanks.
You should get back.
How long did you stay in Germany?
Quite a long time.
You must be fluent in German.
Just enough to get by.
She's good.
Very good.
- Were there Koreans there?
- Not really.
"It was a small tourist city, so I saw some Korean travelers."
- What are people like there?
- A bit boring.
But they are honest.
Very much so.
They express their feelings as they are.
They seem more laid back than people here.
Have you dated foreigners?
"- Men, I mean."
"- Ah, men."
Do you really want to know?
"- Well, I think..."
"- No, don't say it."
I don't care what you did there.
Congratulations.
I though this was what you always wanted.
"To get back to Norway, get out into the field again."
If you's rather stay here just until the end of hostilities then go and see your wife and children.
It's no problem.
I can...
Of course not.
The war is not over yet.
"- Thank you, Sir."
- Good man.
"- Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get a fish this colour in Norway.
- No we don't.
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss most about Norway?
The horizons.
- Whereever you look.
- Yeah.
It's been awhile.
You must come and visit.
Our house is big.
It would be awkward.
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good birdwatchers.
Certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have the war.
Yes.
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow.
Get that?
!
One of us!
"I don't get it. I'm stupid to get it Mr. Writer, sir."
"I say be an ordinary plumber, but you, you're a raving lunatic!"
That woman is deadly!
"Three husbands, three dead bodies!"
"One of us will be the fourth, can't you see that?"
Deadly?
You just want to scare me so I'll split!
So you'll have Chrissy for yourself and all her money!
Forget it!
"You can't rattle this boy, this boy's staying with Chrissy!"
- You stay and you're dead!
- Bullshit!
One of us will croak!
Scram!
Fine!
I'll read the headlines about your death!
Raving lunatic!
- Get in!
- No!
I'm leaving for Amsterdam!
Get in and I'll take you to the station.
Just don't take me anywhere near that woman.
Okay.
She's mine then.
- Can't you pass them?
- Grouch!
"You're driving beside your own funeral, Herman."
Watoh out!
"First him, doctor, first look at him."
"Yes, of course."
"You know, it's funny what a difference the flip of a coin will make."
"If you hadn't lost that silver dollar that night, i would've had fleurique, and you would've had josie."
"Oh, sergeant!"
"Yes, sir."
That cherry hill gang are coming over here looking for a scrap.
Cherry hill?
Yeah.
My bowery boys will be glad to hear that.
Ahem!
"Sorry, sir."
There must be some way we can give these bullies a party without getting our uniforms all torn up.
"Anyway, place a sentry around the ferry dock."
Have them give us a signal.
"Yes, sir."
"Here they come, colonel."
Keep that music going.
You all know what do do.
And remember... no knives or guns.
"Only clubs and iron bars for cherry hill, sir."
"Come on, uncle daniel, up you get."
Come on.
Up you go.
Come on.
Turn her on!
You want mr.
Daniel drew?
Yeah!
Come up and get him!
Cease firing!
Hooray!
"That'll get 'em, huh?"
You'll be OK.

[Woman] Washed up from a shipwreck.
"Oh, the poor thing."
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
- [Woman hums] - [Gasps]
I'll just...
I'll just get this washed for you.
"[Gasps, splutters]"
"Well, you must have at least heard about this girl."
- No!
- Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
[Burps]
- Really.
"- Madam, please..."
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
"If Eric's looking for a girl,"
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.
[Gasps]
[Knife glistens]
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion...
"I'm tellin' ya, Grim."
She was real.
"I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her."
"[Woman laughs] Come on, honey."
Don't be shy.
"Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?"
"Uh, you look wonderful."
"Just where on this island is the treasure supposed to be, anyway?"
.
It says right here on the map.
"It was an entire 50 zeny, so search properly."
Who would believe such a cruddy map?
The same goes for that boat.
"Thanks to you skimping out, the engine broke."
"Now we can't even get back to the port, can we?"
.
How could you?
.
Am I going to die here...?
Just stop complaining and get searching for the treasure.
I'm so hungry...
I want some dinner pancakes...
"And if I can't even catch one small fry, are you telling me that even the fish are disrespecting King Pilaf?"
.
Aren't they great?
Mum's been collecting them specifically for today.
The seven Dragon Balls are all together...
And they're headed this way.
N-No way...
It couldn't be.
Our luck has finally started to turn.
Pilaf-sama.
You've hooked some food.
Here goes.
The Dragon Radar....
S-Stop.
Our dinner....
Oww...
Who cares about such cheap crap?
- Mmm-hmm.
Randy?
"Psychologically, we need to connect with somebody."
- Could be.
Jill.
Because we're culturally preconditioned?
"Good answers, but too intellectual for me."
"I think it's because, as some of you already may know, while it does last, it feels fucking great."
That's why.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"I'm halfway through my meal, and you haven't even started yet."
The perfect bite.
Mmm.
You need a therapist.
"Rose, do we have to have the television on?"
Can't we have a civilized conversation?
I know I'm not as intellectually stimulating as some of you university people...
"Okay, I'm sorry."
"How was your day, Mother?"
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry.
Let's talk.
I've lived too long.
"I should be dead, not having conversations."
"You stop it, please."
Give me that!
Talk to me already!
All right.
You haven't even noticed I had my hair done differently.
"Yeah, I thought you looked different."
It looks great.
No one hikes around here.
- Phillip.
- No.
Don't worry.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"Open up the back for me, please."
Sure.
"Heel, bud."
Jesus.
That smell is worse than the shit it covers up.
Have a good night.
You too.
Good boy.
We're S.E.A.L.S.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
"If you had taught him how to load that thing, there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge."
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We'd all be dead...
Five minutes.
"Shooters, you're gonna get a magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds."
A magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds.
All ready on the firing line!
All ready on the firing line!
"Shooters, make ready!"
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Unload!
- I think you're reaching because you don't want your sister's murderer slipping through your grasp.
"Which I totally get, by the way."
"I feel you, bro."
But our hands are well and truly tied here.
Where and when are we handing him over to the Feds?
We're still waiting for the final instructions from Quantico.
- Sometime in the next 24 hours.
- This has the cartel all over it.
- He's not wrong to think like that.
- No.
"No, he's not."
"Okay, I'm gonna ask this once and only once."
"Has anyone in this room, at any time, for whatever reason, told anyone else about our incarceration of Carlos Mejia?"
[Tense music]
♪
[Sighs]
♪
[Pounding]
♪
- Oh.
Whoa.
- Come in.
"Sorry, I was at a client breakfast."
I came as quickly as I could.
What's up?
- [Sighs]
- What is it?
Did you tell anyone about Carlos Mejia?
- Excuse me?
"- Please, I don't have the time."
- I just need to know...
- Tell anyone what
"For God's sake, let me kill them!"
Let go of me.
Don't go there!
Come back here.
It's high tide.
You'll be caught in the seaweed.
You'll be killed.
You crazy?
Don't go to the ruins.
Come back!
They were in the marshes.
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.
- I'll look after them.
- All right.
You knew the risk you were taking bringing them here.
It's too late now.
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.
I know you are there!
You saw them!
They can set you free if they wish.
But you're the one who has to wait!
They have to come of their own free will.
I've seen how pure they are.
How innocent they are!
"I won't intervene, but I beg you to spare them!"
So be it.
Let destiny be fulfilled!
"Don't you want to play, Madame Louise?"
Last night ended in tragedy.

"Good night, Mr. Rossi."
Doc Swain offers a special price for frostbites.
"- Come on, Allison."
- Rodney.
Allison!
This was supposed to be a birthday party.
"Just playing ""photography"":"
"Turn off the lights, see what develops."
Don't be fresh.
Just leave immediately.
- All of you!
- I just caught her under the mistletoe.
Will you please leave?
"Happy birthday, Allison."
"Come on, Betty."
I'm sorry.
Thanks anyway.
"Thanks, Allison."
Come out here.
"Allison, I said come out here."
I knew this would happen if you invited Betty.
- Wasn't her fault.
- And you making love...
"We were kissing, one kiss, not making love."
"The house in darkness, and couples necking all over."
"I know, but everyone wanted to dance in the dark."
And I couldn't very well... .
"Mother, at every party in this town, they turn out the lights."
I don't want you to be like everybody.
I want you to rise above Peyton Place.
"It's my home, my town."
"Sinaté, I'm preparing a little trip."
"Hey, you, what about your papers?"
I don't have any.
"Hey, get up!"
Come on!
"You, there!"
Get up!
Your ID?
"The guy asked him for a ""hit""."
"As the baker didn't understand, the Sarakollé showed him a loaf of bread..."
Then the baker and his wife started to laugh.
That's funny!
"Our Sarakollé fathers... in Europe, make fun of white people..."
Really funny!
Leave that!
What have I done now?
You're provoking me!
"Come on, M'Batoma, let's go to the room."
Founé!
See the children off to bed!
Is this your little girl?
Time to go to bed.
"Excuse me, Balla... it's better to be alone."
Women are indiscreet.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
"After returning from Europe, my husband won't let me work."
What about your degrees?
Young men are jealous.
In a week you'll have your car.
I'll go and see Bathily for your coverage.
You'll have all the privileges of your rank.
I have some friends here too.
Look.
"See that man over there, standing next to Matt by the float?"
His name's Frank.
He's very handsome.
And he's also quite handy.
"And he noticed that the axle is kind of rusted, which is very dangerous."
So all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure and...
No!
[MATT YELLING]
"- Hey, pick this trailer up!"
"Guys, lift it!"
- Give me a hand.
MAN:
"Dude, come on."
"- Come on, lift."
[MATT GRUNTING]
MAN:
Come on!
"- Caroline, call an ambulance."
- Okay.
Why are you doing this?
I'm showing you how easy it is to hurt people.
You're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
- Hand it over and the fun will stop.
- Damon's not gonna give it to me.
And I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you.
He'll kill you before he gives it up.
"Is that before or after I kill your brother, Jeremy?"
ELENA:
Jeremy?
Jeremy!
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"We don't even have to look either, because we're never gonna miss it that distance."
"It's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
- You think so?
- Totally.
Cool.
- Don't aim too high.
- Why not?
We don't want to that little bird.
"Oh, yea... good thinkin'."
Are you ready?
- Ready.
- Let's do it.
Who wants a snack?
Be careful they're hot.
Uhm... no thank you.
- Don't you like cookies?
"- Yeah, but..."
I feel kind of bad now.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are those oatmeal?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in this?"
Why are you looking at us funny?
"No, no, no..."
It just that you girls aren't what I expect it.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you have any milk?
"I hate to interrupt or anything, but... don't you think you girls are better be load?"
Alright.
What do you got to drink around here?
You don't have much time.
Soon they will come to harm you.
And I will not be able to stop them.
Unless you are able to give me something to placate them.
Some... piece of information...
Which I can use to protect you from them.
I already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperon.
"Steadily, steadily."
"Down, down, carefully..."
You're all right Indy?
"Gently boys, gently, gently!"
I told you it would be all right!
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
Oups!
What is this stuff René?
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
"Well, I have to be going now René."
I like you René.
Very much.
Perhaps we meet someday under better circumstances.
We meet again freulin.
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now...
You must be very happy.
Instead...
Why are you upset like this about this random girl?
"I know, my fault."
Sorry.
"Now, please smile for me."
I'm telling you again...
Sadhana is deeply in love with you.
When you were hospitalised...
I know.
I will talk to her.
What I meant is...
More than the one we love...
The one whom we love...
The one who loves us...
"No, no..."
It's okay.
"Leave it, mom."
I get the point.
"Have a seat, Sadhana."
Will you like to have anything?
Don't suddenly flip into a totally different person.
Be normal.
Only that suits you.
Okay.
I have to tell you the truth.
"Since you were coming, I didn't even use room freshener."
Okay.
Let me get to the point.
"If you still love her, I totally understand."
Don't take any decision just because your parents are forcing you.
You don't have to tell me 'you like me' just because someone is asking you to.
"He suffers a little from being too arrogant, both in his writing and as a person."
Oh.
Match made in heaven.
I don't know if I can continue to accommodate you here.
Why is that?
Because you're a pain in the ass.
I have to go to the city today.
What for?
See my agent.
- Henry?
- Henry?
No.
Henry's not been with me for 10 years.
Why not?
Because he's a cocksucker and a little piece of shit.
"Oh, fuck!"
"Jesus, God Almighty."
Fucking thing.
Look at this.
Is this a meeting about something new?
Hmm?
"Well, potentially."
It's complicated.
We're hoping for some money from a sale of movie rights.
Is that woman still your editor?
No.
She's an asshole with no loyalty as well.
- What about...
- Are you here only to put me on the spot?
None of this is worth revisiting to me.
I've been betrayed by a lot of small-minded and worthless people.
Do I need them to accomplish anything?
"She is an attorney S. Mazerat, Sophie and she slept with him."
Counterterrorism has his record?
To call them?
-Absolutely not!
Not a word.
Tomorrow we will try and arrest Shack know that it is connected with Riffautom.
"Not a word, especially not Hervilleu."
Thomas Riffaut is ours.
Laura!
That fucking asshole Sophie Mazerat!
See you tomorrow!
-Until tomorrow!
Do you have any plans?
Are you for dinner?
"Gilo, hold me!"
Drop me to Vincent!
"Let go, you do not create problems."
"Just want to hurt you, huh?"
You're in bed?
-I waited.
"I wanted to call you, but I eventually escorted Gilo."
"I go into the shower, I corpse."

Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
"Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash."
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"

Operator.
That wasn't the right code.
What?
What I just called in.
It wasn't the right code.
Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.
What?
Fuck!
They got to the emergency phones.
Just let me think.
"No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?"
"No, they don't."
"-There has to be a safety measure, right?"
-No.
-Something or someone?
-There's nothing.
Someone who cancels the broadcast when something like this happens.
There's no one.
"There has to be some kind of back-up, like an emergency back-up..."
Something like this doesn't happen.
"Seventy years, the code's never been breached."
Somebody has to be out there who can...
"Katherine, there's nothing but the goddamn numbers!"
(PHONE ringing)
"If we do ourjob, we get out of here alive."
I promise.
-OPERATOR:
"You kill her for me, I let you live."
-(sighs)
No.
We've gone to a lot of trouble here with these broadcasts.
On the contrary.
Come with me.
We will take the air in the garden.
I'm taking care of her.
We woke up painful memories to you.
You are very alone in this house.
Don't you have relatives?
No.
Friends?
"I'm here, now."
I am very careful.
Attentive to your eyes.
My eyes?
"Yes, they are so young, so clear."
"And yet, I guess all they have seen recently that they should not have seen."
Smile at me.
I am convinced you will soon find your brother.
Believe me.
"What can I say, Sir?"
Your words are helping me in an unexpected way.
Probably you already suffered greatly in your own flesh.
The suffering of others can not but interest a man like me.
Your dedication affects me greatly.
"It is limitless, know it."
"Nanteuil, we will take our leave."
"Don't bother to lead us out, Miss."
We'll let you know soon.
"Goodbye, sir."
Goodbye.
Count on me.
And good luck.
He is ...well...
"No image, no arrests, no Internet profile."
- No way to see what he looks like.
- So I could go undercover as him.
"- Could be pretty risky, Bos."
- But worth it.
This is more than just a gambling ring.
I can tell you he's scheduled for some casino time after his 8:00 massage.
Looks like one of us is gonna have to rub down a bad guy.
Good idea.
Massage?
No.
No.
Don't look at me.
I'm the cruise director.
I've already given up my cover.
I'm a dude.
You guys suck.
That's nice.
"Just a little higher up the thigh, honey."
There we go.
"Just a little higher, babe."
"There it is, sweet cheeks."
Why don't you just relax and enjoy the pressure points?
How's about you shut up and give me the happy ending?
Okay.
I'll give you a happy ending.
Once upon a time...
The end.
Bingo.
- You're back.
- I am.
I felt a little underdressed.
You're spending millions on him.
- Cunning!
He's using Jai
Jai knows where he's headed.

What do you want to do with your life?
What I want to do?
I want to beat you

- Don't get sentimental
Who can beat you?
"My loan, please."

You won't marry me without a dowry?
Goodness!
Help me... someone help
What's going on?
- Let's take a look
She's the one who fooled Om
"Watch, I'll give her a taste of fun!"
Right at the wedding altar!
How dare you ask for dowry?
"What happened, lady?"
I had To run away from my wedding
My fiance's father is greedy!
"At the eleventh hour, he demanded a million from my father!"
"No, only 800,000 800,000...?"

"And the sad part is, he kept mum"
"Don't cry, come with me."
Oh no... no...
Come with me.
- I am listening.
"We are after talented musicians at schools, especially after Candan..."
- Ercetin's popularity.
- Yes.
And we have come across your thing your name.
"You are very kind, Mr. Ceyhan."
"Of course, we can meet."
Is it necessary to meet today?
"Well, right away if possible."
The studio is free at the moment.
We could do some recording...
My partners are here too.
"So, we could sign a contract too."
"Well, if you say today is necessary."
I am listening to you.
Then ...
let me give you the address.
"Okay, I am writing it down."
"It's IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek, Bemol Records, Cevat Ceyhan."
Which bazaar did you say?
"Ma'am, it's the IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek."
"There aren't any mistakes with the address, right?"
Of course not.
What kind of a mistake can there be?
"Alright, sir."
"So, that's your place."
Come on.
We are waiting for you.

The first time those items appeared round here was last January.
"We got together at a Christmas do, I semi-moved in the next month."
"So, where do you sleep every Tuesday night and alternate weekend?"
I kept my place on.
Expensive.
I want to keep my independence.
Really?
Is that true?
"I'm sorry, I really do need to get back."
Will you tell him that we met?
Will you?
Are you kidding?
It'd freak him out.
"Best both keep quiet, then."
Pretend like this never happened.
I like that plan.
"Oh, do me one favour?"
Anything.
Change those sheets.
What do you think about having them over?
Who?
The neighbours.
We could make it a thing.
"Drinks, nibbles."
Do we have to?
I think we should get to know them better.
Find out what they're really like.
"Morning, Mr Sellers."
"Good morning, Michael."
We're having everyone over ours Friday evening.
A few glasses of wine.
This is the best you could come up with?
This shit?
This is shit.
Read the deposition of the LaVamere lady.
She was putting on a sex show.
- How long did this go on for?
- It was hours.
- How many hours?
- Three or four.
Which one?
Three or four?
"Three, I guess."
"In her defense, she was drunk."
"To be honest, once she finished fucking and sucking those two assholes... she was carried into another room, and boys were going in and out of there... but I don't know if she was fucking them."
"When she came out, she was covered in cum."
It was awful.
"Excuse me, Counselor."
"I, um..."
- May I?
- Of course.
"Just to clarify, why exactly was Mrs. Laine Hanson..."
Strike that.
"Laine Billings involved in this, uh... appalling and disgusting behavior?"
- That's...
That's what's important.
- Exactly.
Thank you.
It's great to see you guys.
There you go.
Thank you so much for your support.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Doesn't chemistry mean anything?
"Try to understand, please."
- Relax!
- I'll kill her.
Move...
Move...
Stay there.
I swear I'm going to kill her.
"What have you done, Shiv?"
He will kill you.
"Wait, did you kidnap me or did I kidnap you?"
I don't understand.
- Oh my!
- What happened?
Uncle and auntie.
- What?
"- Hello, uncle."
"I seek your blessings, aunty."
How are you doing?
Did you see what she was about to do?
"Ultimately, I had to explain it to her that she cannot marry him."
"And auntie, after using my body, how could she..."
"Don't be stupid, Shiv."
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Just a second, aunty."
You didn't jump into the pool but you jumped into the sea!
You know you are the first heroine..
..to go and plank herself in the villain's den?
And I am looking for you like a hero turned monkey...
And that b**tard is coming after my tail with a match in his hand.
Shiv...
Ladies!
"Ladies, is everything all right?"
Roshanna--
Thanks.
Thanks--
Wha--

I can see that.
"Yes, Iyah."
"I'm here to help, remember."
Help...
"Alright, alright..."
See ounu?
Later Dunston.
So what you been telling your brother about me?
That's it?
"Nothin' about how much you think about me morning, noon and night."
You got a beautiful smile.

You think Usian Bolt is Jamaica's only natural wonder!

"Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to--"
YOU are going to decide the winner of the

It comes down to the two finalists.
"Okay, hold fast there."
All stop.
"Well, that's kind of weird."
"What did you find down there, Tony?"
"These, right here on these rocks here..."
Geez.
Rick?
"-I've got, um... what could be a triangle."
"It's got a line across the bottom, pointing straight up at you from here."
It's got some little pattern in the middle.
"- You got that light, Nick?"
"- All right, here you go."
This thing's amazing.
"Some20miles from Oak Island, inthetownofNewRoss,  diver Tony Sampson hasjustfound a mysterious triangle carvedinside an old stone well."
Let's get a picture.
Let's get a real clear photograph of it.
"Itislocatedona property believed to have been inhabited by members oftheKnightsTemplar, more than five centuries ago."
"Whoa, beautiful."
"Okay, camera up, buddy."
There's something there.
"You don't put a mark on a stone, you know, halfway down a well."
why in a well?
"-Yeah, exactly."
Yeah.
-Right?
-TIM:
Right.
"Okay, Mike."
"Bring us up, buddy."
Up slow.
Wow.
"Rick, take a look at this."
I should've killed that bastard.
"- What are you going on about, Louise?"
"- It's only a song, Bosco."
A story about wreckers.
There are no wreckers nowadays.
It's just a song.
As long as it's just a song.
I don't want to hear your damn song!
It makes me sick!
Bloody hell!
There's a curse on this village.
The demons are free.
What did you see?
Tell me!
There were two ghosts.
They were staggering about.
"Pale and covered in blood, with crazed eyes."
- There were two women.
- Where did you see them?
"Over there, by the ship cemetery, near the haunted ruins."
"Come with me, you two."
Hurry
The devil has been set free!
God help us.
He has been imprisoned in the ruins for centuries.
Now he is free.
Misfortune is upon us!
I can sense that he's still in the ruins!
Maybe now his long wait will be over.
They're here.
We must drive them out.
They won't come out alive!
Linda Farrell.
- Why do you smell like dope?
- I've been with a patient.
- We're hooked up to Mount Sinai?
- Beating the crap out of them.
- What are you doing?
- Playing Doom II.
- How long does it take to play?
- Months.
I've done thoracotomies that were less bloody.
He doesn't understand the educational value.
"Die, bastard."
Die.
Come on!
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.
I knew you'd come.
"- Sweetie, of course we would."
- I want to go home.
Your daughter will be in the hospital at least several days.
Excuse me.
- Will both of you stay with me?
"- Of course, sweetheart."
"And, Daddy will you come back to live with us?"
- Well....
- We'll talk about that later.
How could you let her ride her bike in the rain?
- Don't blame me for this.
- Who else let her do it?
I'm doing the best I can.
If you spent more time with her and less at the office with Sarah--
The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
I think you should...
"Less talk, more action."
"Oh, this machine almost drives itself."
"Stay here, son."
"Come on, we have to find course for the dinosaur or we're useless."
"Cody, what did you do to our robots?"
"If you need them to do you want, you have to ask nicely."
"Cody, get off this channel."
It's for emergency responders only.
"Hide down, Kade."
Cody spotted the dinosaur first.
"For now, he's on the team."
Fine by me.
"Got any ideas, Cody?"
Not exactly.
But I know someone who will.
Hello.
Cody?
The Dinosaur Exhibit.
"Fine, now you're interested."
"How is that going, Graham?"
I'm almost there.
Just a little more to the right.
Preparing to lift the payload.
"Good to go, Dani."
You really think this will hold the tyrannosaur?
We'll find out.
"Keep him busy, Dad."
Dani is on her way.
"Now, how are we supposed to get that thing over here?"
Thought you'd never ask.
Incoming air support.
"Second, you're lookout only."
You're not goin' inside.
Can't he be lookout?
It's fine.
"Actually, yeah, can he be lookout?"
I'm not done.
"Last, you need to respect my leadership skills."
"I'm the leader, okay, and you need to treat me accordingly."
"You realize that real leaders don't tell others they have leadership skills, but you got-"
"- You sure about that, man?"
"I mean, this is my heist, right?"
This is just a robbery.
"Look, this is your heist, you're the leader and I respect your leadership skills."
"Too late, homie."
All right.
All right.
You can come along on the heist.
It's not a heist.
Thank you.
"Hey, all right."
"Yeah, okay."
Thank you.
Yeah.
It means a lot.
You guys hear me okay?
Yep.
Clear up here.
All right.
Be back in a minute.
"All right, guys, let me show you how the big boys do it."
I'm buyin' boobs.
What are you gonna get?
You should've called me yesterday.
Who the hell is this person you're meeting?
"Okay, can I ask you a favor then?"
Can I bring my girlfriend along?
- Girlfriend?
- Yes.
You want to take your girlfriend?
We were supposed to go on a date today.
"Sure, fine then."
Then I'll be right back.
"I'll go tidy things up a bit, and I need to call her."
"Alright, what time then?"
- How about two?
- Two?
"Okay, two then."
Hold on.
- Hello?
"- Director Kim, it's me."
- How are you?
"- Fine, of course."
Did you happen to read the paper this morning?
It said that a film director named Kim died in a car accident.
And so I called just in case.
I felt awful because of that.
So you're alright?
That was in the morning paper?
Interesting.
"- Anyhow, I wonder who it was."
"- Someone, I guess."
"- So, is the script almost done?"
"- Uh, well..."
"Actually, I was just taking off to somewhere quiet to work on it."

Yeah.
He was doing so well.
He said his last scan was clear.
I did a flawless job on that glioblastoma.
I can't help it if the damn thing had already spread.
The LFTs suggest metastasis to the liver.
God.
Never even got a chance to start the antiviral protocol.
I just wish I wouldn't have held out that hope.
He's gonna go fast.
"So, uh..."
Who's gonna tell him?
Oh.

It can't go on like this.
"If she hadn't crashed, she'd been gone anyway, so what's the diff?"
She might have come back?
"Well, we'll never know, will we?"
"So, spare me the pity party."
I am over it.
Morning.
Correct.
"So, that's it then?"
That's the story?
"Yeah, for now."
Because Big Mac doesn't want his family dirty laundry aired in public.
"Ah, no, because most of what people are saying is hearsay and we don't print hearsay, George."
But it just seems so...
Underwhelming?
Yes!
There is a life attached to that body.
"Well, not anymore, to be accurate."
"Which we are, George."
The facts.
"So, an unidentified woman..."
Which everyone knows is Trina!
She hasn't been formally identified yet.
"So, until then it is not a fact, it is gossip."
"We print news here, George."
News.
Siouxsie?
"Ah, Siouxsie, is Monty..."
"Right here, George."
"She's, er, processing her grief."
"Were her and Trina close, then?"
Not really.
Trina didn't really like kids.
Saeko-san loves chocolate more than anything else.
That's why I will make chocolate that can make Saeko-san happy.
Saeko-san.
I know everything that Saeko-san likes.
High cocoa chocolate.
Strawberries.
Caramel ganache.
Orange peel.
Rum soaked raisins.
Light green pistachios.
Bright red kirsch soaked cherries.
Ah.
Does this silence mean that she's touched?
"No, it was a miss?"
Souta-kun.
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I can't accept this.
- Eh?
Because this is totally serious chocolate.
Eh?
Ah.
Did you think I'm a really serious guy?
"A guy making chocolate is really weird, right?"
"But, you know, my family is a cake shop, so making this sort of thing is no big deal."
"So, see, there's no deep meaning to this or anything."
There's someone I'm going out with.
Huh?
"- After Christmas,"
I got back together with my ex-boyfriend.
"Since he likes to travel around, I'd been neglected,"
I thought it would be fine when Souta-kun confessed.
Then who...?
A shadow stealthily approaches Agwarda!
What are the secrets hidden in the lowest levels of Agwarda?

"But things are starting to heat up now, so it may be too risky to talk to her."
And that's why I need to do it.
"Now, as our true enemies draw nearer, we need her help."
All right...
Don't worry about what may happen.
Do what you need to do.

He predicted the downfall of the Edomites.
The Edomites were an arrogant people.
They thought they were better than everybody.
"They tried to destroy Obediah's people, but-- lt didn't work."
Obediah's people rose up.
Justice was served.
Anything you wanna tell me before we go to trial?
"No, sir."
This Obediah just wants his day in court.
"You tell a story like that, Josiah..."

So I'm just digging A long trench.
Through the gravel And the pebbles.
He needs to be Excruciatingly careful.
About the amount of time He spends down there.
He could really hurt himself At that depth.

Copy that.
Really?

"I'm seeing hardpan, Like I wanted."
But there's not even A speck of gold on it.

We in Ireland should not be in here.

What are you doing?
Shit.
"Sir, we have Black Hawks coming in."
Which direction?
"From I Street, and fast."
"How do you feel, Mr. President?"
"Surprisingly good, Dr. Cale."
"Let me call in, make sure they don't think we're dead."
"The former vice president, Alvin Hammond.."
is clearly calling the shots as the new commander in chief.
I have John Cale on the line.
Cale?
Where's Carol?
Finnerty's been relieved of command.
The cavalry's coming.
Should be hitting the residence in a few minutes.
"No, no, no, not by air."
They have to come by ground.
I think we can handle this.
They have Javelin missiles.
Not according to our intel.
"Even if we wanted to call them back, they've gone dark."
"If they fail, they're going to kill every single one of those hostages.."
including my daughter.
Just go.
Take this and stay out of sight.
Thirty seconds!
Let's go!
"Incoming, three of them!"
Spread out!
Castle in sight.
"I say again, Castle in sight."
Are you ready?
"When mom gives orders, you have to obey..."
"You are still in college, are they sick or what?"
Bankruptcy!
He's broke.
They can't afford to support both of us.
I fucked up your life as well.
Never mind.
I'll pay for that too.
You take care of yourself.
"Murat, I need your help."
I am pregnant...
I want this child but not marriage.
If we get to the point...
Sis?
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting centre... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply for an exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
What the hell is he doing?
Is he a waiter here?
What's wrong with him?
"Oh my goodness, what are you doing?"
Hey!
How many are in your family?
I have four.
"If you also have four, we're a perfect match."
You pervert!
"Dad, help me."
Me?
Not me.
So you're with him?
- With him?
Who?
I?
- Come here.
- I'm gonna kill you today.
- don't know him!
It goes down really smooth.
"Sorry, it's just that you eat so beautifully."
I haven't seen anyone eat ramen noodles as sexy as you do.
"Actually, I'm a writer."
So whenever I see anything beautiful I can't let it pass.
I'm sort of a workaholic.
I want to eat it.
'I want to eat ramen.' That's the title.
I suddenly got that poetic vibe.
Pink tiny glamorous lips Like blooming nipples
Slightly open
Your tongue that's like a shell's flesh
Accepts without any reservations Those erected noodles
And I can't betray him.
"Not now, or ever."
We must apprehend this Calvetti.
Do the impossible.
Be quick.
You're crazy; they're looking for you.
- I came here to give myself up.
There's nothing else I can do.
- No.
But it's me they want.
I can't let you die in my place.
Watch out!
The guards.
Everything in order?
- Everything.
I brought her meal.
Don't worry.
I'm not here to hurt you.
"If it was up to me, I'd let you kill whoever you want."
Bon appetit.
Save yourself.
It would be crazy to give yourself up.
What good would that do?
Everyone's against us.
"Lucrezia, Giacomo, even Martina."
- Martina?
The maid.
She told the judges I had ordered her to let you into the castle.
Martina said that?
They must have paid her to make a false statement.
We must find her and force her to tell us everything she knows.
Meeting me has cost you dearly.
What happened all of a sudden?
I'm scared.
"I'm afraid of losing you, too."
But you're doing all you can to lose me.
Doborobon.
I was waiting for you.
- They released me.
- Isn't it too soon?
"Yes, but I insisted."
"Goodbye, Donna."
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
Did you speak to him?
What did he say?
Nothing.
"I just remembered how you once told me,"
"""Doborobon, it's a shame that your life is like water."
"""Clear, tasteless and odorless."
Change a little.
"Surprise yourself."""
But I never believed in that.
"People never really change, Mom."
They just start lying to themselves.
"You can go now, Morn."
I promise I won't bother you any more.
I just wish you could come here for a moment and explain to us why you did all this.
"Well, now I'm in your house."
I have a lot of spare time so I'm pondering.
I'll probably understand something in the end.
"Previously, on ""Satisfaction""..."
- Who's in the conference room?
- SEC.
We're shut down.
Somebody went out of their way to bring on some real hurt.
You made any enemies lately?
Adriana called them in.
Revenge for when you and I...
Help yourself to the files.
You won't find anything.
I've been cooking the books for years.
- I never saw that.
- I was good at it.
You want to burn down my house?
I'm going to burn down yours.
A standard in-house Bastion contract.
It specifies a large amount of cash that you've been funneling into investments.
Cash obtained illegally.
You forged my signature.
Where do you think I learned that little trick?
Work with me.
Partners.
"Now, what do you really want?"
You want me?
You want Grace?
I want you both.
Suddenly single.
"Starting over, I guess."
Is that what we're doing?
I'm not gonna see you for a while.
We're going to Argentina.
"Simon, what's wrong?"
He's not sick.
"This is all bullshit, okay?"

"When in the jungle, protect your life, Not your pride."
I'm sharper than the dagger.
Watch your step.
What's your intention?
Doom.
I knew that Muraakis' brains are below their waist.
Accept defeat.
My next strike might kill you.
Try to not kill yourself.
For me.
Kill me.
I cannot stay here.
I won't be able to go back.
"We let Paathar go, Saiba is now ours."
He cannot be defeated even by a beast...
A Muraaki can be killed only by deceit.
Saiba is yours.
First we marry.
"Jilaan loves wars, then why this marriage?"
"Oh Muwaqqit, what do you gain by conquering the world?"
"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."
Kaabir?
Why are you here?
Saiba forgot why she is here.
Jilaan shall no longer even look at our Ghat.
- Didn't you get the message?
- I got the message.
But I didn't get Saiba.
I'll take Saiba with me...
After killing Jilaan.
Tia?
"If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too."
[tires screeching] [brakes squealing]
You the party I'm supposed to pick up?
- [Bene] just the children.
- All right.
"Meter's running, hop in."
I got it.
[cabbie grunts]
I've been waiting here forever.
"You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people."
We're exactly on time.
"Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up."
"I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months."
We have seats on the 50-yard line.
[Tony laughs]
Deliver the children to this address.
You'll be paid after you arrive.
This is a big fare here.
"If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip."
"Now, everything's been arranged."
I'll see you Friday.
- Ok.
"Goodbye, Uncle Bene."
- Goodbye.
"- Have fun, you two."
- [tires screeches]
[engine revving]
[horn honking]
- Look at that dummy.
- [honking horn]
"Get off the road, you dummy."
- He is stunt man..
How long you knew him?
- I knew since my childhood.
By the way who are you?
What do you want..?
Police..
Yes Sudhakar.
Sir his name is Karthik..
He is Stuntman..
Okay..
Thank you.
What his dad said was correct.
There is another person looking like him.
But we cannot take chance.
Hello sir..
I am sending a photo.
Hack the IB main server and check whether he is there in the employee data base.
His name is Vikram Kumar.
IPS 2012 batch.
Thanks Stephen.
"Confirmed, both are different."
- Strange!
Hello sir..
"As said by you, they hacked and searched the IB server for you."
We created your ID as an IB officer.
They confirmed that I'm a police officer via audio.
Now I'll show them the video.
Why are you still here?
Have you not still caught him?
My target is to catch you.
- Will you call Chairman Sir informally?
Inquiries should be done on criminals like you and not on Police like me.
"And, Bruce, we really wanna wish you well."
I thought they gave you grounds privileges.
They did.
It's not much of a privilege unless you use it.
So you're really leaving?
"Well, my insurance ran out, so I guess so."
Are you ready?
Do I have a choice?
You cold?
Oh.
"Uh, a little."
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
"- God, this feels so normal."
- Hm.
Is that crazy?
"You thinking the law library was haunted, that's crazy."
"This is, um..."
This is fine.
What's it like?
- What?
- Just hearing the voices.
"Oh, um..."
It sucks.
"Well, what does it feel like?"
Because I just picture it like there's a radio on in your head or something.
"Um, no, it's not in my head."
It's...
I actually hear them with my ears.
"Like people standing behind me, or beside me or creeping up."
Sometimes it's just one.
And then sometimes it's so many that I can't sort out the voices from my actual thoughts.
- A real weird story.
- It makes me feel eerie.
I'm going to bed.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"- Tomorrow, let's all go there and see."
- Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a long time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide. """
"""We are two elopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
- You spent what?
"Yes, we spent a lot of money."
"So, what?"
How much?
Why do you want to know?
Just tell me.
"Apart from our savings, we have borrowed some."
Varun!
"- Varun, stop!"
Your eyes are very sensitive to light now.
It will take some time to get used to excessive light.
You will have to use spectacles.
"- Okay, doctor."
'Calling Deepa'.
Varun.
Think practically.
You say that she used to come to the restaurant everyday.
But you don't know what she looks like.
You neither have her photo nor her address.
How do we search for her?
I promised to help her.
She must have pinned her hopes on me.
Would she have any idea about my accident?
She would have thought that I had cheated her.
There is no wrong from your side.
Don't think too much.
Varun.
Excuse me.
Do you remember the girl who used to come with me?
Everyday I see lot of people.
Thank you.
Tell me if you see her.
- That he killed himself to save our destinies?
"If it's any consolation,"
I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.
I'm fine.
Just let it be.
A full compliment.
"To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go."
"- Well, actually..."
- We're not coming with you.
"With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens."
"I give it three months, tops."
"Look, I just..."
I want to say thank you.
To all of you.
"- Ray, I..."
- No.
This is...
it's meant to be.
I wish both of you nothing but the best.
Be safe.
See you guys around.
"Every time they do that,"
I get hungry for chicken.
"So, shall we?"
- Is that...
- The Waverider.
Another Waverider?
"Whatever it is, it's not slowing down."
Get down!
What the hell's going on?
"To be honest, Mr. Jackson, I have absolutely no idea."
Is this 2016?
"The search party looked for you for three days, but they had to turn back because of the aftershocks."
[Groans]
"You could hear them, couldn't you?"
[Moaning sadly]
"I cannot imagine the pain, the feeling of abandonment."
"But, Ian, killing is not the answer."
"[Moans, huffs]"
Stay back.
We have it under control.
"Ian, please."
Come with us.
We can get you help.
[Whimpers]
"Ian, no, please."

- Mm-hmm.
"Well, I guess that puts the yeti myth to bed once and for all."
I doubt it brings much comfort to Meegan's family.
But they do have some closure.
"You know, I have to admit that when I saw those footprints, even I started to believe a little bit."
I can't imagine what it took to survive an injury like that.
"Well, that speaks to the strength of the human spirit."
"Yeah, but was he?"
"You know, human?"
Having devolved to such an animalistic state?
I think so.
It wasn't fulfilling.
It wasn't fulfilling?
Ha-ha-ha.
It wasn't fulfilling.
It wasn't anything!
"We don't want any violence in here, do we?"
"Go ahead, kill me."
I don't care.
It must be from a factory... or someplace where the fire is burning quantities of oil.
That direction... that would be the factory owned by Mac Bain!
Mac Bain?
Do you mean the famous aeronautical engineer?
"If I remember right, he's the favorite to win the world aircraft championship."
A race that will be held in Holland sometime soon.
My late husband really admired him.
"Oh, I do hope everything's all right."
Well then.
Why don't we have a look?
How terrible!
Where is Mac?
Is Helen safe?
"Ma'am, it's too dangerous!"
Stay back!
Stay back!
We are acquaintances of Mac.
I am Sherlock Holmes.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Please stay here, Mrs. Hudson."
Mac!
Helen!
Let me see...
How could this have happened in an empty factory?
I can't believe I chickened out.
It's okay B.
This is the beginning of something new.
Now we can all move on.
The possibilities are endless after all.
Yes.
To great things.
And so what if i'm not going to yale?
you were recently incarcerated
And I'm afraid to talk to Chuck because he might hurt me again.
This is our moment.
Nobody can take that from us.
I urge you to go out into the world
And show them who you have become.
Not so fast.
You're not graduating until I give you my diplomas.
Mine are labels and labels stick.
Nate Archibald-- class whore.
Dan Humphrey-- the ultimate insider.
Chuck Bass--coward.
Blair Waldorf--weakling.
And as for Serena Van der Woodsen
After today you are officially irrelevant.
- O.M.G.
- I know.
Congratulations everyone.
You deserve it.
Now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009.
Class please stand.
You were right B.
Nobody can take this day away from us.
Gossip girl is going down.
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.

These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
CzechosIovakia.
italy.
poland.
bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.

Cuba.
holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water."" AII died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
people are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
What's the matter now?
I think Grandma would Iike it not too spicy.
May I start eating?
This is called a rock.

Wig out.

Gosh!
Let's see what delicious food we're getting today.
- Minced shit!
You know I don't eat shit.
- Shut up!
Why don't you eat this yourself?
Pigswill for pigs!
I've had it with you!
Who's a pig?
Tell me.
Who's a pig?
- You're the pig.
Say yes.
"I said, say yes!"
- Yes.
Stop it!
Are you trying to kill him?
"Come on, let's go."
- Come on now.
- You see how things work here.
No jokes!
"Sir, get in here!"
"We have 5 deceased males and what looks to be a crude lab, all shot in the head execution style."
- Any anthrax on the scene?
- Only residue.
There's also packing and tags from 4 new backpacks.
"- All right, listen up."
- Backpacks?
They're already on the move.
We're too late.
Have you finished?
"As you said, the sun is set."
Yes.
I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine.
Dr. Reid.
- May we speak?
- Of course.
I have a little time.
That was a joke.
I have all the time.
Please.
A joke.
"- Well, we're making progress."
"- Yes, progress."
That is true.
Is there no way for this thing to end?
This Jihad?
The Jihad will end when Allah wills its end.
Then how will you know that it is Allah's will?
When the Jihad ends.
I have been lying to you.
Of course you have.
My colleague has been outside watching us as we talked on monitors.
We got to get going.
Right.
Okay.
"Then later, at a club in Chinatown somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."

"Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid?
That's...

Your Highness!
Let's go.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
Cool?
Can you find it?
- Sure.
Give me 10 minutes.
Let me find now.
- Excellent.
- Hello?
"- Tool as a chartered company, consisting of religious statues a church in Los Angeles sent a large transport."
- Religious statues?
- Yes. 20 statue of the Virgin Mary.
But that address is sent to control a church in Los Angeles and I do not have such a church.
Tool company steeped in a bad way.
Even if this guy 5 cents there.
"House for sale was removed, his wife, the divorce lawsuit."
Çırpınıyormuş for the money this man.
- Someone must have paid kickbacks to him.
- Never been bribed.
- I rented the corporate bullshit.
I've never.
- We do not have anything at that time.
"- No, there's something."
- What is it?
Virgin lost 20.
- This is a bad thing?
- I think I look açına depends.
"- Michael, is not it?"
"- Yes, Mike."
"So Mike, this is really a very nice gesture."
- Are you coming to church?
Many familiar come.
- Sometimes I'm coming.
Yes.
"Yes, thank you again."
"- Oh, Mike."
- You'll see my head...
- There we go.
"You can hardly tell, but I thought..."
"When it happened, I was like, ""Great, that'll look like I did that on purpose."""
And then you can't tell.
It looks like I have a spastic neck movement.
- Tom Richmond.
- Tom Richmond.
"It hurt though, really."
I think I was bleeding.
I was actually bleeding from that.
They had to put makeup on it.
- Yeah.
- Mike.
"For the rest of the movie, whenever you see me, I had makeup on."
"No, that's not true."
- It's horrible.
"- Oh, God, that was real vodka."
- It's a controversial shot.
"- Whose voice is that, Pete, yelling?"
"That's Myron Kerstein, our editor's voice heckling Ari."
Those are good names there:
"Adam Brightman, Nathan Kahane, Joe Drake."
- We love Nathan.
- All those names are good too.
- Good names.
"- New York, we love."
- That's a good couple of names.
- Look how cute...
Mike.
I did not really drink alcohol in that previous scene.
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
Sit right down.
"Well, I..."
"Well, I'll just take a sip."
"- Of course, I shouldn't stay too long."
"- Oh, nonsense."
Nonsense.
You can stay as long as you like.
"After all, we have all evening, haven't we?"
Of course we have.
Here.
There.
"Oh, I like your singing."
Yes.
You must sing again for me sometime.
Where did you get such a pretty voice?
"Well, I don't know."
I just...
Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?
- Well...
"- Very lovely, where it comes from."
"- Well, here's health so good luck."
"- I make my own luck, my dear."
"Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow."
"Oh, you don't half talk, do you?"
Perhaps we could follow it together?
"- I'll follow it right home, mister."
- To that rattrap?
"- Hey, what are you calling names?"
- I think you deserve something better.
How do you know where I live?
"Well, I can imagine."
Surely your wages here don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.
There is no enough time to wait for a suitable donor.
The only option left is to arrange for an organ illegally through an agent.
But...
It's very expensive.
I have lost hope fully!
My brother...
Don't say that now...
I'm here to help you.
I'll be there for you.
Listen.
I'm expecting a payment this week.
Give me 2 to 3 days.
I'll somehow arrange for the money.
No.
"No, Vikram."
- Don't talk like an idiot.
This is your brother's life.
That's the priority now.
You proceed with arrangements for the transplant.
We will take care of the rest later.
Priya.
Thank you so much.
"A boat load of lies, in those big beautiful eyes of yours."
"You girl, are an anaconda in the disguise of an innocent child."
So...
What's the next plan?
Erode.
Are we going by bus or by train?
Go!
Go fast.
Are you sure it's Vikram?
"Yes, I'm tracking the number you gave."
"She swings like Tarzan, through the vine."
I don't think that Paul chews that.
Can you believe Antoniette?
Watching her in predator mode is better than...
Shark week on the Discovery Channel.
"- Hello, whores!"
- There is special China Chow...
He' s probably giving some hints on how to remain in the spotlight... without actually doing anything.
- I gotta take notes.
- I think I'll follow you.
"How are you doing, sweetie?"
I don't know.
"Kind of tired, I don't feel so well."
I think I'll just go home and get some sleep.
Have a drink of bourbon it hits the head for 15 hours.
You'll be a million times better.
We changed the ceramics?
- I think so.
Then.
It's normal.
There's always smoke the first time.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
You don't look too well.
- I'm fine.
The vacuum cleaner is not the reason.
Is it?
No.
I have other problems.
A woman.
I bet.
- What makes you think that?

"Ah, come on in."
I could do with some company.
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.
I'll just finish marking up this.
"There it is, look."
Circling every two minutes.
- When did you pick it up?
- Just before I called you.
It's circling all the time?
Yes.
Zen says it's a Mark Three Galaxy Class cruiser.
Galaxy Class?
"That's outer planets manufacture, isn't it?"
"Right, but Mark Three went out of production at least fifty years ago."
Getting any signals from them?
"No, she's as quiet as a grave."
Probably guidance control systems
That ship's in trouble.
It's the only thing that makes any sense.
- You think so?
- Mmm.
"All right, we'd better take a look at her."
"Zen, abort course programs."
Take us in to 200 spacials and match vectors.
(chuckles)
"So, what brings you to Los Angeles today, Toast?"
Waffles.
What?
(chuckles)
"Well, not just waffles, fried chicken too."
Have you ever been to Roscoe's in Hollywood?
"Uh, yeah, sure."
It's great.
"I don't know if I'd travel 3,000 miles for it."
"Yeah, well, clearly you're not as dedicated to excellent waffles as I am."
"But if you're free later, I'd love to take you to breakfast."
"You do know we land at 5:00, right?"
I don't do time zones.
"I do, however, very much enjoy a good breakfast, hence the name."
You're funny.
And you're mind-blowingly attractive.
"(coughs, clears throat)"
(clears throat)
You're gonna just pretend like you didn't see us or what?
Hey.
Jersey.
McGruff.
What a coincidence.
You guys going to LA?
No.
"No, and neither are you."
"Impeccable timing as always, fellas."
"Thanks to you, I am not having chicken and waffles with a bona fide ten."
DANNY:
"Hold on, hold on."
Stop.
- Throw things at him!
"- Stop, or I'll arrest you all!"
You watch it!
- What about my theatre?
- Reporting for duty!
Moron!
- What about my theatre?
- Moron!
"Friend, tell me if you see anyone who looks suspicious."
There's a monetary reward.
Useless bum!
"Koon, there's a murderer with a painted face."
He might be in the troupe.
You must watch out.
Really?
- Where is he?
"- In this mess, who knows?"
We just recruited someone.
He has a funny walk and...
"OK, I'm coming."
"When the show's finished, look for me front of house."
I'll tell you.
I hate people from Bo Chi Lam.
Now you're their prime suspect.
We can work together.
You help me to...
"If you're successful, I'll pay for your trip to Nan Yang."
You won't have to worry about the police for the rest of your life.
But I'm afraid that you're no match for Wong Fei-hung.
LONGEVITY
"Congratulations, congratulations!"
- Have another drink!
Did you get an address?
- I'm gonna send it to you now.
"All right, urn..."
- I'll see you there.
"- Yeah, see you there."
- You off to arrest someone?
- Yeah.
You're screwed then cos I'll do you for false arrest.
I had reasonable and probable cause to think you were committing a crime.
"- Listen, one more peep out of you..."
- (LAUGHS)
- ...and it's with intent to supply.
- You're a liar.
And you're a junkie hooker.
I'm a copper.
"Do that, would you?"
Stitch me up?
Yeah.
"In a millisecond, just to shut you up."
Do you even know what they'll do to me for this?
"They'll break my ankles, if I'm lucky."
Listen.
Look at me.
"Nothing's going to happen to you, all right?"
"Yeah, who says?"
You?
"- Yeah, me."
"- They do know where I live, you know."
"People like that, they always do."
Come on.
"Mark, I wouldn't do this unless I absolutely had to."
Do what?
- Same stakes?
"-Sure, go ahead."
"Hey, that's not bad."
- Where'd you learn your pitching?
-From the farmer's daughter.
Something I've been meaning to ask.
It has to do with security.
Shoot.
We're having a tough time keeping stuff from the Krauts.
"Like our escape equipment, for instance."
So we're always looking for new devices.
Uh-huh.
Looks like you found one.
- Me?
"-Well, I mean the lieutenant."
"He hid a time bomb on him, right?"
"He even carried it through prisoners' search, didn't he?"
Where did he hide it?
Right in his pocket.
- The old cigarette-match gag.
-What's that?
"You take a book of matches, light a cigarette, slip it in."
It takes about three minutes for the cigarette to burn.
Then it sets off the matches.
Simple.
Some time bomb.
"Hey, that's a ringer."
"O come ye, O come ye"
To Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
"O come, let us adore him"
I can give you one of our lorries.
That's all I can do.
- I'll drive these people away from here.
- To the Promised Land?
Is that what you're fighting for?
I don't think you understand what we're fighting for.
Let's move on.
"We're moving on, guys."
We've got to get away.
- Thank you.
- We'll give them a lorry for their escape.
"Come on, get up there."
Hurry up.
"- Mariá, Mariá!"
"- Hurry up, get up on the lorry."
"- Hurry up, there's no time to lose."
- Get a move on.
Hurry!
"You too, hurry up."
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
He's in there.
Open the door.
Why are you snooping around here?
You're mumbling.
We can help your friend escape.
Someone we trust will handle that.
- And who is he?
- A member of the militia.
Water.
"The president's men seem to consider your friend very important, so the price for his escape should reflect this."
Silveira's men are corrupt?
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
"If I trust my employees, it's their duty to uphold my trust."
And not break it.
It's your duty to live up to my trust.
I understand.
It's simple.
"If I take care of people, they should also take care of me."
Of course.
So I guess.
A hand searches for another hand.
I hope you understand what I am saying.
I will see you in the office.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Bye.
"Sir, newspaper is here."
Keep it in the car.
You are the only one that can handle this.
Okay.
The officer was shot several times.
The wounded officer's condition would be serious.
Hello?
We have no money for the restaurant.
We can not meet you.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you back.

"So, am I to keep silent about that?"
"Of all people, you should know better that she is practically my wife"
"--So let's not touch this topic --No, let's!"
"Since you started this conversation, then let's!"
"It's not clear to Masha ""practically"" whose wife she is, yours or that soccer players."

"Let's dot the I's, cross the T's on this one later."

"Well, is there any truth whatsoever to the story?"
- There will be an investigation.
- She's gonna have the truth on her side.
- She's gonna deny it and make us all look like fools.
- Let her.
Let her deny just that part of the story.
- Hold here.

Oh.

I can do that myself.
Yeah.
Thank you.

Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was- stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.

I hid it in my office before the police came.
You stole the medallion?
"Oh, purely for safekeeping."
Why?
"I had no choice, MacGyver."
You don't realize what's at stake.
I'd say about 20 years... for robbery.
I can explain everything.
My office is this way.
Come on.
In you come.
It's been torn apart.
"All right, don't touch anything."
I'll call the police.
"Nonsense, this is how it always looks!"
A neat office is the product of an empty mind!
Professor?
"Just a moment, MacGyver."
Hold your horses.
Ah.
"There we are, safe and sound."
Just as I promised.
"Now, what's going on?"
"Ah, yes, well, that requires some explaining."
Yes.
We are here.
You said the riddle on the Ark was a set of instructions?
Exactly.
"And if, uh, Cleeve stole the Ark, it can only mean that he's after the treasure!"
Is there some reason you cou--?
Is there some reason you couldn't have told the police that?
Let's celebrate!
This is not a celebration!
This is a nightmare!
Dr. Lonsdale is obsessed.
He won't quit asking me things about you.
"Oh, and now I'm doing surgical procedures that are way over my head."
Let me guess.
- This is all my fault.
- This is all your fault.
You make things so messy.
Like now!
Oh!
Your underwear is in our communal sink when you have a perfectly functional sink of your own!
"Actually, I clogged my sink up hard."
It's a funny story.
"See, I was trying to wax my..."
Stop.
"The point is, I need you to get your thongs out of the sink of my career."
- What?
- Break it off with Lonsdale.
For real.
"I mean, leave the poor guy no hope."
None.
I can do that.
Consider Dr. Everett Lonsdale completely dumped.
"- Although, you never know."
"- No, no, no."
This time I need you to know.
- Tell me you know.
- All right.
"And don't think, ""you never know,"" either."
- Fine.
This is proof.
Is it?
"Well, this is fake."
Huh.
Oh.
"Oh, yeah, that's my credit card number there."
Oh!
"Vexing, isn't it?"
Eh?
The cuff link that I bought- very similar
In design and style- winds up at a crime scene.
Let's cut the bs.
You planted it there to help your client beat a murder rap.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Is that your theory?
That's not fact.
There's no foundation there.
"Plant anything else, and I will personally drive you to chino."
"Yes, I believe you would."
"As a matter of fact,"
"I've been contemplating retiring, anyway."
That's your problem.
"You know, you can buy a sense of humor."
"We got to catch this guy, calleigh."
We got to catch him.
I just-
- I know he did it.
I think I may have found a way.
Really?
"Well, I started thinking about it,"
And the print alone is not gonna sink coop daly.
"No, he's got, uh, that other explanation--"
There are bills to be paid.
Take a check from the drawer and pay at the bank.
There's a checkbook with signed checks.
Alright.
"Do it by tomorrow, otherwise there'll be a fine."
Okay.
And sell some of the short-term deposit at the bank.
Tell Yaffa she promised me higher interest.
I'll handle everything.
Did you move all yourthings?
How's the apartment?
I brought everything back home.
Why?
Daddy...
Come on...
I brought yourthings from home and the play from your nightstand.
Do you need anything else?
I don't need anything.
What'll you do with the contract?
It's a waste if you pay and don't live there.
I feel bad about all this.
I ran out of licorice.
Okay.
I'll relieve you.
"Hello, Mr. Director."
"Once again, you took things to heart."
"I'm going, will you be alright?"

- That's a pretty good call.
"- That's nice, yeah."
Hey.
Here's a little bit of everything.
Let your education begin.
This place is perfect.
"Seriously, it's totally safe."
"Ryan, how perfect is this place, right?"
"Seriously, what else could you need?"
Anyone bring any food?
Um...food.
Guess we're going on a mission.
Faster!
"Go, Ryan!"
Whoo!
"Well, call me if someone meeting that description comes in."
Thank you.
Nothing at the hospitals.
I'm sure he'll turn up.

Are you accusing him of lying?
That'll be really good for your relationship.

"Oh, I wish you hadn't called the police."
They don't have the resources or the manpower.
Ryan'll just slip through the cracks.

What is it about this kid?
I thought I could help him... make a difference.
I was this kid.
- I want him dead and disintegrated!
"- Roger, General."
We continue the search.
We need an evacuation group.
Ishmael is almost frozen.
You must leave here immediately.
General?
Can you hear me?
Send an evacuation group.
I repeat:
Send an evacuation group.
"Will we stay here all night, or what?"
An electromagnetic storm is coming.
"If we wait, we'll lose Ash."
"If we move now, we still have a chance."
"I can do it, Commander!"
"Kix, stay with Ishmael, until the storm is over."
I'm not a fucking nanny!
"""What were Trajan's orders?"""
- Ash's going to die.
Then I'll take care of that.
"I was born to hunt, Commander."
The collection team arrives in the morning.
All you have to do is stay warm until then.
"Can you do that for me, Spartan?"
"I can do it, Commander."
"Stay strong, brother."
See you upstairs.
"What is it, Kix?"
Where's the fucking bitch with thick balls now ?

"I have your breath hanging right here, Hatta."

Enright murdered his wife brutally.
The guy's a known wife abuser.
Jesse found blood from the dead wife
On enright's clothes and in his car.

I set up a meeting with his mom.
"It's not protocol, but I think it'll help."
Is he still violent?
No.
"No, he was never violent."
I thought you had to restrain him.
"No, I sedated him."
"-Oh, I thought he was psychotic."
-Huh?
No.
He had a psychotic episode.
He OD'd on methamphetamines.
But he's not psychotic in general.
When did you start reading Spin magazine?
Whoa.
What...
What happened to your wrist?
"- Oh, it's an a-allergic reaction."
- So take it off.
"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close... to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
Better the sores weep than I.
"Hey, hold on."
That slut just got here.
How'd she get beer already?
- You see a ring on that finger?
- Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Are you saying that this invisibility thing means I might not be able to get beer?
I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee and bagels and rent.
- Rent?
- But not being able to get a beer?
Unacceptable.
Excuse me.
Hot girl coming through.
Oh.
Hmm.
"Three beers, please."
"Damn it, ring!"
"- Oh, yeah, baby."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Later, you should totally go out and buy a switchblade."
"- Mmm, sure."
"While I'm out, maybe Daddy picks up some diapers and a little mild salsa..."
- because we're low.
- Oh.
Mmm.
"Yeah, but not as bad as the grocery store."
"There was only one pack of toilet paper left, and me and this crazed housewife reached for it at the same time."
Tell me you took that bitch down.
[ Wind whistling ]
- Ha!
- [ Claps hands ]
Still...
I feel like there's something missing.
Are you perhaps looking for...
these?
- Ohh!
- Aah!
Yeah!
You are almost sexy right now.
"I mean, seriously?"
I got bit.
Mmm.

Jules:
Ugh.
"That was a wild night, but we made it through."
And nobody behaved badly expect for everything that Jelly did.
"I warned you guys-- when I fear for my life, I kick and scream and yell and I tell people exactly what I think about them."
"Still, I am sorry for everything that I said."
And did.
- I'd be mad if I wasn't so impressed.
- Ugh.
How is the damage out there?
"Well, it looks like we lost a tree and gained a new patio set!"
Score!
You're holding hands?
"What, is the world ending?"
"Oh, damn it!"
You can not prove anything with a stolen mobile phone.
I give a shit about evidence.
What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell have you done?
- I have not been here.
You're crazy.
"CODE NAME ""LAILA"""
- You have to press hard.
"- Fuck, man."
Satan.
Share Russians.
- Tell the Russians.
- Why the hell would I do that?
Because it determines whether I'll drop you off at a hospital or in a ditch.
There is a lot of money in this case.
A lot of money.
I do not take them.
I'll let you keep them.
Although I desperately need them.
Think of what it will mean to you.
I have never done anything that has been directed at you.
Everything I've done has been against your competitors.
You will aliigevel ... you will ...
never could find them.
Why not?
Because they drive around in a car.
- What kind of car?
- With sleeping bags and canned goods.
A black van.
A Chevrolet.
An older model.
You are safe here.
This is the most important thing.
I'm frightened all the time.
And this is the prison where they killed my brother.
"Yes, but the assassination of your brother was premeditated."
And criminals do not have accomplices in every prison.
"Finally, you are being closely watched, by order of the judge."
You said it yourself:
Fantômas is capable of anything.
"Yes, but less here than elsewhere else."
"Forgive me, Elizabeth."
Forgive me.
You lied to the judge.
It's called contempt of court.
You should be here at my place.
But when you're a great journalist...
I did it because...
I want to know when they will release me.
As soon as you are out of danger.
Anyway...
I love you.
Love me?
"No, you think you do."
But you belong to Fantômas.
So leave me alone.
Happy hunting.
Ah!
At last.
"Excuse me, I went to see Elizabeth in jail."
How's your love?
Bad.
She can not forgive me for what I've done.
(wiart speaking)
Okay.
(wiart speaking)
Morton:
No.
"Oh, I missed that."
(wiart speaking)
Ooh.
Right.
"We've already found a lot of things just by, like, stopping for a few seconds."
Morton:
One of the reasons a lot of these drugs
"Probably haven't been found is 'cause, first of all,"
"It's hard to find the plants, because they're in the fucking jungle,"
And you got to come here and get into the jungle.
"And then, second of all, you'd expect new antibiotics"
To look like the craziest plants in the jungle.
"It'd be like weird, rare orchids that you have to,"
"You know, climb a mountain and snip."
"But they're not, they just look like this."
You have to really know what you're looking for to find stuff
That could be potentially useful.
"So, the thrill of the find is a plant that looks"
"Exactly like this, but slightly different."

Wiart:
Oh!
Uh-huh!
Morton:
"Oh, wow."
(wiart speaking)
Morton:
Should I really?
Should I just quit everything and follow you around?
Yeah.
Quit everything and even follow me to school.
Let's go to school.
Jik.
Noona wants to follow you around...
You know that Sin Joon Young's fans isn't a joke.
Hm?
"Among the fans from singer celebrities, Sin Joon Young's fans are the most extreme ones."
There are even psychos.
They're looking into you right now.
If something happens then...
This is Oh Jik's phone right?

archaeology is not an exact science.
Does not deal in time schedules.
The Führer is not a patient man he demands constant reports.
And he expects progress.
You led me to believe -
Nothing!
I made no promises!
I only said it looked very favorable.
"Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct."
Boy they're not kidding are they?
What time does the sun hit the map room?
About nine in the morning.
Not much time then.
where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?
On that ridge.
But the map room is over there.
"Let's go, come on."

Sallah!
Sallah!
Mehr Wasser!
What is the matter?
"I fetch the water, I shall get it for you."
Water?
"I will give you water, no problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
They must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
You have to get me out of here quick!
They're going to be back at any minute.
Quick!
"He wants power, that's different."
But you both qualify:
"same rank, seniority, service rating."
"So whoever nails that scum, will be king."
I don't mix with brass.
It's better than mixing with whores and hoods.
Times have changed.
Get yourself a new style.
You're an anomaly.
"Your men, your methods."
"In the police, now you toe the line, you snap to."
"If you don't, no one will cover for you."
All the brass have caved in.
Even you?
"Lay off me, shit!"
Who the fuck are you?
"Shit, what ya doin'?"
Who the fuck are you?
What have I done?
"Don't do that, don't!"
"Lay off Manou, or I'll stuff you with your brother's head."
Quite a shiv!

"No, it's for Manou."

Come in.
Our soldiers have been instructed not to shoot unless they are attacked by you.
Accept this offer.
You are surrounded.
You cannot escape any more.
"General Benítez has promised that no one will be harmed, if Enrique Carrasco negotiates with him."
Every single word is a bloody lie.
Not even a child would fall for that.
- No.
Are you crazy?
- I believe him.
Enrique!
The regime has collapsed.
Ramírez has left the country.
He's fled?
Yes.
General Gómez is leading the provisional government.
- He's guaranteed law and order.
- And you believe him?
I hope it's true.
I'd like to tell you that I'm glad that we're meeting this way.
I want you to know that I don't wish to be your enemy.
Commander!
"Commander, the militia!"
They've stopped Padre Julio's bus.

Padre Julio's bus has been ambushed by Silveira's men.
We must hurry.

Come on!

Hurry up!
"Poached it, seasoned it, and covered it in Thorpe-andaise sauce, my friend."
"You should thank me, dumpy."

Why does everything with him have to be so dramatic?
Why are we stopping?
Ohh.
"Oh, my God!"
I thought I lost you.
What's to tell?
"A truck runs a stop sign, I avoid it, everyone walks away..."
"Bing, bang, no boom."
"- Um, there was a truck!"
- That was crazy!
"- Okay, okay."
- Where did it even come from?
- You don't see that truck...
- Everybody calm down.
Calm down.
Let's not overreact.
- What?
!
- Dad!
- We were almost just killed!
- Yes!
Exactly.
"Almost, which means we're all just fine."
You aren't the least bit upset?
It's gonna take more than that to ruin a morning that started with a whipped-cream smile on my waffle.
"Okay, it may have affected me a little, but sometimes it's hard to know what you're feeling."
No matter what happens in life don't let their be any rift in your friendship.
- Promise?
- Promise!
I promise too!
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
What have you ordered for?
Aam...

Omlette!
But why are you talking of eating?
Didn't you go home?
Your mother must have fed you to your heart's content!
Couldn't you have brought some food for me too?
I don't eat the stale food of this place.
- l feed it to the customers.
- What?
- Did you meet your brother?
"- No, I am on my way."
Come along?
I have to visit the shrine today.
- Gosh!
I had forgotten!
- Did you see?
"He forgot, he says!"
"Some day, he will forget his friend for his brother's sake."
- Such things happen.
- How can you say that?
What will you do if you are required to choose between...
- ...your friend and brother?
- l will tell you what to do!
If you talk like this I will break the heads of both of you.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"See you tomorrow, Tia."
We'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"Let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
You will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done by the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch Mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?

"lfJackson doesn't know what he's doing, then he probably doesn't know that someone's controlling him."
Or he doesn't remember.
What if it's the same kind of thing that happened with Lydia when she took off from the hospital?
A fugue state?
SCOTT:
He'd have to forget everything.
The murder.
allison:
Getting rid ofthe blood.
STlLES:
"But he had help with one thing though, the video."
Maybe someone else helped him forget that.
Whoever's controlling him.
allison:
Are you sure Jackson has no clue about any ofthis?
He thinks he's still becoming a werewolf and that being with Lydia somehow delayed the whole thing.
allison:
So do we try to convince him he's not?
"If it helps us find out who's controlling him, then yeah."
Do you think he'll talk to us after what we did?
"Yeah, it's us."
What you thinking?
"Laila, If this deal won't happen then you can't take place your bank's installments."
If the bank's installments would not take place then everything will go.
But you will see from far.
And...
You won't tell anyone about this.
"All right, show me."
"But not here, Then where?"
In your hotel.
All right.
Come.
Tell me who shot the fire?
Fire shot from there and we were here
And you.
"Yes, Madam."
Then come.
Yes!
Madam!
What are you doing?
"A weapon without riot,"
Didn't you fire a shot to him?
"Hey, search him, Yes!"
"If you don't mind, Sir!"
Why you always searching?
You didn't know that police officers didn't leave any chance.
"Do you understand, Come with me to police station."
Why police station?
I live in Ghat Kupar.

"Well, no."
No one beneath me could hurt me and no one above me would hurt me.
What a beautiful sentiment.
"Now, you let her finish."
Music.
Cooing.
"* Cooing, billing birds of spring *"
* Come back each year and sing and sing *
"Cooing and billing birds of spring, come back and..."
"Pardon me, something is bothering you?"

- That's fine.
* Oh that is what he taught me to.. *
* Spreading sunshine and gladness *
* And teaching lessons of love
"* Fluttering, chirping birds of spring * [yodeling]"

What a lovely pizzicato.
"To you, that's a pizzicato."
"To me, that's a pizzinati."
"I know, music."

"All my life, I've looked forward to America."
"I suffered fire, floods, pestilence, and starvation to get here."
"And when I arrive, what does America give me?"
- A hillbilly.
- Oh.
"Now, you see what you've done?"
I warn you.
"Any more insults, and I take my money and Miss Chummy out of this production."
- You followed me.
- He's the one?
- You're starting up with him again?
- I'd sooner chew glass.
"Choose your seconds and meet me at dawn, sir."
- No more duels!
- This is men's business.
- I accept.
- Men?
You're not fit to be men!
Morons!
Idiots!
"Choose your weapons, Mallefille."
Red or white?
Leave her alone!
She's going off to write about us.
It's time for her nightly regurgitation.
20 pages.
The only reason she needs you or me or anybody is to provide characters for her ghastly novels!
- I trust you have no objection to pistols.
- What?
- For tomorrow.
"- My boy, I really don't care."
"Thank you for the loan, my dear."
It was most instructive.
"You'll be up before dawn for the duel, so I shall sleep in my own bed."
Ooh!
I do wish I could be there tomorrow.
You will make sure nobody's killed?
"I abhor killing, but a good fight's something to see."
- Good night.
"- Good night, Claudette."
"Come on, Marcus, you wally!"
Wait!
Wait!
Excuse me.
What is going on here?
Nothing.
Everything's under control.
I'm just his voice coach.
What are you doing here?
"I heard you were about to commit social suicide, so I dropped by."
- My accompanist left!
- Brilliant.
- You don't have to do it.
- I can't do that.
"Yeah, you can."
Just tell them:
Artistic differences.
You can't work without him.
He had a drug problem.
My mum wants me to sing it.
It'll make her happy.
"Look, mate, nothing you do can make your mum happy, all right?"
Not in the long term.
She has to do that for herself.
- Get over here right now!
"- Just bugger off, will you!"
"What I'm saying is, the important thing is to make yourself feel happy."
I've tried just making myself happy.
She's tried making herself happy.
It doesn't work.
You need other people to make you happy.
But that's just it.
Something's wrong!
"Go, go!"
I'm leaving.
See you tonight.
"Tail-hair, follow me."
"Don't you understand, idiot?"
Come on!
"Come on, hurry up!"
You silly fool!
I could have sliced him for good!
Come on!
Oh!
Toulouche!
What is happening?
"Go back to sleep, you!"
Have you embarked the counterfeit money?
Yeah.
"For this, no problem, but this damned reporter, this Fandor, he was walking in the main sewer."
"I was going to slice him for good, but this idiot, he threw him in the river."
"With any luck, he drowned."
Not a chance!
He swims like a fish.
Why did you save his life?
What do you reproach me?
What innocence!
He always forgets everything.
It's really not smart to have him introduced in the gang.
I do what I want.
"If it's not in your taste, you can remove your printing presses from my cellar."
For what I earn on your output...
Besides he renders services.
His brain is full of holes like a strainer.
Don't move.
You're not going to shoot me.
Tell me something else about myself.
"I swear that I will, but not now."
"(Machine gun fire, screams)"
-Silence!
Up against the wall.
"(SALVADOR) Finally, Espínola."
-Relax.
Outside is taken care of.
and I will sort this out in a jiffy.
"Let's see, do any of them speak Spanish?"
"-Yes, this one."
"Well listen carefully, because this is the last time I'll say it,"
"I have 100 more men in the hallways, and all your comrades are dead, so surrender and we will treat you with honor."
Do you understand?
-And you understanding this?
"No, it's not going to be over that easily."
"Diego, wake up."
Diego.
-Silence!
We will never surrender.
We only follow orders from the Führer.
That can be arranged.
Remove your aim from my boss or I'll shorten him by a head
(ANGUSTIAS) Wake up.
We have to warn Ernesto quickly.
Fine.
Someone translate.
I'll do it.
-Perfect.
Tell him to return to Montserrat.
But that ain't my fault.
I'm waiting for Captain Leavenworth to arrive with his army.
Then we'll have enough men to shoot some civilization into those fucking Arikara and get back our pelts.
All right.
All right.
When's that supposed to happen?
I don't know.
"But until then, nobody gets paid."
"Listen here, all right?"
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
"The way I see it, now you, you got a safe."
It's probably full of money.
You signed a contract to protect your boss and your boss's property.
And that safe isn't full anymore.
It's short about $300.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
"It means, according to my records you purchased more goods on the expedition than what you are owed by the company."
"Now, Happy New Year, Fitzgerald."

"You and I have a date, sweetheart."
You'll have to go through me.
Really?
You're gonna go to jail for that!
And who's gonna make me?

I'm gonna confront a man who tried to have me killed.
"It's not a weekend getaway, Fi."

- It was right here.
"Fi, the thing about D.C.-"
Is that you're going to need backup.
Don't tell me you'd rather have Sam.
- We can't talk about this right now.
- Why not?
Because I have a hard time focusing when I'm in handcuffs!
Would this help?
Another fine illustration of your need for tactical assistance.
"Admit it, Michael."
"Not a single fingermark, sir."
"There are traces of blood, but it's been deliberately wiped clean."
Had to be Travis.
- The girl wouldn't have the wherewithal to do that.
- Exactly.
"But then, what about the bite marks?"
"Well, the victim got too close to her."
"As you discovered, Fen reacts violently when approached."
Indeed she does.
So the victim and the girl were involved in an altercation.
Or Travis set her on him.
"Either way, Travis stabbed him and then tried to cover it up."
But why?
"Any news from the victim, Crabtree?"
"Nothing yet, sir, but I've widened my search, sent out a province-wide description."
Constables.
"Come with me, I've found the killer."

- They take great pictures.
First the good news Franz.
My boss says the location is perfect.
Yes?
What does that mean?
"That means as soon as the contracts are signed, we'll do a casting."
- What?
Someone will play me?
What do you think?
Will this work?
Get rid of the Jesus business!
"Yeah, but it somehow works with the whole revolution thing."
Explain to me why they won't work together?
Why won't they work together?
!
Just settle down.
"Franz, I have the contracts with me..."
Let's find a quiet place where we can talk it over.
It's quite the opposite.
The people don't want to see authenticity.
Stars!
That's it.
"Every once in a while, we'll throw in an average guy."
That will freshen it up a bit.
Could Franz be that guy?
It's not my job.
That's up to the casting people.
"- But the Hotel, that stays in."
- That'll be something.
That's true.
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
Follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, Claudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
Hello!
Welcome.
"Well, he left the salon at that moment."
Claudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!
Madame Sand!
Everybody's staring at me.
It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!
George in a dress?
"Red and white, the colours of the Polish flag."
- How very impressive.
- Would you like to buy it?
- Do you want to sell it to me?
- Yes.
- How much?
"1,000 kroner."
"That's the best 1,000 kroner I've ever spent."
My colleague is a quite the art expert.
He'll be very impressed.
"- Hi, Frank."
- Well?
- It's mouth painted.
- But why?
I bought it from a crippled lady who paints with her mouth.
Impressive.
"- But still, it's a shitty painting."
- I think it's very... mouthy.
"- But impressive, eh?"
"- ""Mouthy"", you said it!"
- I'm happy.
- But you can't hang it anywhere.
The office.
You've got that...
It's not really office material.
We have people coming by and...
I'm at a stage in my life where I'm fascinated by the orally competent.
- Why?
- Mia says my technique is dull.
- She says you give bad head?
- That's another way to put it.
"I'm like a fiery Arab, and you're more the dray horse."
You toss your long tongue into her beaver.
-Calling Buzz Lightyear!
-Karate chop action!
-Wow!
-Pulsating laser light!

Out among the stars I sail
Way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sailed
To a dream that ended too soon
Now I know exactly
Who I am and what I'm here for
You are a toy!
You can't fly!
And I will go sailing
No more
"But no, it can't be true"
I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky
If I believed I could fly
"Why, I'd fly"
To infinity and beyond!
I want the boss.
"""Tattooing"" in Japanese..."
Take it nice and slow!
You lied to me.
All your questions about Lynn's tattoo.
She was killed for her tattoo.
What about you?
Did you tell me the truth?
I thought there were 12 Hiromitsus.
I wish it were so.
You were together?
You and Hiromitsu.
I loved him.
So much I didn't care that love meant something different to him.
We were so happy.
Until his masterpiece was finished.
He lost interest in me.
He lost interest in everything.
In life as well.
He killed himself.
Attained absolute perfection.
And left me behind with a wound that won't heal.
"Ironically, I'm the only thing that's left of him."
So Lynn Wilson knew about your tattoo?
"Of course, but she swore never to tell anyone about it."
Before ending up in Gunzel's basement.
Gunzel most likely knew about her tattoo and whoever else worked with him.
"Irezumi, too."
Who else knows about it?
Your family?
Your lover?
No one.
# I got you #
# Under my skin #
# I got you #
# Deep in the heart of me #
# So deep in my heart #
# That you're really a part of me #
# I got you #
# Under my skin #
# I tried so #
# Not to give in #
# I say to myself this affair #
# Never will go so well #
# Why should I try to resist #
# When baby I know so well #
# I got you #
# Under my skin #
# I'd sacrifice anything...
What are you doing?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Something's wrong with you.
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gotta sit you down in this chair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."
Put down the proto baby.
Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
What's that?
But I did attack.
I was in a simulation controlled by Jeanine and the rest of the Dauntless that she recruited.
Tris found me.
"She managed to break me free from the simulation, and then together we..."
Together we fought our way out.
So you're saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?
Yes.
One last thing.
"If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless, why didn't you just leave?"
Why did you stay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY) I wanted 110 leave.
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.
And I couldn't leave her.
Thank you for your candor.
ALL:
Thank you for your candor.
JACK:
"Tobias Eaton, this trial is concluded."
And you are absolved of guilt in the attack on Abnegation.
"Miss Prior, if you would."
May the truth set you free.
"Tris Prior,"
Mr. Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim.
TRIS:
Yes.
JACK:
So you were never under the simulation yourself?
No.
How is that possible?
Because I'm Divergent.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
I see.
"Yesterday, I was unemployed."
"Today, I guess I'm retired."
"That makes two of us, brother."
"But in a stunning development this morning, the lottery commissioner suspended all payment to Captain Stottlemeyer after it was revealed that Stottlemeyer has known and worked with Natalie Teeger, the newly hired lotto ball girl."
There is a news conference...
He said we cheated.
Why?
Just because you know the Captain?
I...
I mean...
Okay.
"It looks bad, but it's not impossible."
No.
It's not just that.
They said they have proof.
They checked the equipment.
There was something wrong with the machine.
It was rigged.
Rigged?
They said I'm going to jail.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry I said I quit."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
You have to help me.
Yeah.
"Good morning, Miss Teeger, Captain."
"You and your friend, Mr. Monk, wanted to see what evidence we had?"
Yeah.
"Well, here it is."
"Before we begin, is there anything you want to say to the lottery commissioner?"
Yep.
Walls.
"Yes, furniture, walls, curtains, candles"
What else?
Darkness.
Precisely.
I dreamed of creating a hallway ten times the size of this room.
A room without darkness.
"On one side, windows looking out to the gardens, on the other, mirrors."
A hall of blinding light that would make the Palace famous throughout the world and for time eternal!
Let us now turn this dream into reality!
"It is Her Highness, Sire."
She is taken ill.
"Talk to me, doctor."
"I beg your patience, Sire."
"It would rather scrub your plans, wouldn't it, if she died?"
She will not die.
"Suppose, having the death of both my wives on your conscience?"
Henriette's death had nothing to do with me.
I beg to differ.
There is a certain test I wish to perform.
Here.
What is this for?
"Urine, Your Highness."
Of course.
Your staring at me is not making this any easier.
Thank you.
Wine.
Well?
Yer Highness is pregnant!
Congratulations!
My heartfelt congratulations to you both.
We did it!
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety ofthe passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died ofa heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
His name is Tony Weng.
He works with a drug ring in Central America.
What is this?
"This is the only reason why you're alive, Tris."
"Man, I love knowing stuff that you don't."
"Need you to open up that box, Tris."
The only way to open that box is to pass the sims of all five factions.
But the only people that have tried to do it so far have died. (LAUGHING)
Oops.
I don't think I was supposed to tell you that.
"Oh, Well."
No pressure.
JEANINE:
Remarkable.
"Chances of it being you, of all people."
Nearly defies the laws of probability.
As remarkable as the amount of people you've managed to murder.
Dark times call for extreme measures.
"You may find it hard to believe, but I am serving the greater good."
"Step up on the disk, please."
"Step up on the disk, please."
(PETER GROANS)
(PANTING)
Ma'am?
- Hmm?
-(PETER GROANING)
Oh.
Stop the suicides or I swear I will shoot him.
That's okay.
You can kill him if you want.
We have plenty of guards.
What?
(YELLS)
(GRUNTS)
"please, calm down."
"But this is still an advanced, liberal society, as far as I know."
"The police aren,t standing behind me, so I can say -"
"Let him talk, BonaIoi."
You see?
Stop it!
"Watch out, or I,II hit you!"
"Don,t try that again!"
"You,re all brawn, no brain!"
Stop it!
Bastard!
"Okay, okay."
I lost my temper.
Thanks.
I noticed.
"I,m sorry."
"Oh, don,t start whining!"
I was mad.
"I didn,t mean it."
Did I hurt you?
Come on.
"I,d like to thank our guests."
"Good night, viewers."
until next time.
"Paris, whore of the world"
"It,s been confirmed that general Pinochet remains in critical condition."
"His family is with him, and we hope to have better news soon."
"Our model couple has now been ,in orbit, and under constant surveillance for three weeks."
No ill effects to report.
Quite the opposite.
"However, the City of the Future has hit some snags."
The project has stirred up local opposition:
"Loud and clear on this end, Tony."
"Roger that, buddy."
Let us know what you need.
AssistingTony at the surface is safety diver andcommunicationssupervisor Mike Huntley.
"IfTonyencounters any kind of danger, or needs assistance underwater,"
Mikewilldescendthe well to help him.
You got to plant your ass on that board.
Okay.
Roger that.
Down slow.
"Roger, down to water."
Down to the water!
"Yeah, roger, we have visual on the camera here."
Lower Tony down.
Down two more feet!
Diver's in the water.
- All stop.
- All stop.
"Actually, visibility's great."
Lower Tony down!
Lowering down.
"AsI 'msittingthere watching the monitor, youknow, you're always hopeful."
"Nomatterwhere the search takes you, you want so desperately to see something that answers a question."

Where is he in relation to the bottom?
Are his feet on the bottom?
Are you touching bottom yet?
"Roger, on bottom."
"Is the bottom rough, smooth?"
"Hey, Tony, can you feel with your feet at all whether or not the bottom is smooth or rough?"
Roger that.
So did every other developer in town.
"Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor..."
... ifyoudon'ttransport their employees...
... BankExchangewill dump this deal...
... andforgetaboutNew York...
... andputup their60-storybuilding in New Jersey instead.
So be it.
The mayor loves BankExchange but can't afford infrastructure.
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp...
... itcan'tpayfor them.
-Where are you going?
-l have an appointment in Manhattan.
This meeting's over?
I heard you say no.
Can I offer you a ride?
"No, thanks."
I make it quicker on the train.
Here he comes.
Judge Stern!
"Why did you give Tino Zapatti probation, Your Honor?"
Why did you go soft on the drug charge?
is probation a sentence in this town?
They're burying little James Bone.
Are you going to the funeral?
Get me the file on Tino Zapatti.
Mr. Deputy Mayor...
"Okay, Sara may still be in that tunnel."
"McNamara, let's get blueprints."
"Mei, Tac Team on standby."
Let's go.
Five Lincoln want a team leader.
The tunnel is secured.
This is team leader.
Good to go.
Valera stopped somewhere in here in the northbound bore.
"North and south tunnels are linked by three cross passages-- here, here, and here."
They're used for ventilation and maintenance.
Access shafts run off each cross passage.
So what about these?
Relief ducts.
They leed right into the drainage system
It's like a maze.
Perfect place to hide a body.
Live or otherwise.
"Okay, listen up!"
Sara Collins may still be alive in this tunnel structure.
Weapons down.
Eyes up.
Let's move.
You gonna be able to pick anything up through these walls?
It's a crap shoot.
"Kelton, we've got something."
It's definitely blood-- fresh.
that's a fingerprint.
Nice and clean.
Almost like someone made it on purpose.
Run it!
Plenty of room for Valera to pull over.
- Oh!
Um...
"Oh, I..."
"- Thruppence, please."
Please.
There.
"Well, as long as you receive an adequate coaching fee,"
I see no objection to your continuing to instruct him.
- Fee?
- Yes.
Certainly a fee.
I shall be raising the matter with Mr. Baker today.
Is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Your dressing room is adequate?
Uh...
"Oh, your intimate needs are being catered for?"
Mmm?
Sammy once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew.
Electricians in particular?
Yes.
"Well, one mustn't complain."
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work, uh, people..."
People seem to be responding rather well to Uncle Frank.
I look-
- I look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
It smelt of you for the longest time.
"And then one day, I went in there and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day...
I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in.
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
You lose everything.
Everything...
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
Do not get lost!
"- It's a little mysterious, right?"
- Yes.

Yes.
Do you think we will be happy?

What if I had crossed paths with a hunter back when I was possessed by Gadreel?
"I could've ended up dead, too."
Would I have deserved that?
Would I have deserved to die?
Go home!
"Yoshimura, stop picking on them"
You don't know nothing
I was educating them
These damn savages!
I'll have you pay for this some day
Good morning
What?
Checking out guns?
Watan Robo is getting married We've got some preparations to do
Tado?
Baso?
I heard your father Mouna Rudo has mobilized lots of men for this hunt?
"Yeah, but what can we hunt in those disappearing forests?"
You've about hacked down all the trees on our hunting grounds
If we don't go hunting now we'll have nothing left once the trees are all gone
Tado Mouna!
You'd better watch your mouth!
Savages will always be savages
They have no manners at all
Wait!
Pawan?
What is the kid doing there?
Pawan!
Chief Mouna!
My hunting ground is right here!
Temu Walis?
You red-foot pheasant!
Don't you know this is the Mehebu hunting ground?
Mouna!
It's just a misunderstanding
This is the first time my eldest son goes hunting
Sloppy.
They must have been delighted that you showed up.
- You next.
- Me?
"Yes, yes, you."
Enlighten us.
Do.
"Um, OK."
I'm Tony Stonem.
I go to college...
I live in...
"I actually said enlighten us, don't bore us, Mr Stonem."
"Speak about yourself, about your motives, your drive, your animus."
"Don't know what animus means, do you?"
- Yes.
I know what it means.
"- Well, I'm relieved."
"You see because at this university, we don't have room for the inarticulate."
"I think I'd better go, then."
Bye.
Good.
"So Tony, you were about to tell us just how extremely clever you are."
- I'm not that clever.
"- Oh, he's clever all right."
Really?
Touching.
Sadly lacking in substance.
"At our university you have to have verve, a sense of charisma - intellectual thrust."
"And that's what we're here to do this afternoon, is find out whether you're a giver."
- Whether you're...
- Willing to sleep with the lecturers?
- I'm sorry?
"The, um, autograph defense."
Exactly.
"So if the print won't do it, maybe what's inside"
The print will.
Now you lost me.
I'm gonna break down
The chemical compound in coop's fingerprint.
"Within that, I think there may be something he can't refute."
"Dimethicone silicone- based lubricant,"
And cells consistent with lambskin.
Lambskin?
That's a condom.
Exactly.
Coop was wearing a condom.
So was anna's rapist.
This spectra has a unique chemical signature.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna run it against the spectra from anna's sex kit.
¶ ¶
"So, um, what kind of condom do I use?"
What's my favorite?
My brand of choice?
I rarely use them.
"So it's kind of a, um,"
Personal question.
"Actually, it's evidence."
Really?
There were specific traces
In anna kitson that we also found
In the oil of your fingerprint.
That print is the same as the one on the murder weapon.
"So, just to get this straight, you raped anna,"
I carry them with me always.
Until tomorrow then...
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Good work.
Marianne.
"You covered Shakespeare, Scott, poetry."
"When you know his views on romance, you'll have nothing left to talk of."
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.
Should I hide my regard?
- No.
But we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.
"Seven years is too little for some, seven days is enough for others."
- Or seven hours.
In this case.
- I feel I know him already.
"Had I more shallow feelings, I could perhaps conceal them as you do."
- I'm sorry...
"- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne."
I do not understand her.
Marianne...
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No.
Patience.
You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?
They're sending someone to take care of the whole thing.
"Jeez, earl."
You really are crazy.
Who in the hell would the government send?
"Kent MansIey, unexplained Phenomena."
-Marv Loach.

-What happened?
Not sure.
"Sometimes the line'II snap if the weather is bad, sure."
But for a whole tower to get twisted up like that... .
It's got me beat.
It's almost like it was bitten off by some enormous beast.
Enormous beast.

Escaped gorilla?

Let's put it this way.
"Once in a while, things happen..."

people wanna know the government has a response.
I am that response.
So were there any witnesses?
"well, sir, if you'II just follow me."
We did find this.
"United States Government, huh?"
Guess that means something big's happening here.
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
Take charge of the starboard gangway.
- Keep the prisoner below.
- Flagship's jolly boat alongside!
- Take me to the captain!
"- This way, sir."
"He came with the prize-ships, and stayed with the admiral."
- I've brought an urgent dispatch.
- Give that to me.
It's happened!
They've done it at Spithead!
The fleet mutinied!
- The Admiralty agreed to this?
"- Every item, sir."
All you asked for.
Look.
Full pardon for all those involved has been signed by His Majesty the king.
"- This changes things, don't it?"
- It changes everything.
"Well, lads, you heard the news!"
What happens to us?
"I'll go to the admiral, and I'm sure I can promise you everything you wish."
So long as I leave an orderly ship behind me.
I want all officers set free immediately!
Bring them on deck!
You can't let them go!
You're throwing it all away!
"Jenkins, release the midshipmen!"
- Release the officers.
- Release the officers.
"Please come on deck, sir."
- What happened?
- Mutiny's over.
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"" in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
That's lovely.
- Yes.
- Alicia's loving it.
"Lovely, because from death emerges life."
- From the male emerges the female.
- Of course.
From the earth emerges...
The...
The... tree?
No.
From the earth emerges...
The... flowers?
No.
The ethereal.
"The ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly."
Of course.
And I've got the music.
By Penderecki.
"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths, I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now."
You're going to flip out.
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."
Though you look gorgeous.
"""Trenches"" must be made."
And I shall.

Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
[victor] you will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done
By the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands
Which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
- Petition!
"- Why fear the word ""mutiny""?"
- I'm not afraid of it if it fits but it don't.
"Seize one ship, that's mutiny."
No one ever got away.
"- Seize the fleet, nothing they can do."
- They can't hang every man.
We'll make them listen to us.
Until then spread the gospel.
Same as back at Spithead.
Yeah.
"Wait, and wait, and wait."
"Yes, Evans."
Wait.
Until the time comes.
"And when the time comes, Vizard..."
Scott-Padget!
"Mr. Kilpatrick, you've been before the board three times."
- Each time you've failed.
"- Yes, sir."
"- What age are you, 33, 34?"
- Thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
- Your chances are getting slight.
"- Yes, sir."
Unless the board had reason to believe you had special qualities.
"- Special qualities, sir?"
"- Ingenuity during difficulties courage, loyalty to a particular officer an officer with influence, who might use it."
"Yes, sir."
"I think I see, sir."
"You're in charge of disciplining midshipmen, right?"
- Make them kiss a gunner's daughter.
"If they discover the secret of this cursed village, nothing will stop them from taking revenge."
Let the ghosts come.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Let them come and see the captain!
God or devil.
Come and have your throats slit.
"Come on, then."
"Come on, ghosts."
"Come on, phantoms."
"Come on, demons."
Come back and see the captain.
I challenge you.
You died tonight.
I will kill you again!
We have to shut him up or he'll tell them everything.
He's drunk
I saw your heads smashed against the rocks!
What the hell is going on?
I don't want any trouble here
It's morning.
We're closing now.

It happened one windy night
It happened one stormy night

Innocence destroyed by rape

"Amounting now, to 17.5 million including interests"
And I'm charging you only bank rates
I know Shekhar

"Mouna, he's one of our own"
"No one can ever run ahead of me, you hear?"
"Come on, Labay!"
Are you alright?
Laying railway tracks?
It's no easy task in the mountains
In order to harvest the natural resources in those forests we need to have proper transportation
Yeah
It's a shame to leave those resources undeveloped but those savages up there...
Sir?
"Here she is, sir"
"She dares not lead you past Hakaw Supeitei, Captain"
She'll spend the night in her father's house in Meisi
She won't accompany you to the hunting grounds of other clans
Much obliged
Let's go!
Captain?
Those savages in the mountains are rather ferocious
Please be careful!
Hey!
"Hey, it's your turn now"
Wow!
How beautiful!
"Yes, indeed"
It was so dark last night that we didn't notice we're surrounded by cherry blossom trees
Cherry blossoms?
They really are cherry blossoms
It's so red
Red as blood

Japonian martxotik aurrera iristen hasi zitzaizkigu heien antzeko sintomen kontakizunak.
Hasi nintzen susmatzen menturaz osasun kalteak handiagoak zirela telebistetan kontatuak baino.
"Ikerketan hasita, amak galdezkatu nituen, eta ohartu nintzne egoera zinez arriskutsua zela."
Hau martxo bukaera aldean gertatu zen.
Apirila bukatutakoan Japonia osotik hasi nintzen jasotzen hitz egiteko gonbiteak.
"Noan leku guztietan, Txernobylen gertatutakoen antzekoak entzuten ditut."
Haurretan oso antzeko sintomak aurkitzen ditugu.
Zu eta zure taldeak antolatu zenuten Japonian haurrentzako lehenbiziko kontsulta.
Esango diguzu zein izan zen gurasoen erantzuna?
Nola esango nizuke...
"Gure lehen asmoa zen besterik gabe gurasoei aukera ematea Txernobylgo haurrak ikusiak zituzten medikuekin hitz egiteko, lasaitu zitezen."
Baina teléfono deiak ez zitzaizkigun gutxitu.
Ohartu ginen konbidatu genituen medikuak ez zirela aski.
Berehala dei egin behar izan genien mediku boluntarioei.
"Hala ere sekulako jendetzak deitzen zuen, askori esan behar izan genien ez etortzeko."
Ikusten ari garen osasun arazoak ez dituzte erakutsi komunikabide nagusietan.
Baina SOS dei asko jaso dituzue.
Egia da.
Geuk ere begiratu dugu ea zer ari den gertatzen oraintxe.
"Fukushimako osasun kontsultaz eta osasun arazoen zainketa independienteaz egin dugu erreportajea; mesedez, ikusi ondoko bideoa."
"Fukushima hiria, Fukushima probintzian [zentral nuklearretik 60 kilometrora]."
Ekainean ekin zitzaion haurren osasun kontsultari.
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Fukushimako Sarea""ren ekipoak antolatu zuen."

"(Energetic) ""Hurricane"" MV THE END!"
This is Washington D.C.
After a little break some members will get ready.
I heard Him Chan and Jong Up will be filming first.
I didn't want to waste time in the hotel.
I heard the set is near here so I came out to skateboard.
I like it here so much.
"Hi, I'm Him Chan."
"""Hurricane"" MV is over."
We were filming for a real long time.
There were many different places we went to.
"And today, we came over to Washington D.C."
"As soon as we got here, Jong Up and I had to film for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV."
So we're out here and it's pretty nice.
Zelo is here too.
Zelo seems to like America a lot.
Look at him.
But I'm a little worried about something.
L.A. and San Francisco were very natural and free cities.
Washington D.C. seems like a noble place.
I'm worried that Zelo will get scolded.
We're at the MV shooting set.
Wish us luck.
Goodbye.
We're heading to New York now.
New York is the final destination.
We'll try our best in NY too and head back safely.
We're finally in NYC.
Honestly we wanted to go to JFK airport.
We'll go to Korea from JFK.
"Cind-who? fuck'n ""rella""?"
Jesus!
Who the hell's naming these kids?
Goddamn my head.
So it turned into a yearly ritual.
Is that a crime?
Yes.
"OK I have a huge family, and yes OK I may have snuck into their homes after dark - but only because I didn't want to wake them."
What?
I told you - I'm not one to skimp on the Gandja..
Ahhh... it's called MUNCHlEEEES.
Ya - all I did was eat a few cookies and maybe grab a glass of milk?
And are you forgetting I DlD leave them a few gifts?..
So what?
What's the difference if I do the Return or someone else does the return for me?
They still get to exchange it for something they want.
Oh come-on.
I'm sure a toddler can find something cool from Joe's Big-Boy Shop.
What?
No fuck'n way!
You can't pin that on me!
I have absolutely nothing to do with that kid Jesus.
I want a lawyer.
"Yo Guys, it is Keralis, I am here just to tell ya that I am livestreaming."
"Um, hm."
That's right.
Keralis space program.
Www.
Triple w. twitch.tv/Keralis links the description.
I'm gonna be playing some Kerbal space program... and Outlast.
"That's right guys, with face cams."
It's gonna be fun.
They were four.Selim...
"Son of the Yaşarans', Selim."
Shut up.Don't mention their names.
They are very powerful people.They'll get out of jail in two days... ... and come back to do you even more harm.You hear me?
They were all at the engagement party.
I've given their punishment.
I've punished them.I'll tell you everything once we're out of here.
Please Fatmagül.Okay sweetie?
- Who is it?- It's me.
- Where have you been?- I'm back.
Making me wait here for hours.Locked in this room.
Kendin geziyorsun tabi maaşallah.
Do you have to brush me downas soon as I'm back?
I was busy with work and stuff.It's not like I'm late on purpose.
You don't carewhat this woman is doing with no money.
I didn't even eat anything.
"- Okay, okay."
"I'll order something now.- You're very generous, thank you."
"Hey, okayI am sorry."
"I said sorry, girl."
"Okay, I've acted like a jackass.I'm sorry."
"Okay, I won't be late next time."
Mukaddes you're prolonging this.
Look at me.
Look.
Smile.
As if I could smile right now...
"Anyway, I shall go wash my face."
"And then we go and eat, okay?"
"- So, did you go to the doctor?- Tsk."
[No]
"I went to the nursery school, to see my son."
I sure know that.
I would like to ask you something.
But tell the truth.
The whole truth.
What did you use before this performance?
"Rolls with meat pie,... and green tea."
Some meat pies are good dopes.
"All right, where's the talent?"
She has something strange...
"I don't think you had to use something, you're just that kind of type."
"You have no extreme talent, but you enjoy the singing, and I wanted to see it to the end."
A lot of energy comes out of her!
- Certainly!
"- It's strange, Paľo."
Yes for me!
- Strange.
- I felt good.
Something painful.
Mournful.
The singing grobian here just wants some notes...
Galee mein maarey pherey He walks around in the street

"- It looks like a radio, no? -well...."
"-ow, ouch. -oh son, not so loud we can't hear a thing. which song can I play for you?"
"-The one by Sepito -No, no."
Ask for help stupid
Do you have the one called 'help stupid'?
"-No, no."
Ask to be rescued!
"No, I don't want to leave."
"Don't get me wrong Federica, but nothing could make me go back to the City Peluche, never ever..."

Help!
Hello?
Anyone?
SOS?
"-SOS, or whoever."
-Speaking...
I'll put some clothes on.
So you are the Major?
I was the Major.
I guess to some I still am.
"Now, Terry here was my right-hand man back in the glory days."
"That was a long time ago, mate."
Why'd you get out of it?
I was a crazy bastard back then.
This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
I'm taking pictures right now.
All the passersby's look incredible.
I want to ask so many of them
lf I could take pictures of them.
There are tons of people who look much better than we do
They look very modelesque.
I got this stain from a hotdog I ate earlier.
I guess I'm clumsy sometimes.
Thankfully I dropped it after I finished my scene.
Dae Hyun and Yong Guk are filming at Time Square and Central Park fountain.
It's like a dream.
When else would we come here to film for a MV!
"Right now, we are at Central Park."
We're here because Dae Hyun is filming.
He's filming for the MV right now.
And I'm just going there to watch him.
"At Central Park,"
The trees are all very tall and the air is very fresh.
Look over there.
It's a horse.
I've only seen it in NY I think.
Horses in NY!
You don't see that often elsewhere.
Horses on the streets.
This place sure is humongous.
The trees are enormous and the streets are wide.
It's one thing that stands out about America.
This place is so big I feel like I'm in a giant's forest.
Dae Hyun is a natural at acting.
This place is Central Park.
ln the middle of Central Park
I took a picture over there by the fountain.
It's my first time on an elevator in Las Vegas.
You haven't in the hotel?
Did you walk up to the hotel room?
We were on the 20th floor.
- We didn't film then.
- You're right.
That's why this is my first time.
"Wow, elevators in Las Vegas go up too."
Same as Korean ones.
Great work.
It feels just like Las Vegas.
Great work.
We're in Las Vegas.
We just finished shooting for the MV.
I had an all-nighter yesterday and couldn't sleep today.
I just woke up in the middle of my nap to come to the shooting.
The director expected me to look awake.
"So I was jumping around, trying to be hyper."
Thankfully the scenery was great
So I could get in a happy mood.
(Satisfied) I'm feeling pretty good now.
I'm all done filming so I'll be leaving with the photographer.
None
We played like crazy on the bus.
You can only check it out in the MV.
We'll be all done at the desert.
The desert scene is the final one.
"""We're Hurricane, We're Hurricane"""
I've gone insane.
I've been up for almost 24 hours.
We're heading to the desert now it'll take about 20-30 minutes.
"It's where the scorpions live, my favorite."
"- Wait, Georgia."
"- Georgia, don't go."
- Georgia!
"Georgia, what are you doing?"
You'll be late for your first day back at school.
I'm coming.
"- Georgia, Mummy wants you."
- Libby.
"Oh, flip, flipper and flipping hell!"
Excusez-moi.
C'est trés grotesque.
If you don't mind?
Oi!
Cheeky.
"Libby, stop putting Angus in the fridge."
"What do you want for breakfast, munchkin?"
Stuffed olive?
"Just because I did something so beyond the Valley of Sad City last night it doesn't give you the right, as my parents, to humiliate me further."
Today is the first day of my life as the new Georgia.
"And who is she, my little elf?"
"She's not an ""elf""."
Not a munchkin.
"She is a mature, sophisticated woman called Ms Georgia Nicolson."
"So, to celebrate the new me,"
I've decided what I want to do for my birthday party this year.
"I want a proper party in a club, with a D.J."
"You're not old enough to get into a club, never mind hire one out for a party."
"If you haven't noticed, I'm a woman now."
I wear a bra!
Bob.
Are you really trying to damage me permanently?
"There's no way that you are having a party in a club where there's drinking, and it's full of randy men."
He's TlNY!
"Even the mythical creature he's based on, the Tsuchinoko, is typically described as around 10 to 30 inches long- tops!"
"But in the official games, little Dunsparse is- er-"
WHAT?!
4 foot 11 inches???
But. . .uh
Why you make him so little?
I-I don't understand.
"Joining Dunsparce in the things-that-are-way-longer than-you'd-think club is Dratini, another serpant like Pokémon."
He's the first pokémon in his line so I've always thought of him to be the little guy.
WRONG!
5 foot 11 inches.
Longer than the average height of humanity.
"Also, this was always weird to me."
Dratini:
6ft long.
Dragonaire:
13ft long.
Dragonite:
7ft long.
Where?
Where does it all go???
Let's check out some spherical pokémon.
"I've always pictured guys like Glalie, Fortess and Gastly to be around a foot long or a little bit bigger than a basketball."
NOPE!
These guys are actually all 4 to 5 ft long.
See this guy?
See that giant ball?
That's a 5ft beach ball! and THAT is what your Glalie is gonna look like in real life.
"And yes, It is terrifying!"
"At last, at almost 48 feet long, Wailord is by far the longest pokémon in existence- over 17 ft longer than the second longest, Steelix."
"But weight-wise, Wailord doesn't make ANY sense."
Front side of the building Don't move
I'm five seconds away 4 seconds 3... 2...
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Are you okay?
I thought you were going to propose!
I thought you wanted a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant.
And we never play games with fires.
How could you not know that?
What?
"Hey, Lee Jin-woo..."
The movie's starting.
Shhhh.
"Hwi-chan, look at me."
Did you do your homework?
Then you better go home right away and do it.
Don't play on the computer.
"Do the homework first, okay?"
I have to stay here for a few days.
"You'll be fine on your own, right?"
You won't?
When have I ever not been alone?
"Yes, my Hwi-chan can do great on his own."
Your mom will do well too.
And I'll try to do better once I get out of here.
But you need to promise me one thing.
Show me your diary every day.
After school I went to the hospital to see Mom.
"Mom is hurt, so she has to stay there a few days."
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and show Mom my diary as I promised.
It's nice...
"Now Mom doesn't work late, she doesn't drink, and I can see her whenever I want."
"Well, let me say first of all thank you for haveing my mama at the White House [oh, yeah] for the Easter, that was a beautiful event and she was so [applause] and she was so thrilled to be there."
It was great having her [applause] she's terrific
We even got Bo in there.
"Bo's there, Tony's there..."

It was my mother's dying wish.. ..to take the entire 'Bhajan Mandli' group along with their family.. ..on a trip to Badrinath.
Please do come.
Of course.
Please join us on the trip.. ..and pray for my mother's soul.
My mother.
Why do souls become restless after they die?
"I mean, once you're dead it's the end of all problems."
Why become restless?
That's not it.
Suppose the deceased has a unfulfilled wish.
Then his son will fulfil it.
You won't go on the trip.
Get that.
Her mother was in the hospital for two years.
And he didn't even come take a look.
He was making dollars in America.
This charade is for the world.
Not for his mother's soul.
Let's hope the best for them.
Amin.
"I told them, they shouldn't come all the way back here."
"So, I'll just have what will be delivered to Kuzey."
And I'll take it to them.
Boot licker.
That's good.
You thought well.
"Actually, Sami Amca wanted me to present at the jail as well."
"He said, it would make Kuzey very happy even if I'm just waiting at the door."
"But, I'll see."
Where did Sami Amca say that to you?
In your dream?
"Cemre, what are you talking about?"
Silly girl.
"I got used to it, Gülten Teyze."
This is just a sample of our dialogues with Cemre.
I bet you took a day off from work for this.
"Dear, why don't you go and put the cookies in the oven?"
I got some other stuff to do as well.
You don't worry about me.
"- So give me what you have, and I'll take it to them."
"- No need, I'll do it myself."
"What, are you going too?"
Come on...
"But mom, it's not ready anyway."
What should I do?
- Rush it while Zeynep is poising over me?
"- Well, I can't wait, if it's not ready."
"Also, she might put it into trash or change my letter."
"I won't take the risk, thanks."
"Okay, Cemre..."
I don't feel I'm driving.
I can't wait til next family gathering.
"Friday, 5pm., I'm sure  I'll get there on time."
Especially wishes.
"Wow, a good driver..."
I bet it's a woman.
"Damn, we spend so much  money on legal music and software."
If I was a driving examiner  I'd also give him a driving licence.
He's driving really well.
I can't wait til I can use toilet in the train.
30 MPH on the fast lane?
Great!
I can't keep up with those  new faces in politics.
"Easy, elderly lady can go."
I'm not in a hurry.
"Damn, my train is too early again!"
Cart is full but I still have  so much money in my wallet!
Vodka?
Not today.
I have to clean after my dog.
I'm driving.
"You know, I love my boss."
Are you crazy?
I'm working tomorrow.
Good that I finish full-time studies.
At least I have a job guaranteed.
I don't remember when  I last ate pork chops.
I'm sick of this sun!
I've always been interested in  tennis and cross-country.
Even when we weren't successful.
I'm sure that everything I study  will be useful on labor market
Socks and sandals?
My poor daughter!
What am I doing?
"He wants to be the king, but what is he doing?"
You mean the one who's stopping the ship is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
"Yes, he's the one who helped both of us."
He's so cool!
So that's why he couldn't reveal his identity to me!
"This is all secret, so please do not let on that you know."
I'll be on my way now.
Wait!
Take me to him!
I don't think just anyone can meet him.
"In that case, please deliver a message for me."
"She says she respects you, Sir Moonlight Black Hat."
"You told her to not do anything, right?"
"Yes, but she said she wants to meet you."
She can't.
It won't be good to be involved with me.
We can't meet.
I really want to meet him again.
He seems like such a cool person!
"If I knew it'll be like this,"
I should have asked me for a business card!
So such a man existed?
He must be a true Joseon hero!
He disguises himself in the moonlight and rescued civilians in need!
I wish I could be like that too.
Then why don't you disguise yourself and go out in the moonlight?
How could I do that?
Why not?
You're a warrior who knows how to fight.
He's Sir Moonlight Black Hat.
"We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling me to help kill Klaus."
What the hell are you doing?
I needed her to know about the coffin.
"And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie."
"So what are you going to do, Stefan?"
Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone?
"Don't tempt me, Elena."
"I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan."
And I need Elena to help me find her.
Find who?
What are you talking about?
I couldn't place her face at first.
Then I realized...
"Oh, my God, Bonnie."
Who is this?
It's my mom.
Los alamitos?
"Um, too old."
Honolulu?
"Ugh, I wish."
How many of these are there?
A lot.
I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
I know we haven't been able to really...
That things have been weird because of Jeremy.
So thank you for helping me with this.
I know you have a lot to deal with.
"There's nothing more important, Bonnie."
It's surreal.
Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid.
"You know you don't have to, right?"
Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin.
We're in New York. other members have to shoot but I finished my part in D.C. yesterday.
So Jong Up and I went shopping.
The jumbo screens assure me that this really is Times Square!
B.A.P has finally arrived at Times Square.
It's an honor.
It really is an honor.
I still can't believe it.
Times Square.
This is Time Square.
I've only seen it in pictures.
This is my first time here.
All this fanciness.
ls that a celebrity?
Who's that?
one two okay. one two.
The weather is awesome today.
The buildings around here are tall so usually this street gets less sunlight.
But today the sun's shining so much.
"(Very satisfied) Wow, good."
That dog looks happy too.
"Yo, New York City."
We're headed to the set feeling like we're VlP.
"Today, we're filming at MTV in Time Square."
We'll be customizing shoes and painting murals.
Time for some cultural activities.
It feels more like playing rather than working.
You know what I'm saying?
I'll be styling my own shoes.
I'll be making one-of-a-kind shoes.
This looks like a really famous shop. for street artists.
It seems many famous street artists have come through here.
I wanted to make my outfit or shoes with this printing.
"Of course, I got carried away a little bit after that."
No harm or nothing done.
It was just innocent.
We thought it was just normal innocent stuff.
"What about the music, speaking of the dance."
Who played music at that time around here?
That would have been
Jule Gillespie and Pat Bonner and
Walter McCauley.
"Maybe Robert Palmer, Edward's brother."
"Russell, one of the [?] guys or something."
There's a lot of people - a lot of them can make music
Family type stuff...
Jules - Mary's mother...
Mary can sing.
Mary Palmer.
If you can ever get her to sing.
"Richie Gillespie is a good singer, if you can ever get him to sing."
"He used to - twenty years ago him and Rich [?] could - you name it, they'd play it."
Richie'd sing as good as anybody you've ever heard.
"But Jules's wife, she could sing too."
She was a real good singer.
What kind of music?
Just the regular stuff that you hear on the tapes.
The country type or whatever you want to call it.
Were anybody left that actually did any step dance?
Mm-hmm.
The Dodie guys would just ... wife here a couple weeks ago...
Uncle Joe [?]
"Gallagher, and Uncle John he lived over where [?] is."
He was a big guy.
"Not quite like me, but big guy."
"- I left it in the hotel room. oh, you left it there?"
This is the point!
None
"I found out from my fan cafe, that they thought these were arm warmers."
"But guys, these aren't arm warmers."
I just put this mask on my wrist.
(Simple-minded)l didn't want to lose it.
I lose things pretty often...
So I try to always hang my belongings on my body.
- My camera - Did you shut the door?
of course you did.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
- What are we filming today?
- We're filming for the MV.
"I want to live in a house like this one day. &amp;lt;""Coffee Shop"" MV First main character Dae Hyun&amp;gt;"
I'll have a wife and kids.
My wife will be cooking breakfast and I'll be playing with the kids.
"We'll eat delicious food together, and take a walk with our two puppies."
I'm glad the background looks nice.
At least I won't look tacky.
The place for my MV is the best.
The weather is fantastic.
How do I look?
It's me over flowers.
I can't really smell well because I'm sick.
But real flowers do smell good.
Do I get to rest now?
I was worried because I didn't get good sleep.
But the weather's so good it's very healing.
I'm done.
I took some pictures since I came to America.
You will die in my hands!
But I swore I wouldn't get involved with you again.
"I said leave me, leave!"
I don't use any opportunity .
I don't look at anyone's wife or girl either.
Put this in your goofball head.
Did you get me man?
EPlSODE 5 - Leave me !
What can you do man alone?
"Come on, do it!"
"Mira is my friend and whenever I want to be with her, i will be ."
Got it?
Now get out!
Don't dare to come here again!
What's going on here?
Nothing...
"I came to thank him for helping in the club, but... alas..."
I forgot that we don't talk the same language with our friend.
"It'm not at fault, but I'm sorry for disturbing you.Good night."
What did we talk with you Yaman?
This man came to my door.
What's his trouble with you?
"It's okay, nothing."
"- If you're right you will tell what happened, why do you keep quiet?"
We've solved it already .
There is nothing to tell.
"Come on Ender, anyway we have more important things to do, let's go and talk with Faruk."
Come dear...
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
Thank you.
"What is it ,dear Ender?"
"As soon as you heard ,did you also come to ask for your money?"
From here it looks very small.
"But when you're in front of the statue, I hear you only see the body because it's too big."
That building there is where the 911 terror took place.
So they're rebuilding a new structure there.
"Come to think of it, what's that on the very top? on top of that building there's something like a fork-crane."
The person operating that - must be so scared.
- He must be very scared.
He must have more than one life or something.
I'm sad.
We're heading back to Korea the day after tomorrow.
I wanted to tour more before leaving.
None
New photographer.
He takes out his right hand from his pocket.
"Look that way, looks at the sky, hand on the hat..."
"His hand's up, and back down."
He's walking suavely
He puts his hands in his pockets.
Looking this way.
Don't laugh.
He's laughing. oh no.
He couldn't help but laugh.
"Honestly, it's really embarrassing."
"For both the doer and the watcher, it's embarrassing."
Nice.
I'm done.
We're out in NY right now.
How early did we get ready?
It's 11 AM right now.
"To film at 11 AM,"
You have to start getting ready at 7 AM.
Which means Young Jae and Dae Hyun
"I'm afraid that uh... ...that you're going to have such a direct attack that uh, you're going to get me in the corner, and I'm afraid of that."
I want you to be more on my side.
"You said I'll get you in a corner, and you put your hand on your chest."
-Mm-hmm.
-Is this your corner?
"Well, it's like...yeah, it's...like I'm afraid."
You know.
Where would you like to go?
Can you describe the corner you'd like to go to?
Yeah.
Uh...it's back in a corner where...
I'm completely protected.
And you would be safe of me?
From me?
"Well, I know I wouldn't really, but it feels safe."
[overlapping]
But while you're in this corner you're perfectly safe now.
What would you do in that corner?
I'd just sit.
-Just sit?
-Yes.
How long would you sit?
"I don't know, but this is so funny you're saying this."
This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
"Every time I was afraid, I would feel better sitting in a corner."
Not panicky.
Okay.
Are you a little girl?
"Well, no...but it's the same feeling."
Are you a little girl?
This feeling reminds me of it.
Are you a little girl?
"See you later, L.A."
We're going to San Francisco.
"See you again, L.A."
We just arrived in San Francisco.
"Before MV filming, we're going to San Francisco hamburgers."
"Tigger here, Tigger there."
"Lately, fans have been sending a lot of Tiggers."
We have so many Tiggers at home.
"Tigger staring at me here, Tigger staring at me there."
I'm freaked out.
They look like they're alive.
It looks like they're alive and staring at me.
oh my gosh!
This street is called Union.
The weather's kind of chilly here too.
None
It's a different feeling from L.A.
San Francisco feels a little more antique.
"Very vintage, and each building has its own character."
lf I were to choose between the two cities
I'd pick San Francisco because it's more put-together.
"L.A. is nice too though, it's very casual."
I wish my neighborhood were San Francisco.
This place has a different aura to it.
They're in the same country but they feel different.
"It's a city that goes well with our song ""Coffee Shop"" too."
Just a little bit ago there wasn't this much sunlight.
Thank goodness the sun came out.
Zelo is filming right now.
It's a relief the sun's shining brightly.
I have a feeling today's shoot will be a good one.
I'm done.
SPEAKER 12:
"Take a cab, or drive in a car if I'm by myself."
SPEAKER 11:
Try to park my car close to door openings.
SPEAKER 8:
"And I just try to have a plan in advance, like where I'm going to be parking in relation to walking around campus."
SPEAKER 13:
I know where all the blue lights are on campus.
SPEAKER 2:
Like to try to make a mental note of where all the
little blue light box thingies were.
SPEAKER 14:
I'm just aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 15:
I'm really aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 8:
"I'm not talking, I'm not texting."
SPEAKER 15:
Look at who's behind me.
I don't like people walking behind me.
SPEAKER 2:
"Like if I'm walking by a shop window, I'll look in the window to see if there's a reflection of someone behind me."
SPEAKER 15:
"Because I pay attention to who's walking around me and behind me, especially at night."
SPEAKER 16:
Make sure I have my keys all out and ready for me to get into the house.
SPEAKER 17:
Don't talk to strange adults that you normally don't see around campus.
SPEAKER 11:
You never talk to strangers or guys or take rides or certain things like that.
SPEAKER 17:
I lock my doors.
"Ohh there is bazaar today, I forgot!"
If we enter we can't get out.
You go down on the right!
On the right from here!
"You come also, if you want."
"- No, I will wait in the car, you go!"
Don't hurry !
Good afternoon!
I wanted to move my registration
First let me find your registration here.
"You know how devoted I am sister. but really, i can' t endure Kenan's trouble anymore..."
"What can I say, you're right.- I gave him many opportunities, you know it.. but it's a must to break up."
He lost me.
Don't feel yourself guilty.
It's his choice..
I wrote a letter and send it to him.I told him everything was needed...
Did he ask me when he got into trouble?
Yaman was also angry with this.
"""How can you do this when the guy is in jail?"""
Do you talk with Yaman?
He calls sometimes to ask about you.
I wish you stayed with Yaman aunt!
You wouldn't be apart and your life would be better too.
My life can't be better.
My condemnation is until death.
I will be at ease when I close my eyes.
"Sister, who is Turunc Nadir?"
What? &amp;gt; Turunc Nadir
O don't know...
Who is it?
I heard uncle Hasan and Kenan fighting once.
Kenan threatened uncle Hasan with him.
That's the slight catch.
The job's in New Zealand.
- What?
"- Look, I know it's a big deal and I don't have to decide anything yet."
I really want to discuss it with all the family.
It's a bit of a shock for us all but your dad's not going to do anything we're not happy with.
"Oh, Dad, you should totally go."
What an opportunity.
Yes.
One less parent to deal with.
If Dad goes to New Zealand I can easily get around Mum and have my dream party.
"Now, I just need a plan to show Robbie I'm a natural born snogger."
"So, I've figured out what I've got that Slaggy Lindsay doesn't."
Hair on the back of your legs?
- The Angus advantage.
- What?
Get in!
"Inside, now!"
You will wait for the judge to sentence you.
The prison warden is coming now.
Whoever tries to escape will end up in solitary confinement.
"Don't you know that, Nazif Kara?"
"Why did you try to escape, old man?"
Running to your wife &amp;amp; daughter?!
Tsk Tsk Tsk...
Sit down now!
What happened Kibarim?
I don't know.
"I went out, they pointed the gun at me and caught me."
Who is the rat that told them?
Nejdet wasn't waiting for you outside?
That idiot!
Thank you.good job.
Sister!
"What happened? sister,what happened?"
"Are you okay? something happened to Mahir? sister što se dogodilo? sister, what happened?"
hello
Mr. prosecutor here Muhidin Cicekfrom the police station
"Sorry to bother you at this time,but we had a tip."
Is that so?
"Someone saw the hidden box of bulletsshops in the center, we think it isone of the traders thatalready had a warning,go to search."
"We may need to orderthe arrest of Bulent Tiryakija,the store owner."
Give me an addressbe right there!
"Right away, sir."

"Is there something troubling,Mr. Doctor?"
"No, sir."
"Mahir nothing wrongis going to happen, it's good.The danger has passed."
"God bless you,thank you"
Speedy recovery.!
"Thank you very much, Doctor."
Thank Godthat's over!
"Sister, I wasso worriedhow to tell my dad about this,"
I was afraidWhat will he saythe brother something bad happened.
"It is, gone Songul,"
Do not worry.
Do not worry.
"I'll stayhere tonight, Ilknur."
You go home letyour sister take care of Nazif
"I want to stay with you,Mother."
"Look, you can not be pregnantand take care of the patient?"
"Listen to meand go home, come on."
"Grandma, give me a callif my black uncle asks for meI will immediately come running."
All I fucking cared about... ...was my reputation amongst the firms of England.
"I mean, you've heard all the stories about Millwall, yeah?"
"Last match I went to was Millwall, West Ham."
We're talking a good 10 years ago.
"I mean, we'd been waiting for this match all year."
At Millwall.
Yeah.
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.
We were fucking wired from the start.
"Now, Tommy Hatcher... ...he was their main man back then."
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy to the grounds.
Tommy Jr.
"Always banging on how he brought his kid up, you know, to be like a little pit bull."
"Well, we lost that match."
Three-nil.
And those Millwall cunts started laughing at us.
And I just fucking snapped.
"I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?"
"So I assembled all our troops, and we hunted them down."
I saw that little lad go down.
Tommy!
No!
And I saw his skull get crushed under the boots of the GSE.
I never went to another match after that.
And I left the Major behind.
And that's when I met your sister.
She was my angel.
She really saved me.
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.
And she swore... ...she'd leave me if I ever returned to it.
"We've found someone, 46."
-Take him out first.
-Yes.
"This afternoon, a fire broke out in a Seoul warehouse, 35-year old Lee who was working inside the warehouse was injured from smoke inhalation."
"While rescuing him, two firemen from Dobong Station received burns and are currently in intensive care."
The fire burned down the whole warehouse and $350 thousand worth of property was damaged.
The fire was out after an hour.
The police are investigating the cause based on the witness' depositions.
How did you get here?
I'm okay.
I'm not hurt.
I am the one who's hurt.
I can't take it anymore.
"Every time I hear a siren, my heart drops."
Soo-jeong.
"It's okay, so let's go."
There are other people here.
"No, it's not okay."
Who cares about other people?
"- I care about you, and about myself."
- Soo-jeong.
"These people say you're cool, encouraging that you are a great fireman."
"That's all, isn't it?"
"Su-jeong, that's not it."
"And so they just push you deeper and deeper into the fire, right?"
"Soo-jeong, no..."
You know... how we work here...
You know.
"No, I don't know."
I've forgotten it all.
"When you say 'we', I'm not included, so how can I know?"
"104 this is 10, roger."
"O dear, keep that pan aside."
I will burn myself into ashes.
Will you keep it aside if I tell you?
Have you not told me to do so?
- Let us go out.
It seems son-in-law is going to do something.
Let us not disturb him.
Come on.
"O my dear, is it ok for you if I die?"
It is burning!
Where there is a will there is a way.
"Bhadra, Ranga Rao came to see you."
Let him in.
"- Hey you, come here."
"Sir, Bhadram sir!"
You are my God.
Please save my daughter and me.
She is my only daughter and I brought her up as a doll.
Even my master is also looking her as a doll.. ..but he wants to see her in his home.
He is ready to give 10 lakhs if you accept this marriage.
When crores are coming who needs lakhs.
"I will first use him to finish Venkat, then think this matter."
"My God, 10 lakhs?"
Where are they?
"Here, take them."
"Sir, God has given me an extra tooth but not extra intelligence."
I would have realized your heart if He gave me that.
But I am unfortunate.
This marriage will not happen.
Why is that?
"Every idiot wants to marry my daughter.. ..Sir, I am not talking about him."
"He is pure gold, I am talking about that fellow.. ..who trapped my daughter in the name of love."
"You go on, call him."
Take this over.
- What's up?- It is declared.
And?
I failed.
It happens Don't get your morale down.
It's not like you had to pass it at the first time.
Just don't give up.You can study harder and pass the next one.
Next exam will be... of the next class's .
What?
Gotcha !
Why you..!
You almost got me frozen here!
"- That wasn't nice of you Fatmagül.- It has just been declared, Meryem Abla checked it."
"- I can't believe I passed it!- I'm so happy to hear that, congratulations."
"- Shall we celebrate it tonight?- Okay, talk to you later."
I shouldn't hold you more.
Laters.
"- Teas are on me!- He got frozen, lost his tongue for a moment."
- Naughty you.- Then he tried hard to comfort me.
- You scared my son!- Who wanted the teas again?
Number three.
"Easy, I'll spill them."
- We should let Kadir Bey know about it as well.- Of course.
You call him then.
Fatmagül..!
I'm busy right now.My börek is in the oven.
Thank you God.
Your hala will finish the school next year.Be successful like her.
"But he will finish his school without any break, right?"
- He will go to school and study hard.- Yes.
"I'm so happy Fatmagül.I hope we can celebrate the day... ...you graduate from university,all together."
YJ shoes.
I put my initials on it as well as our team B.A.P.
"To the left, you see this side and to the right, that side."
Walk like this.
Then B.A.P will show.
"So for the left shoe, I drew on the outer side."
"And for the right shoe, I drew on the inner side."
And on the back is our Matoki.
It's good.
I'm 150% satisfied.
It came out very well.
I got some good help.
It's good!
It's great!
I'll be wearing these shoes the day I go back to Korea after the tour.
The sun will be up soon.
The sun should be up soon.
It's 7:10AM now
It's 15 degrees (Fahrenheit) out right now.
"From this street, you can see buildings and bridges over the rivers."
I think the view here is the best in early morning.
"Right now it's early morning, so the setting matches ""Coffee Shop"" perfectly."
"What we're going to do now is, we'll start filming first."
What we'll be filming is.
You two standing like this while alternating singing.
"Lip sync, then that'll be it. - oh no."
- Why?
We both wore hats.
- Both of you?
- But we meet each other in this scene.
Dae Hyun and I were both supposed to be wearing hats.
But I heard later there's a scene where we meet each other.
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely in the best way,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when, We forget about the heartbreaks,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if, (Ooh), you keep me next to you."
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright if, (Alright), we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're twenty-two, (oh-uh-uh-uh-oh),"
Twenty-two!
(I don't know about you)!
"Twenty-two, twenty-two!"
It feels like one of those nights!
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights!
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights!
"You look like bad news,"
"I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"
"Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, hey!"
"I don't know about you, (I don't know about you)!"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if, (Ooh), you keep me next to you."
"You don't know about me, (You don't know about me)!"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright if,"
"We just keep dancing, (dance like we're),"
"Like we're twenty-two, (oh-woah-oh),"
It's our first experience.
I couldn't do anything because I was frozen.
I'm sure Jong Up can do well though.
Jong Up is Americanized.
"lndeed, when this fancy background and"
Jong Up's slick dancing skills...
That was awesome.
I'm enjoying Las Vegas very much.
Filming is fun too.
But my bangs...
I'm gold from head to toe.
"Honestly, it was something I'd wanted to try some time."
I'm honored to have gotten my chance so early.
It's very very nice.
I wanted to visit because of the glamorous scenery.
I'm more excited than usual because we're shooting a MV here.
"More than tension, I'm having so much fun."
There's no time to be tense.
I'm your fan.
Please give me an autograph.
- There was no time to be nervous.
- Can I have an autograph please?
I think those sunglasses suit Bang Yong Guk more for sure.
I'll show you a real performance.
It's about 6 AM right now.
"More so than being very tired, no lies, it's so much fun."
I always feel I'm lacking.
lf I say I'd like to try again
We're good to go for a re-shoot but I still feel like it's lacking.
But that still feels lacking.
I'm not satisfied because it seems the same.
"Alright, all finished. okay"
You've stood strongly on your feet till today.
"You should keep the same stance from now on as well.Better, happier days are awaiting you."
"No one can take them away from you.Very soon, girl."
Your exam results will be announced soon as well.
We will get your good news.You will succeed even more than that Fatmagül.
"My dear, don't let anything pull you down."
Please.
Let's go now.
"And then, the baby rabbit... ... in tears, apologized to his mom."
- Are you asleep?- No.
"Okay, good."
"Then, his mom said to him, ""My son..."""
"""Lying is a very bad thing,"" she said."
"""Children shouldn't lie."""
"""No matter what, they shouldn't lie,"" she said."
"""They shouldn't lie, even if their mothers wants them to,"" she said."
"You are lying to me as well, now."
I know what you said isn't written here.
"- It is written here son.- The Baby Rabbit's story is different, I know it."
"Oh, this is the other *baby rabbit*'s story though."
Which is much better if you ask me.I think it is very good.
Children shouldn't lie.
They should never lie.
You don't lie to me either.Okay son?
Okay then.
Let us sleep now.I'm sleepy.
"Daddy, fireworks were so beautiful, aren't they?"
"They were beautiful, son.Very beautiful."
Close your eyes now.
Sleep well.
"Kerim, come on.It's late."
Good night.
Now Bhadram wants to take his revenge on us.
He wants me to repay all the debt I took from him long ago.
"If I cannot, then he wants me to marry my daughter to him."
It is better for me to hang myself than giving.. ..my daughter to him.
But I did not do it because of you.
What can we do now?
There is a way.
That producer is still waiting with money .. ..in his hands.
If my daughter agree to act in his film.. ..I can give that money to Bhadram.
How can I ask her to act in these circumstances?
"Dad, I will act in the movies."
Clear the debt with that money.
Let me wipe the blood off.
It will go in few days.
May be from that producer.
Hello producer sir!
Greetings!
"When will you give me the advance, sir?"
Do you want me to come to Warangal?
Warangal?
We are moving out from Warangal.
Good bye to you Warangal and good bye for Bhadranna.
"O rain, do not go back having droppe d from the eyes."
Stay with me like the showers and the lightning.
Why did he go away having raised love in my he art
If you want to come will I stop you?
Hey!
Venkat is here!
Venkat!
It has been a long time.
- How are you doing?
Let us go and see what happens.
My Goodness!- I heard that uncle Hasan is afraid of Turunc Nadir.
I made Giray tell him as if Kenan said that he has to take his complaint back or...
Turunc Nadir will get to know about it..
You really don't know?
Did you wake up?
Come.
I didn't know you were home.
"We work at night girl, I wake up only now."
"While you sleep, probably nothing will be left to the bazaar."
I am waiting for you many hours already..
Wait I will wash my face and we will go.
I will leave as you will go to bazaar.
"I am sorry.- No dear, that takes the cake!"
I will come again.
Goodbye!
Say hello to your mom!
-Yes of course!
It means I was deceived but this**** girl and I didn't know.
The account for this will be asked.
"Here you are,- Thank you!"
Have a nice day! &amp;gt; Good day!
"I'm alright, I'm good, sweetie, don't worry."
"Okay , we'll talk later."
"Okay, my dearest, kisses for you too."
Bye - bye!
Are you done?
If yours (Orkun) is worried you can go if you want.Don't let him reproach later.
"I was talking with Eylul, she calls constantly to ask how I am."
Again.
"If you have things to do, I won't keep you."
If you are going to meet and so on...
You start to cop out right away?
"Habibe Hanım, I've brought your ointments."
Habibe called me and said she wouldn't be home.
"But brought them anyway, as I'm on my way to Galip Usta."
I thought I'd find someone in the house.
You shouldn't have.
Because we don't want your medicines from now on.
No one wants your cures in this village anymore.
- Why not?
- You know what your son did.
And you let him get away with it.
Kerim didn't do anything.
So what they say is right...
You're shamelessly denying it.
Look...
You don't know what really is the case.
"- That corrupt family, the Yaşarans are behind it."
"- Get lost, stop slandering people."
I am telling the truth.
It's me who's telling you!
It's me!
I healed your wounds for years!
I swear on everything I know and I believe in.
They put those pisliks crime on my son!
You're still protecting that bastard?
"Leave, now!"
And never knock on any door in this town again.
"If you don't want to be as lowly as her, you should never talk to her again."
"If you were our Ebe Nine, you'd have let them put him into prison."
- You let him get away with it.
- That's not true.
- That's not true.
"- Either way, no body wants you here anymore."
"We're gonna be late.- Be a good boy in there, okay?"
Are you really okay?
"You look very pale, my child.Come, take my arm."
"- Are you here, jerk?- Kerim what are you doing."
Collect yourself.
I will make you pay for everything you did.
"- Come on, Kerim."
What are you doing?- He can't stare at us from there.
"- Abi, it's okay."
"Not here.- Come on, walk inside Kerim."
- He lost it again.
"Take him inside.- Okay, leave it to me."
"- Fatmagül...- We're come, we're coming."
"It's your turn Fatmagül, okay?Don't let them scare you."
"Be brave, stand straight."
You will be victorious.We will be.
My knees are shaking.
My whole body feels stiff.
I've waited for this day for months.
I've waited patiently.
It's time for revenge.
It's time to stand against thosewho tried to take my life away.
Why are you looking at me with hatred?
Why?
Because I didn't yield to you?
Because I didn't loose against youand I didn't accept the life you forced upon me?
You expect me to hang my head in shame as I walk before you.
I'm not the one who should be ashamedand you know that well.
Hence the hate in your eyes.
You wanted to clean your dirty consciences by staining me.
Even giving up your honors for it.
"*""We won't hurt you."
Say something.
Please.
I shouldn't have kidnapped you.
"The car, the bridge, it was too far."
Thank you.
But you shouldn't have lied to me today.
"You can't go off and do things like that, Elena."
Not while Klaus is still alive.
I know.
I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way.
Without me getting in the way.
I didn't plan on kissing him.
"You're better than him, Elena."
You're better than both of us.
Elena's on her way.
Jamie's safe.
"He's a little bruised, but he's safe."
Do you think the hybrid will come back?
You kept your end of the bargain.
Klaus usually keeps his.
You're willing to do all of this for him...
And he's not even your family.
"He is my family, Bonnie."
"I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is."
But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
"When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me."
It drifted away.
"The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got."
I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No at last.
How old are you?
30.
Then you're not a little girl.
No.
Okay.
"So, you're a 30 year old girl, who's afraid of a guy like me."
"Well, I don't even know if -- well, I don't know if I'll be afraid of you."
You -- I get real defensive with you.
Now what can I do to you?
"You can't do anything, but I can sure feel dumb."
And I can feel stupid for not having the right answers.
Now what would it do to you to feel dumb and stupid?
I hate it when I'm stupid.
What would it do for you to be dumb and stupid?
"Let me put it like this, what would it do to me if you were to play dumb and stupid?"
It makes you all the smarter and all the higher above me and then
I really have to look up to you because you are so smart.
"Ah, yeah."
Butter me up.
"No, I think you can do that all by yourself."
"Ah, I think the other way around."
"If you play dumb and stupid, you force me to be more explicit."
"That's been said of me before, but I don't buy it."
I don't think --
Now what you are doing with your feet now?
Wiggling.
[giggles]
"I'm sorry, No Ri."
This is nothing.
I'm already used to it.
"After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun."
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.
I wasn't intending to be funny though...
"Okay, let's just rest for today."
"When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again."
Yes.
What is his sickness?
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.
"Oh, I see."
"That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday."
He can't even do everything he wants to do.
There's no use in your crying.
That's right.
"If it was you, you could have done something to help him."
What can I do?
You're a genius.
"So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it."
"So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri."
Everyone would be grateful towards you.
How does it sound?
"If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?"
"Yeah, please do it."
It's a really good idea right?
Well...
Being a doctor is best for you.
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...
I want to see you like that.
You're incorrigible . . .
Didn't I ever go out with you?
When did you?
When did you ever take me out?
Should I remind you?
On our honeymoon.
"And I thought we'll go to Kashmir, Kulu Manali."
But where did you take me?
- Hubli.
And only because you were getting someone's bungalow free of cost.
"Kishen, you never cared about my feelings."
"Taking me for a movie, dinner, picnic was a farfetched thing."
You never uttered a romantic word to me.
"It takes two to tango, Mala."
You hated me before the marriage and also after.
I don't try to keep myself busy with the restaurant business for no reason.
I didn't go shopping without any reason.
"Kishen, if I am a shopaholic today then you're the reason for it."
"Because I tried to find happiness.. ..in these jewellery, clothes and shoes."
But now I have realised.. ..that I will never be able to find that happiness in all this.
"You found that out after spending 9, 35, 33, 315?"
"No, after wasting 12, 054 days and 23 1/2 hours of my life."
Dad.
Mom.
Mom.
Dad.
Mom.
I will never let you two separate.
Never.
I know I am going to do a crazy thing.
But there's no other way to stop this divorce.
"To change their present, I will have to change their past."
Professor.
They said he only recognized Narin from a picture and pointed her by his hand.
"And they say ""Maybe, if Narin sees him, it will be good for him."""
I won't go.
Nobody can make me go there.
I will die..
Why do you bring this topic up when she is here.
You know better...
I had to say it Mom.
"Of course, it is up to her..."
They are cursed by many people.
"Now, these curses take their toll on their children."
I have never cursed.
This is not my curse...
Not my curse...
It is from my Lord...
"How is Duriye, Doctor Bey?"
Her blood pressure is normal now.
I gave her a medicine and she is sleeping.
"But, we have to be careful."
"It doesn't matter if we are careful, her son is always on her mind."
Have you talked to Narin?
I told her everything.
"But, You have to see it from her side."
Narin said she won't go.
She already did what she wanted to do to us.
She had Mustafa wrapped around her finger.
"She stole my husband, too."
She must be laughing at us right now.
You don't eat...
You don't drink...
"And then you don't have any strength for anything, of course..."
Does a wheelchair suit a handsome young man like you?
"Sir, everyday you buy dozens of goods."
And haggle for just paisa 50 a dozen.
It's a long story.
- How long?
Its 5ft 7 inches long.
"People normally get married to fortunate, lucky and virtuous girls."
But I got a spendthrift wife.
She has changed the entire meaning of expenditure.
She spends my money like water flows.
Sometimes she shops for so long.. ..that she takes a blanket and a pillow.. ..and sleeps in the Home Department of the mall.. ..so that she can get up again in the morning and start shopping.
I'm done with shopping for small things.
The real shopping..
I will do it tomorrow.
Not just that.
If the stereo of the car doesn't work.. - She buys a new stereo.
"No, she buys a new car."
And look.
Do you see this dress?
Its worth 2.5 lakhs.
She says that Mallika Sherawat wore this dress in 'Murder'.
What do you say?
- Mallika Sherawat wore a dress in 'Murder'.
When?
- That's exactly what I say.
That's why I come here from Lokhandwala... ...to buy cheap fruits and vegetables.
"Brother, I pray that even Osama Bin Laden.. ..doesn't get a wife like mine."
"Oh, God."
- You intentionally ruined the dress.
"Mala, why would I do anything like that?"
Because you don't want me to look pretty.
That isn't possible anyway.
"Whether I do something or not, it would make no difference."
That's the equation -- this is the line that ... of
"solutions to 2x-y=0 my first row, first equation."
"So typically, maybe, x equal a half, y equal one will"
work.
And sure enough it does.
"Okay, that's the first one."
Now
the second one is not going to go through the origin.
It's
always important.
Do we go through the origin or not?
"In this case, yes, because there's a zero over there."
"In this case we don't go through the origin, because if x and y are"
"zero, we don't get three."
"So, let me again say suppose y is"
"zero, what x do we actually get?"
"If y is zero, then I get x is minus"
three.
"So if y is zero, I go along minus three."
So there's
one point on this second line.
"Now let me say, well, suppose x is"
minus one -- just to take another x.
"If x is minus one, then this is a"
"one and I think y should be a one, because if x is minus one,"
then I think y should be a one and we'll get that point.
Is that right?
"If x is minus one, that's a one."
"If y is a one, that's"
a two and the one and the two make three and that point's
on the equation.
Okay.
This is Brooklyn.
My last solo filming remains.
It's raining so much right now.
I'm filming a piano scene today.
I hope it comes out well.
"This piano has been with me since the days of ""I Remember""."
Do you remember?
This piano from the gun shot scene and raining scene.
"It's returned for ""Coffee Shop"" as well."
Wearing a white t-shirt and sneakers.
That's my ideal girl.
ls there any girl who looks good in a white t-shirt and sneakers?
The staff has a harder time for this shoot.
"I just need to rap, but everyone else... is out of breath."
The fountain suddenly burst.
All the sound equipment is in there but the fountain suddenly burst.
lsn't this the beauty of filming?
Hey that dog is taking a bath.
He seems happy.
Look at him drinking water.
We're done.
I'm done filming.
Him Chan and Jong Up were supposed to film here too.
But the NY weather is not good today.
It's cold and raining a lot.
"Unfortunately, we have to stop filming."
So everyone has to go to the studio for group filming.
There's more working than playing in NY.
But I'm still happy.
When else could I come here?
We just talked about our taste for music and dancing.
He says I have very good control.
"May it be easy, dot com.."
What's up?- you tell me..(the news comes from you).
What?
I am saying news come from you.
Anyhow you follow the two sides.
"What are you saying, man?"
"I'm saying anything... whatever, what can i tell you.."
"What kind of a girl are you, man?"
How do you play with everyone separately?
"Look here, you, what are you bullying around?"
"While your best friend was living a tragedy last night, you went to hang out with the others."
How was it?
Did you have fun at least?
"Whith who did i go, i don't understand?"
With Hale and others...Now you blackbirded to Mira for atonement....
Congratulations.
"I'm looking, even there is no Sun to have affected your head.But firstly, last night I was at home all the time ."
We talked with Mira by phone until this morning.
"So ,this night you were not with Orkun and others?"
First repair your head...
Unbalanced!
Well balanced!
(Stable) !
"Yaman, where?"
"I am going to the other side to my neighborhood,I have things to do on the reeve."
Jump in..
"No, thanks, the bus is coming.."
"Come on, get it."
I was going to piano lesson.
I could not stay at home.
"I wanted to get out as soon as possible. get in, i 'il drive you, and we can talk as well."
I will get out by the metro station.
OK you can stop.
Thank you.
OK for our next one we're going to dribble and we're going to switch hands every time we dribble the ball.
OK?
So you're going to dribble until I say stop.
"OK, try again."
"OK, that's good."
Thank you.
You're going to come around to the side and we're going to put our knees on the red pad.
You're going to keep your feet in the air like this.
OK?
And you're going to push up until I tell you to stop.
Try to keep your back nice and straight and we're going to push down and up.
Ready?
Begin.
OK keep that back nice and straight and try to bend your arms up and down.
There you go.
And stop.
OK.
For our last activity we're going to lay down on the carpet.
We're going to put our hands next to our side.
We're going to sit up and bring your hands up to your knees and back down.
Up and down.
OK?
So you're going to sit up until I tell you to stop.
Ready?
Begin.
Good and try to make sure you get your shoulders off the ground.
There you go.
And Stop.
OK Reagan that was our last activity.
Thank you so much for letting us work with you today!
"Duriye Teyze, I swear..."
You should have seen it..
"He aimed at the most vile, problematic person in the garden..."
Oh Gosh...
Unbelievable...
"Yasar dude, have you seen what your brother did?"
Good job...
"You are raising a child there, it seems.."
Why didn't you play long donkey and five stones?
The man has gone...
My husband has gone...And you don't even care...
My son has gone...
"It is only Narin who can do something about this, but... the Doctor is not going to say anything to her, either."
Give that to me...
You go and bring the cold meals from the downstairs.
Stuffed grape leaves and beans...
Asiye!
Go away!
Don't spill your poison here...
It is easy for you to say go...
You didn't see Mustafa in the nuthouse.
"But, I did."
I wish I were blind and didn't see him in that condition.
He is finished Hatun Abla.
They ruined my husband!
"Not just me, he doesn't even recognize his parents."
He looked at us as if he was a five year old kid.
They just don't diaper him; it is that terrible...
"We took old pictures there,  thinking that they may help him to remember..."
He only recognized Narin.
He pointed at her with his finger.
He has kept only... ...Narin in his mind.
If I kill him now.. ..he will become a hero in her eyes.
He must not become a hero.
"Hey Godess Laxmi, daughter of ocean God."
Take the Arathi baby.
Why are you looking me like that?
I have really changed.
I promise.
Come here I will explain you.
I accept that I am a bad man.
But I am not a bad father.
Sit down.
For the first time in my life I worshiped the God.
I took one decision after I prayed to all the Gods.
To perform your marriage with Venkat.
You are not understanding me.
I am not against your love.
I just want to know one thing.
"What is the difference.. ..between me, who is useless and him?"
I dont have any job and neither does he.
I am spending my time in clubs and he in the petrol bunk.
I dont have any shame so I am running this family.. ..by borrowing money from others.
But he is very hotblooded.
What will he do?
How will he earn money and look after you?
The house owner does not understand your love.
He demands his rent every month.
"The milk man, the provision store owner.. ..no one will understand your love."
Every one demand money.
How will you manage?
Did I say anything wrong?
He is also trying for a job.
What is his fault if he failed?
Again a pig?
No.
A lion.
No.
"I have to say it, it is a stupid, racist sentence, but it is also true:"
Somali people are always shouting.
It is always the real big drama.
This was a german Reunification-Shout.
This was a Bone-Breaking-Shout.
I can't bare certain pictures.
"When I see a cruel picture, a bloody picture,"
I loose consciousness a fall to the ground.
This happend for the last time in Berlin in the subway.
There are screens called Berliner Fenster.
"They showed an advertisment for a CD recorded by the German Opera, Semiramide by Rossini."
Then they showed a photo from Pulitzer Awards.
It was taken in the National Theatre in Mogadishu.
You see a man lying on the ground with summer clothing.
"The sun is shining, he smiles."
"There is a hole in his head, there's blood and parts of his brain everywhere."
When I saw this I fainted.
Oh God!
I worked with cruel pictures as well.
A serbian colleague asked me to participate in her performance.
She experienced the Kosovo-war when she was 15.
She described a footage that she saw.
That was broadcasted in the TV.
A prisoner was tied to a column.
His skull was cut open alive.
And the liquid from his brain was spooned out.
I shoul dance a derwish-dance.
That's a prayer of turkish monks.
of course if they go well as I hope.
"I need to take a breath too, this short holiday will be good for both of us."
"I also would like it very much , my baby but I have to be here on Monday."
"On Friday evening I'll pick you up at Dalaman, from the airport we will go straight to the ship."
"You have a guest, Sude Beylice."
"Yes, of course we'll talk again, see you, bye."
Welcome Sude.
Thank you.
"You know everything, so i get straight to the subject."
"Please , take a sit."
"I came to ask your advice, Mr.Asim."
"After last night's happenings in our life , i really don't know what to do."
Why are you thinking?
Leave it to Faruk to think .
"Yasemin, please bring us some coffee."
Let mine be quite strong please!-Of course.
Tell the captain to prepare the ship for the weekend.
Don't let anything be missing.
"I will invite my friends.- Good ,sir."
"Yes dear, now i'm listening you."
We must do this work before the switch sockets come.
Look!
Master!
I will change my clothes and will go.
"Okay, take your money..(pay)."
What money is that?- It's your pay for the week my boy.
Is that so?
- Were we going to make you work gratis?
May God make it plenty (way of thanking )- Use it with happiness &amp;gt;Thank you.
Hypocrite.
Be careful.
Faker.
It's good that you came.
Come over here.
"Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'"
The timing of the kiss
"I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" this is 4.3 seconds..."
"During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then."
You'll have to do it before she leaves.
"Of course, I have to do it before she leaves."
"But you see, that timing doesn't really work out."
"Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me."
EH?!
"No, I don't want to"
"I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?"
"Please, do it for me."
I'll do it instead.
"Ok, then you do it."
Stand right here.
It worked well for Seung Jo.
"When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up ."
If you can forget me...
"You saw that just now, right?"
The timing wasn't right
"Before the conversation is over, he already came it."
"It's too long, this 4.3 seconds."
"Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?"
"When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person."
"Confidence, and burning eyes."
Hae Ra!
Oh my god!
You startled me
"Oh, what do we do"
"If Kwon-yoo dies, I will die as well!"
Let go of me!
Where are you taking Hwa-yeon?
Hwa-yeon!
Hwa-yeon!
Let go!
Let go!
I'll do it myself.
Even the bathing has proper rules and order.
"Do you mean, I don't have freedom over my own body?"
* 5 years later *
"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
* 5 years later *
"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
I haven't seen you for a while.
"Where have you been, my brother?"
I've been wondering without staying in the same place.
"Your Majesty, I'm afraid you look so ill."
"I haven't been well for a few days,  but seeing you is making me feel much better."
How is the world outside of the palace?
The weather is cold enough to have fruits on the  trees and the colors of autumn are beautiful to see.
Your people are taking chrysanthemum flowers to make wine...
"This is happening often, recently."
The royal doctors don't know the reason either.
It's just very frustrating.
He will get better soon.
Your highness need not worry so much.
"You left so sudden, I was worried."
You worried about me?
My thoughtlessness made you both worry.
I'm just glad you come back healthy.
I came as soon as I heard of His Majesty's illness.
Why do you ask?I guess there is a reason...
What are you doing here?
"Soon you'll wish to my fatherwelcome to freedom.My heart, my prayers are with you..."
Welcome.
My mother has not come yet?
She went to see Mahir he is coming tohis father trial?
Here Safija!
"Mother,will my brother come?"
"No daughter!He tried,but doctors forbade him to!"
"Come on, let us enter."
Bring in the defendant!
What happened to father?
"Do not worry, Mom ."
Do not worry
"Mr. Nazif,What happened to your leg?Are you hurt? a Small accident"
I askedwhat happened?
Mrs. Judge!...I knew that my son Mahirin critical condition in the hospital
The manager...imprisonment guards would not let me go and see my son...
"I thought,if I'm injuredthey will take me to the hospital and I'll see him but they did not want me to see Mahir..."
"Do not worry,dear grandpa!"
Uncle Black is very good!
He asked for youAs he opened his eyes!
"silence in the courtroom,otherwise I will send you out!"
"Son,do not be angryMrs.."
Judge!
SitMr.
Nazif.
Your Honor
This is important evidenceYou Need To Considerbefore the final decision.
I would like to clarify what mr.
Nazif said
"First, he was arrested yesterdaywhile trying to escape and then he hadthis little accident... he claims that it was all doneto see his sick son,but this is not true!"
Sorry.
I gotta tell it where to do this on the negative one.
Sorry.
There we go.
"So I put down a C2, look at that. . See that?"
"So, what Spy's powerful per-say boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, zero."
Got it.
"Now, the other one is interesting, cuz it's up here, and it's Up this, it's this one here."
For the zero set.
"So, it's like P2, but just shifted up by one."
Okay?
So I could take this E2 vector and just shift it all.
Okay.
Which I'm going to do.
Alright.
"And then for the, but, but first let's build the occasional, the 0's with the occasional one."
So let's make a vector called P4.
Which will be just a bunch of zeroes.
"And now what I'm do on this one, is put an occasional one, so E4."
Just like this guy.
Equals one.
"So now, there's the occasional one, there's the occasional zero."
"And I put this E4, actually this one here, interestingly enough."
"And, we won't have time to talk about everything yet."
"But, I'll show you where it goes, it actually goes over there."
Occasional one.
Now the thing is when I put this one over here I have to shift it by one.
This one here is shifted down.
I have had enough of doctors and hospitals..
"I certainly hope God doesn't get rid of them, but... ..I don't have the strength to see them.."
I don't know what to do.
"Don't worry about me, I will be fine."
You take care of your son.
- Save my Mustafa from all this.
"- God, look at this!"
"You don't have any strength in your limbs or tongue, but you are still nagging at me!"
Seher...
Take your lady to her room so she can rest..
I know what I need to do.
"I know what I need to do, as well, Duriye!"
Go to your room and lie down!
Seher!
"God, give me patience!!!!"
"Are you happy, Ms. Narin?"
Asiye?
We went to see Mustafa a little bit ago...
"But, he didn't see us."
"Do you know, my husband, a mountain of a man, has become almost vegetative?"
"You will celebrate, now!"
"Our new work place is here, Pasa."
"Ah, Doctor?"
Isn't this the place where we had the situation with the picnic?
"Yes, it is."
"If we can provide not just for the farmers, but for the social needs of the community, then we will have won, Pasa."
Yes...
"Actually, a astro turf would be great here."
Really... no...
"No, that won't be enough for you!"
"For you, hopefully, we will build an Olympic stadium."
It will be the Ali Olympic Stadium.
"I won""t get anything in this deal. kaka sir!"
Where will you run?
Beg! lmplore!
"But I won""t spare you!"
"Tiger singh, please let me go!"
Forgive me!
You will surely die!
I have to settle old scores with you! scores with me?
"Yes, you!"
20 years ago the man who was the in-charge of Goga lighthouse.. ..his soul is still waiting for revenge!
But what is your connection with this?
"Won""t a son take the revenge of his father""s death?"
"Why, scoundrel?"
"Tiger singh, forgive me!"
"Don""t kill me!"
"For God""s sake, forgive me!"
"Today even God can""t save you!"
"Go and drown! come, shekhar! sP, my mission is over."
And I surrender myself.
"I was waiting for this day only, shekhar!"
I have found out about your helplessness.
But you have committed a grave mistake.. ..by taking law in your hands.
I wish you had told me this before.
But I will try.. that the law is lenient with you.
"Taking into consideration the police""s recommendation.. ..for taking law in your hands, you receive.. ..7 years imprisonment term. only you dwell in my heart."
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open."
ln my heart..
My name is David Wolfe.
"I was born near New York city in America, currently residing in Ontario Canada."
"I am a renegade nutritionist, I am renegade superfoodist and infopreneur, but above all of that"
"I wrecked my familyfor nothing, absolutely nothing."
I don't have the face to say anything.
But what happened has happened.
I did it again.
Forgive me.
Forgive me and go.
As if you left me anywhere to go.
Who would accept me now?
Who would forgive me?
"If you spoil those men's game...Maybe, your husband will get soften."
Go girl...
I'll buy your plane ticket.I'll put some money in your pocket as well.
Go and testify.Be their doom !
"Offf, days and weeks have passed here."
But these minutes feel even longer.I'll loose my mind.
- What if we come back here.- Stop being a merchant of doom.
We'll end up here againif you keep attitude.
Stop it!
"- What's wrong, man?- Don't touch me!"
- He is just shaving you.- I don't want him to.
Fuck off then.
- I'm not dying to touch your face.- Ibrahim...
- If it wasn't for the orders I was given...- Just do your job.
Sit down.
Don't piss him off.
"- Sit down!- Come on, man."
We need a shave as well.
I feel dizzy.Must be because of high blood pressure.
"- Perihan, please get a grip on yourself.- Can we find some water?"
My mouth is also dry.
I told you not to come hereand go directly to the courthouse.
I will be the only one to see them anyway.
"I'm sorry to have offended you, please forgive us."
Sorry.
Let's go.
"Old man, do you know what Xiang Yaocha is?"
What did you hit me for?
"Who are you, kid?"
Don't you have any manners?
How dare you call Miss Mu by her nickname?
You want to get yourself killed?
"Old man, what's going on?"
"Lucky for you that you've met me, or you'll die."
I don't understand.
"Let me tell you,"
"Xiang Yaocha is the alias of Mu Wanqing, a martial arts expert of great reputation."
"Oh, so it's a person!"
"She's as pretty as a peony, she is ruthless, can be quite scary, that's why she's also known as Xiang Yaocha."
Where does she live?
A deserted valley ten miles away.
"There have been many who went there, but none of them return."
Is she a very good host?
"No, she killed them all, peeled off their skin to block the sun."
Please sit down.
"What would you like to eat, master?"
Just a few dishes.
Right away.
Should I go or not?
"If I don't, then Miss Zhong's life is in danger."
"If I do, she might skin me alive to block the sun."
Difficult decision.
"I wanted to rush over, and kill that bitch, Xiang Yaocha."
"Be careful,"
"I heard her ""Bone cutting sword"" is lethal."
I wasn't embarrassed.
Now that's when you're mad you're not a phony.
I still resent that.
I'm not a phony when I'm nervous.
Again!
I want to get mad at you!
I...I...you know what -- [mocking]
I...I...I...
I want you on my level so I can pick on you just as much as you're picking on me.
"Okay, pick on me."
I have to wait until you say something that I can pick on.
What does this mean?
Can you develop this movement?
It's a...I can't find words.
I want to...
Develop this.
But since you've been dancing...
I want to start all over again with you.
"Okay, let's start over."
I know a corner I'd like to put you in.
"I'd like to ask you a question and because I have a feeling you don't like me right off the bat, and I want to know if you do."
Can you not play [indiscernible]
What would he say?
"He'd say that she's a phony, for one."
"So, you are a phony."
"You're a phony, and you're a flip little girl, and you're a show off..."
What would [indiscernible] have said to that?
"I know what I'd answer,"
"I'd say, ""I think you are too."""
"Well then, tell this to me."
Tell me what a phony I am.
[laughing]
Send me the case files and tell me when to be in court.
"Thank you, doctor."
We need this.
"Before he was arrested, Father Moore sent this to me."
He asked me to take care of it.
It's your burden now.
One more thing.
When you saw Emily... ...did Father Moore ask you to give her any medical help?
He was already trying to stop her from injuring herself and urging her to eat.
"And I told him, as a doctor, I couldn't help her."
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.
Don't you get it?
He's not just an eyewitness to the exorcism.
He can also refute the prosecution's medical case.
This is huge for us.
When do I get to testify?
I don't know.
Let's take this one step at a time.
No.
"What matters most is Emily's story, which only I can tell."
I understand.
Have you thought about what I said before?
About dark forces and demonic attacks?
"Yes, I have."
"That day, after Briggs testified... *..."
I was feeling awful. *
*And I went out for a walk* *just to clear my head... *
*... and I was thinking about* *what you said to me.
Thinking:*
"*""What if demons really do exist?""*"
And wondering what that would mean if I believed that.
"Because God knows, I have my own demons."
Looking good.
Different and uncommon.
"lndeed, Reporter Jung of B.A.P."
He's a sensitive man who knows how to be romantic.
It's just piece of art no matter how you take it!
I heard that bridge was built in 1935.
"lts height is similar to that of ""63 building"" in Korea. &amp;lt;""The island across from here is the world's largest prison""&amp;gt; Wow, that?"
- That looks like an island.
- That's the world's largest prison?
I heard there are Dementors living inside.
Look at him enjoying nature.
It's freezing.
It would be so much fun to have a concert in a place like this.
My hair is stiff because of all the mousse I have in there.
That goes totally well with him.
He's got the aura.
Doesn't he look like a celebrity?
The wind is crazy.
I'm happy but it's cold.
It's always cold.
You can't tell on screen.
But this is a cliff.
I'm scared.
So when I was shooting that scene
I felt like it was life or death for me.
Great job.
Hi.
We're in San Francisco.
It's supposed to be a normal street in a town but the aura is totally different.
Taking pictures anyway still looks professional.
It's cold.
This is a port city in San Francisco.
And her fiancé isn't  happy with this at all.
His mother is being a bitch about it as well.
- I'm really sorry about it.
"- It's okay, thank you."
"- Thank you, usta."
- Take your share and let us part ways.
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.
"Don't let anyone inside, son."
"How can I not, abla?"
They say they are customers.
- They're camping outside.
- Don't answer their questions.
- Come let's wash your face.
- I tell them I don't know anything... ... and I don't even know you.
"It makes the other shops uneasy, too."
I understand.
We'll talk to Kadir Bey first and then see what we can do about it.
You close to door.
"And tell anyone who comes, we're closed today."
"Okay, abla."
- The shop is swarmed with the reporters.
- What do we do?
It's a public restaurant.
"You can't say ""the reporters can't come in""."
"- But they have no rights to bother you, of course."
- But that's what they exactly do.
"- They are getting to our nerves, aren't they?"
- I'm most concerned about the Yaşarans.
I fear that they'll send someone to make a scene... ... in front of the cameras and we won't be able to prevent that.
"Abla, can you answer it please."
"Hello, Sinem."
Hello!
May I speak to your sister?
- Sure.
Don't hide your face.
I recognised you as soon as I saw you.
My husband died 4 years ago.
I have been looking for you ever since in order to apologise to you.
To apologise to me?
- Yes.
He told me everything about you before his death.
So you know that... - Suraj is your son.
And I also know the circumstances under which my brother died.
I am ashamed of myself.
I was very mean to you.
Forgive me if you can.
"- What are you doing, sister?"
Since the day I have learned the truth... ...
I have not considered Suraj my son but your safe keeping.
And I am waiting for the moment when I can give him to you.
Suraj must never learn the truth.
He is an excellent pilot.
He will soon marry Renu.
They have a bright future together.
"If he learns that it is not you but I who am his mother,... ... a woman who has spent 12 years in prison for murder,... ... he will be shattered."
He won't be able to hold his head high.
His life will be destroyed.
Don't you care about your own life?
Won't you accept your son after going through so much pain?
Only you have the right to be called his mother.
You are responsible for what he is today.
"But, Suraj is your son."
"No, sister."
But it's the picture that I'm
looking for today.
"Okay, so the row picture."
"All right, so I'm in three dimensions, x,"
y and z.
And I want to take those equations one at a time and ask --
and make a picture of all the points that satisfy --
let's take equation number two.
If I make a picture of all the
"points that satisfy -- all the x, y, z points that solve"
"this equation -- well, first of all,"
"the origin is not one of them. x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0 would"
not solve that equation.
So what are some points that do
solve the equation?
"Let's see, maybe if x is one,"
y and z could be zero.
"That would work, right?"
So there's one point.
"I'm looking at this second equation, here, just, to start"
with.
Let's see.
"Also, I guess,"
"if z could be one, x and y could be zero,"
so that would just go straight up that axis.
"And,"
probably I'd want a third point here.
"Let me take x to be zero,"
"z to be zero, then y would be minus a half, right?"
"So there's a third point, somewhere -- oh my -- okay."
Let's see.
I want to put in all the points that satisfy that
(lighthearted cartoon music)
DR. JAMES GRlME:
"This is such an inspiring story, because it shows how mathematicians can save lives."
We're talking about one of the most famous cipher machines of all time.
It's a code machine called the Enigma machine used by Nazi
"Germany in World War II to send secret, coded messages."
And we've got one over here.
This is not a copy.
This is not a replica.
This is an original Enigma machine actually used in World War Il.
This was made in 1936.
It's an army Enigma machine.
Let's see how it works.
So this belongs to a man called Simon Singh.
He's an author.
He writes popular science books.
And he lends it to the University of
"Cambridge, where I work."
"This was found in a French field, I was told, by an"
American cryptographer after the war.
And he took it home.
So I guess he took it home as his souvenir.
"Yoink, that's mine."
The guy who found it died about 12 years ago.
"And when he died, that's when Simon"
Singh bought the machine.
We're going to send a message.
"Now, we were talking about what to send before, so we send Numberphile."
Let's turn this into Enigma code.
So I'm going to type in N to begin with.
"And if you can see there, the letter Y lights up."
All of you please go out.
I want to talk to my son.
"You too, go outside."
Sir!
- Please go.
I understand how it will be when death comes near.
I know I am not going to heavens.
Being a gangster I killed many people and now I am suffering.
You dont repeat my mistakes.
And dont ever hurt any woman.
I did that with Parvati.
I never told anybody that I am the father of her son Kasi.
Now I want to do justice to him.
I want to give half of my property to her son.
Promise me you will fulfill my wish.
Why dont you talk?
Will you do it?
Do you equate me with the son of your mistress ?
Your dad is very great.
He lived and died like a king.
He died like a dog.
I became home minister because of your father.
From now I will serve you as I used to serve your father.
I know I will have your support.
Just a phone call is enough for any work.
By the way 17 of our people are in central jail.
If you ever need them I will release then on parole.
I have an urgent meeting with collector.
Bye.
You stay here.
She is the your fathers mistress and he is her son.
"Mother, he is my brother and he will be with me from now."
He came to talk to me.
He claims that Barış hired a man to go into jail for him.
"Come on, really?"
He made himself believe in that.
He thinks the man got himself caught on purpose.
That's why this happened after we confronted Barış.
He believes this story in his mind.
I think we shouldn't go deep on this.
We should just leave the rest to the police.
True.
"I just don't want to be suspicious of anyone around me, anymore."
And I made some spinach börek.
Kuzey's favorite.
It hasn't cooked yet.
It will be in 5 minutes.
Will you be okay while I am not here?
"Don't worry, I'll be home all day today."
But our girl is doing well.
She's getting better everyday.
"She'll be even better, inshallah."
Her face is getting more colorful as well.
The weather is fine today.
I'll go out in the yard with her.
"Careful, don't let her get cold."
- We'll be careful.
- Really though...
You sure you don't need to be at work?
"I'll feel so bad, if you have to stay here because of me."
No.
I don't have anything important to do at the company today.
I scheduled today to spend some time with my daughter.
Great.
I love... cleaning something that's really dirty so you can see the result. man:
I actually love my refrigerator.
It's such a cool thing.
It remains at one corner.
It keeps its mouth shut.
I love my refrigerator.
Nothing else but my refrigerator. man:
What do you love? man #2:
Women. man:
What do you love? man #3:
Freedom. man:
What do you love? man #4:
Power. man:
[laughs] woman:
"I love the word ""mamihlapinatapai."""
"It's from the Yaghan language, which is now a dead language."
"But it was spoken in Tierra del Fuego, the very southernmost point of South America."
"I've never heard the word said properly, so I could be pronouncing it wrong."
But the meaning is quite beautiful.
"It means that moment or feeling when two people both want to initiate something, but neither wants to be the one to start it."
"It can be perhaps two tribal leaders both wanting to make peace, but neither wanting to be the one to begin it."
Or it could be two people at a party wanting to approach each other and neither quite brave enough to make the first move.
[birds calling]
Can hear the kookaburras now.
[line ringing]
man:
"Currently, I'm calling my mom to ask her what I should say to Emily today."
[line ringing]
woman:
Hello? man:
Do you have a second to talk to me? woman:
Sure. man:
I will consider later.
SlR I felt like..
"Hey, you are starting a song when you are asked for a story."
You got your money.
Now leave.
What did he see in me to lend me this money?
If he gave you money without a mortgage.. ..then you must have something as valuable as gold.
What do I have?
I have a golden heart.
Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
Where is the rain?
We dont have rain in stock.
It is out of stock.
"How can rain the out of stock, you fool!"
You idiot!
Everyone calls me a fool.
But you have.. ..lovingly called me and idiot.
Who are you?
You said that there would be rain after 48 hours.. .. six minutes and eight seconds.
Where is the rain?
"Is it you, seed of love?"
Rain is not a wife to come as soon as it is called.
"Of course, my wife does not come even when I call her."
Then whose call will she respond to?
Are you talking about the rain or my wife?
At present we are talking about your wife.. ..tell me about the rain.
The rain was supposed to come.
"But the low pressure.. ..crossed Orissa, West Bengal and then moved over to Bangladesh."
Then what are you doing here without going to Bangladesh.
I do not have a passport.
"What passport, you anthrax......!"
"My boy, you are inventing new words to swear at me."
"Poor man, they'll give him a stroke one of these days."
Selim!
But I'll get that newspaper shut down.
That'll teach them.
"Of course, you have the power to do anything."
You wouldn't move a finger in the first place if the Yaşarans weren't also in it.
"- You're the one cleaning up their mess, aren't you?"
- Look mister...
I told you a thousand times already...
"I went to help the girl, because the town folks asked me to."
And I helped her without expecting anything in return.
"Unlike you, I didn't turn my back on her."
"And if this news was right then you'd be the one  who really abandoned her, am I wrong?"
You did the right thing though.
Everyone went their own way now.
And that chapter's over.
"It was that girl, wasn't she?"
She was there at the night of engagement.
You're talking nonsense.
I am Fatmagül Ketenci's yenge.
Was her yenge there to ask about her?
You were acting so weird all night.
"For God's sake Selim, just tell me, is it true?"
Are you crazy?
How can you believe that rubbish?
This is how much you trust me?
Are you serious?
I can't believe you.
No...
This is unacceptable.
You can't ask me that.
"Look, Meltem...This is over, if you don't believe me."
He????
Who am I???
"I am your husband, Narin!!!"
"Even if you won't do your wifely duty, I still acted as a husband towards you."
Don't touch me!
What's my fault?
Eh???
What's my fault?
It's been over two months since we got married.
I did whatever you wanted.
Whatever you wanted.
"Get up, get up... sit.. sit..."
It's enough!!!!
"What do you think I am, eh???"
What do you think I am?????
"I am supposed to shut up over everything, accept everything, and you all twist me around your fingers, eh???"
"There is no such world, Narin."
There is no such world.
"From now on, we are going to live as man and wife."
Everyone is going to know their place.
I am your husband.
"Mustafa... you can fool everyone, but.."
"I won't fall for your act, son..."
"I understand you.. if you have anything you want, tell me... relax.."
Don't worry yourself over it..
"If he needs anything, Neco is here.."
"But, when one sits around all day like a potato, they don't have any needs, right?"
It's enough to give a little fertilizer...
"Ah, now I believe you!"
If you won't stuff this man's words back into his mouth.. ... you are not aware of anything...
"If I wasn't too embarrassed, I swear to God, I would cry."
It troubles me so much.
"The vanilla bean, which is expensive and worth reusing."
Today's Episode
Vanilla Sugar
"Here, in this little pot, I'll show you."
"There's all the vanillas I save,"
That I let drying.
Moustache:
The smell is amazing!
"Everytime I make something with vanilla bean, I wash it if I put inside the milk or the cream."
"If I didn't put, don't need to wash."
"Then I put it beside my stove and leave there for a couple of days, it'll dry."
"When it dry, I save inside this little pot here, I close it, I let it quite closed."
"When I have the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar, I make it."
For the vanilla sug...
Moustache:
And what is the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar?
This is what I'm going to say right now!
"For the vanilla sugar, we will always need the sugar and the vanilla."
SUGAR &amp;amp; VANlLLA
Only.
Nothing more.
Moustache:
"Wonderful, it makes sense."
It makes sense.
And then what happens?
"In this case, here I have 15g of vanilla."
So I need 150g of sugar.
"In other words, we always need 10% of the sugar's weight in vanilla."
So: there's 200g of sugar?
I'm going to use 20g of vanilla.
Moustache:
Wonderful!
Shall we marry with out any delay
let us recreate history and show that.. ..our union is a proof of real friendship
I will never remove you from my heart . ..and this ring from my finger.
You should also promise me one thing.
Whenever it rains you should come and hug me like this.
My God!
From where did you get that heroine?
Shall we watch the shooting?
Why not?
Let us go.
"Sir, see this girl!"
How beautiful she is!
If we make her the heroine in our movie.. ..it will definitely go on to celebrate a silver jublee.
You are right director.
She looks wonderful.
Hey photographer!
Take a few snaps .. ..of that girl in the pink dress.
Look here Mr.Ranga Rao!
We never know when luck will smile on someone.
For example Simran became a heroine.
Her mother is moving around in a Benz car.
Roja also became a heroine. - Her brother too has a Benz car.
Same thing with Rambha too.
Her mother is moving around in Benz car.
You are talking only about brothers and mothers.
What about fathers?
- He is there.
And you are that person if you agree.
Listen to me and make your daughter a heroine.. ..then you will get not only Benz cars .. ..but you can enjoy all other luxuries.
You can earn some crores of money.
Crores!?
Yes believe me.
I'll go already...
I'm tired...
You have to take a look to the future plans with your lover once more
Come on..
"You were in class A, I was in B"
I'm saying...
"This is why I don't remember you ,..."
But i remember you..
I remember of my all primary school friends.
It means there is a problem in my memory card.
"You were not interested in anyone, you didn't play with the other kids."
"Even during the breaks when everyone was running, you were sitting in the edge and reading books."
So that no one would mess with me.
"Actually, I was like you too.."
Did you study a lot?
I did not have many friends. friend..
"In fact, no friend at all."
Oh snap!
Why?
"First I was very tall, I looked older next to them , and I had dental braces until the end of junior high school."
"It's beautiful to be tall, I wanted to be tall too."
But your height is good.
Thank you!
"Your dental braces served the purpose, your teeth are very beautiful &amp;gt;Thank you!"
No one cares about Mira.
And it's understandable why Eylul left us.
Life goes on...
Thanks for the beautiful moments tonight !
Don't mention it.
"Good night, &amp;gt; The same to you."
Mom?
"I struggled a lot to reach this Mira,"
Europe on average uses
about half as much as Americans use and England is a really low water user.
They use about 40 gallons per person per day.
"So, now this cup, this is another continent."
It's representing 22 gallons per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Asia. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah.
Asia.
Yup.
"Now, we have another continent."
This is 12 gallons per person per
day.
Any guesses?
It's Africa.
"And the last one, this is one of the lowest water-using"
countries in the entire world.
It's representing 1.3 gallons of water per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A country? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
It's a country.
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rome. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
You're close.
Yes.
It's Gambia.
So it's one of the lowest water users in the world.
"So, we just wanted to start with, you know, how much water we do use."
"In the United States, we have a lot--we have a lot of water and we use a lot and so we're excited to talk about some better ways to use that water. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
"Thanks, Laura."
OK.
"So just picking-up off that theme, a few more questions for you."
"Anybody want to have a guess at what the recommended amount of water per person is recommended for basic sanitation and health needs, per person?"
"Charles, you should know this one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WARREN:"
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:
- And I gave all my money to the taxi.
- Why are you doing dangerous stuff like that?
You're seeking trouble.
They could have seen you.
I can't bear the longing for my child.What can I do?
"Okay, this pregnancy really made you nervy.You better do something about it quickly."
I will.
Don't worry.
"I can come with you, to the doctor if you want."
"- Okay.- This week, I'll be a bit busy with work though."
"We can go next Thursday, okay?I'll be busy till then."
Which day of month is next Thursday?
Let me see...It's 8th today.
16th it will be.
16th...
"Don't waste time, if you ask me.Let us go and take care of it next week."
"Neither before you, nor after you."
"Fatmagül, shall we dance?Let us dance."
How sweet of you.
#Oh the separation.
Stronger than even death.
#Time stops flowing.
"#Neither my loved ones, nor the sweet memories are enough anymore."
"Abla, shall we dance?In honor of Fatmagül's birthday."
# I'm caught up in your love.
# I stole from my own life.
"- Let us dance as well.- No, baby."
You know this is not my type of song.
"# Travelling around the seven worlds,"
# I have yet to find a remedy.
Tonight is doing good for all of us.
- It made Fatmagül so happy.- I wish her to be always happy.
Why do they involve you?
Good heavens...
"Okay, I won't to talk about these now Orkun."
Come here!
Please!
Take me out of this nightmare.
Please I want you to be by my side today.
"Sweety I can't come now, I am at school."
I am solving the registration procedures.
You know our department has the courses selection today.
I can only come at the evening.
Let's do something at the evening.
"Anyway... good, forget about it."
"But, don't..."
Hello?
"What happened again?-Nothing, come on let's get these things done and go right away."
Where do you see yourself after five years?
"Probably I will graduate until then, I will find a job."
"A higher degree?- I don't want a higher degree or something like that, straight to the working life."
"It looks like you're in a hurry, do you have to go somewhere?"
I have one more exam today and...
I am stressed a bit because of that.
"Good, what's your life's philosophy in general?"
Not to quit the right way even in the hardest times.
Hello children.!
Do you know where is Yaman's house?
Yaman Koper?
"I don't know, do you know, dude? &amp;gt; No."
"Okay, but do you know where is the reeve?"
Thank you.
He is coming. &amp;gt; How was it?
"I don't know, Mert give me the scooter's keys."
- Yeah.
You were so hilarious in that olive costume.
"But, Jas, you said boys don't rate girls for funniness."
"Well, I just meant that they rate other things more."
"Oh, yeah."
What do they rate then?
Skinny-Minnie blondie boobie girly girls like Slaggy Lindsay?
"Well, she does have that cover-girl look that boys die for."
"So, are you saying I have to be more like her?"
Thong alert!
I always knew she was from Vulgaria.
- Now that's what boys like.
- But they just go up your bum.
- Nah.
- Do you think you should try one?
No way.
I'm not gonna injure myself just because boys like it.
And Slaggy Lindsay should know that all those ancient women did not burn their bras and give women the vote so she could wear a thong.
What a swiz!
- That is just diabolical.
"- No, that is shocking."
Bet you Robbie doesn't know about that.
At least I sort of fill up my bra when I wear one.
Even though it does bunch up when I run for the bus.
"So, she has false boobs, a massive bum and a blank personality."
You would score more in all of those areas.
Defo.
But she's got Robbie and I haven't even kissed a boy.
I can't.
"You want to move up on the maturity scale, right?"
I'm not that desperate.
You have to step up to compete.
So you won't stray again.
What you have to understand is that the church and the state are the parents of the motherland.
That requires a sense of responsibility... and deserves respect.
You people don't respect anything so we have to take a hard line.
Nobody cares that you're here.
Your family and friends don't give a shit about you.
You won't get out of here alive.
I won't let you.
"And even if you did, I'd come find you."
I'd come find you.
You're cracking really fast.
This isn't happening!
You can't hurt me!
I can't hurt you?
No!
"What I just did, didn't that hurt?"
"Dad, please..."
It's me...
Malena.
I know you remember.
Please.
Don't hurt me anymore.
You know what?
Maybe you're right.
Remember the story of Abraham?
"No, you wouldn't."
"God told Abraham to kill his son, lsaac, and Abraham didn't hesitate for a second."
He looked at his son and saw an enemy he had to wipe out.
"He took him to the mountain top, drew a knife to cut his throat... and just when he was going to do it.."
God told him to stop.
"If I'm your father as you say, then God should tell me to stop."
Shall I tell you a secret?
"I identify it with my father, but not me."
I don't feel I demand respect.
You don't demand respect?
No.
Should you?
"As a matter of fact, I'd like more."
I'd like you to respect me more.
"Now you see, so you demand respect."
"Alright, yes."
"Yes, as a matter of fact if I could demand respect from you"
I would.
So do it!
Who's preventing you?
Except yourself.
'Cause if I feel I get myself out on the corner you're going to let me just drown.
You're not going to help me one bit.
And I know that I can't quite come up to standards with you.
What should I do when you're on the corner?
Encourage me to come out.
Ah.
You don't have enough...courage to come out by yourself.
You need somebody to pull a little damsel in distress out of her corner.
Yes!
"So anytime you want somebody to... ...pay attention to you, you crawl into a corner and wait until rescue comes."
"Yes, that's exactly what I'd like."
And this is what I call phony.
Pardon me?
This is what I call phony.
Why is it phony?
"I'm admitting to you what I am, and how is that a phony?"
"That is a phony, because --"
Oh!
I will arrange a job for him.
Ask him will he do it?
Look here my child.
I care a lot for you.
All I want is you should never repent like your mother.. ..that you have married a guy who is useless like me.
Take this flower.
Girls should put it in the plait.
Boys must put it in the ear.
Give this flower to Venkat.
Take the plate.
By the way will our son-in-law agree?
How can I say that?
I know.
He will not accept.
Your father will arrange a job for me?
Will he make me a card distributor in that club?
"Venkat, be serious."
My dad want you to join.. ..as assistant manager in a cement factory.
I dont want that.
Why?
Because my father arranged it.
- Yes.
How will you feed me if you dont have any job?
Anyone can ask that to me but not you.
When you believed that rain has united us.. ..then why cant you believe that I can feed you.
How will you do that?
- I will rob a bank or I will steal.
I can do anything for my love.
Try to understand me.
You want to see me as an employee.
With in 24 hours I will come to your house as an employee.
You have tried to create a dispute between your daughter ..and me because I am unemployed.
- I'm glad you're safe.
Have you been hurt?
That evil bastard!
- How dare he hurt my daughter!
- It wasn't his fault I was hurt.
It was my own fault.
I'm afraid that bad rumors may start.
"Now that I am safe, please inform the police to stop searching for me."
"Alright, fine."
"- Granny, take Eun Hye outside."
"- Yes, Sir."
Did you meet him?
I hope he's safe.
"Seeing how the young miss is protecting him, it seems that she has already fallen for him."
I thought you were discussing marriage between the eldest son of the Interior Minister.
Isn't Hong Gil Dong his illegitimate son?
If the marriage negotiations break down because of this...
"If they break down, the Interior Minister's relationship with me ends too!"
We must proceed with the wedding!
"If we have Eun Hye followed, we should be able to catch Hong Gil Dong."
Find him for me and get rid of him!
"If it concerns you and the Interior Minister, then of course we should help you."
Was it really him that I saw?
"No, that's impossible!"
I must have been mistaken.
I came on behalf of everyone because too many people would cause trouble.
Thank you so much.
"If people find out about us, it'll be trouble."
"Since people think that Yongmun solved this problem, let them."
- Don't spread other rumors.
- We know.
What did Yongmun do anyway?
"What can I do,that this interferein the business?"
He knows what he's gotbecause of their work...
"I do not trust him... oh, you did of coursetrust him ."
If you sayI usehis position in court
"When you are concerned, it is the exception,"
"I do not know... ,"
Do not lookme so worried
I did not comethat would upset you...
"What do you advise, sir."
Attorney?
"Ah, it's goodthis coffee!"
"If I were you,Mahir Karu would tomorrowsent to prison."
"Do not be worried, my dear,there is a nice, has a doctor,nurse, help, him..."
"Let us Say this... f something happenswhile prisonnobody cares, all believe that he is veryaggressive man"
"But if you escape from here,the doors open to the investigationin all areas of the hospital."
Help!He's not breathing!Help!
What's going on?- He stopped breathing!
"Mr. Mahir,how are you? unlock the cuffs,we have to switchin intensive care!"
"Oh, what do you do?"
"I have to go,excuse me. mr."
"Prosecutor, I thoughtabout what you said."
It should besend to jail tomorrow.
"And there is the jail clinic, and there can be cared for,what do you say?"
"Do not worry,"
I will personally tell themyou good care of him.
"You are very well chosen,very well."
Who would have guessed?Nothing can be done.
Go get a doctor!- Good.
Are you here to see the patient?
Mahir Karaescaped!
How is this possible?
"Thank you,Manager..."
[people speaking foreign language]
"Yeah, speaking of Ass Violator."
"Oh no, it gets worse."
You've been warned.
[people laughing]
"Wow, that Ugandan pastor would not approve of such behavior."
"Ugh, this video is some s--t, ain't it?"
So to speak.
Why did you guys make me review that?
"And more than that, why is the other elephant just sitting there like,"
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Stick your trunk in there.
"Oh, very nice."
"-Ugh, I don't know."
Maybe that's how this guy gets his peanuts.
"Oh, why did I make that joke?"
"All right, that's it guys."
"Don't make me review anymore videos of nasty turd-burgling elephants, all right?"
"Okay, so I actually do have something interesting for you."
"It's one of those things that's kind of racist but kind of f--ked up, but also kind of funny."
And it's just a commercial for a local mattress store.
"-Hi, I'm Gary."
At the one and only Gary's Mattress.
Now with locations in Koreatown and Little Tokyo.
We are karate-a-chopping a-prices just for you!
Oh cho!
Even we would buy it.
"At Gary's Mattress, we're blowing up prices!"
Yayayaya!
"-Wow, that is unfortunate."
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that I wouldn't buy mattresses from that guy.
"I mean, who's your target demographic when you trash everyone?"
- And she knows we're Kerim's friends...
"- Please, I don't want to hear anything."
Thank you.
He should be here soon.
Our phones kept ringing since the morning.
Everyone who saw it on the Internet dialed our number.
You can imagine how difficult a situation it was for us.
"It's indeed difficult, having to defend ourselves against such a groundless and ugly claim."
- I can't believe we're even talking about it.
- Exactly...
Exactly.
I'm disgraced before all my friends.
I have been believing your lies closing my ears to what others said...
But I don't know how I am going to deal with this!
I've never lied to you.
Even if it's denied and refuted... ... the question marks in people's heads will remain.
"Even today, my best friend told me  ""There's no smoke without fire""."
To hell with their smoke and fire!
You'll keep hearing such things if you don't shut them up!
After all I've told you...
Is this how much you trust me?
Do you think I could possibly do something like this?
Meltem...
That girl was Kerim's girlfriend.
"Would she marry him, if she wasn't?"
Meltem...
That news are set up by my father's rivals.
Everyone in that town knows that.
It's OK.
Leave it.
"Welcome, dad."
Welcome dear.
"If we take it to go,  they give 30% discount."
Hey!
Lee Tae Ik!
Are you trying to stingily save money?
"No, no!"
It's because it is good.
I like that pizza best.
This and... give us this.
We purposely came all the way here.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Please give us a lot of topping.
Also give us a lot of hot sauce and pickles.
"Whatever, give as much as possible!"
We are regulars.
"Also, give us garlic sauce."
"Anyway... just to get 30% discount,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;we went all the way there?"
"Hallyu star, Take One?"
Hey!
"Baek Go Dong, don't just eat."
You must never tell about this to anyone. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;It's such an embarrassment.
I also think so.
So what?
It's good to save money.
What is he doing?
The pizza will turn cold.
It's almost ready.
"Hurry and come, hyung!"
"It's so good, looks like we will finish it all."
Leave mine!
Put on the TV.
"Yes. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I met with world-famous star, Jin Se Ryeong.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I see. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go to that scene! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As the first Korean to do so,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you won the prestigious supporting actress award in the States.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How do you feel? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm happy. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I see. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sometime back, you even got a love call from world-famous director, James Wang.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please tell us of your upcoming plans."
Why?
We were watching it well.
It's not interesting.
That man isn't the real killer.
You were the one who got him caught.
And now you want to clear his name?
A man appears out of no where to save Barış from the suspicions.
Ferhat's lighter found on him?
"Come on, that's not just a coincidence."
They just want us to think that way.
The man was following me just to get caught.
"So, you're saying that Barış hired that man?"
Exactly...
Barış took action when he felt he was cornered.
First he wanted to silence us to buy some time.
That's why he said he would sue us all.
And then he made his plan.
He made that man get caught.
So that he would confess the murder.
So simple...
"See, that man isn't the real killer."
All this was setup by Barış.
Or maybe Kuzey did it.
Just when Kuzey went into jail... ... a man confesses the murder to clear Kuzey's name.
Kuzey wouldn't do a sham like that.
If the killer is one of Bekir's men... ... he might have sacrificed himself to save Kuzey.
Can't that be possible?
You have this disease for how long?
Since my son died.
The doctors said it is at a progressed stage.
- You didn't get treatment?
- No.
- Why?
- Killing that man was my treatment.
Did you kill Ferhat?
We're going to film the first Las Vegas scene.
We suffered a lot until now in the U.S. because of the weather.
But I think it'll be okay in Las Vegas.
Although I am quite sleepy and that's not good.
What time is it now?
I couldn't fall asleep so I read a book instead.
There's nowhere to film here.
There should be a lot out there.
"For Las Vegas,"
This is where everything really starts.
None
None
None
It's a song about us B.A.P.
We wanted a song that matched Las Vegas.
It's a very fancy city.
"Since we are singers, we look the most splendid when we're up on stage."
It's a song about us and how we'll go to many cities in many countries to perform on stage.
There are many countries we want to go to
And there are many countries we will go to.
So it's a song that contains our greatest aspirations.
It's so pretty since the streets are so extravagant.
I'm not sure I did well.
There are too many people.
I'm nervous because too many people are watching.
None
I'm embarrassed.
It's crazy.
lf I were good at dancing then I would at least do something.
Singing is more embarrassing than dancing for some reason.
People are all staring...
So it's kind of hard to be confident.
Approximate.
Did you find anything on that flight?
No.
"No, not that I remember, no."
"Of course, the thing I remember most was that landing."
I thought that was absolutely great.
Yes.
Frozen brake and 180.
"Yeah, and then have to run another runway."
"Like I said, He didn't let it bend or whatever"
"Now, the next day"
"I don't know if it was the next day or not, but you mentioned that the bodies started washing -"
"Yeah, even that first day they were picking some up."
"And the second day when we were at the Coast Guard station, yeah."
"They brought in the boats, you know."
"Smaller boats, and the 40-footers..."
"And there might have even been some private boats, I'm not sure."
"I can't remember, but they were consolidating at the Coast Guard"
Station.
But they were bringing the bodies in.
You could see them bringing them in.
They'd be in the fetal position.
For warmth.
I don't think they got them all.
I don't know how many there was but there was enough that -
"That's what they would do, obviously, when they froze to death."
"When they drowned and froze to death or both, a combination, I imagine."
That's bad.
"Hell, about two of them were from Rogers City."
"They left 50, 60 kids and stuff."
It was...
It wasn't anybody from the Island here on it.
She didn't talk about it for 20 years.
Her face-muscles were motionless.
"Everybody treat her and her mother well in Taiwan, because her father sacrificed himself."
But she says:
I'm not him.
Memory is the selection of images.
"Some elusive, other's printed indelibly on the brain."
"Daddy loves you, so much!"
I know we'll dance at every party.
Each image is like a thread. each thread woven together to make a tapestry of intricate texture. when I first met Louis I said to myself
"He is a healer, he will take care of me."
Do you still love her?
Men fought each other for the privilege of speaking her name.
And the tapestry tells a story.
And I find out he's just a man.
"You're in trouble, they're really mad."
Who them?
They always mad!
And the story is our past.
I'll never forgive you.
If you drive him away.
"The summer I killed my father, I was 10 years old."
"I saw daddy,"
Daddy and Mrs Munroe.
That's a lie!
What's wrong with her?
"Oh, she'll be alright."
Have you told anyone?
Cos if you tell I swear I'll do you harm.
You know i love my sister but she's not unfamiliar with the inside of a mental hospital.
"It's sunday, which one of your patients you gonna see Louis?"
What was wrong with that lady?
"Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would."
Sorry...
"But the work out seems to have had an effect, seeing how you managed to keep up so well."
"But, you knew?"
That we were following you?
It would be weird if I didn't know.
You're obvious.
I didn't have a choice.
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...
Without knowing...
"But if you happen to like Hae Ra,"
That is something...
I can do nothing about.
Do you want to go somewhere?
What?
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a dream... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Me being with Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With Seung Jo.
It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day.
I'm happy now
"But, it looks like only families are here."
We are the only ones who look like a couple.
Of course.
"There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months."
You didn't know?
What?
You didn't know?
It's well known.
"After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating."
You know what?
Let's just get out of here!
What to do?!
Wear it until your clothes dry.
"It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes."
Everyone's looking fancy after shopping yesterday.
"Zelo, that's a very unique hat."
- I got it yesterday.
- Where'd you get it?
"I found it off the street, some US brand..."
Your hair color is very artistic
- My hair color?
- It really stands out.
- What color is it?
- It's purple.
Those sunglasses are very unique too.
"Yes, they are unique."
Your facial features are unique.
"I hear that a lot. oh, really?"
I have to buy things suitable for my age and pockets...
"I was surprised, to be honest."
They had everything I was looking for but they were all very costly.
- Limited editions are really expensive.
- The first thing that caught my eye was about 1400 dollars.
With 1400 dollars I can drink Nesquik 6000 times.
I couldn't sleep much but I came out because I wanted to shop.
"Actually, we were all washed up and ready to go to sleep."
But we all came out as soon as we heard we're going shopping.
We can only stay here for about 2 weeks.
There's no time to be sleeping.
At least one more hour...
Shopping helps a singer express more.
"Shoes too, styling for our album"
It helps us to discuss with the stylists.
We would be able to make suggestions and use those items.
I think it's a big help.
This is Hollywood.
"Her father the king said, ""Don't whistle."""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Hai, don't whistle."""
But the princess continued whistling.
(Whistling)
"The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully."
(Whistling)
"Her father the king said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
But the king had an idea.
He announced a Swayamvara.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
"""Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!"""
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
(Whistling)
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the king."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the queen."
"But the princess said, ""Father, Mother, don't worry."
I have an idea.
I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly.
"And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."""
"So she went up to each and said, ""Do you accept that I have defeated you?"""
"And they said, ""Me?"
Defeated by a woman?
"No way, that's impossible!"
No no no no no!
"That's not possible."""
"Till finally one prince said,"
"""Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."""
"""Uh-huh ..."" she said."
Pinto!
"- Yes, boss!"
The goods should be cleared from underwater tunnel.
Underwater tunnel ready!
- Go ahead!
Beware!
Hands up!
"Boss, our link with Jamal Pasha""s boat.. ..has got disconnected."
"And boss, we have received the red signal too."
Red signal?
What about the goods?
God!
I knew it!
That I will be ruined!
"Tiger singh.. what was the need.. ..to bring such a big consignment? shut up! congratulations, boss!"
The consignment is here!
Quickly open this! otherwise he will get a heart attack. very good! very good! very good! open it!
"That""s better!"
Tiger singh.. only gold! kaka sir!
Real gold!
I knew it!
"Tiger singh.. as long as you are there.. ..no harm can befall on these gold. seema has come. so this is your business, shekhar!"
How dare you! - seeing your illegal activities!
This is my business!
"lf this is your business, then shame on this business! shame on this luxurious life! seema, you have made a mistake by coming here!"
"Now don""t cross your limits!"
"When you have crossed your limits of humanity.. ..then why do I have to stay in my limits? shekhar, I could have never imagined that you will be like this!"
Now I know your true form.
Now I know why strange people come to meet you.
Because you do smuggling! - seema!
lf you had to be a traitor.. it would.. ..have been better if you had died!
Thanks a lot for this favour!
"already here -- so that's one of column one,"
"that's one times column one, right there."
And now I want to add on --
so I'm going to hook the next vector onto the front of the arrow will
start the next vector and it will go this way.
"So let's see,"
can I do it right?
"If I added on one of these vectors,"
"it would go left one and up two, so we'd go left one and up two, so"
it would probably get us to there.
Maybe I'll do dotted line for that.
Okay?
"That's one of column two tucked onto the end,"
but I wanted to tuck on two of column two.
So that --
the second one -- we'll go up left one and up two also.
It'll probably end there.
And there's another one.
So what
I've put in here is two of column two.
Added on.
And where did I end up?
What are the coordinates of this
result?
What do I get when I take one of this plus two of that?
"I do get that, of course."
"There it is, x is zero, y is three, that's b."
That's the answer we wanted.
And how do I do it?
You see I do
it just like the first component.
I have a two and a minus two that
Kuzey's case will drop when the real killer is trialled.
And then he'll be free again.
"Okay, let's hope so."
And then I'll divorce and be free as well.
"Cemre, for God's sake don't live in vain hope."
- What hope?
- I'm saying I will divorce.
"I mean, for after you got divorced don't get hopes."
Look sweetie Güney is a black thorn between you two.
Nothing will change this reality.
Put this in your mind.
"Mom, what are you doing?!"
I'm giving them proper shape.
You can't send heart shaped cookies to jail.
You want to embarrass him?
"They will mock him, girl."
If they see them heart shaped like this.
"And you know Kuzey, how easy it is to push his buttons."
"See it looks nice, when it's plain and simple as well."
He can offer it to the other jailers as well.
"Okay, it seems you thought of everything."
"Well, we need a smart person in the house."
"Then, dear mom..."
You brush some eggs over those.
While I'm writing Kuzey a note.
What note are you talking about?
You've written a novel since last night.
"Please, I expect some respect to my privacy."
I didn't read your letter.
I just saw you writing it.
- Of course you didn't read...
- Why would I read it?
"This challenge tests skills for rifle shooting, pioneering, and first aid merit badges."
There are three tasks.
One... ...hit three targets at a 22-rifle range.
"Two, complete the fourth wall of a pioneering tower."
From the top of this tower... ...shoot a slingshot... ...and hit three targets to retrieve this map.
"Three, follow the map to Lake Ida, then handle a life-threatening situation."
"Paul, you and Will are up on the rifle range first."
Go ahead and take your spots and we'll get started.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Get him Big South"
"Will ""Big South:"" All right."
"All right, you guys."
Paul:
I am determined to win this competition.
"I, I want this bad."
And I really hope that my Scoutmaster... ...gets to see me do the best that I can.
Somebody's going to have to cut off one of my limbs to stop me from winning.
"Will ""Big South:"" Honestly, I think the targets are kind of big."
"So I think this is a matter... of speed, and who gets it off first."
NARRATOR:
All right.
Eyes and ear protection are on both.
Rounds are being chambered.
Will is sighting in.
Stand by.
"Three, two, one, commence firing."
And Will has a miss on his first target.
Paul:
I hit something.
NARRATOR:
Paul's first shot takes down his target.
"All right, Will takes down his target."
Paul is sighting in on his second target.
"I could compare the process of  goal-setting with a matrioshka: one goal in another, and so they go on; there are many of them, they accumulate."
"And paradoxically in contrast with  this Russian doll, there is not always reduction of size, they could be of the same size."
But they are inserted in one another  and overflow from each other.
The second very important thing:  museum process and museum activity are more important then the final result.
"We don't seek this result  but we go forward to it, always by making goal-setting."
"And finally, the most important resource for museum activity which is not always estimated and used  is cooperation."
"It is a valuable resource  which needs much openness and, believe me, really less money."
So my appeal to the community:
Let's become more complex!
(Applause)
[Josh]
"Hey Donovan, do you have anything to drink?"
[Donovan]
"Yeah, in the fridge."
[Julian]
"Hey Josh, grab me a glass of ""melk""."
[Josh]
"They don't have any ""melk"", but I can get you some milk."
[Donovan]
That's what he just said.
[Julian]
"Yeah, I just want some ""melk""."
[Josh]
"Nah, you're saying it wrong."
"You're saying ""melk""."
Like it's a disease.
(Laughs)
[Donovan]
How do you say it?
[Josh]
I'm saying it the way everyone oughta say it.
"""Milk"" M-I-L-K"
"Let's go, aunty."
I welcome you on behalf of the Delhi Citizens Committee.
And I request the chief guest to start the function.
In today's function we have gathered to congratulate... ... those brave young pilots... ...who have risked their lives for their country.
And in the process they have set such standards of bravery... ... that every citizen of India is proud of them.
The State has already honoured them and will continue to do so.
But I believe that there is no greater award... ... than the love and good wishes of the people.
The first name in the list of award winners is...
You're surprised because you've seen flight lieutenant Arun Varma.
You look like Arun Varma.
I am his son.
Arun Varma died...
I shall tell you everything after the function.
But permit her presence here when I receive the medal.
You mean...
The person because of whom this day is a part of my life.
She's responsible for what I am and for the award that I'm receiving.
Please permit her to be a part of this happy moment of my life.
I would consider it the greatest honour.
I would also like to meet this person.
Please call her.
Mother...
"Come here, mother."
"Go, Vandana."
Suraj is calling you.
Me?
"- Yes, mother."
I am calling you.
Did you tell Suraj everything?
"No, a son has recognised his mother."
Go.
"Come, mother."
Is me.
Sing your song at the beep.
"Hi, M.J."
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
"Well, I was on my bike..."
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And... ...I know you predicted I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
"Is amazing, isn't it?"
How complicated a simple thing... ...Iike being someplace at 8:00 can become.
"Actually, there was this obnoxious usher."
"Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J."
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider-Man.
"Weird, huh?"
Now you know why I can't be with you.
"If my enemies found out about you... ...if you got hurt, I could never forgive myself."
I wish I could tell you how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen... ...my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon.
"But first, before we start... ...has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?"
Because we found the rubber band.
Is a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today... ...you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source.
"Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone."
And now let me introduce my assistants.
These four actuators were developed and programmed... ...for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion.
We can say congratulations now.
"Let this exam's result come in the best way, let my son pass it too."
"Don't worry, Yaman will make it!"
You will see.
"Today will be a beautiful day for him, and for you too, if it's not for anyone else."
Thank you very much.- Enjoy it.
You won't have headache after you drink the tea.
"Today, my day started very bad.. but I want it to be beautiful for someone else."
Thank you very much.
Good bless you!
There are analgesics in the closet.
"No, I have my medicine."
If I say that I have also headache from the excitement...
"Come on bro, I am in hurry.- You told me to stop."
Take it.
Thank you.
Calling Yaman.
Your brother let you down.
Cut your hopes!
There were some in photo albums too but who know where they are.
The photos spread why moving from one place to another.
I will order pita.
Don't take the trouble.
I will go now.
"It can't be, you came from far away."
"I will get it and bring right away-Order it, of course."
Your must have headache from hunger.
It's obvious you didn't eat anything.
Eylül calling.
:
Actually I can't look you in your face.
I disgraced mysself that night.- After that night so many disgraces happened that... don't worry at all.
Have you forgotten that the whole palace is  not fond of having a half brother of the king around?
Don't do anything to give them a reason to make it an issue.
It's my rightful duty to see you twice a day.
"You still don't call me ""mother""."
It seem like you are spying on me.
You are making me very uncomfortable.
What do you mean by spying?
You still don't have a heir and have not gotten a concubine  either.
Others are saying I am making you this way.
I'm just sorry for the one who has already passed.
There isn't any other reason.
"Although I am your new mother,  you must understand that I still care for you."
"Then, please seek out for a new candidate for the queen's position."
I will start seeking a new queen.
Who's out there?
"My prince, please, come in."
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
It's very late.
Let's go inside first.
Didn't you promise me already?
"Yes, I have promised you."
But I could not go against palace instruction...
Why?
Did she say that she doesn't want me?
Please let's step inside first...
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
"Okay, I'll sort of start it the"
"same way, say maybe 2x-y and maybe I'll take"
no zs as a zero and maybe a -x+2y and maybe a -z as a --
"oh, let me make that a minus one and, just for variety let me take,"
"-3z, -3ys, I should keep the ys in that line, and 4zs is, say, 4."
Okay.
That's three equations.
"I'm in three dimensions, x, y,"
z.
"And, I don't have a solution yet."
So I want to understand the
equations and then solve them.
Okay.
So how do I you understand
them?
The row picture one way.
The column picture is another very
important way.
"Just let's remember the matrix form,"
"here, because that's easy."
The matrix form -- what's our matrix A?
"Our matrix A is this right-hand side, the two and the minus one and"
"the zero from the first row, the minus one and the two and the"
"minus one from the second row, the zero, the minus three and the"
four from the third row.
So it's a three by three matrix.
"Three equations, three unknowns."
And what's our right-hand side?
"Of course, it's the vector, zero minus one, four."
Okay.
"So that's the way, well, that's the short-hand to write"
out the three equations.
"ln the last riots, I defended some innocent Hindus."
And my own people did this to me.
Father cannot walk.
But you want to fight.. ..with the One who created your entire community.
Will you flee?
I've no other option left.
I won't run.
"Look, I cannot fight your case in this condition.. ..but if the lawyers refuse to take up your case.. ..then according to the law you can defend your own case."
ls that possible?
"- Yes, there's a provision in the law."
lf you want I can prepare your legal notice.
"I'll be grateful to you, Hanif."
Hanif.
Do you believe in Allah?
Of course.
"God, Allah, they are all the same."
"So, I am fighting against Him."
"So, why are you helping me?"
You're not the only pleader.
Everyone does.
"Some pleads to Him, and some against Him."
Where do you want to send this notice?
I don't have his...
- Address.
No.
- Then.
The judge will dismiss your case in the first hearing.
"I mean, I don't have His address.. ..but of the places where people look for Him. "" You're our benefactor, our friend. """
""" So scare us. """
""" Why ruin our present, by telling us about an unknown future. """
""" You're our benefactor, our friend. """
""" Why ruin our present, by telling us about an unknown future. """
What okay?
"It's not , far from it."
What's all this hurry to achieve your interests from every opportunity?
What does that mean madam?
We didn't do anything yet.- Sequestration officers are here.
How do you know?&amp;gt; I know.
What's happening Selim?
Can something like this happen?
You brought the officers to our door without notifying us.
"Just a minute, I am the representative of the claimant, Mr. Umit didn't demand me for something like this."
"The claimer is Safet Orhun, not Mr. Umit."
"Mert, you go, I will come after."
Can I take a look to the documents?
:
"I am saying there is a mistake in this issue, why don't you listen?"
Is there any news from your brother?
"Don't worry,"
This issue will be solved today.
It's not my trouble.
If there is no money there won't be a sick certificate either.
Then you will be moved to prison way.
OK...
I said I would find it.
It will come today.
We will see.
Did he enter inside?-Yes he did.
Why did you choose this school?
Because I want to have a good education.
"Can you define ""Good"" to us?"
"How, in the lexical meaning? &amp;gt; No, no..."
"What do you mean when you say ""Good education"", I am curious about that."
Good.... promising in every way.

Sad Movie
They say that I'm an optical illusion.
They say that I'm just a social construct.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
The same people who say that it's fine for black and brown people to organize themselves for their own benefit say it's evil if my people do the same.
Why?
Who makes these unfair rules?
Asia is Asian.
Africa is African.
Where are the white countries?
They say that white countries don't exist.
They tell me to be loyal to humans but they all step on me.
People are saving endangered species like the whales and the spotted owl
What about my sub-species?
Would you call me a Nazi if want a happy future for people like myself?
Does Israel need diversity?
Whites are 8 percent of the world population and decreasing.
If they are against racism why don't they fight for me?
Why don't they fight for me?
What about a future for me?
What about a future for me?
What about a future for me?
Look not for the permanence of job but of love.
Listen to me and apologize to him.
What about our parents?
It is you who have to live together.
Not your parents.
Go quickly.
If you delay then he may not accept you.
Why are you still thinking?
Go now.
"Kiran, I did not come to say sorry to you."
But to tell you that I will live or die with you only.
Stop there.
What are you doing with my son now?
Have you gone mad?
What was the need for you to go to him?
I will bring a much better boy for you than him.
Get who ever you can.
But this marriage will never happen.
I wont agree for this marriage even if you fall at my feet.
Stop it.
Our marriage will take place.
We are not concerned with your standoff.
Our love is important for us.
She realized her mistake and.. ..apologized me.
Now if I bow to your adamancy.. .. then I will lose her forever.
Whether or not you agree we are going to marry.
Will you not shed your anger over me?
How can I bare that anger?
Stop your acting I will not surrender to you
Show some mercy on your girl who approached you
Does our paths ever combine?
Please stop your angry scolding
They lived in that
little house around the corner.
There was one brother that would be here - one or two that would be here
like all summer.
Coordinate stuff.
"Do you recall their names, or?"
Not really.
But they'd play ball
Baseball?
Yep.
And they'd go for walks after supper every night.
Walking down the middle of the road.
With their habits on.
"And then Larry McDonough was just getting into the riding stable thing and they'd - he had 6, 8 horses."
That was one of the things they'd do.
They could rent the horses.
They had one day to be back and forth on them.
And they just seemed a real pleasant bunch.
They never preached.
They didn't do anything like that.
"They were just more friendly, you know."
They were all teachers out of Chicago.
Some Jesuit college or something down there.
"Not Jesuit, but you know."
But we'd always haul them - pick up their luggage with the truck and - same as like when boy scouts come.
You'd load all their gear in the truck and take it up to Fox Lake or into that little road into
Barney's Lake.
"It's fenced off now, but down there."
"So, the brothers would come here."
They were teaching at the colleges down in Chicago there.
Their time here was for what?
That was their retreat.
SPEAKER 28:
"I don't really have to worry about it that much as a guy, I feel like, so."
SPEAKER 29:
"Being a guy, I feel like it's less of a concern."
SPEAKER 23:
And I'm not scared of personally being assaulted.
SPEAKER 20:
"As a boy, I would be less likely to be sexually abused or something like that."
SPEAKER 30:
To protect myself?
I don't really feel like I'd be too much of a victim.
"I'm more focused on my girlfriend, my female friends."
SPEAKER 31:
"Yeah, I don't think there's much I actively do or at least consciously do to protect myself [INAUDlBLE]."
SPEAKER 32:
"Um, I don't really do anything."
SPEAKER 29:
I probably don't do anything on a day-to-day basis to protect myself from sexual violence.
SPEAKER 31:
Essentially nothing.
SPEAKER 33:
Nothing.
SPEAKER 34:
This video is not intended to demonstrate what women should be doing to protect themselves.
"Rather, it is intended to highlight a social reality."
100% of women experience the threat of sexual violence every day.
This is a lived reality that most men never personally experience nor are aware of.
SPEAKER 35:
"Additionally, women are often blamed for the violence committed against them."
"She should have worn a longer skirt, or she shouldn't have drunk that much are victim-blaming phrases."
Rape is never the victim's fault.
SPEAKER 34:
I beg at you.
But... - Otherwise...
"Otherwise, I'll become widow before marriage."
"Don't say that, Radha."
We're with you.
I'll speak truth and none other than the truth.
Inspector Damodar... ...don't you think you should have come in your uniform... ...for giving your statement?
"Your Honour, actually we become little tough in uniform."
While giving our statement we forget the human emotions.
I'd just repeat few lines of this Geeta.
It says... if a sinner confesses his sin... ...and is ready to go through it's punishment... ...he is no more considered a sinner.
"Your Honour, we, the police officers tried our best to arrest Jackie."
And finally what did we get?
Nothing.
Total flop.
Order... order...
"Your Honour, isn't this evidence enough... ...that Jackie has surrendered."
Your Honour.
He was a criminal.
But now he is not.
There's a lot of difference between both the tenses.
We must forget the past.
And think about his present and future.
"If he wants to mend his ways, I'd request the court... ...that the law should show mercy upon him."
"So that he can be a good man, a good citizen... ...why..."
"Your Honour, I think I've said too much."
"Sorry, I became little emotional."
"But whatever I said had some weight, right?"
Yes.
Under the IPC section 362. court orders... ...2 years imprisonment to Jackie alias Jaikishan.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Just leave.
"Boss, honestly."
"If it was about a goon, we'd have managed."
This girl is very sharp.
We can't control her.
We're trying to explain her that we're the police officers...
And she's in the police custody for her wellbeing.
But she's not ready to believe us.
We've to keep her here for 18 days.
How will you manage?
It doesn't suit to tenderly girls like you.
You all are goons.
You've kidnapped me.
But I'm Radha Mathur.
I know how to tackle with goons like you.
"Never try to do that with me, is that clear?"
I beg of you
You can take away all my jewelries.
But please let me go.
"Look, you are misunderstanding us."
We're government servants.
We'll have to follow our senior's orders.
Then why don't you arrange for me to talk with my father?
What's all this?
This is the result of your father's enmity with a goon.
That goons is planning to kidnap you.
That's why our IG has ordered us to keep you... ...in our safe custody away from the city.
But how do I believe you?
This is a not a drama.
Do you have any evidence?
Wait for the 24 hours and you'll get the evidence.
That's a tape.
"Go bring the instruments now, hurry."
"Yes, sir."
Is he not being able to breath?
"Don't just look, please try something."
This is a lethal location.
"Your Majesty, please let us know of your successor."
Please make your decision.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty ...
The king has passed.
The king has passed.
The king has passed.
You've done well.
You've been most helpful.
"But the queen and the young prince survive, as well as the queen's father who has many follower and is from a warrior clan..."
Don't you think I can take care of a woman and a child?
"With her father and left minister (war minister) gone, she won't have a chance."
"Your Highness, we need to do something before the Queen Mother does something."
The Queen Mother has the right to choose the successor.
Do you think they're that easy to persuade?
"Your Highness, if we retreat from here you and the young prince's life could be in danger."
"Also, this is the chef's record."
There were no records for the day His Majesty became ill.
You mean ..?
That's right.
Even the person who writes the record is missing as well.
There hasn't been enough time for them to take the recorder  out of the palace.
"That means, she is hidden somewhere inside of palace."
Inside of palace?
"Yes, Your Highness."
"They say I look like, well, an actor in the movie Seediq Bale!"
And Power Station (a Taiwanese indigenous band)
I feel happy as long as I can dance.
I feel happy as long as somebody is watching me.
I am happy as long as my customers are happy.
I love the feeling living in mountains.
Also I am quite interested in my own cultures.
Every single ceremony gives me another different feeling.
Since I began to work as a guide
"Of course, I started to have some students, five or six,"
Which made me so proud!
"And then, after the typhoon Morakot, I got more students."
"Like Wen-Feng, who became another new guide."
This is what delighted me the most.
So that we can pass down Tanayiku to the next generation.
"My child seems interested in my job, too."
Because sometimes he is with me when I am working as a guide.
"And then, sometimes he told me, ""Mum, you are so great!"""
"And I feel, ""Wow!""......"
Am I really as great as he says?
When the guests like what I cook and eat them all
Then I feel happy
I must try my cooking out
Let's check it out
This is......
"Uh, salt!"
"Haha, this is the spoon for salt"
Hahahahaha
Happiness is......
Perhaps because they live in cities
So they come here for leisure.
To forget about all the pressure of days
The ice is melting.
But the frog is dead.
Unless it can kick start its heart.
Blood flows.
Nerves twitch.
The frog is back from the dead.
"There's no frostbite, no damage."
The spring ponds of the north are free from competition.
No other frog can survive life in the deep freeze.
NARRATOR:
The next incredible story of survival comes from down on the farm.
[rooster crows]
"It's September 10, 1945."
Farmer Lloyd Olsen is having chicken for dinner.
He selects a five-month-old rooster called Mike.
The headless chicken carried on as though nothing had happened.
A blood clot prevented him from bleeding to death.
"Mike's head was gone, but most of the brain stem and one ear was intact."
And a brain stem provides all the thinking power a chicken needs to survive.
Mike the headless chicken became famous.
Feeding was a problem.
Farmer Lloyd dropped water and grain down what was left of Mike's gullet.
Mike not only survived-- he thrived.
Mike the chicken struts into number 4 because he lived for 18 months without a head.
"Unfortunately, Mike had a mucus problem and needed an eyedropper to clear his airways."
"One day, Lloyd couldn't get to the eyedropper fast enough... and his headless chicken died."
But Mike's legend lives on.
The animals crawling into number 3 thrive in the underworld.
Rats.
We think they're dirty.
Disgusting.
Diseased.
"Just basically, you know, so how do they make their marriage work?"
You're just trying to take the concentration off of the sex end.
You're like where is the relationship?
"Where is our, where is the rest of our intimacy?"
David:
Yeah.
The point is love and sex are different things.
Chandra:
Correct.
David:
"And for a lot of people, they are very lined up and when they think about their relationships, sex is kind of really at the center of where it is."
"But if you set up a relationship and from the get go,"
"I mean, everyone has really close friendships, right?"
Star:
Yes.
David:
"Which are different, but you can form a really close relationship where sex isn't at the center of it."
"And so it's...it's abstract, but it's thinking about how do you form a relationship that's closer, that's more committed than, you know, can be the basis for a family?"
Joy:
But what about kissing and cuddling with a girl and having a little of that stuff?
David:
"Oh, I personally like that."
Joy:
"Oh, you do like that?"
"So, what if the girl gets aroused?"
What are you going to do?
[laughter]
David:
"I mean, she's going to know from the get go."
Joy:
She might change her mind once you embrace her.
[laughter]
We will burn his house.. .. with a tank full of petrol and bring Shailaja back.
Are you out of your mind?
He is not an ordinary person.
He is a powerful man in entire Telangana.
That will be our strength.
He cannot imagine .. ..that we will dare to rescue Shailu from him.
Even then we should not be careless.
With a perfect plan.. ..we should rescue her tonight.
"Bhadra, listen to me."
She is not even taking any food.
How would she possibly marry you and lead her life with you?
Dont do it.
If you decorate your feet with Mehendi.
They look beautiful with that red color.
If you decorate your hands they too look beautiful.
But dont let blood smear your hands.
It will not be nice.
I could have done anything with you.
But my father told me in his death bed.. .. not to hurt any woman.
That is why I have caused no harm to you.
But I will definitely marry you.
I dont like you.
Then whom do you like?
That Venkat who left you and ran away?
Why do you think him so much about him?
I am the person who is standing all your abuses.
Think about me.
Change your mind.
It is not me but you who has to change your mind.
"Whatever you say, my fancy for you is only increasing."
What do you ladies have?
Even kings become your slaves.
"Just think: all the cars, tractors, trucks, ships and planes in the world added together emit fewer greenhouse gasses than livestock farming!"
Oh really?
"Wow, I thought it was mostly cars."
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Livestock?
"That's crazy, so more than the cars."
Are you serious?
"Yeah, I didn't know that."
That's insane.
"No, I did not know that, no."
That's news to me.
I haven't heard that.
"I've never heard the livestock connection, no."
"Well I knew there was some, but I had no idea that it was so extensive."
How does it come from livestock exactly?
What do you call cow farts?
What do you call that?
OK ...
"Yeah, the methane gas coming from the cows."
Yeah.
"It's cow shit, right?"
Doesn't cow poop?
"It's what the emissions, right?"
"I thought it was just fat people here in the South, here in America."
"But no, apparently it's cattle as well."
It's quite worrying.
"Well I saw an article and they say, because it is the cow, what they fart and then actually the farting they make the global warming."
And how can it be that farm animals place a heavier burden on the environment than the entire transport sector worldwide?
"Well, actually it is rather simple."
Once upon a time a farmer was someone who owned land and some animals.
Get it off!
Get it off!
"Release him, demon."
"I command you in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ."
"Tell me your name, wicked one."
He who commands you is he who ordered you thrown down... ...from the highest heaven into the depths of hell.
"In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, I now command you:"
Tell me your name!
"Hear, therefore, and fear, Satan, enemy of the faith."
"Give me your name, demon!"
Names!
Names!
Ancient serpents... ...depart from this servant of God!
Tell me your six names!
We are the ones who dwell within!
And I am Lucifer... ...the devil in the flesh.
Mr. Rose.
"Doctor, help him!"
"*After a few moments,* *Mr. Rose revived... *"
*... but the exorcism* *had to be abandoned. *
Emily was taken to her room and soon fell into a deep sleep.
The whole thing was a complete failure.
Describe her behavior from the night of the failed exorcism... ...until the time of her death.
Violence towards others and herself.
Sometimes she screamed for hours on end.
"She drove her head through windows, tried to bite..."
"Tried to bite holes in the walls, breaking several more of her teeth... ...as you saw in the postmortem photograph."
- You witnessed this?
"- Some of it, yes."
I tried to visit every day... ...and the family told me the rest.
Did you attempt another exorcism?
"I wanted to, but Emily refused."
"produces a zero, and in the second component I have a"
"minus one and a four, they combine to give the three."
But look at this picture.
So here's our key picture.
I combine this column and this column to get this guy.
That was the b.
That's the zero three.
Okay.
So that idea of
"linear combination is crucial, and also -- do we want to think"
about this question?
"Sure, why not."
What are all the combinations?
If I took -- can I go back to xs and ys?
This is a question for
"really -- it's going to come up over and over, but why don't we see it"
once now?
"If I took all the xs and all the ys, all the combinations,"
what would be all the results?
"And, actually,"
the result would be that I could get any right-hand side at all.
The combinations of this and this would fill the whole plane.
You can tuck that away.
"We'll, explore it further."
But this idea
of what linear combination gives b and what do all the linear
"combinations give, what are all the possible,"
achievable right-hand sides be -- that's going to be basic.
Okay.
Can I move to three equations and three unknowns?
Because it's easy to picture the two by two case.
Let me do a three by three example.
Radha likes him.
If we are getting a good son-in-law... ...what's wrong in waiting for few more years?
"By then, even Radha will pass her graduation."
And it's not easy to get her married in this circumstances.
Radha!
Come out.
Come here.
You always shared everything with me.
But today you didn't tell me about your feelings?
Father!
Kishan!
I can't come and see you in the jail.
And this letter also may be my last letter to you.
On this condition brother Damu has postponed... ...my marriage for 2 more years.
"Kishan, how will I spend these two years?"
I'll miss you every moment.
"We'll meet, Kishan."
We'll definitely meet... ...at the same place from where we had separated.
"""Even after separation, we're worried about one thing."""
"""How will I live for years in this condition?"""
"""Death didn't but your memories reached me."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""After few days love we faced a long period of separation."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""My lips murmured in prayer for you."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""After few days love we faced a long period of separation."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""I'm not with you, my love."""
"""And there's no hope of our meeting."""
"""And there's no hope of our meeting."""
"""On top of it, the spring puts us on test."""
it is one of the first column and two of the second column and let's
just see what we get.
So in the first component I'm
getting a two and a ten.
I'm getting a twelve there.
"In the second component I'm getting a one and a six, I'm"
getting a seven.
So that matrix times that vector is
twelve seven.
"Now, you could do that another way."
You could do it a row at a time.
And you would get this twelve --
and actually I pretty much did it here -- this way.
Two -- I could take that row times my vector.
This is the idea of a
dot product.
"This vector times this vector, two times one plus five"
times two is the twelve.
This vector times this vector --
one times one plus three times two is the seven.
"So I can do it by rows, and in each row times my x is what"
I'll later call a dot product.
But I also like to see it by
columns.
I see this as a linear combination of a column.
So here's my point.
A times x is a combination of the
columns of A. That's how I hope you will think of A times x when we need
it.
"Right now we've got -- with small ones, we can always do it"
"in different ways, but later, think of it that way."
Okay.
side.
I just cooked it up by adding this one to this one.
"Now, what's the solution with this new right-hand side?"
The solution with this new right-hand side is clear.
took one of these and none of those.
"So actually, it just changed around"
to this when I took this new right-hand side.
Okay.
"So in the row picture, I have three different planes,"
three new planes meeting now at this point.
"In the column picture,"
"I have the same three columns, but now I'm combining them"
"to produce this guy, and it turned out that column one"
plus column two which would be somewhere -- there is the right
column -- one of this and one of this would give me the new b.
Okay.
So we squeezed in an extra example.
"But now think about all bs,"
all right-hand sides.
Can I solve these equations for
every right-hand side?
Can I ask that question?
So that's the algebra question.
Can I solve A x=b for every b?
Let
me write that down.
Can I solve A x =b for every
right-hand side b?
"I mean, is there a solution?"
"And then, if there is, elimination will give me a way to find it."
"I really wanted to ask, is there a solution for every right-hand side?"
"So now, can I put that in different words -- in this linear"
Come...
What's this?
Another temple of death?
"It's my tomb, Antony"
"When I die, it will be sealed tight"
"Here is where I'll lie, but not be confined"
"Beyond flesh, I will journey to the next life and back at will"
"And there, my sweet, noble king,"
I have reserved a place for you to travel with me
"I will lie anywhere with you, Cleopatra, but I'm not ready to accept death, not, not yet"
"Tonight, I had a dream"
I was winning a great battle!
ln the desert!
Even the ground was in my favor
"Octavius' army was marching on impossible terrain no place to deploy, nowhere to maneuver his army"
"lf I strike him, and I strike him hard and fast,"
I can stop his momentum...
And finish him in the desert!
That's right!
"So we may finally realise your vision... of uniting the east and west in a new Golden Age of light, of love, and dominion"
Antony!
Let me and my men come with you
"No, I need someone here I can trust"
You'll see that the Queen is safe?
On my life
These are just ornaments
"Still, Octavius will not have them"
"Your Majesty, this is the whole list?"
You must complete this side
Yes
Where is Caesarian?
I haven't seen him of late
People are dying because they drink their neighbor's waste.
The water is so unclean that it contains your neighbor's waste.
This is hard for many environmental enthusiasts to grasp.
Climate change overwhelms them so much that they forget reality.
They forget that two million kids die of diarrhea due to unclean water.
It's horrible that we don't have clean drinking water in the world.
And that we have air pollution because houses don't have chimneys.
That contributes to childhood pneumonia.
It's a major environmental problem.
"At the same time, I say the climate is the biggest environmental threat."
But not the biggest environmental problem - it's a future problem.
You have to think several thoughts at once.

Sad Movie
"This year, 32 public libraries are scheduled to open in Seoul."
"The city announced it as part of a plan to introduce 48 libraries,"
"First, let's have a meeting regarding the design."
"Okay, I worked for Pioneer"
"Hybrid International, out of Adair, illinois."
I worked under plant breeder Dr. Mark Hoffback.
And I reported to Bruce Edson.
He's a senior research associate for Pioneer.
And my project was related with nitrogen-use efficiency corn hybrids.
"The field that I worked with was flooded out not once, not twice, but three times."
And if you there today there is only soybeans that high.
"In other words, we had to contact other research stations around the Midwest and go"
[Text on screen:
"Josh, student intern]: to their nitrogen-use efficiency plots and collect our data."
"So I went to Marion, Iowa; Princeton, illinois; and Johnston, Iowa, which is Pioneer's world headquarters."
And I collected my data from their locations.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So what would you say is the most exciting thing about your internship this summer?
Josh:
"The most exciting thing was to work with very smart, intelligent people that know a lot about the maize or the corn crop."
"And most of all, their passion about it."
They really
like what they do.
And it made me like what I do.
Learning from those people is worth more than the paycheck every week.
"Or most importantly meeting those people for down the road future references, for possibly a job after graduation."
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
Thanks a lot for talking with us.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Bill.
William Bailey:
"Hello, Beth."
Beth Seaton:
Thank god
"Most importantly, calm this man down because he's shocked"

"Excuse me, prove what happened now at tomorrow's case"
Luck was on our side this time
"Mahmoud should be with you tomorrow morning at court and you're ready, right?"
Ofcourse!
Today's case will really help us and I've made a deal with the officer
"I'd love to know, where has he been for 2 weeks"
"It's just like you see it, his actions are odd"
I'm very worried for him
What's the reason for this confusion?
Let's hope he stays that way till tomorrow!
What if he doesn't get confused tomorrow at court and told him everything?
How would we solve that?
We're ready for everything Mr.Sameh
"Medical statements, the guy who got hit yesterday."
Everything!
These will really help us
As long as he's at court tomorrow
"Mr.Mahmoud, what do you have to say for what's being said about you?"

"I object, Your Honour."
Mr. Kanji is calling service to God a business.
Of course it's business.
Take a visit to any religious place.
First you've to pay for parking.
"Then, pay for standing in the smaller queue."
"Then pay for the flowers, blanket, candle."
And the donation box is kept right before the idol.
"As soon as you bow down, you've to put something in it."
And they even charge for the offerings of God.
Just like we're charged for seeing wax statues in the museum.
"Similarly, they charge us for seeing the stone idols in temples."
And the priests have salaries as well.
"His is less, and his is more."
And you even have income tax benefits.
Right?
"So, where's the service?"
"And, Your Honour, there's never recession in this business."
No.
"ln fact, they do better business during recession. "" Oh, God!"
"Oh my, God! """
Relax.
Consider that it is a business.
"Still, why are you asking them for compensation?"
You pay premiums for your insurance.. ..so you can ask them for a compensation.
But why will the temple pay you?
Because...l've paid premiums in their temples as well.
- What?
What nonsense?
I knew you won't believe me.. ..so I have brought all the proofs along.
Look.
These are the receipts of the premium.. ..l've been paying for the last 18 years.
"(imitates crash) Oh, (bleep)in' balls!"
I'd better get the rest of the day off.

And that's why I always warn people.
This is what happens when you go out and get a real job.
People get hurt.
But you know what doesn't hurt?
The comment question of the day.
That segway made no (bleep)ing sense.
The comment question of the day comes from  a user named NycKiko and she said...

Today we're going to begin focusing on theories that are primarily concerned with environment and how they influence organizational effectiveness and survival.
"These theories are called resource dependence theory, network organization, and new institutional theory."
Now sit aside.
We do not speak to drunkards at all.
I am a drunkard but not a hen-pecked husband.
How dare you say that to me?
Did you see what he said about you?
I am observing you since some time.
Why are you getting aggressive?
There the ladies have entered the arena.
You too enter the fray.
What are you ranting?
We agreed for this marriage.. ..since we did not know that you are worthless people.
See this sari that you presented.
Please do not tear the sari.
That sari is more than enough for your status.
"Madam, past is past."
Please keep quiet now.
"Who are you to speak in between, you bald fellow?"
How dare you speak to me like that?
If not a bald fellow we will call you a rotten fellow.
"Teacher, bald is better than rotten."
Oh!
Is that so?
Why dont you say loudly so that all can hear?
All of you please listen!
"My teacher is bald, not rotten."
"My dear bride, why dont you patch up for what happened.. ..by saying sorry to the groom once?"
You shut up.
Will a sorry nullify everything they did?
"Look sir, will you accept it if the girl you love insults you.. ..in front of all and then say sorry?"
I will not.
Every time this bus puncture at this place.
Is this a hotel?
There's the cars we're driving and the water waste.
And all the trash we don't care where we're throwing it.
That's what I think.
"Cars, buses."
"It's industry, its gasoline, it's energy use."
All the fumes from cars.
Cars.
Too many vehicles maybe.
The fumes in the air.
All the gas.
And people driving in the city.
"Cars, factories, planes."
I image the aviation industry hasn't helped.
I mean one air plane can fly across country and its like 40 tonnes of carbon.
"40 tonnes, that's a lot."
I think in one word I would say pollution.
"Coal power stations, gas power stations."
People using more energy than they need to.
We are wasting a lot ...
An excessive use of gasses.
"And also coal burning stations, especially in China."
"All the pollutants that we pump into the air, day after day."
"Everyone says the same thing: it's the cars, the planes, the industrial plants."
It's because we leave our lights on and take long showers.
Always the same familiar answers.
"And yes: of course it's true, but no-one has yet won the grand prize."
Because we're forgetting one extremely important factor.
Eighteen percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock farming.
That might surprise you.
"Farmed animals, 18%!"
And guess what percentage of total global emissions are caused by transport?
Thirteen percent!
"Merlo Pont, Jacques Lacan, Raymon Queneau, and its said that Jean Paul Sartre got the notes"
The Master-Slave dialectic sets out the origen of history.
How did history begin?
Perhaps no one ever asked himself this but the beginning of history is the beginning of human relations
"For Hegel, history began when two wills clashed, two desiring wills"
First let's differentiate between the human will and the animal will
The human will seeks other wills.
To wit: the will of one man seeks the will of another
That is: he desires that the other recognize him ...that he recognize him as the superior. ..that he submits.
So that I seek the will of the other.
I want the other to recognize me and submit to me.
And I'm going to constitute myself when this happens
The relationship that is going to be established between the other and myself
But at first the man seeks wills.
The animal seeks things and the things that it seeks it usually eats.
It desires natural things.
But man doesn't seek natural things
The consciousness is desire.

We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.
(Laughter)
"I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders."
(Laughter)
"The sixth-graders look at it and they say, ""No."""
(Laughter)
"""You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."""
(Laughter)
"""The chicken is not."""
(Laughter)
"So this is our problem, as you can imagine."
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
(Laughter) (Applause)
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"""Fix the chicken."""
(Laughter)
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
"Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools."

We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world

Calls are coming in and we're looking at our friends
Wondering who's it gonna be
It was so good once upon a time
It was a simple time
It was a good time
Now we got the perks and all the crème
And it's tearing us apart at the seams
But I remember
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world

Mr.Sameh
"The people were asking, do we stay or do we leave?"
Their presence now isn't really important I guess...
Pay them and let them leave
What?
Nobody is gonna leave
Assume he suddenly returns
He has to return to find everything the way it was
Yeah I agree
"If he returns, treat him just like you did at first"
Got it?
Okay
"Let's go, looks like we wont find anything here"
"It's no use, we've been looking for 2 weeks"
Now what?
We're doing what we can
All this is useless
The court meeting is tomorrow
And now what?
"It's a difficult situation, if the father isn't here, we'll lose the case"
We'll be jailed for at least 5 years
"No, we can't wait that long"
"Karim, Sameh, you have to decide on something"
Can't we get another guy to pretend he's dad?
"This situation has other arrangements, we have no time"
And we can't postpone tomorrow's court session?
That was the final postponal
Can't you lend us money till we find dad?
"If I had money, do you think I would've been helping you now?"
"Listen, when it comes to the bank we all took that loan"
Which means we'd all go to prison
"Don't say that, hopefully nothing bad will happen"
"They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die."
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
They try and build it.
They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
So what do you do?
Do you let them die?
"Well, somebody had a great idea."
And it was a simple idea.
It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field.
Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment.
"And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through."
"So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?"
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
[Video]
Woman:
Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.
Man:
You know how expensive those are.
"I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas."
Woman:
What solution?
Man:
"Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have."
Boy:
"Grand-dad, tell me the solution please."
Man:
I will tell all of you.
They're the... our genre's most important things.
You need to make them feel alive.
You need to make them breathe.
You need to make them just realistic.
"So, let's talk about ways to do that."
First thing that we'll start to talk about is the concept of a sympathetic character.
Sympathetic Characters.
This is kind of the word that a lot of us use.
"Because, sympathetic is better than saying protagonist and antagonist, or heroes and villains."
"Because you want, generally, almost all of your characters to be sympathetic for one reason or another, ok?"
"Even your villains, the villains that you love, are sympathetic for a couple of... for some odd reason, and we'll talk about that."
"Let me throw it at your guys first who haven't taken the class before, since the rest of you know the answers to this, hopefully."
If you don't...
What makes a character sympathetic to you?
What makes you like a character when you're reading a book?
Student:
Some similarity between you and the character.
Brandon:
Ok.
You hit one of the big three right off the bat.
Student:
They have problems.
Brandon:
Ok.
Problems are good.
"Another way to put this is the ""underdog syndrome."""
"We like the underdogs, don't we?"
It's just human nature.
"Ok, what else?"
Student:
Consistency.
"I mean, they can evolve, but not be doing just random things."
So the third -- the algebra way to look at the
problem is the matrix form and using a matrix that I'll call A.
"Okay, so can I do an example?"
The whole semester will be examples
and then see what's going on with the example.
"So,"
take an example.
"Two equations, two unknowns."
"So let me take 2x -y =0, let's say."
And -x +2y=3.
"Okay. let me -- I can even say right away -- what's the matrix,"
"that is, what's the coefficient matrix?"
The matrix that involves
these numbers -- a matrix is just a rectangular array
of numbers.
"Here it's two rows and two columns, so 2 and --"
"minus 1 in the first row minus 1 and 2 in the second row,"
that's the matrix.
"And the right-hand -- the,"
"unknown -- well, we've got two unknowns."
"So we've got a vector, with two components, x and x,"
and we've got two right-hand sides that go into a vector 0 3.
"I couldn't resist writing the matrix form, right -- even"
before the pictures.
So I always will think of this as
"the matrix A, the matrix of coefficients, then there's a vector"
of unknowns.
Here we've only got two unknowns.
Later we'll have any
number of unknowns.
"And that vector of unknowns,"
well I'll often -- I'll make that x -- extra bold.
"This is the first lecture in MlT's course 18.06,"
"linear algebra, and I'm Gilbert Strang."
"The text for the course is this book, Introduction to Linear Algebra."
"And the course web page, which has got a lot of exercises"
"from the past, MatLab codes, the syilabus for the"
"course, is web.mit.edu/18.06."
And this is the first
"lecture, lecture one."
"So, and later we'll give the web"
"address for viewing these, videotapes."
"Okay, so what's in the"
first lecture?
This is my plan.
"The fundamental problem of linear algebra, which is to solve a system"
of linear equations.
So let's start with a case when we
"have some number of equations, say n equations and n unknowns."
So an equal number of equations and unknowns.
"That's the normal, nice case."
And what I want to do is
"-- with examples, of course -- to describe,"
"first, what I call the Row picture."
That's the picture of one equation
at a time.
It's the picture you've seen before in two by two equations
where lines meet.
"So in a minute,"
you'll see lines meeting.
"The second picture, I'll put a star"
"beside that, because that's such an important one."
And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time.
And those are the rows and columns of a matrix.

woman speaking native language:
There is a new one over here.
[man speaking native language] man speaking native language:
"Oh, gosh."
You have to pull on this one.
Can you manage it? woman speaking native language:
Nope. man:
You have to pull using your dorsal muscles. woman speaking native language:
It won't budge.
[man speaking native language] woman speaking native language:
IT WON'T BUDGE. man:
"John, it is necessary to address one or two shortcomings in, uh, the physical side of marriage."
"Surely no one would argue that there are certain physical demands a wife can request of a husband, and Ann asks you that you address these issues right now."
[laughter]
Do you agree to wash the windows inside and out?
[laughter]
man speaking native language:
It's like at the gym.
"You grab here, you grip there, and you position yourself with parallel feet so you can use your dorsal muscles."
Then you pull.

These smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum... ...allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction... ...in an environment no human hand could enter.
"Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in the arms... ...is as advanced as you suggest... ...couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?"
How right you are.
Which is why I developed this inhibitor chip... ...to protect my higher brain function.
"It means I maintain control of these arms, instead of them controlling me."
And now on to the main event.
"Give me the blue light, Rosie."
Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and Oscorp lndustries for providing it.
"Happy to pay the bills, Otto."
Ladies and gentlemen... ...fasten your seat belts.
"Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction."
This is a breakthrough beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.

"Shut it off, Otto!"
Shut it off!

"a minus one and in the second equation a two,"
"and on the right-hand side, zero and three."
"You see, the"
"columns of the matrix, the columns of A are here and the"
right-hand side b is there.
And now what is the equation asking
for?
It's asking us to find -- somehow to combine that vector and
this one in the right amounts to get that one.
It's asking us to find
the right linear combination -- this is called a linear combination.
And it's the most fundamental operation in the whole course.
It's a linear combination of the columns.
That's what we're seeing
on the left side.
"Again, I don't want to write down a"
big definition.
You can see what it is.
"There's column one, there's column two."
I multiply by some numbers and I add.
That's a combination --
a linear combination and I want to make those numbers the right numbers
to produce zero three.
Okay.
Now I want to draw a picture
"that, represents what this -- this is algebra."
"What's the geometry, what's the picture that goes with it?"
Okay.
"So again, these vectors have two components,"
so I better draw a picture like that.
So can I put down these columns?
"I'll draw these columns as they are, and then I'll do a combination of"
"No, but I know what they taste like individually, so..."
"- Okay, well, don't we all?"
- Good luck. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Get creative.
Cold pan.
Cold pan.
"Felix, what's going on?"
Are you gonna try to pan-roast this and get the fat rendered?
Yeah.
It works better when the pan's on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) You might run out of time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I think that's good.
- Interesting.
- Yeah.
- Definitely.
"- Very interesting indeed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Becky, I mean,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; she's going for dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A rhubarb tart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So, look, working with both&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;hands at the same time.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- I love the way she's multitasking."
- Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm really concerned about Samantha.
Would you put sweet potato with rhubarb?
Ugh.
That sounds disgusting.
"So Felix says she's gonna bring her, you know, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;restaurant experience.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"But her duck, I put my whole hand in the pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not even on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It could be good if done right.
"So, Scott, I don't know what zone &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's going into.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's doing a profiterole&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;with sweet potato&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and duck breast.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Profiteroles are a dessert, and they remain dessert. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And they shouldn't be tampered with.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Absolutely.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Now, you should be working on your finesse &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and making sure everything&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you put on the plate&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;has a reason.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Okay, five minutes left, guys."
Five minutes.
"Right, Tali, how you feeling? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene) Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Fire."
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stand back.
Just stand back.
Okay.
So what have we got on this
left-hand side?
A linear combination.
"It's a linear combination now of three vectors,"
and they happen to be -- each one is a three dimensional
"vector, so we want to know what combination"
of those three vectors produces that one.
Shall I try to draw the column
"picture, then?"
"So, since these vectors have three"
components -- so it's some multiple -- let me draw in the first
column as before -- x is two and y is minus one.
Maybe there is the first column. y -- the second column has maybe a
"minus one and a two and the y is a minus three, somewhere,"
"there possibly, column two."
And the third column has --
"no zero minus one four, so how shall I draw that?"
So this was the first component.
The second component was a minus
one.
Maybe up here.
"That's column three,"
that's the column zero minus one and four.
This guy.
"So, again, what's my problem?"
What this equation is asking me to do is to combine these three vectors
with a right combination to produce this one.
"Well,"
"you can see what the right combination is, because in"
"this special problem, specially chosen by the lecturer,"
that right-hand side that I'm trying to get is actually one of these
But not the animal sliding into number 2: the lungfish.
It can breathe air.
"So when the going gets tough, the lungfish digs deep."
"Three feet underground, it swallows mud to excavate a chamber."
It secretes slime that hardens into an impermeable body bag...
sealing the lungfish away from the drought.
Mud makes a time capsule.
And great bricks.
"Inside its cocoon, the lungfish shuts down."
The comatose lungfish is number 2 because it can remain in suspended animation for up to four years!
"But even in Southern Africa, the rains will come."
[thunder]
[rainfall]
Water dissolves the slime sack.
The lungfish awakes.
Withered and shrunken.
It has survived for four years by cannibalizing its own muscles.
But it has still enough strength to slither to water.
It's an extraordinary feat of endurance.
Only one animal survives longer in far worse conditions.
NARRATOR:
The ultimate survivor hides out in the forests of Canada.
"For the world's largest deer, it makes life a living hell."
Moose are bled dry.
Attacked by a plague of tiny vampires.
It's late summer.
Bloodsuckers the size of a grain of sand swarm at the optimum height to meet a moose.
Ticks.
CO2 from moose breath stimulates the swarm.
"One moose can be home to 100,000 ticks."
Over two months the ticks drink 10 gallons-- that's a moose's total volume of blood.
Infested animals are called ghosts.
Insults are always a sign of inability
"Happens a lot, For example when a guy tries to get the girl"
"Nothing happens, so he tries to insult her"
Hi baby.
Let's Dance
"Sorry, no ..."
Sl*t
"Insults are really just empty air, We should not pay attention to them...."
Completely!
"Who understands it, it's mpossible to hurt him"
But there are those who take the harsh words in their direction
"For them, it is better to understand thay insults are lies and complex of the offender or the meanness of offending"
"Indeed, how low you need to go if you insult someone weak"
So you're rose above him.
Laughed and forgot
But he remembered and stepped out the window
"Maybe I'm exaggerating,But the essence is clear"
"By the way, is often not only an insult."
And by praise you can understand human values
Someone praises a rich businessman.
And translation:
Yeah cool I also aspire to be like this
"Someone praises a monk, sitting in a monastery And a similar translation:"
I aspire to be like that
But when one praises the monk but reproaches the one that praises the businessman
It's only a clash of values.Full stop
Therefore such criticisms should pass by you
Because this is for you.
That it for him.

"I want to make sure to just give a few last tips for the very final draft,"
For example what do Stanford alumni most want to see?
Sat scores.
"Winning state championships and, and national championships."
What is it?
What resources are considered most and
least important?
"On the other hand, does the availability or supply of the resource influence its value?"
Is the resource scarce?
Do only some of the other organizations have it?
How concentrated is the resource?
"Are there, are there alternatives to this resource."
Can another kind of resource be substituted for it.
Who else has it?
Let's consider Stanford again.
What does it offer?
"What, what does Stanford offer that is unique, that no one else can provide?"
It's an open question.
Leave it for the forum.
Discretion over a resource also defines relations of resource dependence.
Discretion is defined in at least two ways.
"First, who controls the resource?"
Can the exchange partner dictate how you use the resource?
Is the resource regulated by the government?
"So changing, districting to increase the resource or, or pool of available students for a particular school."
Is your firm dependent on the supplier for materials and funds?
Or is it dependent on consumers like students and families?
"Second, what controls dependencies?"
What laws are in place?
What are the copyrights or contracts and
licences that exist that prevent us from sharing certain curricula?

"Warsaw, Illinois"
"Warsaw is a city in Hancock County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,793 at the 2000 census. People know the city for its historic downtown and the Warsaw Brewery."
History.
"The city of Warsaw began in 1814. Future president Zachary Taylor founded Fort Johnson on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River across from the mouth of the Des Moines River. Fort Johnson was occupied only for a few weeks before it was burned. In 1815 another military camp, Fort Edwards, was built nearby at a different location. Warsaw became an important fur trading post and one of the earliest European-American settlements in western Illinois."
"During the 1840s, Warsaw was one of the centers of opposition to the Mormons at Nauvoo. Thomas C. Sharp, who edited the ""Warsaw Signal"" at this time lead the anti-Mormons. The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a ""wolf hunt,"" people knew that the ""wolves"" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846."
"The city has a well-preserved downtown with a number of remaining historic businesses. Founded by German immigrants, the Warsaw Brewery opened in 1861 and operated for more than 100 years, ending production in 1971. The facility was renovated and reopened in 2006 as a bar and restaurant."
"The letters č, š, ž and dž are like the English sounds in ""ch""in, ""sh""in, vi""s""ion and ""j""uice."
"The letters ď, ľ, ň, and ť are called “soft consonants” and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth."
"The letters c, dz and j are also soft, like ""ts"" in ba""ts"", ""ds"" in ro""ds"", and ""y"" in ""y""es."
"Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: á, é, í, ó, ý ú. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel."
"The letter ô is like English ""wo""man, and ä is the same as the letter e."
"The letter ch is like ""ch"" in Scottish lo""ch"". V is more like English ""w""."
"The letters b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž are voiceless when they are at the end of a word (for example, 'd' will sound like 't')."
"The accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere."
"Like other Slavic languages, Slovak is difficult for English-speakers to pronounce., especially because several consonants often come together. In the sentence: “Strč prst skrz krk!” there is not one single vowel (it means: “Stick a finger through your neck!”)!"
Grammar.
"The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:"
"Unlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as “the” and “a”)."
"There are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German), but it changes the adjective's ending."
"Like many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers."
Sample words and phrases.
The numbers from 1 to 10 are .
"Use the familiar form when talking to a child, and the polite form when talking to an adult."

How Australia was settled.
"The main idea is the Out of Africa hypothesis: It says that humans developed on the African continent, and spread from there. Another important site is called Kow Swamp, in the northern part of Victoria. It consists of about twenty skeletons, which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. The morphology of Mungo Man is noticeably different from these skeletons. For this reason, some researchers have said that Australia was probably settled twice. The settlers were probably descendants of Homo erectus and came from the Asian mainland. This theory is based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA. If this is true, the two lines, that of Mungo Man and that of modern humans, separated a long time ago. This would also mean that Mitochondrial Eve of this line and that of modern humans would be older than mitochondrial Eve of all living humans."

During the day, they stay still, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their stomachs, and shut their red eyes. So they look almost completely green, and are well hidden amongst the leaves. The large red eyes are a defensive adaptation called deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed tree frog detects a predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee."
They are active at night. They like to eat small insects.
"During mating, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of eggs. The male puts out his sperm onto the eggs as they are released."
Tree frogs lay jelly-like eggs. The mothers will stay near them and help them fight any hungry animals that want to eat them. They become a tadpole in one or two weeks. They drop from the leaf and into the lake which is below the leaf.
"If predators are close enough to produce vibration, the embryos sense this. After a few seconds, they vigorously hatch out into tadpoles and spread out to escape."

Skin cancer
"Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too.

Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive."
"Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds."

"The Nashya Shaikh or Nashya Sekh(Bengali: নইস্য শেখ) is a Muslim community found in northern parts of the state of West Bengal in India. They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations."
Etymology.
"There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them ""nosto seikh"" meaning ""spoiled Shaikh"". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term ""nosto seikh"" slowly got islamicised into ""Nashya seikh""."
Origin.
"The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib."

Green bromeliad frog
"The green bromeliad frog, Jamaican green tree frog, or Wilder's tree frog (""Osteopilus wilderi"") is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen between 120 and 880 meters above sea level."
The adult male frog is 24.3 to 27.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 to 29.2 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and a little webbed skin on the back feet. This frog is usually yellow-green in color but it can be red-brown in color. The belly is lighter in color. Some frogs have spots on their sides.
"This frog lives in bromeliad plants. Bromeliads are plants that can live on the ground or high up on other plants. Rainwater collects in the leaves of the bromeliads. The frogs lay their eggs in this water. The first tadpoles to hatch eat the other eggs. Scientists think the tadpoles may also eat each other. ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles do eat green bromeliad frog tadpoles if they are in the same plant. But ""Osteopilus brunneus"" lays its eggs in larger bromeliad plants, and the green bromeliad frog lays its eggs in smaller ones. Scientists think green bromeliad frogs do this so that the ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles will not eat their young."
The green bromeliad frog lives in tropical forests and subtropical forests.
The adult frog eats insects. It eats leafhoppers.
This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live to build houses and to collect wood for building.

Thrace
"Thrace (: ""Thráke""; ; ""Trakiya"", ) is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe. It was bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey. The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people. They lived in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe."
Ancient history.
The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians. They were divided into many tribal groups. Thracian troops were known to be used in the Persian army. Many of them went with neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which is next to Thrace) during his invasion of the Persian Empire.
"The Thracians were divided into separate tribes. They did not form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition. The tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity."
"Thrace was conquered by Alexander. It later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 AD, in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of conflict and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence."
"The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and ""Thrace"" and ""Thracians"" are simply the names given them by the Greeks."

Fight against the chase of witches.
Praetorius fought against torture and against the hunting of witches. Some women were accused of being witches. People thought that witches can do harm to others. So these women were arrested and put in prison.
In 1597 Anton Praetorius protested against the torture of women accused of witchcraft.
Praetorius was so shocked about the torture of the accused woman that he demanded a stop. His protest was successful.

Theological argument against witchcraft.
"Praetorius was a Protestant minister. He believed that man can do either good or bad things. However, God chooses certain people to do certain things. Those things can be good or bad. According to Praetorius, witchcraft can only be a fall from the favour of God, and a pact with the devil. But, neither the devil nor sorcerers can do more than is in their nature (and predestination). God will punish those who are witches or sorcerers. This however, does not give human courts a right to put those to death, they believe are guilty of the crime of witchcraft. For Praetorius, witchcraft cannot exist, because it is beyond the faculties of either man or the devil. It is also against Nature."

Competition
"A competition or contest is an event where people get together to see who is the best at something. Someone who takes part in a competition (""enters for a competition"") is called a competitor. The competitors compete against one another. The person who wins may get a prize. The prize might be a trophy or money."
"Competitions can be for lots of different things, for example, sport, writing, music, dancing, science, or chess."
Some competitions need a referee. The referee will make sure that the game is played fairly and that the competitors obey the rules. In events like music competitions there will often be an adjudicator who will decide which person they think is the best.
Forms.
The adjective of 'competition' is competitive.

SimCity
SimCity is a computer game where the player has to build a city. They can do whatever they want to their city. It can be built from the ground up or it can be destroyed by a hurricane or a UFO.
History.
"""Sim City"" was made by game maker Will Wright and first released by the company Maxis. They are now owned by Electronic Arts. The game was first officially released in 1989."
It was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all simulation games.
Gameplay.
"At the start, the player has to build power plants. Power plants make power so the city can have electricity. By building power lines, power is connected to the different areas of the city. Water needs to be pumped in from a river using pipes to connect them to the city."
"Smaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, commercial, or industrial zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow."
"Roads, schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better. Parks and libraries make more people want to move to the city. Railways and highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods."
Sequels.
"After the first game, many more were created. These were made up of three games, with spin-offs and expansion packs. These were:"
Doorstop
A doorstop (or door stop or doorstopper) is a tool.
"There are two types. One holds a door open (or ""stops"" it from closing), and the other stops the door from hitting a wall."
"Doorstops that keep the door from hitting a wall can be put on the door, or on the wall, or on the floor in front of the wall."
Doorstops that are used to keep a door open come in two varieties:
Digital rights management
"Digital rights management (DRM) is a way to make it difficult to copy music, movies, and computer programs. It is used to make people follow copyright laws. It works by using computer technologies."
"Many companies use DRM to protect their properties from copyright infringement, such as Sony, Microsoft and the BBC. Other companies also use DRM."
Some people do not like digital rights management. They think that DRM makes copying harder than copyright laws allow. The Free Software Foundation suggested that 'digital restrictions management' is a better name.
Personal life.
"Married three times, his last wife was a former fan, who met him when she made a documentary about his life and career. One of his later supporters was radio talk show host Howard Stern. Tiny Tim died in 1996, after suffering a heart attack during a performance."
Kelvin
"The Kelvin scale (symbol: K) is the SI unit of temperature. It is named in honour of the physicist William Thomson, the first Lord Kelvin (1824–1907)."
0 degree Celsius = 273 kelvin
Definition.
"The Kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature. This says that ""the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin"". This means that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, and scientists use this scale more than any other."
"The kelvin is a base SI unit of measurement, since 2018 defined by setting the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant ""k"" to 1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1."
"The temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree Celsius above the freezing point, or 0.01 °C. The coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to -273.15 degrees Celsius, or zero kelvin (0 K). By writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers."
The absolute temperature scale was designed so that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change of 1 degree Celsius. This means that it is easy to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin.
"It is important to notice that the name of this unit is simply ""kelvin"" (with a lowercase initial), not ""degree Kelvin"". In English, it undergoes normal plural inflection as ""kelvins"". For example, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen is 77 kelvins."
"In everyday use, the kelvin is most commonly used to measure very low or very high temperatures, such as the temperature of liquid nitrogen or the temperature of a light bulb filament."
Tourism
"Tourism means people traveling for fun and adventure . It includes activities such as sightseeing and camping. People who travel for fun are called ""tourists"". Places where many tourists stay are sometimes called ""resorts"". Places that people go to for tourism are called tourist destinations."
There are many reasons why people travel for fun:
The tourism industry.
The tourism industry has different parts. Some of these are:
Package tour operators can offer all these services to a group who will go together. This can be cheaper than paying for them separately.
Damage tourism can bring.
"Tourism can bring damage to the local area, and/or the tourists. Litter, scuba-diving and deforestation are problems for popular places such as St. Lucia, Hawaii and others. Scuba-diving can damage coral reefs which are home to hundreds of species of sea animals. Tourism can change culture when people learn each other's ways, and certain local traditions are being put aside for tourists."

Caulfield is best known as the location of Caulfield Racecourse and the Caulfield campus of Monash University.
History.
"It is not known why the area was called Caulfield, but it is probably linked with Baron Caulfeild of Ireland. John Caulfield was an early settler in the colony of Victoria. The name Caulfield was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse."

Stratosphere
"The stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth. It extends from about 8 km above the poles (18 km above the equator) to about 50 km. In the stratosphere, the temperature rises with increasing height. This makes the stratosphere very stable. This temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some UV radiation from sunlight. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat."
"This differs from the lower layer, the troposphere, where temperature declines with higher altitude, and from the next higher layer, the mesosphere, where the temperature again declines."
"Airplanes that are going far usually fly in the lower stratosphere, because the engines are more efficient in cold air and drag is small in low air density air."

Kostandin Shpataraku
Kostandin Shpataraku (flourished 1736–67) was an Albanian painter of 18th century.
Early life.
"Kostandin Shpataraku was born in Valesh village in the Shpat region of Albania. The region is located in the southern highland of Elbasan, Albania, in today's Gjinar which was originally in the Ottoman Empire."
Work.
"Shpataraku was a painter in the Orthodox tradition of icons and Byzantine church frescoes, active between 1736 and 1767. His works combine Byzantine tradition and Italian Renaissance influences."
Death.
"Shpataraku was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan. His family took his body and buried him in his village with his head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built later to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals, on September 21."
Legacy.
"Many of his icons are in Ardenica Monastery, St. Jovan Vladimir's Church near Elbasan, Vithkuq, and in the ""Museum of Medieval Art"" in Korce. Many of his works belong to private collections."
Elastin
Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored.
"Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish."
"In humans, elastin is encoded by the ""ELN"" gene."
Icterid
"The Icteridae are a family of small to medium-sized New World songbirds. They are usually brightly colored. Most species have black as a main plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red. The family is extremely varied in size, shape, behavior and coloration."
"This group includes the New World blackbirds, New World orioles, the bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas and caciques. They are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird (which is a thrush) or the Old World orioles."
"Icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families."
"One unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively. This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food."

Père Goriot
"Le Père Goriot (, ""Old Goriot"" or ""Father Goriot"") is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850). It is in the ""Scènes de la vie privée"" section of his novel sequence ""La Comédie humaine"". It is set in Paris in 1819. It follows the lives of three characters: the elderly Goriot, a mysterious criminal named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac."
The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration. It brought major changes to French society. The struggle by individuals to reach a higher social status is a major theme in the book. Balzac analyzes through Goriot and others the nature of family and marriage that provides a pessimistic view of them.
Publication.
"In the first book edition, the novel had seven chapters:"
"The character Eugène de Rastignac had appeared as an old man in Balzac's earlier philosophical fantasy novel ""La Peau de chagrin"". While writing the first version of ""Le Père Goriot"", Balzac named the character ""Massiac"", but he decided to use the same character from ""La Peau de chagrin"". Other characters were changed in a similar way."
Legacy.
"""Le Père Goriot"" is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau's remark: ""We are all children of ""Le Père Goriot""."""
"In his book ""Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World"", Martin Kanes calls it ""the keystone of the ""Comédie humaine"". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's study ""Balzac's Recurring Characters"". Entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer."
"Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, ""Goriot"" is one of the novels of ""La Comédie humaine"" that can safely be read in English for what it is."""
"According to the editor of the Norton Critical Edition, Peter Brooks, the book is now seen as ""the most endurable and popular of Balzac's myriad works"" and a ""classic of the [18th]-century European novel""."
"A well-known line of this book by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, ""In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline."""
"This has been reworked by Mario Puzo in the novel ""The Godfather"" (1969) and its movie adaptation (1972) as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""."
It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.

Calendar date
"A Calendar date is a way to refer to a certain day in a calendar. With the calendar date and the calendar, the exact day can be identified. With a different calendar, the same calendar date may refer to a different day. This can be seen easiest when comparing the Julian calendar with the Gregorian calendar."
"Calendar dates are important to refer to events (most holidays are fixed with reference to a particular event or calendar date.) One example may be Easter. In the Middle Ages, it has been fixed that Easter is to be the first Sunday that is (on or after) the 14th day after the spring equinox."
"Most calendar systems have a date format that has three parts, the day of a certain month, the month and the year. Sometimes the week is added."
Persian calendar
"The Iranian calendar also known as Persian calendar or the Jalāli Calendar is a solar calendar. It is currently used in Iran and Afghanistan. It is observation-based, rather than rule-based. Each year starts on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran (or the 52.5°E meridian, which also defines IRST) and Kabul. This makes it more accurate than the Gregorian Calendar."
"The current Iranian Calendar year is 1401 AP"" (AP = Anno Persico/Anno Persarum = Persian year)""."
Hexagon
"A hexagon is a polygon with 6 sides and 6 corners (vertices). Like regular triangles and squares, hexagons fit together without gaps, which are known as tessellations.

Tendon
"A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. It is built to withstand tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another. Tendons and muscles work together, roughly as follows. When muscles contract, the tendon transmits the pull to the bone."
Anatomy.
"A tendon connects to a muscle at one end, and to bone at the other end. Each tendon has these two ""insertions""."
"Collagen fibres connect the muscle to the bones. A tendon inserts into bone at one end, and into the muscle at the other end."
"Tendons do not create any pulling force of their own. The tendons transfer the force of muscles pulling on the bone. Unlike elastin (another bodily tissue) tendons have very little ""give""."

All we know about its history is from Mina Napoi, who interviewed many people of the sami culture. Her findings are at the helsinki central library in finland which are currently being approved for digitalization as of February 2021. In her last two pages of her article titled, ""Saamen murre nimeltä hoseff"", she talks about how the language most likely formed as a dialect of sami in the late middle ages but then over time reformed due to the hoffish-sami group's migration. The hoffish-sami people she interviewed said that their ancestors moved a lot from northern finland to as far as southern norway while trading furs. She finally states because of this common migration that the people must of picked up a lot of new nordic words and grammer which in time turned the sami language into what the hoffish people speak today."

Other decisive factors were the lack of synchronicity between the flight progress tabs available to the controllers and the actual position of the aircraft on the airport runways and taxiways, which made the flight aircraft 5569 received incorrect instructions due to its controller's incorrect perception of its location. The poor night lighting of the runways and the glare problems that this lighting caused in the operators of the airport control tower, reducing their ability to see small aircraft during their maneuvers on the taxiways, was another of the determining factors of the Sinister."

"The chandelier, in a single numbered work of art, as a sculpture, was installed in 1956 in an apartment in Milan, following an art exhibition, with the prototype and the projects of the unique work. The work represents the birth of industrial design in the italian fifties. Its value today is priceless."
"The chandelier is characterized by a series of ceiling stars of particular significance, inspired by the world of planetariums, with the desire to piece together the stellar worlds. The starry skies were one of the typical representative works of Italian design of the 1950s, the most prestigious and interesting period of study in the history of Italian design."
"Galmanini's design work is a tribute to his friend and companion of innovative avant-garde architectural researches Piero Portaluppi with whom he frequently dissertated on astronomy, the universe and stars. Portaluppi collected astrolabes and sundials, often making inlays with stars, such as the famous window of Palazzo Necchi. Portaluppi was also the architect of the innovative Planetarium in Milan, with its starry sky."
"From the 1950s, also due to Galmanini's promotion in architectural circles, the roofs of starry skies became a symbol of architecture and innovative avant-garde."

"Oh, you know"
You know.
true.
That's true.
"The bad guys are, you know,"
"like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
"And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But the system doesn't allow for the corrections
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, that's interesting."
"I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there."
And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
Yes.
"And,"
And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.
Right.
She was in Cobb County.
Right.
"I'm,"
I can't really say much about the schools up here.
I really don't come from here
Uh-huh.
I'm only up here temporarily on an internship
"but  uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually."
Okay.
"And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad."
They're pretty good.
"Well, that's great."
"But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good."
Uh-huh.
"For example, I have a brother in North Carolina"
"and he says the schools there are, are incredibly bad. Uh, just terrible."
"Well, I feel that we're way behind."
Do you have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
"Yes, sir."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I love Mexican food myself."
"Oh, do you?"
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
"Oh, we, we do too."
"We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food."
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
"It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point."
"But the kids,  seem to enjoy it."
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, let's see."
"We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here"
"but it's, uh, not part of a chain"
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
"But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had"
"that was, uh, not just really super."
It's nice to find a place like that.
"Oh, boy that is wonderful."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I agree with you on that."
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
"I, I love crab meat in particular."
Um.
"I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to."
"Oh, boy."
"Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I know exactly what you mean."
"We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us."
Uh-huh.
"But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that."
"Oh, well, that is fortunate."
Yeah.
It is an old farm house
"and, uh, we really like it here."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, I like it, I like it here."
"Uh, I, I grew up here."
I have lived other places
"and, and, but I, I did grow up here"
Uh-huh.
and this is very much home for me.
Uh-huh.
"And,"
It is nice down there.
"I, I, I liked it when we visited there."
I hope you visited during the winter.
Uh-huh.
"One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter"
"and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway."
Right.
Right.
That is the best time to go.
Yeah.
"and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice."
"It has been hot,"
"but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there."
"Oh, sure."
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I don't, I don't think that,"
"well, when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then all of a sudden you look at the bill
"and you go, Oh my gosh,"
I spent this much.
"But now, the fact that you still have two cards,"
"are you, do you use them, more judiciously?"
"Yeah,"
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car
Yeah.
and that paid for a new transmission
Uh-huh.
"um, and, and things like that."
"Um, and we try not to use them for incidental type things, like, you know, gas and stuff like that."
Purchases.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh
"Clothing, sales."
Yeah.
Sales I find are a pain.
Yeah.
"I've, I've gotten, I've gotten a lot more away from, from credit cards,"
and I pay by check a lot more now.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it sounds good, you know."
"Like I said, it sounds like you're, you've really got it under control."
"I, I admire you for having, having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,"
Yeah.
All right.
Happy home repairing.
Okay.
You too
Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye.
"Hi,"
what do you do with your credit cards?
Oh
"Well, my husband and I have gotten into some, some problems with credit cards."
We don't handle them very well
"We, we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more."
"Oh, jeez."
"They, they're, they're really bad for us."
"Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,"
and we pretty much keep those maxed out.
"Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many."
"But I see what you meant,"
you had them for each of the individual stores.
"Yeah,"
"we had I had probably twenty credit cards for,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, um, two Visas, two MasterCards"
"Oh, gee."
"I mean, I had,"
"any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it,"
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.
"Oh, sure."
"Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you."
"Uh-huh,"
so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again.
"<Laughter> That's neat,"
that's neat
"And, uh, I, I don't know,"
"now I, I know eastern,"
"now the other thing we do here, of course, is a single, not quite a single climate."
"We have, uh, we do have some snow in the wintertime"
and it can be quite warm in the summertime.
Uh-huh.
"Not hot like, uh,"
I lived in the midwest for a while.
Oh.
"And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
We don't have that much.
"It's, uh, it's a very mild climate."
"Oh, well that's nice."
"That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine."
"Yes,"
it is.
"Because here, gosh, we had, uh,"
the winter hasn't been bad this winter.
"It's, it it's only snowed maybe once or twice"
but it's been cold.
"Low twenties, let's say,"
"and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties"
"so,"
You interested in woodworking?
Yeah.
"Actually, I, uh, I guess I am"
"Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion."
"Uh, I do, uh, some, uh, woodworking myself"
"But, you also manage to make them."
"uh, actually, we, we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago. One of the family reunions."
Yeah.
But we are both in school
so that makes it kind of tough.
Yeah.
"They usually, uh, they have been happening, uh, just after the summer semester starts."
You can't really get away.
Usually not.
We managed to get to one.
That was before I started school
and she took that summer off.
"But, uh,"
"Well, now that we have been talking about it, I, uh, I am kind of getting home sick now."
Because it has been over three years since I have been home  to see my grandparents.
Oh goodness.
"Well, my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around."
Yeah.
"And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically."
Yeah.
"So, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like."
"She was like the glue,"
so.
"Yeah,"
I understand.
Where is home for you?
"Originally, uh, I, uh, was born in Missouri."
Yeah.
"But, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, uh, here in Texas"
Yeah.
"but it is harder for everyone to get in, get home."
Yeah.
"Oh, I think, I don't think so."
"I, I think that, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it,"
"because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know."
It's a hundred meter.
"Oh, absolutely."
"And, uh, uh, but automobile races"
"if it,"
"I don't think they'd ever,"
it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.
They're not going to ...
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
They're not going to change that to meters.
It will always be.
Yeah.
"And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh,"
"you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold."
"How many ounces of gold, you know."
Twelve.
"I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something."
"It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header."
"And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce."
Yeah.
There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.
Yeah.
"Now that makes, you know."
Yeah.
"And, and is that going to change too?"
"Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton"
and then there's a ton.
But what's a metric ton?
"Uh,"
Right.
"And I would much rather own my own home than, than be renting it like we're doing."
"I mean, we're basically, you know, kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
We're renting a house.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, right now with the way our credit card situation is, there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house."
"Right,"
right.
"But, but, once I suppose you, you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's, it's going to, it's going to take quite a while."
Uh-huh.
Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home.
Uh-huh.
"But, um, I'm not really counting on it real soon."
Okay
You want to get a start?
Certainly.
"Uh, the weather here is warm."
Uh-huh.
And it has been sort of raining on and off.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I am an avid gardener"
"so I measure the rain in our rain gauge on a, on a regular basis."
"So I can, can avoid wasting money on watering."
"Oh, great,"
great.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days,"
"Now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land."
"And, of course, it's pretty static right now"
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
How about you?
"Well, I am, uh, I'm, gosh, I'm barely in Dallas."
I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway.
Okay.
Okay.
"And, I guess we have a similar situation."
"I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand"
Uh-huh.
and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street
"so I don't I don't even know how high those go,"
Okay.
but some of those are pretty big.
"Yes,"
those are over a million.
Yeah
"So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas because back where I'm from, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all."
"They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles."
"So,"
"Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas."
Yeah.
"Not as bad as Houston,"
"but, exactly what you're describing is what happens all over."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
I've noticed that.
"Well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,"
Uh-huh.
Yes.
it is a mental thing.
It is a conversion thing.
"It's like a mill, you know."
"We, we do, uh, um, well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on on semiconductor devices."
Right.
"And well, what's a mill"
and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric."
We have a eighty-nine Chevy Blazer.
"And before that we had a Horizon. Uh, you know, Plymouth Horizon?"
Yeah.
And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.
"Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field,"
"for why, why, why pieces,"
"could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't."
"Uh, okay."
The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.
"Oh, okay."
"And the starter was Bosch American,"
so.
"The bolts were, were were, were English then."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"It was, it was annoying."
"One, one half of the starter you know, three bolts on the starter"
and two of them were American
and one of them was metric.
Now that's strange.
"And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator"
"Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream."
That's pretty tough
What area do you live in?
I live in Houston.
"Oh, okay."
I see.
Is that pretty typical for your area?
"Well, for the neighborhood I'm in,"
"yeah,"
Yeah.
"This is one of the more established neighborhoods,"
Huh-uh.
That sounds real interesting.
I live in a suburb of Dallas
"and, uh, I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home."
"So, at least, I have two bathrooms."
"That's not so bad,"
"but, uh, it's pretty typical for the area, as well."
"Uh, I've always been interested in older homes, personally."
"So, I think you can end up doing more with them, it seems like."
What about yard space?
"Do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that?"
The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.
"Oh, I see."
"About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden."
Huh-uh.
"Oh, that's nice."
"Because I have just like a very small, you know, those basic tract houses, like that."
We have a very small yard
"and, um, I do have garden,"
"but it's extremely small,"
"but, uh, it seems like, though, for your area that, that is sort of different."
"and if, they should pay for it with their life."
Right.
"When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned."
Yeah.
"We just have the case,"
"I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up"
"Oh, really."
"So, I mean, his appeal was denied"
and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
"It, uh,"
Yeah.
"But, uh, that was absurd"
"There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence."
"I know that, that"
Uh-huh.
"And, I don't know."
"Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?"
"Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,"
"the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of."
"Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd."
There's no way that could work.
"Oh, yeah."
"I, I, I don't agree with that at all."
"Uh, but,"
Imagine the guilt that person would have.
I mean  burned out.
"Oh, exactly."
"There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself."
Exactly.
Right.
"Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do."
"Like the guy in California got you know, twice before he went to the gas chamber"
"and then they said okay, no,"
you don't have to go.
And then they took him back.
"I mean, it just seems,  Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent."
"Jeez,"
that's a lot of repeals.
"And then you have like two,"
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it."
"Uh, I guess,"
"what is it, what's the policy now with treason?"
"Do they, uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence?"
"No,"
"I don't, I don't think, uh, the military doesn't execute anymore"
so.
Yeah.
Or death before the firing squad or whatever.
Yeah.
"So, I think about the only one is, uh, rape,"
"Okay,"
I'm here.
How do you feel about public schools?
"Well, our public schools are, are really poor, I feel."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation"
"but, uh, we're toward the bottom."

"Yeah,"
"I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle,"
I used to sail about every day.
"I'd work, go to work,"
I'd like to do some sailing.
"Yeah,"
it's a lot of fun.
"It's, uh,"
"especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat"
like those catamarans are pretty fast.
"Yeah,"
"what,"
"You can actually,"
"Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that"
"or they just,"
"Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life."
"Uh, my family's pretty into it"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six"
"and then, uh"
Is it pretty easy?
"Yeah,"
"it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it."
Yeah.
"So it's, it's not too bad,"
"it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think"
"and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,"
"but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine."
Yeah.
"Well, that's about all we have"
"Yeah,"
Uh-huh.
"He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books"
and then he just started doing it.
I don't know.
"He, well he did all the flooring himself."
"He put the whole, the whole floor in"
and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there.
"And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that"
"after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less."
"It's not, you know, it's not enclosed."
"It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park"
"and it's,"
"Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?"
"Uh, it's off the ground."
On the piers?
Uh-huh.
"It's on about uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that."
"Did,"
You had those poured
So.
or you did them yourself?
"Uh, no,"
"those, those are,"
we did those ourselves
so.
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
Yeah.
Huh.
"Exactly,"
"so. It's,"
"Well, the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of"
"Yeah,"
I mean they were so rude about it.
Right.
And so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said well it's not guaranteed.
"And I said, well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed"
so do it anyway.
Uh-huh.
So we got the kind we wanted
and I was really disappointed with that.
I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
Uh-huh.
and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
and I called there to see if they had it
and the lady was very nice.
"And I said my goodness,"
"I said you've been very nice, what's your name."
And she told me
and I said well I really appreciate it.
"I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that, store"
and it turned out she was the assistant manager
"so,"
Right.
"So I felt kind of good about that, you know."
I didn't  even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
Uh-huh.
Right.
"but I just felt like, well at least I did something."
Maybe they'll fix it.
"They might work on that, you know."
"Right,"
right.
But I find attitudes are more of a problem.
"and so my transportation costs have gone up by, uh, five times"
"Yeah,"
I understand that.
"We, we have a real similar situation."
"Ours, uh, have quintupled, at least."
So there is a real family budget.
"Yeah,"
"pretty much, um."
The problem is there never seems to be enough money.
"I have three children,"
"and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need,"
"and, uh, of course, nothing ever goes down,"
"I mean, uh, I remember,"
I have five children total.
I have three left in the house.
Yeah.
"And I can remember years ago, when school would start,"
"and I'd go buy all five kids, you know, shoes,"
"and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store without spending more than thirty-five dollars."
"Nowadays, thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes"
If you're lucky.
"yeah,"
"so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last, uh, I guess about the last ten years."
Exempt or nonexempt.
I'm exempt.
"Wow,"
must be nice.
"Part of the high price spread. Uh,"
"no,"
"well, we don't, we do,"
but we don't have a family budget.
We have the fixed things we have to pay.
I'm jealous.
"and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible,"
"it's a three eighty-six,"
"I guess it's twenty-five,"
"yeah,"
three eight six twenty-five C maybe
"I don't know,"
no we don't have the
we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing
"and,"
What kind of consulting do you do?
"Um, well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,"
Uh-huh.
and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
"Um, well, it depends,"
"it's very different in the different places,"
"but,"
Is it programming related?
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Program related, research related,"
"and I work in the speech field,"
"and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,"
Uh-huh.
"and I do that type of stuff typically for other people,"
"and we, like here we use the P C to do that."
Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
Word processing.
"Well, more, uh,"
"do you know Latek? Word text processing,"
No I'm not familiar with that.
"the monotonous the monotonous,"
yeah.
no
"that's not,"
"I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah."
Uh-huh.
I don't like that.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I like the funny, satire,"
"and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society."
Yeah.
It really does.
"It talks about, um, race relations and police relations"
"and, um, that, that"
I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I'm, with you though,"
I like classical
Uh-huh.
"um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway."
"I like easy listening, just kind of, you know,"
I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more.
"I used to like it all right,"
but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason.
"Um, let's see."
"Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that."
"Some of it's okay, uh"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's about my opinion of that"
yeah
"It's, it's okay, um,"
"and we have a lot of, uh,"
"the county I am, I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic."
Yeah.
Probably quite a few black people up there
"and and,"
No
"We're from a county, we're from the county they marched in."
We're in Forsyth county
"Oh, is that right?"
"yes,"
"and we,"
"and there's very, very few blacks."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, so, so that's, uh,"
"I, I hate to say, uh,"
"it's not a problem, uh, because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although they are."
Yeah
"but, you know, it, it's,"
"you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,"
but then again.
"But it is a problem  Uh, especially in the inner schools, inner city."
"Yeah,"
"there is no denying that, that,"
"Sure, you know."
"Teachers, you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school."
"Well,"
and you can't put all the children in special education.
"That's right,"
you can't do that.
"Uh, and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know."
Right.
"See, I grew up in Nebraska"
Yeah.
"So, I really, I really like that,"
"but, people are really concerned,"
"it's just that sometimes it's not the right people, which is really, really sad because, I wish we would do more"
Yeah.
"At work we started, uh, all the recycling stuff."
"They're really trying,"
I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year.
Yes.
"And, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off,"
"but, you know sometimes it dwindles down."
"Yeah,"
where I work now we recycle all the computer paper.
That's good.
But that's about the extent of it.
"Well that's, uh,"
at least your trying something.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"It's just yeah,"
it would be nice if it could be more.
"And I'm sure that the, uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so."
Oh do you really.
"We sell the paper back to the, uh, to a paper manufacturing company."
Well that's a neat idea.
"Well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think."
"I,"
"not by much, but it does defray it some."
Right.
Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building.
"Well that's, that's really good,"
I mean at least they're trying.
"this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,"
Yeah.
"it's just, it's just ridiculous."
"Yeah,"
"I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair."
"Uh-huh,"
"it really could,"
"and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead,"
"and they keep dragging it on,"
and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"so, uh,"
"Yeah,"
the press has a lot of power.
They really do.
"I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more."
"Yeah,"
"oh, but, boy you try get into that,"
you'd really open a can of worms.
"Oh, yes,"
"or they, I agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments,"
but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
"Yeah,"
"seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit,"
and I don't think they ever care to.
"No,"
they don't.
"Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about."
"Well, I enjoyed talking to you."
"Well, it was good talking to you."
All right.

Known throughout his playing career as Miran Bux, he was aged 47 years, 284 days when he played his first Test (against India at Lahore), making him the second oldest Test debutant, behind James Southerton. Unusually, this was only his second first-class match (having failed to capture a wicket on debut almost five years previously)."
"A tall off-spinner, he had taken five wickets in a two-day match against the touring West Indians in 1948-49, and 10 in another two-day match against the Commonwealth XI in 1949-50. After his brief Test career ended, he continued playing first-class cricket in Pakistan until 1958-59, when at the age of 51, he took four wickets in his last match, playing for Rawalpindi against Peshawar. His best bowling figures came in a match for Combined Services at Dacca in 1956-57, when he took 6 for 15 to dismiss East Pakistan Whites for 33."

= = = Anne of Foix-Candale = = =
Anna of Foix-Candale (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of King Vladislaus II.
"Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics."
"The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day."
"Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery. She was 22."
"Although Anna was Vladislaus II's third wife, she gave birth to his only surviving legitimate children, both of whom were born in Buda:"

She was reassigned to Sheerness in January 1900 for instructional purposes at the Sheerness school of gunnery, including as tender to HMS ""Wildfire"". Two months later, she was transferred to Chatham to relieve the destroyer in the Medway Fleet Reserve."
"She was involved in an accident at West Pier, Brighton in April 1900. The ship's boat carrying twelve seaman was swamped resulting in seven sailors drowning. Late in 1900 she was deployed to the British Mediterranean Fleet based at Malta. Lieutenant Edward Oliver Gladstone was appointed in command in September 1901. In September 1902 she visited the Aegean Sea with other ships of the station for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia."
"She remained in the Mediterranean until November 1913, when she was ordered to return to home waters. On her return to home waters she was assigned to the Portsmouth Local Defence Flotilla."
"On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed that all destroyer classes were to be designated by letters. She was assigned to the D class along with other destroyers built to the same overall specification. After 30 September 1913, she was known as a D-class destroyer and had the letter ‘D’ painted on the hull below the bridge area and on either the fore or aft funnel."
For the test mobilization in July 1914 she was assigned to the Portsmouth Local Flotilla.
"In August 1914 she was in active commission tendered to HMS ""Excellent"", the Portsmouth gunnery school. She remained there for the duration of the First World War."

"Dave Smith Motors is a car dealership in Kellogg, Idaho, that attracts customers from all over the country. The dealership has a reputation for being the ""World’s Largest Ram Dealer""."
"Dave Smith Motors started in October 1965 in Wallace, Idaho. He purchased the small Chevrolet dealership from Mort Keane. At that time, the Chevrolets were sold mainly to miners, loggers, smelter workers and local businessmen in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley. Five years later, he moved the dealership to Kellogg, Idaho. Today Dave Smith Motors carries Chrysler, General Motors, and Nissan products, according to the Dave Smith website,(Dave Smith.com)."
"Idaho’s Silver Valley was founded in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest silver mining regions in the world. The community is located along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho’s Shoshone County. The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then, in 1981, the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed. Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn. The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry. The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership."
As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof. He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the Internet.
"In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat, Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list. Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in Kellogg, Idaho."
"The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because Chrysler Corporation (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales. Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals. The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to boycott Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors. The Federal Trade Commission considered their boycott illegal and the group settled the charges before the boycott began."
"Dave Smith Motors is one of the largest employers in Shoshone County, and the largest private company in Kellogg."

"On 6 October 2008 President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari, patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) appointed Butt as chairman of the PCB. He has been involved in several controversies during his career, presiding over Pakistan during a time when security concerns—including a shooting incident involving the Sri Lankan tour bus—stripped the country of several international fixtures. He has made several attacks on current and former PCB officials and the Senate of Pakistan."
"Butt was born in Sialkot, Punjab in 1938. He began his first-class career against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club squad on 16 January 1956 while playing for Pakistan Universities. Batting at number three, he scored 35 and 97, falling three short of a debut century thanks to the bowling of Billy Sutcliffe and the catching hands of Ken Barrington. The match ended in a draw. A month later he faced the MCC once more, this time for Punjab: he scored 43 and 18 as the MCC triumphed by an innings and 29 runs. Butt went on to make several successful appearances in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy over the winter of 1956/57, scoring 225 runs at 56.25 including a maiden century of 147 runs. He promptly toured the West Indies but only featured in one first-class match before returning to the 1958/59 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy where he had a less successful second season: 73 runs from three matches at 24.33, failing to pass 50.

"João Oliveira dos Santos (born 15 January 1933) better known as Mestre João Grande, is a Grão-Mestre (Grand Master) of the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira angola who has contributed to the spread of this art throughout the world. He was a student of the ""father of Angola"", Mestre Pastinha, and has an academy in New York City."
"Mestre João Grande was born in the village of Itagi in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. As a child he worked alongside his family in the fields. At the age of 10 he saw ""corta capim"" for the first time. This is a movement performed by crouching down, extending one leg in front and swinging it around in a circle, hopping over it with the other leg. Fascinated, he asked what it was called and was told that it was ""the Dance of the Nagos"" — a dance of the African descendants in the city of Salvador. The Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria had a major cultural influence in Salvador, which was considered the Black Rome of Brazil. But the dance was actually of Central African origin— it was Capoeira. João didn't learn the correct name of the movement until many years later, but it changed his life forever. At the age of ten he left home in search of ""the Dance of the Nagos""."
"Ten years later, he ended up in Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira as we know it, where he saw a proper capoeira roda for the first time. Present were mestres Menino Gordo, João Pequeno, who was there with his first teacher, Mestre Barbosa, and Cobrinha Verde, one of the most skillful players of that era."
"João Grande asked Mestre Barbosa if he could study and Mestre Barbosa sent him to João Pequeno, who later became his closest associate in capoeira. João Pequeno sent him to Mestre Pastinha who had a famous academy in the Cardeal Pequeno neighborhood of Brotas. João Grande requested permission to join his academy, and Pastinha accepted João as a student at the age of twenty, relatively late in capoeira life. While studying, João Grande worked as a longshoreman, playing after work or on his few days off."
"Mestre João Grande eventually became such an acclaimed capoeirista that when Carybé, a painter famous for his documentation of African Culture in Bahia, chose to do studies of capoeira he chose João Grande as a model."
"João Grande and João Pequeno are featured in numerous films of capoeira including one in which they demonstrate the knife techniques of the art. In 1966 João Grande travelled to Senegal with Mestre Pastinha to demonstrate capoeira at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. He was awarded his Diploma of capoeira from Pastinha in 1968 making him a full-fledged master of capoeira Angola. He subsequently toured Europe and the Middle East with Viva Bahia, a pioneering group that performed Afro-Brazilian folk arts such as capoeira, samba, maculelê, candomblé and puxada da rede."
"Eventually Pastinha's academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, was asked by the government to vacate his building for renovations, but the space was never returned to him. Instead it became a restaurant with entertainment, now called SENAC. Pastinha died broke and bitter about his treatment, but never regretted living the life of a capoeirista."
"João Grande returned when Mestre Moraes and Mestre Cobra Mansa persuaded him to come out of retirement in the mid-1980s. He began to teach with their organization Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho. In 1989 he was invited by Jelon Vieira to tour the United States. The tour was a tremendous success. In 1990 he returned to present capoeira at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Schomberg Center for Research for Black Culture in New York City. João Grande decided he liked the US and has been teaching in New York City ever since."
"In 1995 he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Upsala College, East Orange, New Jersey. In 2001 he was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA, which is one of the most prestigious awards given to practitioners of traditional arts in the US. He has also recorded an audio CD and several DVDs featuring himself and his students, as well as other illustrious figures of capoeira Angola."

"Patrick Perkins was born in a humble cottage on a small farm in the village of Clonoulty near Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the second son of Thomas Perkins, a farmer, and his wife Ellen (""née"" Gooley). He attended the local National School."
"Thomas and Ellen Perkins and their eight children (including Patrick) immigrated on the ""Persian"", departing Southampton and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 9 April 1854."
"In 1861, he married Mary Ellen Hickey in Victoria. They had four children born in Victoria:Thomas Hector (born 1864); Mary Eveleen, (1867-1942) m. Charles Seymour-Allan; Edgar Colin Francis (born 1868) and Lilly Eleanor Perkins (born 1875) m. Randall Macdonnell, m. George Wilkie Gray. They had two children born in Queensland: Patrick Harold (born 1878) and Helene Cicilia (born 1880, Toowoomba d 1965 Adelaide), Sr Margaret Mary of the Dominican priory, Adelaide."
"Patrick Perkins was a miner and storekeeper on the diggings in Victoria in districts including Ballarat, Bendigo, Woods Point and Jamieson."
"With his brother Thomas, he started breweries in Victoria and Queensland. In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872."
"In 1876, Patrick Perkins moved to Queensland in order to manage the Brisbane and Toowoomba breweries."
"Perkins also had interests in property and mining, including the Mount Morgan Mine and coal mining in the West Moreton area."
He was considered a shrewd and successful business man.
"On 9 April 1877, Edward Wilmot Pechey, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Aubigny, resigned. On 1 May 1877, in a by-election, Perkins was elected in Aubigny, defeating Angus Mackay (the then editor of ""The Queenslander"") by a large majority. He was elected again in Aubigny in the 1878 election and was appointed as Minister of Lands in the First McIlwraith Ministry from 21 January 1879 to 13 November 1883."
"Perkins was elected again in Aubigny in the 1883 election, However, allegations about electoral fraud (including intimidation, bribery, and ballot stuffing) in the Aubigny election started to surface, resulting in a petition to the Governor of Queensland detailing numerous kind of electoral fraud and asking to declare that the Aubigny election was void and that Patrick Perkins was guilty of bribery and corruption. On 21 February 1884, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications ruled the Aubigny election was null and void and called for a by-election. Perkins had denied any involvement in the alleged electoral fraud and the Committee of Elections and Qualifications did not disqualify him from re-contesting the seat, which provoked outrage in some quarters. However, Patrick Perkins announced he would not re-contest the seat as he would be taking a trip to England."
James Campbell was elected unopposed at the resulting by-election on 4 March 1884.
"At the 1888 election, Perkins was elected in the seat of Cambooya on 10 May 1888, which he held until 6 May 1893."
"On 23 May 1893, Perkins was appointed to Queensland Legislative Council from 23 May 1893. Being a lifetime appointment, he served until his death on 17 May 1901."
"In 1883 used his wealth to buy a palatial home at 273 North Quay, Brisbane, which he called ""Aubigny"" after the electorate that first sent him to parliament. The house was originally built in 1870 by Samuel Davis, a Jewish businessman, and included a separate building used as Brisbane's first synagogue. Patrick Perkins used the former synagogue as a billiards room. In 1899, the Perkins family rented the property to the Criminal Investigation Department which used the house as offices and the synagogue as a photography room. In 1906, the house was sold to the Rev. Mother Patrick of the Sisters of Mercy to create the 20-bed Mater Misericordiae Hospital (now a tertiary hospital located at South Brisbane); the former synagogue being the hospital chapel.

Charles Raymond Davys Tuckey (15 June 1910 – 15 October 2005) was an English tennis player.
"Raymond Tuckey and Pat Hughes won the doubles in Wimbledon in 1936, defeating Charles Hare and Frank Wilde in five sets. In 1937 he again reached the men's doubles finals at Wimbledon but this time lost with Pat Hughes against American team of Don Budge and Gene Mako in four sets. He was part of the winning British Davis Cup team in 1935 (against the US) and 1936 (against Australia) and of the 1937 team that lost the final to the US."
"His mother, Agnes Tuckey, was, with Hope Crisp, the first winner of the Wimbledon mixed doubles in 1913. Agnes, when in her fifties, partnered Raymond in the mixed doubles in 1931 and 1932, the only instance of a parent and child teaming up at the championships. His sister, Kay Tuckey, was also a tennis player."

"The Pymmes Brook Trail is located in the London Boroughs of Barnet, Enfield and Haringey and is just under long. The brook is named after William Pymme, a local landowner."
"The trail goes from Hadley Green to Tottenham Hale, where the trail connects with the Lea Valley Walk. Most of the first half of the trail, as far as Arnos Park, runs beside Pymmes Brook, but after that the brook is only encountered intermittently as much of the brook passes through private land which is not open to the public. In its lower reaches sections of the brook have been culverted to alleviate the risk of flooding."
"The trail starts on Hadley Green, where the headwaters of Pymmes Brook rise, with a link from High Barnet tube station. Together with the London Loop, it then drops through Monken Hadley Common to Jack's Lake, to meet another link from Cockfosters tube station. Pymmes Brook proper starts here as it flows out from Jack's Lake. The trail detours through Victoria Recreation Ground, where Pymmes Brook is joined with Shirebourne brook, then follows a short street section to rejoin the brook at East Barnet Village. It then runs beside the brook through Oak Hill Park and Brunswick Park to the halfway point in Arnos Park, with a link to Arnos Grove tube station. It is also where Pymmes Brook is joined by Bounds Green Brook. The trail then leaves the brook to pass through Broomfield Park and Palmers Green. It crosses over the New River at Oakthorpe Road, then the North Circular Road, to divert through two new public open spaces - Bowes Meadow and Tile Kiln Lane Open Space - where Pymmes Brook can be followed again. The trail recrosses the North Circular Road onto Silver Street, Edmonton, where the path enters the gardens of Millfield House. From here the trail leads to Pymmes Park and another brookside section, then to Fore Street, where the brook flows underground to merge with Salmons Brook to the south of Angel Road. As of 2018, the trail must temporarily follow public throughfares for a short distance, but will eventually take a new route when access to the brook is opened up in the Meridian Water development. Finally, the trail passes through Tottenham Marshes, beside Pymmes Brook and past Stonebridge Lock on the Lee Navigation, to reach the point where the brook joins the River Lea. The trail connects with the Lea Valley Walk at Tottenham Lock, with a link to Tottenham Hale station."

"Robert Aldworth (died 1634) was a Bristol-born English merchant and philanthropist. Much of his wealth, although used often for generous purposes, was acquired through the trade and exploitation of slaves. He became Mayor of Bristol in 1609."
"In 1612, Aldworth set up the first sugar processing business in Bristol, England, where sugar was processed in 'sugar houses'. Aldworth’s sugar house refined sugar produced by slaves from Spanish and Portuguese plantations in Madeira, Brazil and the Azores."
"Aldworth and his relative Thomas Aldworth, were members of the Society of Merchant Venturers, a group dating back to the 16th century to promote and protect Bristol merchants and trade. This included involvement in the transatlantic slave trade."

Whizziwig is a science fiction children's programme broadcast on CITV between 1998 and 2000 based on the books by award winning children's author Malorie Blackman.
"Whizziwig centres on the adventures of a boy called Ben and his best friend Steve who befriends a small pink alien approximately the size of a rugby ball. Whizziwig has the ability to grant wishes to anyone who uttered the words ""I wish.."", however wishes had to be made for someone else and would last a maximum of 24 hours. A recurring theme is Ben and Steve trying to deceive their friend into granting their intentional wishes only for the alien to become wise to the scheme."
"Ben would keep Whizziwig hidden, often smuggling her into school in his school bag. Many hilarious escapades ensued as the wishes made by unaware students in Whizziwigs earshot would be granted."
"Despite never achieving commercial success many critics hailed the show as groundbreaking in the manner in which it dealt with adult themes such as morality, death, and mereological nihilism, whilst still being accessible to its young audience."

Train rides during the one-day event, held on the first Saturday of October, run from the town of Hurlock's historic train station (built in 1867) to Federalsburg, along the MDDE's Seaford Line. The town of Hurlock owns the train station and two passenger cars."
"In 1892 Hurlock became the intersection of the ""Delaware Railroad"" and the ""Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway"", which are no longer operating. The MDDE's Seaford Line is the only rail line now serving the town. Except for the Hurlock Fall Festival, MDDE does not provide passenger service."

"Priory Meadow Shopping Centre is a shopping centre in Hastings, East Sussex, England. The centre was opened in 1997 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The local radio station Arrow FM, which was founded in 1998, broadcasts from the centre."
"The building was built on the site of the Central Recreation Ground, which had originally opened in 1864 and had since remained the main cricket venue in the town. This history is reflected by the statue in Queens Square of a batsman holding a pose having played a shot (""The Spirit of Cricket"" by Allan Sly). The observant shopper will be able to spot the ball that this batsman has hit (it can be seen in the wall above F. Hinds jewellers)."
"The land on which the shopping centre now stands had been underwater before the 13th century, and was the original harbour for Hastings. A series of severe storms, silting and sea erosion forced the town to move to where the current old town is. The Priory Valley eventually silted up completely and the area became known as Priory Meadow and turned into farmland in 1536."
"In 1864 the Priory Marshes were levelled and drained and opened as a Cricket Ground, by 1932 one corner of the ground was leased by the Maidstone and District bus company to use as a coach station, then in 1958 a row of shops was built on one side of the ground with seating above."
"In 1982 Hastings Council voted for a shopping centre to be built on the cricket ground and to move cricket to Summerfields, now Horntye Park. In 1987, planning permission for 420,000sq.ft of space for shops was granted. Due to the onset of recession, developer Speyhawk pulled out. By May 1993, a new developer, Boots had been found and developed the existing shopping centre which was then sold to a private Irish investor and is managed by BTWShiells. A scheme of approx. 264,000sq ft now exists. In 1989 the ground hosted its last Sussex county game, when they beat Kent in front of a crowd of 1000 people."
= = = Grahame Park = = =
"Grahame Park, located on the site of the old Hendon Aerodrome in North West London, is a north London housing estate in the London Borough of Barnet, including 1,777 council homes built in the 1970s."
"The estate is named in honour of Claude Grahame-White, the pioneer of aviation who established the original aerodrome and aviation school on the site."
"The building of the estate was a joint project between the Greater London Council and Barnet Council. The plan was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1964, and the first family moved in on 23 October 1971. Sir Roger Walters was the Chief Architect and Gordon Wigglesworth was the Housing Architect."
"A typical characteristic of the estate was the plain, square, brick terraced houses and long winding low-rise flats, with flat roofs, also known as ""Brick Brutalist"" style. Most building names, walkways and roads on the estate have names linked to the aviation history of the site."
Not all of the old aerodrome was sold off for development; the Royal Air Force Museum is situated immediately to the south-east of the estate (with free entrance).
"A secondary road called Grahame Park Way, a typical 1970s-style collector road, runs along the eastern margin of the estate, parallelling the Midland Main Line (Thameslink) railway, and beyond that, the M1 Motorway."
The estate became the sole site of St. James Catholic High School in 1996.
"London Underground Colindale station, on the Northern line Edgware branch, is within comfortable walking distance of at least the south-east corner of the estate. The next tube station north, Burnt Oak is also accessible. Mill Hill Broadway Thameslink station lies to the north, a bus ride away. Several bus routes run into or near the estate."
"In the late 1980s, the estate went through its first regeneration process, which split the blocks of flats into smaller blocks, by removing connecting walkways, and added pitched roofs to many of the buildings."
"In 2003, residents voted in favour of a full regeneration of the estate. The Housing Corporation earmarked £15 million for the redevelopment."
"The redevelopment is managed by Choices For Grahame Park, a subsidiary of Genesis Housing Association, with new houses being built by Countryside Properties."
"In 2007 a web-site was launched by Countryside Properties, renaming part of the redevelopment as ""New Hendon Village""."

Imiglucerase is a medication used in the treatment of Gaucher's disease.
It is a recombinant DNA-produced analogue of the human enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase.
"Cerezyme is a freeze-dried medicine containing imiglucerase, manufactured by Genzyme Corporation. It is given intravenously after reconstitution as a treatment for Type 1 and Type 3 Gaucher's disease. It is available in formulations containing 200 or 400 units per vial. The specific activity of highly purified human enzyme is 890,000 units/mg. A typical dose is 2.5U/kg every two weeks, up to a maximum of 60 U/kg once every two weeks, and safety has been established from ages 2 and up. It is one of more expensive medications, with an annual cost of $200,000 per person in the United States. Imiglucerase has been granted orphan drug status in the United States, Australia, and Japan."
"Cerezyme was one of the drugs manufactured at Genzyme's Allston, Massachusetts plant, for which production was disrupted in 2009 after contamination with Vesivirus 2117."
"The most common side effect is hypersensitivity, which occurs in about 3% of patients. It is associated with symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, rashes, itching, and angiooedema. Less common side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and reactions at the injection site; they are found in less than 1% of patients."
"No clinical interaction studies have been conducted. Miglustat appears to increase the clearance of imiglucerase by 70%, resulting in decreased enzyme activity."

In 1830 there were about 25 students, but this school was discontinued in 1834. The next record of school was by the teacher Edward Churnside Bishop under the Newfoundland School Society from 1843 to 1883.

When it became apparent that the Dutch were negotiating a treaty to transfer their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom, Eminsang led the attempts by the Elminese to stop the transfer, and together with other Dutch loyalists paid for a visit to The Hague by David Mill Graves, in an ultimate attempt to stop the ratification of the treaty. Eminsang wrote a letter to the German ambassador in The Hague asking German Emperor William I for mediation and protection, to be handed over by Mill Graves."

Apart from being a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast, Eminsang had also become a substitute judge on the Court of Justice, a sworn attorney, and a justice of the Small Causes Court. Eminsang's ""volte face"" proved very worthwhile for him, as he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Regularisation of the Affairs of the Netherlands on the Coast of Guinea headed by J. M.

As it appeared that Eminsang was rewarded for his sudden change of opinion, many Elminese grew angry with the situation. On 26 April, people from various ""asafo"" wards, mainly numbers 6, 7 and 8, marched with muskets, knives and Dutch flags to Eminsang's house, where a meeting was held between the Regularisation Committee and colonel De Haes, the Dutch military officer who had been entrusted with effecting the transfer of sovereignty. An altercation followed on the streets and eventually shots were fired, which hit J. M. C. W. Joost, who died of his wounds the next day."
"Eminsang could no longer remain in Elmina and fled to Cape Coast. He was released of his duties to the Regularisation Committee by colonel De Haes on 30 April. Eminsang later returned to Elmina, however, and served as acting consul general of the Netherlands in Elmina in 1878 and 1879 during the absence of Pieter Simon Hamel, and as consul to the Congo and the United States in Cape Coast in 1890."
"In the preface of his book ""Fanti Customary Laws"", John Mensah Sarbah wrote:"
"Eminsang had at least three children with Anna Abraba Smith. One of them, Marianne Eminsang (about 1859–1915), was grandmother to Robert Patrick Baffour. Anna Abraba Smith previously had a child with Cornelis Nagtglas."
"Eminsang married Mary Ellen De Lyons on 14 April 1860 at the American Episcopal Church in Harper, Liberia. She however abandoned him for the British colonial administrator Herbert Taylor Ussher. Eminsang then tried to indict Ussher for fornication and adultery at the Cape Coast court of justice, but after this attempt failed he decided to divorce De Lyons. The divorce was finalised on 11 September 1867."
Eminsang also had a child with Sarah Rühle and a son with a woman named Adayesa.

"Pemberton is an unincorporated community in Goochland County, Virginia, United States. Virginia State Route 45 passes by Pemberton, located about west of Goochland, the county seat. It was named for the family that owned Clover Forest Plantation. Nearby is Howard's Neck Plantation, listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"This hamlet was named for the owners of Clover Forest Plantation. The settlement overlooks the James River and was once a hub of rural trading activity. A dam and canal lock were built on the James at Pemberton to enable passage by boats. The lock lowered boats from the Kanawha Canal into the James River just below Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia and connected with Tamworth, Virginia and its mill. Trade moved from the Cartersville port and Willis River downriver on the James."
"Pemberton became connected to other markets via the Cartersville-Fredericksburg State Road, that began in Cartersville, crossed the James, and continued northward. The Cartersville Bridge, built across the James River in 1824, connected Cartersville and Pemberton; it was the first James River bridge built in Goochland County. At the time, all other river crossings were by ferry."
"In the late 1800s the Richmond-Allegheny Railroad (later the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, and currently CSX) was built through the area along the tow path of the abandoned Kanawha Canal. Pemberton was one of the railroad stops. Trains arrived in the village daily, carrying passengers and mail."
"By the early 1920s the rural village of Pemberton consisted of a large combined general store and post office, a lumber mill and pulp yards. Prominent Goochland County residents living in Pemberton included William Henry (Bill) Hall, a veteran of the American Civil War; and Bland Selden Hobson, the only Goochland woman known to have served overseas in World War I."

"Crickhowell Castle () is a Grade I listed building in Crickhowell, Wales, now largely ruined. An alternative name, ""Alisby's Castle"", is sometimes used; this is thought to be after a former governor of the castle, Gerald Alisby."
"The remaining sections of the castle walls and motte stand on a spur where a tributary stream meets the River Usk, in a more elevated position than the rest of the town, which was planned around it. It has been suggested that the castle replaced an earlier motte-and-bailey structure at nearby Maescelyn, where St Mary's Chapel, which has existed since around 1300, has also been linked with the castle by some historians. The motte is oval in shape and is still clearly visible, whilst the foundations of the shell keep are largely buried. Traces of the castle bailey have been identified in the nearby playing field."
"The castle was initially a motte and bailey castle built from around 1121, probably by Robert Turberville, a member of the notable Norman family, who at the time was a tenant of the Marcher lord Bernard de Neufmarché. In 1172 it was attacked by Welsh rebels, led by one Seisyllt ap Rhirid. Henry de Turberville (died 1239), the son of another Robert, was Seneschal of Gascony in the years 1226–1231 and again in 1237–1238, and Crickhowell Castle was held at the time by a Richard Turberville. Edmund de Turberville is recorded as lord of Crickhowell later in the century. Hugh Turberville, who held Crickhowell Castle from 1273, not as tenant-in-chief but as mesne lord, also held the position of Seneschal of Gascony. Hugh's services were called upon by King Edward I of England to train Welsh men-at-arms and transform the royal levy into a disciplined medieval army capable of conquering Wales; he led both cavalry and 6,000 infantry recruited in the Welsh Marches for King Edward's forces. He was later Constable of Castell y Bere in Merionethshire. He fought against Rhys ap Maredudd during his rising from 1287 to 1291, and died in 1293, the last of the family in the direct line."
"The castle was refortified in stone from 1242 when Sybil Turberville, Hugh's daughter, married Sir Grimbold Pauncefote (or ""Paunceforte""), who thus gained possession. It was walled with substantial stone towers and a large bailey, a home castle befitting an important Royal ally in Wales. The castle was in the hands of the powerful Mortimer family dynasty of Marcher Lords and in the 14th century and declined as a smaller holding within a large portfolio of lands, titles and larger castles."
"On the Royal command of new King King Henry IV in 1400, it was again refortified, this time by Sir John Pauncefote, great-grandson of Sir Grimbold, in advance of the uprising led by Owain Glyndŵr. The castle was largely destroyed in about 1403 by Glyndŵr's forces. who also attacked and burned Abergavenny town and other settlements in the area. It was at this time that the castle is thought to have been abandoned, subsequent stone-robbing leaving only the ruined stone double tower on Castle Green. However, 19th century illustrations suggest that its condition has deteriorated noticeably in the past century. It was listed in 1963."
"The so-called ""Ivy Tower"", a small tower once thought to have dated from the 14th century and to be part of the castle, was found by an archaeological survey to be much later in date and nothing to do with the castle at all."

"Commodity value is an important consideration in hedging against inflation. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often catastrophically, currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining precious metals. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return."

= = = Sesame Street (comic strip) = = =
"Sesame Street is a nationally syndicated comic strip inspired by ""Sesame Street"". Written and drawn by veteran Sesame animator Cliff Roberts, the earliest concept art was created in 1970, and by 1971, a promotional booklet was created as the comic entered the market, courtesy of King Features. The strip debuted on November 15, 1971, in more than 175 newspapers, and ran until 1975. The strip, which ran both daily and on Sundays, was conceptually similar to the series in its pedagogical goals, but, in the first year of the strip, conspicuous by the absence of the Muppets."
"Instead, the strip featured several new characters created by Roberts, such as Jasper and Julius, Christopher Clumsy, and Miss Fortune; in 1972, all of these characters appeared in animated inserts on ""Sesame Street"" itself. Also regularly seen was Professor Drummond Bugle, a lecturer, similar to more generic characters used in Roberts' animated segments. Roberts fleshed out the strip's cast with a vast menagerie of newly minted animal characters. Amongst them were Lotta Elephant, Richard Bird, Hedda the frog, Balderdash the mouse, Titus the snake, Thomas Turtle, Crawley the worm, and an errant spider. A pair of nameless, Muppet-esque monsters also skulked through on occasion."
"Though the earlier version of the strip avoided the Muppets, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and Cookie Monster joined the cast in December 1972, and appeared through the end of the strip's run in 1975."
"Like ""Sesame Street"", the comic strip was largely educational, using broad humor to relate learning concepts. The most frequent topics were parts of the body, shapes, and identification of objects. Other subjects included opposites or pairings (up and down, here and there, etc.) and emotions. Letters and numbers surfaced rarely, presumably because the strip's target audience was different from the largely pre-literate television audience. However, many strips were pure comedy, revolving around the characters' eccentricities and foibles."

"Marguerite Bellanger (10 June 1838 - 23 November 1886) was a French stage actress and courtesan. She was a celebrity of Second Empire France and known for her relationship with Napoleon III of France. She was often caricatured in contemporary press and is considered to be the model for Émile Zola's ""Nana"". A candy is also named after her. She was reputedly the most universally loathed of Napoleon III's mistresses, though perhaps his favorite. She outlived Napoleon's deposal in 1870 and died in 1886 aged 48."
"Marguerite Bellanger was born Julie Justine Marine Lebœuf on 10 June 1838 in Saint-Lambert-des-Levées, Maine-et-Loire to François Lebœuf and Julie Hanot. Born into poverty, she began working as a laundress in Saumur at the age of 15."
"After an affair with a lieutenant opened her eyes to the wider world, she became an acrobat and trick rider in a provincial circus, she travelled to Paris where she made her debut as an actress at the theater ""La Tour d'Auvergne"", under the name of Marguerite Bellanger (the surname of an uncle)."
"Although her acting talent was limited, she was cunning. She became one of the most sought-after cocottes of all Paris. She led a princely lifestyle, and the climax of her gallant life took place in the years 1862-1866. She is reported to have said: ""It is very nice Paris, but it is only habitable in the beautiful districts ... In the others, there are too many poor!"" according to ""Le Rappel"" of 16 April 1871. Author and playwright, Ludovic Halévy, is reputed to have said that Bellanger had the ""daintiest feet in Paris""."
Her celebrity status was such that she became a figure in the literary and artistic world. Zola quoted her as a friend of Nana.
"In 1947, he returned to Italy and a year later published his memoirs as ""Due dittatori di fronte"" (""[Two] Dictators Face to Face"" – i.e.: Mussolini and Hitler). Much details about the hierarchy and events of the war, not well known, are in the book."

The mountain is popular for downhill skiing in winter, and competitions have been held on its slopes. These competitions include the ""Norseman triathlon"", billed as ""the world's most brutal iron-distance triathlon"". It starts in Eidfjord and finishes at the top of Gaustatoppen. The summit is accessible on foot in the summer, on a rocky pathway of medium difficulty, although the southern side of the mountain is very dangerous and inaccessible. The wreckage of an airplane crash lies there, as it is too difficult to remove it."
"The first element is ""Gausta"", the name of the whole mountain, the last element is the finite form of ""topp"" m 'top, summit'. The name ""Gausta"" is probably a shortened form for ""*Gaustafjell"" (Gausta mountain), because Gausta originally was the name of a farm beneath the mountain. (For the same development see Dovre.) The Old Norse form of the name was maybe ""*Gautstǫð"", the name is then a compound of ""gaut"" f 'flooded place', and ""stǫð"" f 'stead, landing place for boat'. (The farm lies at Rjukan river.)"
"There is a funicular railway inside the mountain, built for military purposes. This ascends from the base of the mountain almost to the summit. A short railway takes the passengers from the mountain base horizontally to the lower station deep inside the mountain.

"Portloe lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The South West Coast Path passes through the village."
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Portloe in 1870 but it was withdrawn in 1887 without ever having performed a rescue. It was kept at first in a boat house built at the end of the road above the beach. It proved difficult to move the boat across the beach so a new house was built in 1877 nearer the water. The first house was converted into a church; the second was a school for a while but has since become a private dwelling house.

"First drafts for a bridge connecting the two cities of Remscheid and Solingen go back as far as 1889. Preparatory work began in 1893, the bridge was finished in 1897."
"The six support columns have a maximum height of 69 meters (230 ft). In the middle of the structure, the main arc has a span of 170 meters (560 ft). The overall length of the structure is 465 meters (1,530 ft)."
"A total of 5,000 tons (4,900 LT; 5,500 ST) of steel were used in its construction. 950,000 rivets hold the structure together. During construction, a number of advanced building techniques were used."
"Anton von Rieppel (1852 – 31 January 1926), an architect and engineer, was in charge of the project. A memorial plaque at the foot of the bridge reminds one of his efforts."
"Originally, the bridge was planned to be single-track. However, high future traffic growth projections led to the redesign as a dual-track bridge. Before its opening, the rail distance between the cities of Remscheid and Solingen was . With a direct connection via the bridge, this distance shrank to ."
The Prussian Parliament approved the 5 million Marks required to build the bridge in 1890.
"The first breaking of the earth was on 26 February 1894. A total of 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) of dynamite and 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) of black powder were needed during construction."
"The bridge's official inauguration celebration took place on 15 July 1897. Emperor Wilhelm II did not attend the ceremony in person. Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia attended the festivities instead. Emperor Wilhelm II visited the bridge two years later, on 12 August 1899."

= = = Walter Beisiegel = = =
"Walter Karl Beisiegel OBE (13 July 1907 – 8 January 1973) was an English career Royal Air Force officer who played first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force cricket team and also for Leicestershire. He was born at Uppingham, Rutland and died in the RAF hospital at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire."
"Beisiegel was educated at Uppingham School, where his batting at cricket won praise from Harry Altham in the annual review of schools cricket in ""Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"" in 1926. Altham wrote that Beisiegel ""stood head and shoulders over his colleagues"" and his innings of 126 not out for Uppingham against Rugby School ""was a fine wind-up to his school career""."
"For a period of five years between 1927 and 1932, inter-services cricket matches between the different branches of the UK armed forces – the Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force – were rated as first-class. Beisiegel played in five of these matches for the RAF team between 1928 and 1931 as a middle-order batsman. In his first match, against The Army cricket team in 1928, he scored 54 in his only innings of the match, and this was to be the highest score of his first-class career. A year later, in the same fixture, he top-scored for the RAF with 53. Though Beisiegel continued to play in these inter-services matches through to 1938, none of his games were first-class after 1931, and these were the only first-class scores he made of more than 50."
"Three years after his last first-class game for the Royal Air Force team, Beisiegel played 10 matches for Leicestershire in the 1934 season as a middle-order batsman. He was not particularly successful, scoring 185 runs at an average of just 12.33 and with a highest score of only 33. But when the Leicestershire captain Arthur Hazlerigg was injured late in the season, it fell to Beisiegel as an amateur player to take over the captaincy, and in his first game as captain he led the team to its first victory over Yorkshire since 1911. ""The Times"" report said that it was ""the most sensational victory of the season"": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90. Two weeks later there was a second victory under Beisiegel's leadership against a team considered greatly superior to Leicestershire when Nottinghamshire were beaten by an innings and 106 runs inside two days at Trent Bridge. The end of the season, however, marked the end of Beisiegel's first-class cricket career as he resumed his RAF duties; he was, however, awarded an honorary county cap in recognition of his captaincy successes."
"From school, Beisiegel went as a cadet to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell where he graduated as a pilot officer in December 1927. He was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant in 1933. This was followed by promotion from flight lieutenant to squadron leader in 1937. From the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 to May 1940, he was in charge of No. 616 Squadron RAF, a unit that was equipped with the Mark I Spitfire during his command and that was based at RAF Leconfield until deployed south in May 1940. In 1942, he was temporarily promoted from wing commander to group captain under the heading of ""General Duties"". He remained in the RAF after the Second World War and was then officially promoted from wing commander to group captain in 1947. In 1950, he was awarded the OBE in the King's Birthday Honours. He retired from the RAF with a promotion to the rank of Air Commodore in 1956."

"""DragonHeart: Fire and Steel"" follows the story of medieval dragonslayer Sir Bowen in his attempt to rid the world of a particularly evil king along with seven evil dragons that have ruled the world (the seven evil dragons never appeared in the movie). On the way, he befriends the last dragon to exist, Draco. Sir Bowen and Draco must join forces to defeat the king's army and rescue a damsel in distress. It drops out some of the movie's plot, but it is still a close match."

The game does not use the film's music, instead featuring an original score by Thomas Egeskov Peterson. It was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews due to simplistic gameplay, poor controls, and jerky animation. Though the graphics were praised, particularly the rendered backgrounds, critics agreed that the gameplay problems were an overriding problem.

The films relate exclusively to the family's expeditions in Africa during this time. The original films are held in the British Film Institute archives, and the Powell-Cotton Museum own copies contemporaneous with the originals."
"Between 1887 and 1939 Major Percy H G Powell-Cotton undertook a total of 28 expeditions to Africa and Asia. Alongside the extensive collection of game and animal specimens he bought back, Major Powell-Cotton also shot several reels of 16mm film footage whilst out in the bush."
"His films mainly depict African game and wildlife, as well as market scenes, craft making and tribal ceremonies from the African rural communities. One particular film, ""Gorilla Drive, Cameroons"", is believed to be the only one of its subject from this date in existence. It shows the mustering of the animals by the local people, their herding and despatch by the natives with spears."
"Powell-Cotton made 17 films in total, either independently or together with his daughter Diana or wife Hannah. All the films are 16mm black and white silent films, made in a non-narrative documentary style. The major also shot all his films using a handheld, windup Bell & Howell Filmo 70 camera, which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The first recorded use of colour film was in 1950’s in the film ""South Africa: Victoria Falls & Livingstone Game Park"" made by Christopher and Diana Powell-Cotton."
"Most of the films in the collection were made for private viewing only and for the purposes recording keeping from the expeditions. However, Major Powell-Cotton did present several of his films to the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1932, including ""Crafts in the Cameroons"" (1931) and ""Osonigbe Juju House and Benin Brass Cutting"" (1931)."
"The most notable films of the collection are those by Major Powell-Cotton’s daughters, Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton from their expeditions to Angola in 1936 and 1937."
"The result of their trips was just under three hours of edited black-and-white 16mm film, accompanied by nearly 3,000 objects and 2,000 photographs. The films portray local ceremonies, craft-working and family life in rural Africa. Together they provide a unique record of the region at a crucial time in its history, before the full impact of the massive cultural changes brought about by missionization and colonial rule."
"Diana and Antoinette filmed their entire footage on a single, small windup Kodak cine camera which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The sisters were not able to review or edit any footage on location, and so were constantly anxious they had not captured the events and activities in Angola successfully. They only edited their footage on their return, and would give private viewings accompanied by music and live narration to family members in their screen room which is now Gallery 4 in the Powell-Cotton museum."

"The microtransaction features of ""Spartan Assault"" were generally negatively received. While reviewers such as Destructoid's Carter felt that the microtransactions could be ignored and did not impact enjoyment of the game, Hillard wrote that ""it’s hard not to feel as though an important part of the game is being withheld after buying into the agreed-upon price of admission."""

"The United States government estimated in 2002 that each year up to 50,000 people are trafficked illegally into the United States, mostly women and children, and are trapped in slavery-like situations. As a response, it enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA), which, among other things, allows such people to apply for 3-year temporary visas that lead to permanent resident status. In 2006, Congress modified 8 CFR 214.11(p) to now have the T-visa to be for 4 years. Although 5,000 are available per year, only 2,000 had been issued as of January, 2009.

"The tomb consists of a single room. The fresco on the back wall shows a banquet scene, borrowed from depictions of drinking scenes on Attic red-figure pottery from the early fifth century. The banqueteers recline on three couches called ""klinai"". On the floor under the ""klinai"" a cat prowls towards a rooster and a partridge. On the left wall three female dancers, one male dancer and a male musician with a barbiton appear. They are placed between small trees filled with birds. On the right wall a similar scene is shown. On the entry wall two youths jump down from their horses. They may be ""apobates"" or a reference to the Dioscuri as intermediaries between the earthly life and the afterlife."
The similarities between the frescoes in the Tomb of the Triclinium and Tomb 5513 (also in the Necropolis of Monterozzi) led Steingraber to conclude that they were the products of the same workshop. The strong influence of red-figure Attic vase painting has convinced some experts that the artist who decorated the tomb was a Greek metic.
= = = Martha Mears (author) = = =
Martha Mears was an eighteenth-century midwife and author.
"Mears was a midwife, mother, and author in London, England. Her work, ""Pupil of Nature"", was published in 1797. The full title is ""Pupil of Nature: Candid advice to the fair sex, on the subjects of pregnancy, childbirth, the diseases incident to both, the fatal effects of ignorance and quackery, and the most approved means of promoting health, strength and beauty of their offspring."" It consists of 10 essays about topics from the state of the womb before and after conception, to the effect of music on nerves. She depicted the pregnant woman as a cluster of symptoms to be managed, particularly with regard to her psychological state. Mears subscribed to the common notion that ""irritability"" of the pregnant woman’s uterus induced a heightened ""sensibility"". The organization and broad scope of the text mirrored this representation of the body as a bundle of potential pathologies. A contemporary review of her work describes its purpose being to teach women the important advantages of pursuing nature's plans in everything that relates to the pregnant state. Mears' studied the writings of Harvey, Leake, Smellie and Denman."
"Mears' was the last major contributor to the eighteenth-century midwifery dispute. Her work is considered an eighteenth-century version of the popular prenatal guide ""What to Expect When You’re Expecting""."

= = = Air Baron = = =
"Air Baron is an economic strategy game published by Avalon Hill in 1996. Despite its family-oriented marketing, ""Air Baron"" plays far more like a wargame than a typical family money-driven game like ""Monopoly"". ""Air Baron"" is for two to six players, adjusting the playable area and victory conditions accordingly."
"""Air Baron"" challenges players to build an airline empire in the United States by amassing a plurality of market share and liquid assets."
"Players seek to gain ""dominance"" or ""control"" of hubs in order to amass market share. Dominance of a hub is gained by controlling the majority of associated domestic spokes; it carries a moderate income potential and market share gain. Control of a hub is gained by controlling ""all"" of the associated domestic spokes; it doubles the income potential and market share gain of dominance."
Any uncontrolled domestic spoke may be purchased at face value. Takeovers of controlled spokes require a higher fee and an opposed dice roll versus the controlling player. Several factors contribute both positively and negatively to each player's dice total.
"If, at the end of his turn, a player has a combined total of market share and cash equal to or greater than the victory margin, he wins."
"At the start of each round, one color-coded chit per player is placed in a cup. The chits are drawn sequentially to determine the current order of play. While the order of play in an individual round is generally unimportant, the interval between turns for a single player is a significant consideration."
"Starting cash is determined by die roll. To offset the advantage of first play, each player receives cumulatively more money during the initial turn."
"Every purchased spoke, plus all hubs, have a unique chit placed in a cup. At the start of every turn, the player randomly draws two chits, paying the owner appropriately. Chits are replaced at the end of each round."
"Beyond the primary domestic spokes, players can also purchase foreign spokes and jumbo jets. Foreign spokes benefit opposed takeovers at the associated hubs. Jumbo jets provide similar bonuses on the domestic spoke where deployed, or they can be held in reserve for later use in an opposed takeover. Additionally, spokes with jumbos pay double the usual rate."
"Normally players are limited to one purchase or takeover attempt per turn. However, players can declare a state of ""Fare Wars"" that allow an indefinite number of domestic takeover attempts provided:"
"While in Fare Wars, players receive an additional takeover dice roll bonus. Profits, however, are not earned while in Fare Wars. Since the state can only be entered or exited at the beginning of a player's turn, the randomized play order has a major impact on the potential for income loss."
"Several optional rules, including strikes, crashes, government loans, and bidding, are provided as part of an ""advanced version"". These rules may be added to the basic game collectively or individually as desired."

"The Yerrapalli Formation is a Triassic rock formation consisting primarily of mudstones that outcrops in the Pranhita–Godavari Basin in southeastern India. The Yerrapalli Formation preserves fossils of freshwater and terrestrial vertebrates as well as trace fossils of invertebrates. The tetrapod fauna includes temnospondyl amphibians, archosauromorph reptiles, and dicynodonts."
Most of the Yerrapalli Formation consists of red mudstones. The mudstones were deposited across a floodplain during the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. Smaller lenses of calcareous sandstone represent ephemeral streams that branched off from the larger channels that were the source of the floodplain sediments. The climate of the region during the time is thought to have been monsoonal with both wet and dry seasons.
"The Yerrapalli Formation overlies the Kamthi Formation, underlies the Bhimaram Formation, and is conformable with both formations. Two members of the Yerrapalli Formation have been recognized; a lower member consisting of layers of red and purple clay with lenses of pale green clay and an upper member consisting of alternating layers of clay and fine-grained sandstone."
"The paleobiota of the Yerrapalli Formation is similar to that of the overlying Maleri Formation, which also preserves fossils of temnospondyls and archosauromorphs. The main difference between the Yerrapalli and the Maleri faunae is the presence of dicynodonts in the former. The discovery of dicynodont fossils in the Pranhita-Godavari Basin in 1964 was one of the earliest indications that the Yerrapalli Formation represented a distinct paleofauna. Before this discovery, Yerrapalli strata were grouped within the Maleri Formation. The dicynodonts of the Yerrapalli Formation are similar to those of the Ntavere Formation in Zambia, which also dates back to the Anisian. During the Middle Triassic, what is now India and southern Africa formed one continuous landmass as part of the supercontinent Gondwana."

"National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a poverty alleviation project implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. This scheme is focused on promoting self-employment and organization of rural poor. The basic idea behind this programme is to organize the poor into SHG (Self Help Groups) groups and make them capable for self-employment. In 1999 after restructuring Integrated Rural Development Programme(IRDP), Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) launched Swarnajayanti Grameen Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) to focus on promoting self-employment among rural poor. SGSY is now remodeled to form NRLM thereby plugging the shortfalls of SGSY programme. This scheme was launched in 2011 with a budget of $5.1 billion and is one of the flagship programmes of Ministry of Rural Development. This is one of the world's largest initiatives to improve the livelihood of poor. This programme is supported by the World Bank with a credit of $1 Billion. The scheme was succeeded by Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana on 25 September 2015."
The basic idea behind this scheme was to form SHG groups and help them to start some entrepreneurial activities but later SHG group failed.
"The core belief of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is that the poor have innate capabilities and a strong desire to come out of poverty. They are entrepreneurial, an essential coping mechanism to survive under conditions of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful livelihoods and enable them to come out of poverty."
"""To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self- employment and skilled wage employment opportunities resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable grassroots institutions of the poor."""
The core values which guide all the activities under NRLM are as follows:
"In order to build, support and sustain livelihood of the poor, NRLM will harness their capability and complement them with capacities (information, knowledge, skill, tools, finance and collectivization), so that the poor can deal with the external world. NRLM works on three pillars – enhancing and expanding existing livelihoods options of the poor; building skills for the job market outside; and nurturing self-employed and entrepreneurs."
"A cake was made which was called Soddag Valloo or Dumb Cake, because it was made and eaten in silence. Young women and girls all had a hand in baking it on the red embers of the hearth, first helping to mix the ingredients (flour, eggs, eggshells, soot and salt) and kneading the dough. The cake was divided up and eaten in silence and, still without speaking, all who had eaten it went to bed, walking backwards, expecting and hoping to see their future husband in a dream or vision. The future husband was expected to appear in the dream and offer a drink of water."
"Other means of divination was to steal a salt herring from a neighbour, roast it over the fire, eat it in silence and retire to bed; or to hold a mouthful of water in your mouth and a pinch of salt in each hand as you listen to a neighbour's conversation, whereupon the first name mentioned would be that of your future spouse."

"The Coleophoridae are a family of small moths, belonging to the huge superfamily Gelechioidea. Collectively known as case-bearers, casebearing moths or case moths, this family is represented on all continents, but the majority are found in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. They are most common in the Palearctic, and rare in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Australia; consequently, they probably originated (like most or all other Gelechioidea families) in northern Eurasia. They are relatively common in houses, they seek out moist areas to rest and procreate."
"These ""micromoths"" are generally of slender build, and like in many of their relatives, the margins of their wings usually consist of a ""fringe"" of hairs. The tiny caterpillar larvae initially feed internally on the leaves, flowers, or seeds of their host plants. When they emerge to feed externally, they usually construct a protective silken case, discarded and built anew as they grow and molt. The common names of the Coleophoridae refer to this habit."
"The bagworm moths (Psychidae), which also belong to the primitive Ditrysia (although to superfamily Tineoidea, not Gelechioidea), build similar cases as larvae. As opposed to these, though, the case-bearer females leave their cases to pupate and have normally developed wings as adults, instead of being neotenous as female bagworms usually are."
"About 95% of the over 1,000 described species have been placed in the ""wastebin genus"" ""Coleophora"". Many proposals have been made to split smaller genera from ""Coleophora"", but few have been accepted, due to the uncertainties about which species are closest to the type species of ""Coleophora"" – ""C. anatipennella"" – and thus would remain in the genus."
"Regarding the family's circumscription versus other Gelechioidea, it is by now far less disputed than usual for this superfamily. The Blastobasidae, Momphidae (mompha moths), Pterolonchidae, and Symmocidae have formerly been included in the Coleophoridae as subfamilies, but are more often considered separate families today. With the internal relationships of Coleophoridae genera (as far as they are widely accepted) and species essentially unresolved due to the classification problems mentioned above, no subfamilies or tribes are accepted in the family for the time being."
Genera of case-bearers at least provisionally accepted by recent authors include:

= = = Strict father model = = =
"The strict father model of parenting is one which values strict discipline, particularly by the father, in parenting."
Ideas involved in this model include:
"This model of child-rearing would involve, for example, allowing children to cry themselves to sleep on the grounds that picking up a child when it should be sleeping on its own improperly fosters dependence on the parents. In his book ""Dare to Discipline"", James Dobson advocates the strict father model. However, some researchers have linked authoritarian childrearing with children who withdraw, lack spontaneity, and have lesser evidence of conscience."
"The strict father model is discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics,"" ""Don't Think of an Elephant,"" ""The Political Mind,"" and ""Whose Freedom?"". In these books, the strict father model is contrasted with the nurturant parent model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then conservative politics correspond to the strict father model. For example, conservatives think that adults should refrain from looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent."

"Mark Alan Stuart (born April 14, 1968) is a Christian rock musician, singer and songwriter best known as the lead vocalist for the Christian rock band Audio Adrenaline during their original run from 1987 to 2007."
"Mark Stuart met the original guitarist and bassist for Audio Adrenaline, Barry Blair and Will McGinniss, while attending Kentucky Christian College (now known as Kentucky Christian University). Barry Blair was Mark's roommate for three years. They founded the band in 1986 under the name of A-180. However, they temporarily disbanded the next year when Mark went to Haiti for a semester. When he returned to Kentucky, the band reformed and recruited Bob Herdman, who brought them two songs to record. After they did, they changed their name to Audio Adrenaline and signed a deal with Forefront Records. After more than twenty years of success with the band and eight studio albums, Stuart and the band decided to retire on January 2006. The primary reason cited was Stuart's ""ongoing vocal challenges"" stemming from vocal cord damage caused by a disorder known as spasmodic dysphonia, not by overuse."
Mark Stuart and Will McGinniss have started a project called Know Hope Collective. The project features a changing group of musicians that will sing worship songs and present testimonies.

"""Missulena bradleyi,"" also known as the eastern mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae. The spider is endemic to the eastern coast of Australia."
"William Joseph Rainbow described the eastern mouse spider in 1914 from a specimen collected in North Sydney by Henry Horton Burton Bradley (1845–1918), president of the board of trustees of the Australian Museum at the time. Describing the ""beautiful and strikingly marked"" specimen as a ""decided novelty"", Rainbow named it in honour of its collector, whom he stated was the first collector of Australian spiders."
"Eastern mouse spiders are often mistaken for Australian funnel-web spiders. The females are large and very strong, with powerful chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly, while those of Australian funnel-web spiders remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets."
"The male, which has an all-black carapace and a pale bluish area on top of the abdomen, roams around in autumn and early winter looking for a mate. They sometimes fall into swimming pools when wandering. Cases of envenomations have peaked during this period."
The burrow can be found by brushing away loose soil in an area where they live until a flap of silk indicative of the entrance is found.
"Common symptoms of eastern mouse spider bites are numbness and tingling at the bite site, sweating (diaphoresis), headache, and nausea generally. Although it appears to be the most dangerous member of the genus, serious envenomations by this species are relatively rare. Most bites documented in the medical literature did not require use of antivenom or involve serious symptoms. Their venom has been found to have toxins similar to the robustoxin found in Australian funnel-web spider venom, and Australian funnel-web spider antivenom has been found to be effective in treating severe mouse spider bites. Compared to the Australian funnel-web spider, however, the eastern mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans, and may often give ""dry"" bites."

"Figshare is an online open access repository where researchers can preserve and share their research outputs, including figures, datasets, images, and videos. It is free to upload content and free to access, in adherence to the principle of open data. Figshare is one of a number of portfolio businesses supported by Digital Science."
"Figshare was launched in January 2011 by Mark Hahnel and has been supported by Digital Science since a January 2012 relaunch. Hahnel first developed the platform as a personal custom solution for the organization and publication of diverse research products generated in support of his PhD in stem cell biology. In January 2013 Figshare announced a partnership with PLOS to integrate Figshare data hosting, access, and visualization with their associated PLOS articles. In September 2013, the service launched an institutional repository service, which offers organizations a pre-developed infrastructure for hosting academic materials generated by their member communities. In December 2013, they announced integration with ImpactStory to support the collection of altmetrics. Figshare made 200,000 files publicly available in its first year, which grew to approximately one million objects by September 2013."
"Figshare also hosts the Reproducibility Collection as a founding member of The Reproducibility Initiative, which acts as an independent and blinded validator for replication of submitted data."
Figshare releases '' each year to assess the changing academic landscape around open research.
"Researchers can upload all of their research outputs to Figshare, thus making them publicly available. Users can upload files in any format, and items are attributed a DOI. The current 'types' that can be chosen are figures, datasets, media (including video), papers (including pre-prints), posters, code, and filesets (groups of files). All files are released under a Creative Commons license, CC-BY for most files and CC0 (public domain) for datasets. Figshare allows researchers to publish negative data. The withholding of negative publications is a widely known phenomenon that leads to a significant bias, often referred to as the file drawer effect. By encouraging publishing of figures, charts, and data, rather than being limited to the traditional entire 'paper', knowledge can be shared more quickly and effectively. Figshare also tracks the download statistics for hosted materials, acting in turn as a source for altmetrics. The main hosting mechanism for the platform is Amazon S3, with CLOCKSS serving as an additional host for public content. Both of these resources support backup and preservation via a distributed cloud computing network."
"Figshare features integration with ORCID, Symplectic Elements, can import items from Github, and is a source tracked by Altmetric.com."
"In March 2018, Figshare announced itself as an all-in-one ""next gen"" institutional repository for data, theses, publications, and other research outputs alike."

= = = Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources = = =
Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources is a 1983 biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by Martin Lings.
"The book provides a new account of the sira or the life of Muhammad, with details that had not been elaborated in other accounts. It is based primarily on old Arab sources that go back to the 9th century, of which some passages are translated for the first time. It is not contradictory to other accounts but rather offers new insights and new details. The book also includes excerpts from original English translations of speeches by men and women who lived close to Muhammad, heard him speak, witnessed his actions, witnessed the way he interacted with situations and witnessed events he encountered throughout various stages of his life."
"References used are Ibn Ishaq (references here are to Ferdinand Wüstenfeld's edition of Sirat Rasul Allah, a life of the Prophet by Muhammad ibn Ishaq in the annotated recension of Ibn Hisham). Also Ibn Sa’ad (the references are to John Leyden's edition of Kitab al-Tabaqat al Kabir by Muhammad ibn Sa’d). Also there is Al-Waqidi (and the references are to Marsden Jones' edition of Kitab al Maghazi, A Chronicle of the Prophet's Campaigns, by Muhammad ibn Umar al- Waqidi)."
"It is a narrative of the history of Arabia and the birth and the life of Muhammad. The biography consists of 85 short chapters, some as short as just two pages in length. Each chapter deals with an important event in the history of Islam and provides chronological context for the advent of the religion, as well as detailed information about Muhammad."
"The biography has gone through many reprints in English and it has been translated and published into many languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Malay and Tamil."
"A distinctive element of the biography is the vivid, approachable narrative style, which is fast moving and flows fluently. The book reads more like a novel and was written in a style, which is easily readable, comprehensible and it uses language, which reflects both simplicity and grandeur."
"Lings uses a more archaic style of English to depict conversations and translations of the Qur'an, which helps slows down the rapid flow of the narration. The focus in the book is less about the teachings of Islam and more about Muhammad."
"In 1991, a second revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, containing additional details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavours as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighbouring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Before Lings died in 2005, a newly revised edition of the book with 22 additional pages was published, which included final updates made on the text and incorporated into its contents, containing extra details pertaining to Muhammad's endeavors as well as accounts covering the spread of Islam into Syria and its neighboring states surrounding the Arabian Peninsula."
"Hamza Yusuf hails this work as ""one of the great biographies of the English language"", praising ""the historical accuracy of the text and the providential care so evident in the author's choice of versions as well as the underlying structure of the story as he chose to tell it."" He also reports from Lings how while writing this book, ""he was overwhelmed with the presence of the Prophet during the entire time and felt a great blessing in having been able to complete it.""."
"""The Spectator"" described the book as ""an enthralling story that combines impeccable scholarship with a rare sense of the sacred worthy of his subject."" ""The Islamic Quarterly"" called the book ""a true work of art, as enthralling as the best novels with the difference that this is not fiction but fact."""
"""The Times"" said ""this work is widely recognized as the most readable account of the life of the Prophet to date."" ""Parabola"" stated that ""for those interested in Islam in one way or another, it is mesmerizing."""
"Upon its first edition, the book was subject to criticism by some Muslims who decried the ""Perennialist poison"" in the book. The author gave public answer in a Saudi newspaper to the objections."
"In 1983, the book was selected as the best biography of Muhammad in English at the National Seerat Conference in Islamabad. This book was also given an award by the government of Pakistan."
"In 1990, after the book had attracted the attention of Azhar University, Lings received a decoration from Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak."
