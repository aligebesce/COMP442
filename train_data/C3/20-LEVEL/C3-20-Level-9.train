Does anybody of you remember where Friends of the Earth England erm  analyze their expenditures.
Their income and  their finance for the last year?
I I  saw it somewhere and I got  lost track of it.
And I was appalled  as to how much they spend on publicity.
But I can't do anything with it because I lost the numbers.
Mm.
"I don't know I'll have, have a look."
I don't remember seeing
The thing is this .
Does anybody of you seen that or  remember?
No.
No.
No.
So  are we saying yes to that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm  can I just ask you.
Does anybody wanna go on the energy campaign weekend?
No thank you.
And there's this  book.
Which I think we might like to  don't worry .
Erm  energy without aids.
Which I think would be  a good idea if we got it because I don't know about you but I'm always having arguments with people who say oh we can't have the whole country covered in windmills and
Mm.
things like that.
They all think nuclear powers okay.
So we really need to know our
What's the energy thing weekend just out of curiosity?
And
Good.
Right.
Go on
Cos I don't
For fags?
How often is it that I have asked you for money?
"Never, but you don't usually get any from me that's why you've never asked."
"I, I"
I don't normally ask you anyway
"Well what, what do you want it for?"
Please sis
No I won't
Please sis
No I haven't got any change
Yes you have
"Look in my purse, I haven't got any money"
Please sis
Oh Neil
"Please, I'm, come on"
I've not got any money
Not even a fifty P?
No cos I used that to go to
oh come on you must have some change
to be
"Or not to be, oh no come on sis"
No
"I'll do anything  please I, I"
"You, you clean my black boots for me, polish my black boots for me and I give you a quid"
When I come back
"No, no you do it now or you don't get your pound"
What these ones?
Yeah
Alright then  I tell you something if I clean these and I don't get that pound
"Yes you will, you'll definitely get a pound"
If I clean these and I don't get a pound these are going in the pond
Running out of petrol just before.
"Bit of a daft time to wait to, to ."
What did he say?
Consummately easy win?
He did indeed.
Oh that's a good picture they've got there isn't it?
That's really constructive.
"That  looking at a bald head, a stupid girl, and something else."
Oh!
But why is she stupid?
I bet they show other people all that.
Getting her head in the way of the camera.
So what happened to Senna?
"I know he dropped out, but why?"
Don't know.
Oh.
Ran out of steam after eighteen laps.
If we're going to do any more quizzes this is the sort of thing we're going to need to know to do well on the sports sections.
Well I don't know.
They don't do interesting sports.
They did the firs
They do obscure ones like golf.
"ah but the, the first ques the first question on the sports section was, what team does Nigel Mansell drive for?"
Oh.
Did you get it right?
"No, we could only come up with, I forgot, but it was something Renault, and we could only think of Renault."
"Williams,Will Williams."
Yeah.
But Chris knows.
That's Renny.
Yeah.
"Here are, look, look, this groupie's getting into everything."
Erm struggle
Yes
I had a struggle getting the ball out of the scrum
"Well done, I, very good, I had a struggle getting the ball out of the scrum, right"
Wriggle
Wriggle
Erm  I had to wriggle out of the scrum
"I had to wriggle out of the scrum, right, good"
"Farewell, is that farewell"
I have to say farewell to my
yes cos what's happened to him?
"is he really, is he really?"
Yes
"Oh I didn't know that, I thought the army was"
no he's going to
Gloucester and then he's erm going to erm
Cheltenham and Gloucester is the poly that he's going to?
Yes polytech
"Oh right, I see when you said that I thought he was going to an army regiment that they put up in Gloucester"
"Oh I got that mixed up, sorry about that, right when does that happen then?"
This October
"Erm, the twenty first"
"Right, and what's he going to do there?"
Oh is he?
"Oh good, oh I, I'm rather pleased about that"
"right, can we do the next one, the last one"
It's a boggin crash
It's a boggin crash
What
"Yes, that's what you're going to do today"
Well
that's perfectly alright.
Fog gets in.
Course it does.
All caravans are like that.
"But you've got to have those caravan, those vents because the van is so small and you've got gas supplied."
It's rules and regulations.
If you've got a gas fire in
It it means that they haven't been doing their duty in the winter then.
If they guarantee to put the mattresses all up  in the dry  they asked you to do yours  or did they say they would do it?
They done it.
Well how's the damn thing on the bed then?
Because they put it back there for these people  that was coming in.
Oh.
They didn't seemingly.
We don't know.
Do we?
No.
Well there were no  there anyway.
So they say.
It's all hearsay.
Well alright.
Perhaps the man was working part-time.
Perhaps he never noticed the .
Perhaps the people were in the van  and found the beds wet and said well we can't sleep here and they slept in the sit with the fire on.
I dunno.
It could have been.
cos there was only two here.
cold weather in any case.
Eh?
It's cold weather in any case.
That's right.
Shut the lights.
You don't know.
Well I still
I think
think
"you, you know you feel safe ."
"that even in something like the choir  it's somebody that you should of struck up a, er a relationship  you know, over several"
The
intervals.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And you suddenly, you thought to yourself  well  you know I actually quite like this chap."
Mm.
"You know, wouldn't it be nice if he had asked me out."
And then suddenly the day
Mm mm.
comes along.
"Not to sort of well you, you can't be blamed because I mean  yo , in the innocent you were actually going because of the concert."
I know.
You see I ne
"But he didn't , you know, he, he can't believe his luck that somebody"
No.
as attractive as you
said yes
he's got this goat beard and this hairy bottom lip!
"You know, breathe that smells of moth balls, I mean who would have thought of that."
"And he, and"
If he were taking several of you out why didn't you say to one of the other girls  why don't you come?
Did he have a pair of tickets?
Cos it was when we were walking down
Michael can I have a look please?
Oh  sorry !
Thank you.
To rebuild his rear end.
Hope he comes out of it.
"Well as long as nothing breaks, nothing gets ."
"No, now way must he strain so she's, she's got some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner."
Quite a major operation.
He's been ever so bright.
"Walking about quite well, he did turn to lick his  under his tail but his little tail was wagging."
And he was walking fine.
He even stopped and had a tinkle.
See they don't know it's to hurt.
No  no.
No I think I think animals are fantastic they way they put up with pain.
Because they can't tell you.
And after a major operation there he was wagging his tail and
You don't know the threshold of pain in animals do you?
Can't tell you.
Well no.
Very seldom you hear a dog or a  in pain.
Oh you do.
Oh
What's the matter?
Odd.
What's odd?
I think it's getting better.
The muscle's gone
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Cup of herbal tea?
An aspirin?
Nothing I can do you for?
Oh you're  book's upstairs.
Do you want that?
".Is it actual pain then, or stiffness?"
Mm.
Mm.
"Also, we are a much more tolerant society, generally."
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"We can encompass people who are a bit different nowadays, which they couldn't."
Yeah.
Couldn't in those days.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
"I think they use the phrase now, do their own thing."
"That  yeah, yeah, yeah"
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
"Yes, yeah."
"So we now have erm, reference to the bible and the erm, prodigal son."
"The prodigal son was a black sheep to his father, and to his older brother."
But how different were the reactions of the two.
"His adventure started off quite normally, as I'm sure you'll remember from the erm, from the parable."
"Every child must break away from the parental fold, and establish his own personal identity."
Things began to go wrong when he got into bad company.
He had then asked for his share of his inheritance.
"He wanted it then and there, not later."
"With money in his possession, was he a pray to the unscrupulous."
I'm sure he was.
He had journeyed into a far country.
That showed initiative.
But did it cut him off from the guidance he needed?
"The story relates, that he spent all."
"He was not prudent enough to have saved, so he began to be in want."
My
It's with condensation of fat and everything  er with them just decorating all rooms and that it's
Ah.
"so you can have microwaves, toaster, kettle"
Yeah.
and things like that and that's about it.
Yeah.
Oh I were just wondering.
Can't find clocks.
Can't find bugger all.
Oh so they'll be round here somewhere then won't they?
"Yeah, radio alarm clocks."
"I just wondered how much they are cos that one that er just disintegrated on me, I got it from Britannia."
It's rubbish.
It's never worked proper
Yeah.
"it sort of played about two or three minutes of music and then it went crrrkkkkkk for a few minutes, that's why I kept hitting it."
"And then music, if you hit it, music come back on."
Oh well
Stupid it were.
"Have to have a proper look later, I can't find it."
Ah found one.
"I says I can't find them, I found them."
Here we are
"what's that one, number four, number four   digital clock, mains operated, fast time, alarm set, snooze feature, battery back-up  four ninety five."
Not bad
That's not bad at all that.
No.
Seven ninety nine.
Six ninety five.
Six ninety five and a six fifty.
Very good.
Is it more or less straight up?
More or less horizontal?
About forty five or?
It's probably about seventy.
Right.
"Maybe seventy, maybe eighty."
"So you could draw a rough sketch like that,"
Mm.
"just measure it with a protractor, or measure along here."
That would be  if we drew wh wh how do we find the gradient really?
"We draw a little triangle, don't we?"
Yeah.
"So at point one, it's nought."
"What would, what would that be at the point two?"
For X
Three.
equals two?
Two three.
"So we could get the point two three, and we could take the gradient of that as being fairly close to the gradient of the curve."
Mm.
Erm how can we get it more accurately reflecting what's happening there?
Right.
Point something.
So if we did something like that that's where we want it.
That's where we want the gradient
Mhm.
"and we took a line from there to there, where this is that's where X is equal to, that'll go far."
Nought nought point nine say.
"And just the other side of it, where X equals one point one."
Mm.
"We're going to have, difference along the X axis will be nought point two."
Yeah.
Yes.
Cos people
D seven was the acknowledgement
So.
So that was to say that we'd w
Yeah.
withdrawn D two point three.
Yeah.
And now you've reused it somewhere else?
And erm and subsequently we've actually withdrawn
Withdrawn
this particular D two stroke three.
So if you look in your manual you've now onl only got one D two stroke
Yeah.
three
"Rather than two D one, right."
"A a a and the, and the, and the D seven bit is, is in a different section?"
Is covered by part D two stroke one.
Right.
Thank you Dennis.
You're a
good lad.
Right.
Could I just quickly look through here?
"I, I did have a go through this core brief to see if there were any things that I should have picked out."
"There there is a good section, there's a good section on pensions"
by the way because our staff will be concerned about pension proposals after privatization.
Is it?
It's section one point five.
If you view files three to five.
The main message I would give is that
"the Board has responded to the government with regard to the pensions issue, and suggested a number of improvements to the government's proposals."
Cos I wasn't sure of some of the answers.
And that it it's saying which of the following days of action has the group participated in.
I mean cos we haven't really sort of really done a proper day of action have we?
We've done little bits and pieces.
I know we did the returnable bottles.
.
I mean cos and we did that stall on peat but we didn't really take part in the peat day of action did we?
.What do you think?
Fiona and I did the electricity
What  at the supermarket .
Is that the global warming and electricity privatization?
That one?
Was it?
It was erm efficiency  of
Oh fuel and efficiency.
Right that one then.
"Oh we didn't, we didn't do the ozone layer one did we?"
Did you do a stall  on that ozone layer?
We did do something.
With the
"Oh we did, yes."
"with the, with er snow remember?"
That was Christmas last year wasn't it?
Oh yes that was
That was ozone.
Yes it was we did
Oh so I'll put down for that then.
Oh it looks quite good .
Right.
Have you written to your MP about fuel efficiency?
Yes I did.
We did.
One of them said er
when they start bringing the
"yes, yes that's right, lower"
lowering the taxes
"Everybody come here, this is the place to run a big business"
Yeah
cheap labour
Yeah
"you can fiddle all you want, get away with it, er"
I
Well Nor you can't help me on this me old son
Er
"it's a shame really, no he bought about erm"
I'm not even gonna volunteer to do
about erm ten of these and then the head
So apart from those three we said what else is there Ma
"No, well he's got a catalogue and we can send"
"No, that, that catalogue he had I rang them and he"
sent me one
Beeswax was it?
"Pure beeswax, what else?"
I bet that was a
It was pure restoration materials
Yes
I've forgotten now
I'm sure that's where he said he got it from the
wax
He said he got his waxes fifteen years ago and he's still using them
Oh
"I think he gets all his stuff from that guy at, he got the brochure didn't he from somewhere up North?"
"Yes, well Molly's just said she's rung them"
"Well yeah, well I've got the brochure"
"Twice he became a tutor, but he neglected his work."
"In one case he had an affair with the mistress of the house, which led to his dismissal."
"He had a period as a railway clerk at  Bridge, but was dismissed because of a deficit of eleven pounds."
"As Barbara and Gareth Lloyd-Evans say, it's impossible to know how the money disappeared."
"Embezzlement forgetfulness, inefficiency."
Did Branwell grow up.
He promised to much.
He was his own worst enemy.
"Like the prodigal son, he wasted his substance in riotous living."
"Er, it's a bit of back background then about Branwell."
You know anything about Branwell.
isn't it.
Mhm.
"Erm, that his father didn't make him go to school."
Mm
"Er, there's a suggestion that he had mild epilepsy, and they tried to keep it quite, and his father tutored him at home."
So he didn't have a normal life a boy of his circumstances in those days.
"Would have, yes."
"It was more lonely, there weren't other boys around him."
Mm.
Mm.
"There weren't other people around him, except his family."
"Yeah, So,"
Didn't help an unstable character.
"That may have contributed, yes, yes."
yeah.
Any other
Plus the rather powerful father figure.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Which tend to
to be made out of recycling
Well  well this is what
Well at the moment it's so dear
well what he meant was
to
"th , I mean he said they"
process it.
we are not
Well
we are not dealing with anything that we cannot
In the short term.
sell.
In
Ah.
"other words they were selling glass, and they were selling  metal  back to  whatever  and manufacturers  to re-use  but  in terms of collecting and the cost of collecting it all and and"
That's expensive!
"handling all this it's, yeah."
The cost that they were  having to bear were greater than what they were actually getting back on the sale of this stuff.
"But, at the same time  the  normal sort of refuse if you like, disposable  was being reduced  because"
That's right!
these other items weren't in the normal refuse collection and therefore they were going to sort of reduce them from a weekly collection to a
Well that's if
"fortnightly collection, so they would be saving in that"
Well that  er
But not saving to these
that's if
particular firms
that
that they want.
that's if
No.
Mm.
"Then there's, I, I, I'm the only person."
"quite a long time now I  begin to understand there are M S twos and threes are project engineers, and I"
Not necessarily.
No.
Er
They can be.
That was certainly my understanding and certainly
No.
if that is not the case then I'm gonna have to change the consultation documents because
No.
It's terminology isn't it?
No.
"Because, because the consultation"
We've
"documents clearly set out to the staff, what I thought was our collective understanding of the section engineer oblique project engineer relationship"
Right.
that section engineers at M S four level er acted as project coordinators or looked after their own element of the
Yeah.
"work, negotiated the er"
The fee
the fees
Yeah.
"and the remit with the client, and then delegated to, the work to a project engineer."
"And the project engineers were M S twos on medium jobs, small jobs, and M S threes on larger jobs."
And they were supported by a pool of engineers and technicians at
Mm.
M S one and P N T created .
Yeah.
But why can't the engineer at M S one level be project engineer
Because his responsibilities are different.
"in, in terms of"
Well.
"And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her , and I 'm going to . ''"
`` Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her ? ''
"`` Well , I ai n't going to let anybody else pull it , '' said Davy , doubling up his fists and frowning ."
`` They 'd just better try it .
I did n't hurt her much ... she just cried 'cause she 's a girl .
I 'm glad I 'm a boy but I 'm sorry I 'm a twin .
"When Jimmy Sprott 's sister conterdicks him he just says , ` I 'm oldern you , so of course I know better , ' and that settles HER ."
"But I ca n't tell Dora that , and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me ."
"You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell , since I 'm a man . ''"
"Altogether , Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard , where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves ."
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out .
"Dora submitted calmly to be kissed , but Davy responded to Anne 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement , `` I 'm Mr. Davy Keith . ''"
"At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady , but Davy 's manners left much to be desired ."
"`` I 'm so hungry I ai n't got time to eat p ` litely , '' he said when Marilla reproved him ."
`` Dora ai n't half as hungry as I am .
Look at all the ex ` cise I took on the road here .
That cake 's awful nice and plummy .
"We have n't had any cake at home for ever 'n ever so long , 'cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us ."
And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes .
Catch her !
Can I have another piece ? ''
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice .
"However , she reminded Davy that he ought to say `` Thank you '' for it ."
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite .
"When he had finished the slice he said , `` If you 'll give me ANOTHER piece I 'll say thank you for IT . ''"
"`` No , you have had plenty of cake , '' said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final ."
"Davy winked at Anne , and then , leaning over the table , snatched Dora 's first piece of cake , from which she had just taken one dainty little bite , out of her very fingers and , opening his mouth to the fullest extent , crammed the whole slice in ."
Dora 's lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror .
"Anne promptly exclaimed , with her best `` schoolma'am '' air , `` Oh , Davy , gentlemen do n't do things like that . ''"
"`` I know they do n't , '' said Davy , as soon as he could speak , `` but I ai n't a gemplum . ''"
`` But do n't you want to be ? ''
said shocked Anne .
said Nat innocently .
"`` Well , I do n't know about that , '' began Mrs. Bhaer , rather startled by the coolness of the proposition ."
"`` Why , I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you , and be kind to 'em as you were to me , '' said Nat , looking surprised and alarmed ."
"`` So I do , but I like to know something about them first ."
"I have to choose them , because there are so many ."
I have not room for all .
I wish I had . ''
"`` I told him to come because I thought you 'd like it , but if there is n't room he can go away again , '' said Nat , sorrowfully ."
"The boy 's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer , and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope , and spoil his kind little plan , so she said , `` Tell me about this Dan . ''"
"`` I do n't know any thing , only he has n't got any folks , and he 's poor , and he was good to me , so I 'd like to be good to him if I could . ''"
"`` Excellent reasons every one ; but really , Nat , the house is full , and I do n't know where I could put him , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her ."
"`` He could have my bed , and I could sleep in the barn ."
"It is n't cold now , and I do n't mind , I used to sleep anywhere with father , '' said Nat , eagerly ."
"Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his shoulder , and say in her kindest tone : `` Bring in your friend , Nat ; I think we must find room for him without giving him your place . ''"
"Nat joyfully ran off , and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy , who slouched in and stood looking about him , with a half bold , half sullen look , which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself , after one glance , `` A bad specimen , I am afraid . ''"
"`` This is Dan , '' said Nat , presenting him as if sure of his welcome ."
"`` Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us , '' began Mrs. Jo , in a friendly tone ."
"`` Yes , '' was the gruff reply ."
`` Have you no friends to take care of you ? ''
`` No . ''
"`` Say , ` No , ma'am , ' '' whispered Nat ."
"`` Sha n't neither , '' muttered Dan ."
`` How old are you ? ''
`` About fourteen . ''
`` You look older .
What can you do ? '' ''
` Most anything . ''
"`` If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do , work and study as well as play ."
Are you willing to agree to that ? ''
`` Do n't mind trying . ''
"`` Well , you can stay a few days , and we will see how we get on together ."
"Take him out , Nat , and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home , when we will settle about the matter , '' said Mrs. Jo , finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person , who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard , suspicious expression , sorrowfully unboyish ."
"They were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them , and he had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse ."
"` George , Nana is a treasure . '"
"` No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies . '"
"` Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ' '"
"I wonder , ' Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , ' I wonder . '"
"It was an opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy ."
"At first he pooh-poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow ."
"` It is nobody I know , ' he said , examining it carefully , ` but he does look a scoundrel . '"
"` We were still discussing it , you remember , ' says Mr. Darling , ` when Nana came in with Michael 's medicine ."
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault ."
"Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine ."
"If he had a weakness , it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly ; and so now , when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , ` Be a man , Michael . '"
"` Wo n't ; wo n't , ' Michael cried naughtily ."
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him , and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness ."
"` Mother , do n't pamper him , ' he called after her ."
"` Michael , when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur ."
"I said `` Thank you , kind parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . '' '"
"He really thought this was true , and Wendy , who was now in her night-gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage Michael , ` That medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? '"
"` Ever so much nastier , ` Mr. Darling said bravely , ` and I would take it now as an example to you , Michael , if I had n't lost the bottle . '"
He had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there .
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it , and put it back on his wash-stand . '"
"I know where it is , father , ' Wendy cried , always glad to be of service ."
"` I 'll bring it , ' and she was off before he could stop her ."
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way .
"` John , ' he said , shuddering , ` it 's most beastly stuff ."
"It 's that nasty , sticky , sweet kind . '"
"` It will soon be over , father , ' John said cheerily , and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass . '"
"I have been as quick as I could , ' she panted ."
"` You have been wonderfully quick , ' her father retorted , with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her ."
"` Michael first , ' he said doggedly ."
"` Father first , ' said Michael , who was of a suspicious nature . '"
Subject : ` Is summer or winter best fun ? '
A lively pow-wow .
About evenly divided .
J. Flint fined five cents for disrespect to the Chair .
A collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the door-step .
"E. Devlin was chosen Secretary for the coming year , and a new book contributed by the Chairman . ''"
`` That 's all . ''
`` Is there any other business before the meeting ? ''
"asked Frank , as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table ."
"Ed rose , and glancing about him with an appealing look , said , as if sure his proposition would not be well received , `` I wish to propose the name of a new member ."
"Bob Walker wants to join , and I think we ought to let him ."
"He is trying to behave well , and I am sure we could help him ."
Ca n't we ? ''

Let him go with chaps of his own sort . ''
`` That is just what I want to keep him from !
"He 's a good-hearted boy enough , only no one looks after him ; so he gets into scrapes , as we should , if we were in his place , I dare say ."
"He wants to come here , and would be so proud if he was let in , I know he 'd behave ."
"Come now , let 's give him a chance , '' and Ed looked at Gus and Frank , sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point ."
"But Gus shook his head , as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan , and Frank said gravely : `` You know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight , and we can not break it . ''"
`` You need n't .
"I ca n't be here half the time , so I will resign and let Bob have my place , '' began Ed , but he was silenced by shouts of `` No , no , you sha n't ! ''"
`` We wo n't let you off ! ''
"`` Club would go to smash , if you back out ! ''"
"`` Let him have my place ; I 'm the youngest , and you wo n't miss me , '' cried Jack , bound to stand by Ed at all costs ."
"`` We might do that , '' said Frank , who did object to small boys , though willing to admit this particular one ."
"`` Better make a new rule to have ten members , and admit both Bob and Tom Grant , '' said Ralph , whereat Grif grinned and Joe scowled , for one lad liked Merry 's big brother and the other did not ."
`` That 's a good idea !
"Put it to vote , '' said Gus , too kind-hearted to shut the door on any one ."
"`` First I want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by Bob , out of the club as well as in , for it wo n't do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street , '' said Ed , heartily in earnest about the matter ."
`` I will ! ''
"`` Whoever it was had better tell , and not wait to be found out , '' said Demi , looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family ."
"`` I know you think it 's me , '' broke out Nat , red and excited ."
"`` You are the only one who knew where it was , '' said Franz ."
`` I ca n't help it I did n't take it .
I tell you I did n't I did n't ! ''
"cried Nat , in a desperate sort of way ."
"`` Gently , gently , my son !"
What is all this noise about ? ''
and Mr. Bhaer walked in among them .
"Tommy repeated the story of his loss , and , as he listened , Mr. Bhaer 's face grew graver and graver ; for , with all their faults and follies , the lads till now had been honest ."
"`` Take your seats , '' he said ; and , when all were in their places , he added slowly , as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look , that was harder to bear than a storm of words , `` Now , boys , I shall ask each one of you a single question , and I want an honest answer ."
"I am not going to try to frighten , bribe , or surprise the truth out of you , for every one of you have got a conscience , and know what it is for ."
"Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy , and set yourselves right before us all ."
I can forgive the yielding to sudden temptation much easier than I can deceit .
"Do n't add a lie to the theft , but confess frankly , and we will all try to help you make us forget and forgive . ''"
"He paused a moment , and one might have heard a pin drop , the room was so still ; then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one , receiving the same answer in varying tones from all ."
There is really nothing at all but scenery . ''
"`` Out of your world perhaps , Susan -- but not out of mine , '' said Anne with a faint smile ."
"`` I do not quite understand you , Mrs. Doctor , dear , but of course I am not well educated ."
"But if Dr. Blythe buys the Morgan place he will make no mistake , and that you may tie to ."
"They have water in it , and the pantries and closets are beautiful , and there is not another such cellar in P. E. Island , so I have been told ."
"Why , the cellar here , Mrs. Doctor , dear , has been a heart-break to me , as well you know . ''"
"`` Oh , go away , Susan , go away , '' said Anne forlornly ."
`` Cellars and pantries and closets do n't make a HOME .
Why do n't you weep with those who weep ? ''
"`` Well , I never was much hand for weeping , Mrs. Doctor , dear ."
I would rather fall to and cheer people up than weep with them .
"Now , do not you cry and spoil your pretty eyes ."
"This house is very well and has served your turn , but it is high time you had a better . ''"
Susan 's point of view seemed to be that of most people .
Leslie was the only one who sympathised understandingly with Anne .
"She had a good cry , too , when she heard the news ."
She always looks as if she 'd just been starched and ironed .
"Well , poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake ."
"Still , I do n't see that she could do anything less than take them , under the circumstances , and she 'll have Anne to help her ."
"Anne 's tickled to death over the whole business , and she has a real knacky way with children , I must say ."
"Dear me , it does n't seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child ."
And now she has adopted twins .
You 're never safe from being surprised till you 're dead . ''
The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde 's Hollow and along the Green Gables lane .
Marilla 's face was rather grim .
It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion .
"It was beyond Marilla 's power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck , or tumble over the dashboard under the pony 's heels ."
In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home .
"Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap , regardless of the reins , flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like hug ."
"`` I do n't believe you mean it , '' he said , smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately ."
`` You do n't LOOK like a lady who 'd whip a little boy just 'cause he could n't keep still .
Did n't you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only 's old as me ? ''
"`` No , I always kept still when I was told , '' said Marilla , trying to speak sternly , albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davy 's impulsive caresses ."
"`` Well , I s ` pose that was 'cause you was a girl , '' said Davy , squirming back to his place after another hug ."
"`` You WAS a girl once , I s ` pose , though it 's awful funny to think of it ."
Dora can sit still ... but there ai n't much fun in it I do n't think .
Seems to me it must be slow to be a girl .
"Here , Dora , let me liven you up a bit . ''"
Davy 's method of `` livening up '' was to grasp Dora 's curls in his fingers and give them a tug .
Dora shrieked and then cried .
`` How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day ? ''
demanded Marilla despairingly .
"`` But she was glad to die , '' said Davy confidentially ."
"`` I know , 'cause she told me so ."
She was awful tired of being sick .
We 'd a long talk the night before she died .
She told me you was going to take me and Dora for the winter and I was to be a good boy .
"I 'm going to be good , but ca n't you be good running round just as well as sitting still ?"
And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick .
It was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave .
Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was a dog she was n't any braver than if it really was a dog .
"But Emerson is jealous because he has n't got a Brave Aunt himself , nothing but uncles . ' '' '"
I have kept the best for the last .
You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child .
Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates ... no real playmates .
"You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have ` favorites ' among our pupils , but I ca n't help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine ."
"I do n't think it does any harm , though , for everybody loves Paul , even Mrs. Lynde , who says she could never have believed she 'd get so fond of a Yankee ."
The other boys in school like him too .
There is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies .
He is very manly and can hold his own in all games .
He fought St. Clair Donnell recently because St. Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag .
The result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each other 's patriotism henceforth .
St. Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST . ' ''
`` Paul 's Letter . ''
"` My dear teacher , '' ` You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew ."
I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean to tell you about them .
I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things .
There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them . ' ''
` My rock people live at the shore .
I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came .
"Now I ca n't go till spring , but they will be there , for people like that never change ... that is the splendid thing about them ."
Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best .
"She lives in Andrews ' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes , and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies ."
You ought to hear the stories she can tell .
Then there are the Twin Sailors .
"They do n't live anywhere , they sail all the time , but they often come ashore to talk to me ."
They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world ... and more than what is in the world .
Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once ?
He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade .
"A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea , you know , teacher ."
"They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday , till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage ."
"` If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 , ' Mrs. Darling said ."
"` If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana 's bowl , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` If only I had pretended to like the medicine , ' was what Nana 's wet eyes said ."
"` My liking for parties , George . '"
"` My fatal gift of humour , dearest . '"
"` My touchiness about trifles , dear master and mistress . '"
"Then one or more of them would break down altogether ; Nana at the thought , ` It 's true , it 's true , they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse . '"
Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana 's eyes .
` That fiend ! '
"Mr. Darling would cry , and Nana 's bark was the echo of it , but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter ; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names ."
"They would sit there in the empty nursery , recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening ."
"It had begun so uneventfully , so precisely like a hundred other evenings , with Nana putting on the water for Michael 's bath and carrying him to it on her back . '"
"I wo n't go to bed , ' he had shouted , like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject , ' I wo n't , I wo n't ."
"Nana , it is n't six o'clock yet ."
"Oh dear , oh dear , I sha n't love you any more , Nana ."
"I tell you I wo n't be bathed , I wo n't , I wo n't ! '"
"Then Mrs. Darling had come in , wearing her white evening-gown ."
"She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown , with the necklace George had given her ."
She was wearing Wendy 's bracelet on her arm ; she had asked for the loan of it .
Wendy so loved to lend her bracelet to her mother .
"She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy 's birth , and John was saying : ' I am happy to inform you , Mrs. Darling , that you are now a mother , ' in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion ."
"Wendy had danced with joy , just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done ."
"Then John was born , with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male , and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also , but John said brutally that they did not want any more ."
Michael had nearly cried .
"` Nobody wants me , ' he said , and of course the lady in evening-dress could not stand that . '"
"I do , ' she said , ' I so want a third child . '"
` Boy or girl ? '
"asked Michael , not too hopefully ."
` Boy . '
Then he had leapt into her arms .
"Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now , but not so little if that was to be Michael 's last night in the nursery ."
Once I thought I was stuck for keeps .
Ai n't it an awful night ? '
`` I came to myself and knew I must hurry upstairs .
"I explained as quickly as I could to Mary , and left her trying to brush the snow off ."
"Upstairs I found that Jims was over that paroxysm , but almost as soon as I got back to the room he was in the grip of another ."
"I could n't do anything but moan and cry -- oh , how ashamed I am when I think of it ; and yet what could I do -- we had tried everything we knew -- and then all at once I heard Mary Vance saying loudly behind me , ` Why , that child is dying ! '"
`` I whirled around .
Did n't I know he was dying -- my little Jims !
I could have thrown Mary Vance out of the door or the window -- anywhere -- at that moment .
"There she stood , cool and composed , looking down at my baby , with those , weird white eyes of hers , as she might look at a choking kitten ."
I had always disliked Mary Vance -- and just then I hated her . ''
"` We have tried everything , ' said poor Susan dully ."
` It is not ordinary croup . ' ''
"` No , it 's the dipthery croup , ' said Mary briskly , snatching up an apron ."
` And there 's mighty little time to lose -- but I know what to do .
"When I lived over-harbour with Mrs. Wiley , years ago , Will Crawford 's kid died of dipthery croup , in spite of two doctors ."
"And when old Aunt Christina MacAllister heard of it -- she was the one brought me round when I nearly died of pneumonia you know -- she was a wonder -- no doctor was a patch on her -- they do n't hatch her breed of cats nowadays , let me tell you -- she said she could have saved him with her grandmother 's remedy if she 'd been there ."
She told Mrs. Wiley what it was and I 've never forgot it .
I 've the greatest memory ever -- a thing just lies in the back of my head till the time comes to use it .
"Got any sulphur in the house , Susan ? '"
"`` Yes , we had sulphur ."
"Susan went down with Mary to get it , and I held Jims ."
I had n't any hope -- not the least .
Mary Vance might brag as she liked -- she was always bragging -- but I did n't believe any grandmother 's remedy could save Jims now .
Presently Mary came back .
"She had tied a piece of thick flannel over her mouth and nose , and she carried Susan 's old tin chip pan , half full of burning coals . ''"
"` You watch me , ' she said boastfully ."
"` I 've never done this , but it 's kill or cure that child is dying anyway . '"
"`` She sprinkled a spoonful of sulphur over the coals ; and then she picked up Jims , turned him over , and held him face downward , right over those choking , blinding fumes ."
I do n't know why I did n't spring forward and snatch him away .
"Susan says it was because it was fore-ordained that I should n't , and I think she is right , because it did really seem that I was powerless to move ."
"Susan herself seemed transfixed , watching Mary from the doorway ."
I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted .
"Some of the answers were commonplace enough ... dolls , ponies , and skates ."
Others were decidedly original .
Hester Boulter wanted ` to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room . '
Hannah Bell wanted ` to be good without having to take any trouble about it . '
"Marjory White , aged ten , wanted to be a WIDOW ."
"Questioned why , she gravely said that if you were n't married people called you an old maid , and if you were your husband bossed you ; but if you were a widow there 'd be no danger of either ."
The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell 's .
She wanted a ` honeymoon . '
I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles !
`` Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done .
"I could n't get the older ones to do so , but the third class answered quite freely ."
Eliza Bell had ` set fire to her aunt 's carded rolls . '
"Asked if she meant to do it she said , ` not altogether . '"
She just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy .
Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box .
Annetta Bell 's worst crime was ` eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard . '
Willie White had ` slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on . '
"` But I was punished for it 'cause I had to wear patched pants to Sunday School all summer , and when you 're punished for a thing you do n't have to repent of it , ' declared Willie ."
`` I wish you could see some of their compositions ... so much do I wish it that I 'll send you copies of some written recently .
"Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased , adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen ."
"They were to write the letters on real note paper , seal them in an envelope , and address them to me , all without any assistance from other people ."
Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains .
Those compositions would atone for much .
"Here is Ned Clay 's , address , spelling , and grammar as originally penned . ''"
` Miss teacher ShiRley Green gabels .
p.e. Island can birds '' ` Dear teacher I think I will write you a composition about birds .
birds is very useful animals .
my cat catches birds .
His name is William but pa calls him tom .
he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter .
only for that he would be a good-looking cat .
It seemed a pity to waste him .
"And say , was n't it fun to hear that girl yell ? ''"
Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables .
"Anne hurried home from school , for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give ."
"Dora , neat and proper , in her nicely starched white dress and black sash , was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor , speaking demurely when spoken to , keeping silence when not , and in every way comporting herself as a model child ."
"Davy , blissfully dirty , was making mud pies in the barnyard ."
"`` I told him he might , '' said Marilla wearily ."
`` I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief .
He can only get dirty at that .
We 'll have our teas over before we call him to his .
"Dora can have hers with us , but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here . ''"
When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in the parlor .
Mrs. Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and called her out .
A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on .
Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure .
"Marilla and Anne stared in dismay , the Aids in amazement ."
"Could that be Dora ... that sobbing nondescript in a drenched , dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on Marilla 's new coin-spot rug ?"
"`` Dora , what has happened to you ? ''"
"cried Anne , with a guilty glance at Mrs. Jasper Bell , whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred ."
"`` Davy made me walk the pigpen fence , '' wailed Dora ."
`` I did n't want to but he called me a fraid-cat .
And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me .
"My dress was just awful but Davy said if I 'd stand under the pump he 'd wash it clean , and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress ai n't a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled . ''"
Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes .
Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper .
"Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously ... a method in which she had great faith , not altogether unjustified by results ."
She told him she felt very badly over his conduct .
"`` I feel sorry now myself , '' admitted Davy , `` but the trouble is I never feel sorry for doing things till after I 've did them ."
"Dora would n't help me make pies , cause she was afraid of messing her clo'es and that made me hopping mad ."
I s ` pose Paul Irving would n't have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew she 'd fall in ? ''
"`` No , he would never dream of such a thing ."
Paul is a perfect little gentleman . ''
That pie was a strong argument for Isaac .
I thought a man who had to live on such cookery did indeed need a wife and might be pardoned for taking desperate measures to get one .
I was dreadfully tired of broiling on the roof anyhow .
But it was the thunderstorm that decided me .
"When I saw it coming up , black and quick , from the northwest , I gave in at once ."
I had endured a good deal and was prepared to endure more ; but I had paid ten dollars for my hat and I was not going to have it ruined by a thunderstorm .
I called to Isaac and out he came .
"`` If you will let us down and promise to dispose of that dog before I come here I will marry you , Isaac , '' I said , `` but I 'll make you sorry for it afterwards , though . ''"
"`` I 'll take the risk of that , Anne , '' he said ; `` and , of course , I 'll sell the dog ."
I wo n't need him when I have you . ''
"Isaac meant to be complimentary , though you might n't have thought so if you had seen the face of that dog ."
"Isaac ordered Julius Caesar away and put up the ladder , and turned his back , real considerately , while we climbed down ."
We had to go in his house and stay till the shower was over .
I did n't forget the object of our call and I produced our subscription list at once .
`` How much have you got ? ''
asked Isaac .
"`` Seventy dollars and we want a hundred and fifty , '' I said ."
"`` You may put me down for the remaining eighty , then , '' said Isaac calmly ."
"The Applebys are never mean where money is concerned , I must say ."
"Isaac offered to drive us home when it cleared up , but I said `` No . ''"
I wanted to settle Melissa before she got a chance to talk .
"On the way home I said to her : `` I hope you wo n't mention this to anyone , Melissa ."
"I do n't mind marrying Isaac , but I do n't want people to know how it came about . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't say anything about it , '' said Melissa , laughing a little disagreeably ."
"`` Because , '' I said , to clinch the matter , looking significantly at her front hair as I said it , `` I have something to tell , too . ''"
Melissa will hold her tongue .
"By the Rule of Contrary `` Look here , Burton , '' said old John Ellis in an ominous tone of voice , `` I want to know if what that old busybody of a Mary Keane came here today gossiping about is true ."
"If it is -- well , I 've something to say about the matter !"
Have you been courting that niece of Susan Oliver 's all summer on the sly ? ''
"Burton Ellis 's handsome , boyish face flushed darkly crimson to the roots of his curly black hair ."
Something in the father 's tone roused anger and rebellion in the son .
"He straightened himself up from the turnip row he was hoeing , looked his father squarely in the face , and said quietly , `` Not on the sly , sir , I never do things that way ."
I do n't see the good of being so awful clean .
It 's lots more comfable being dirty . ''
"`` Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord , '' said Anne astutely ."
"Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight hours ; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving , whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival ."
"If Paul Irving washed his face every day , that settled it ."
"He , Davy Keith , would do it too , if it killed him ."
"The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet , and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done ."
Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew .
"Davy behaved quite well at first , being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was Paul Irving ."
The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off uneventfully .
Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came .
"Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy , her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids , between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed , encased in a loose lace frill ."
"Lauretta was a fat , placid-looking child of eight , who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there , an infant of six months ."
"Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced ... a caterpillar , a furry , squirming caterpillar ."
Marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late .
Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta 's neck .
Right into the middle of Mr. Allan 's prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks .
The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes .
Every head in the congregation flew up .
"Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew , clutching frantically at the back of her dress ."
"`` Ow ... mommer ... mommer ... ow ... take it off ... ow ... get it out ... ow ... that bad boy put it down my neck ... ow ... mommer ... it 's going further down ... ow ... ow ... ow ... '' Mrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical , writhing Lauretta out of church ."
Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr. Allan proceeded with the service .
But everybody felt that it was a failure that day .
For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification .
When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day .
She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk .
Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish .
But Anne 's mournful eyes troubled him .
"`` I s ` pose , '' he said reflectively , `` that Paul Irving would n't have dropped a caterpillar down a girl 's neck in church , would he ? ''"
"`` Indeed he would n't , '' said Anne sadly ."
"`` Well , I 'm kind of sorry I did it , then , '' conceded Davy ."
`` But it was such a jolly big caterpillar ... I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in .
Look to it : he that is last at the lych-gate Sir Daniel shall reward .
Look to it right well !
I know you for a man of naught .
"Nance , '' he added , to one of the women , `` is old Appleyard up town ? ''"
"`` I 'll warrant you , '' replied the woman ."
"`` In his field , for sure . ''"
"So the group dispersed , and while Clipsby walked leisurely over the bridge , Bennet and young Shelton rode up the road together , through the village and past the church ."
"`` Ye will see the old shrew , '' said Bennet ."
`` He will waste more time grumbling and prating of Harry the Fift than would serve a man to shoe a horse .
And all because he has been to the French wars ! ''
"The house to which they were bound was the last in the village , standing alone among lilacs ; and beyond it , on three sides , there was open meadow rising towards the borders of the wood ."
"Hatch dismounted , threw his rein over the fence , and walked down the field , Dick keeping close at his elbow , to where the old soldier was digging , knee-deep in his cabbages , and now and again , in a cracked voice , singing a snatch of song ."
"He was all dressed in leather , only his hood and tippet were of black frieze , and tied with scarlet ; his face was like a walnut-shell , both for colour and wrinkles ; but his old grey eye was still clear enough , and his sight unabated ."
"Perhaps he was deaf ; perhaps he thought it unworthy of an old archer of Agincourt to pay any heed to such disturbances ; but neither the surly notes of the alarm bell , nor the near approach of Bennet and the lad , appeared at all to move him ; and he continued obstinately digging , and piped up , very thin and shaky : `` Now , dear lady , if thy will be , I pray you that you will rue on me . ''"
"`` Nick Appleyard , '' said Hatch , `` Sir Oliver commends him to you , and bids that ye shall come within this hour to the Moat House , there to take command . ''"
The old fellow looked up .
"`` Save you , my masters ! ''"
"he said , grinning ."
`` And where goeth Master Hatch ? ''
"`` Master Hatch is off to Kettley , with every man that we can horse , '' returned Bennet ."
"`` There is a fight toward , it seems , and my lord stays a reinforcement . ''"
"`` Ay , verily , '' returned Appleyard ."
`` And what will ye leave me to garrison withal ? ''
"`` I leave you six good men , and Sir Oliver to boot , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` It 'll not hold the place , '' said Appleyard ; `` the number sufficeth not ."
It would take two score to make it good . ''
"`` Why , it 's for that we came to you , old shrew ! ''"
replied the other .
`` Who else is there but you that could do aught in such a house with such a garrison ? ''
`` Ay !
"when the pinch comes , ye remember the old shoe , '' returned Nick ."
`` There is not a man of you can back a horse or hold a bill ; and as for archery -- St. Michael !
He was so bright and nice-mannered everybody liked him .
"Him and Anne were a fine-looking couple , Nora May ."
Not but what they had their shortcomings .
Anne 's nose was a mite too long and Gil had a crooked mouth .
"Besides , they was both pretty proud and sperrited and high-strung ."
But they thought an awful lot of each other .
It made me feel young again to see 'em .
"Anne was n't a mossel vain , but nights she expected Gil she 'd prink for hours afore her glass , fixing her hair this way and that , and trying on all her good clothes to see which become her most ."
I used to love her for it .
And I used to love to see the way Gil 's face would light up when she came into a room or place where he was .
"Amanda Perkins , she says to me once , `` Anne Douglas and Gil Martin are most terrible struck on each other . ''"
And she said it in a tone that indicated that it was a dreadful disgraceful and unbecoming state of affairs .
Amanda had a disappointment once and it soured her .
"I immediately responded , `` Yes , they are most terrible struck on each other , '' and I said it in a tone that indicated I thought it a most beautiful and lovely thing that they should be so ."
And so it was .
"You 're rather too young to be thinking of such things , Nora May , but you 'll remember my words when the time comes ."
"Another nephew of mine , James Ebenezer Lawson -- he calls himself James E. back there in town , and I do n't blame him , for I never could stand Ebenezer for a name myself ; but that 's neither here nor there ."
"Well , he said their love was idyllic , I ai n't very sure what that means ."
I looked it up in the dictionary after James Ebenezer left -- I would n't display my ignorance afore him -- but I ca n't say that I was much the wiser for it .
"Anyway , it meant something real nice ; I was sure of that by the way James Ebenezer spoke and the wistful look in his eyes ."
"James Ebenezer is n't married ; he was to have been , and she died a month afore the wedding day ."
He was never the same man again .
"Well , to get back to Gilbert and Anne ."
When Anne 's school year ended in June she resigned and went home to get ready to be married .
"The wedding was to be in September , and I promised Anne faithful I 'd go over to Montrose in August for two weeks and help her to get her quilts ready ."
Anne thought that nobody could quilt like me .
"I was as tickled as a girl at the thought of visiting with Anne for two weeks , but I never went ; things happened before August ."
I do n't know rightly how the trouble began .
Other folks -- jealous folks -- made mischief .
Anne was thirty miles away and Gilbert could n't see her every day to keep matters clear and fair .
"Besides , as I 've said , they were both proud and high-sperrited ."
The upshot of it was they had a terrible quarrel and the engagement was broken .
"For all that , if ye have any affection for my neck -LRB- to say nothing of your own -RRB- ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly ."
"I am going to do a bit of play-acting , the bottom ground of which is just exactly as serious as the gallows for the pair of us ."
"So bear it , if ye please , in mind , and conduct yourself according . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said I , `` have it as you will . ''"
"As we got near the clachan , he made me take his arm and hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness ; and by the time he pushed open the change-house door , he seemed to be half carrying me ."
"The maid appeared surprised -LRB- as well she might be -RRB- at our speedy return ; but Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation , helped me to a chair , called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips , and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nursery-lass ; the whole with that grave , concerned , affectionate countenance , that might have imposed upon a judge ."
"It was small wonder if the maid were taken with the picture we presented , of a poor , sick , overwrought lad and his most tender comrade ."
"She drew quite near , and stood leaning with her back on the next table ."
`` What 's like wrong with him ? ''
said she at last .
"Alan turned upon her , to my great wonder , with a kind of fury ."
`` Wrong ? ''
cries he .
"`` He 's walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his chin , and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets ."
"Wrong , quo ' she !"
"Wrong enough , I would think !"
"Wrong , indeed ! ''"
"and he kept grumbling to himself as he fed me , like a man ill-pleased ."
"`` He 's young for the like of that , '' said the maid ."
"`` Ower young , '' said Alan , with his back to her ."
"`` He would be better riding , '' says she ."
`` And where could I get a horse to him ? ''
"cried Alan , turning on her with the same appearance of fury ."
`` Would ye have me steal ? ''
"I thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon , as indeed it closed her mouth for the time ."
"But my companion knew very well what he was doing ; and for as simple as he was in some things of life , had a great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these ."
"`` Ye neednae tell me , '' she said at last -- `` ye 're gentry . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Alan , softened a little -LRB- I believe against his will -RRB- by this artless comment , `` and suppose we were ?"
Did ever you hear that gentrice put money in folk 's pockets ? ''
"She sighed at this , as if she were herself some disinherited great lady ."
"`` No , '' says she , `` that 's true indeed . ''"
"I was all this while chafing at the part I played , and sitting tongue-tied between shame and merriment ; but somehow at this I could hold in no longer , and bade Alan let me be , for I was better already ."
"But cast with what skill he might , it availed nothing , for the salmon would not even look at the bait . '"
"I am beaten at last , unless the Doran-donn can deliver me , ' he cried ."
"And as he spoke there was a swish of the water , and the face of the Doran-donn looked up at him . '"
"O catch me , I pray you , that salmon under the rock ! '"
said Covan son of Gorla .
"And the Doran-donn dived , and laying hold of the salmon by his tail , bore it back to the place where Covan was standing ."
"` The roe , and the duck , and the salmon are here , ' said Covan to the old man , when he reached the cottage ."
"And the old man smiled on him and bade him eat and drink , and after he hungered no more , he would speak with him ."
"And this was what the old man said : ` You began well , my son , so things have gone well with you ."
"You set store by your mother 's blessing , therefore you have been blest ."
"You gave food to the raven when it hungered , you were true to the promise you had made to me , and did not suffer yourself to be turned aside by vain shows ."
"You were skilled to perceive that the boy who tempted you to leave the temple was a teller of false tales , and took with a grateful heart what the poor had to offer you ."
"Last of all , difficulties gave you courage , instead of lending you despair ."
"And now , as to your reward , you shall in truth take your sister home with you , and your brothers I will restore to life ; but idle and unfaithful as they are their lot is to wander for ever ."
"And so farewell , and may wisdom be with you . '"
` First tell me your name ? '
asked Covan softly . '
"I am the Spirit of Age , ' said the old man ."
The Princess Bella-Flor -LSB- Taken from a Celtic Story .
Translated by Doctor Macleod Clarke . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons .
"When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country , and for many years no one heard anything about him ."
"Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father , who died at last in a good old age , leaving great riches behind him ."
"For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father 's wealth freely , believing that he alone remained to enjoy it ."
"But , one day , as he was coming down stairs , he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall , looking about as if the house belonged to him ."
` Have you forgotten me ? '
asked the man . '
"I ca n't forget a person I have never known , ' was the rude answer . '"
"I am your brother , ' replied the stranger , ` and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made ."
"And , what is worse , they tell me in the village that my father is dead ."
I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more . '
"` He died six months ago , ' said the rich brother , ` and he left you , as your portion , the old wooden chest that stands in the loft ."
That is not the way God works .
"But work He does , Miss Oliver , and in the end His purpose will be fulfilled . ''"
"`` Sound and orthodox -- sound and orthodox , '' muttered Susan approvingly in the kitchen ."
Susan liked to see Miss Oliver sat upon by the minister now and then .
"Susan was very fond of her but she thought Miss Oliver liked saying heretical things to ministers far too well , and deserved an occasional reminder that these matters were quite beyond her province ."
In May Walter wrote home that he had been awarded a D.C. Medal .
"He did not say what for , but the other boys took care that the Glen should know the brave thing Walter had done ."
"`` In any war but this , '' wrote Jerry Meredith , `` it would have meant a V.C. ."
But they ca n't make V.C. 's as common as the brave things done every day here . ''
"`` He should have had the V.C. , '' said Susan , and was very indignant over it ."
"She was not quite sure who was to blame for his not getting it , but if it were General Haig she began for the first time to entertain serious doubts as to his fitness for being Commander-in-Chief ."
Rilla was beside herself with delight .
"It was her dear Walter who had done this thing -- Walter , to whom someone had sent a white feather at Redmond -- it was Walter who had dashed back from the safety of the trench to drag in a wounded comrade who had fallen on No-man 's - land ."
"Oh , she could see his white beautiful face and wonderful eyes as he did it !"
What a thing to be the sister of such a hero !
And he had n't thought it worth while writing about .
His letter was full of other things -- little intimate things that they two had known and loved together in the dear old cloudless days of a century ago .
"`` I 've been thinking of the daffodils in the garden at Ingleside , '' he wrote ."
"`` By the time you get this they will be out , blowing there under that lovely rosy sky ."
"Are they really as bright and golden as ever , Rilla ?"
It seems to me that they must be dyed red with blood -- like our poppies here .
And every whisper of spring will be falling as a violet in Rainbow Valley .
"`` There is a young moon tonight -- a slender , silver , lovely thing hanging over these pits of torment ."
Will you see it tonight over the maple grove ?
"`` I 'm enclosing a little scrap of verse , Rilla ."
I wrote it one evening in my trench dug-out by the light of a bit of candle -- or rather it came to me there -- I did n't feel as if I were writing it -- something seemed to use me as an instrument .
"I 've had that feeling once or twice before , but very rarely and never so strongly as this time ."
That was why I sent it over to the London Spectator .
It printed it and the copy came today .
I hope you 'll like it .
It 's the only poem I 've written since I came overseas . ''
"The poem was a short , poignant little thing ."
Richard of Gloucester flushed .
"`` Mark it right well , '' he said , harshly ."
"`` I love not mercy , nor yet mercymongers ."
Ye have this day laid the foundations of high fortune .
"If ye oppose to me my word , which I have plighted , I will yield ."
"But , by the glory of heaven , there your favour dies !"
"`` Mine is the loss , '' said Dick ."
"`` Give him his sailor , '' said the duke ; and wheeling his horse , he turned his back upon young Shelton ."
Dick was nor glad nor sorry .
He had seen too much of the young duke to set great store on his affection ; and the origin and growth of his own favour had been too flimsy and too rapid to inspire much confidence .
One thing alone he feared -- that the vindictive leader might revoke the offer of the lances .
"But here he did justice neither to Gloucester 's honour -LRB- such as it was -RRB- nor , above all , to his decision ."
"If he had once judged Dick to be the right man to pursue Sir Daniel , he was not one to change ; and he soon proved it by shouting after Catesby to be speedy , for the paladin was waiting ."
"In the meanwhile , Dick turned to the old shipman , who had seemed equally indifferent to his condemnation and to his subsequent release ."
"`` Arblaster , '' said Dick , `` I have done you ill ; but now , by the rood , I think I have cleared the score . ''"
But the old skipper only looked upon him dully and held his peace .
"`` Come , '' continued Dick , `` a life is a life , old shrew , and it is more than ships or liquor ."
"Say ye forgive me ; for if your life be worth nothing to you , it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune ."
"Come , I have paid for it dearly ; be not so churlish . ''"
"`` An I had had my ship , '' said Arblaster , `` I would ` a ' been forth and safe on the high seas -- I and my man Tom ."
"But ye took my ship , gossip , and I 'm a beggar ; and for my man Tom , a knave fellow in russet shot him down ."
` Murrain ! '
"quoth he , and spake never again ."
"` Murrain ' was the last of his words , and the poor spirit of him passed . '"
"A will never sail no more , will my Tom . ' ''"
"Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity ; he sought to take the skipper 's hand , but Arblaster avoided his touch ."
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` let be ."
"Y ' have played the devil with me , and let that content you . ''"
The words died in Richard 's throat .
"He saw , through tears , the poor old man , bemused with liquor and sorrow , go shambling away , with bowed head , across the snow , and the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels , and for the first time began to understand the desperate game that we play in life ; and how a thing once done is not to be changed or remedied , by any penitence ."
But there was no time left to him for vain regret .
"Catesby had now collected the horsemen , and riding up to Dick he dismounted , and offered him his own horse ."
Dick bounded to his side and raised him .
His face desperately worked ; his whole body was shaken by contorting spasms .
`` Is the arrow black ? ''
he gasped .
"`` It is black , '' replied Dick , gravely ."
"And then , before he could add one word , a desperate seizure of pain shook the wounded man from head to foot , so that his body leaped in Dick 's supporting arms , and with the extremity of that pang his spirit fled in silence ."
"The young man laid him back gently on the snow and prayed for that unprepared and guilty spirit , and as he prayed the sun came up at a bound , and the robins began chirping in the ivy ."
"When he rose to his feet , he found another man upon his knees but a few steps behind him , and , still with uncovered head , he waited until that prayer also should be over ."
"It took long ; the man , with his head bowed and his face covered with his hands , prayed like one in a great disorder or distress of mind ; and by the bow that lay beside him , Dick judged that he was no other than the archer who had laid Sir Daniel low ."
"At length he , also , rose , and showed the countenance of Ellis Duckworth ."
"`` Richard , '' he said , very gravely , `` I heard you ."
"Ye took the better part and pardoned ; I took the worse , and there lies the clay of mine enemy ."
Pray for me . ''
And he wrung him by the hand .
"`` Sir , '' said Richard , `` I will pray for you , indeed ; though how I may prevail I wot not ."
"But if ye have so long pursued revenge , and find it now of such a sorry flavour , bethink ye , were it not well to pardon others ?"
"Hatch -- he is dead , poor shrew !"
"I would have spared a better ; and for Sir Daniel , here lies his body ."
"But for the priest , if I might anywise prevail , I would have you let him go . ''"
A flash came into the eyes of Ellis Duckworth .
"`` Nay , '' he said , `` the devil is still strong within me ."
But be at rest ; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore -- the fellowship is broken .
"They that still live shall come to their quiet and ripe end , in Heaven 's good time , for me ; and for yourself , go where your better fortune calls you , and think no more of Ellis . ''"
"CHAPTER VIII -- CONCLUSION About nine in the morning , Lord Foxham was leading his ward , once more dressed as befitted her sex , and followed by Alicia Risingham , to the church of Holywood , when Richard Crookback , his brow already heavy with cares , crossed their path and paused ."
`` Is this the maid ? ''
"he asked ; and when Lord Foxham had replied in the affirmative , `` Minion , '' he added , `` hold up your face until I see its favour . ''"
He looked upon her sourly for a little .
"`` Ye are fair , '' he said at last , `` and , as they tell me , dowered ."
"How if I offered you a brave marriage , as became your face and parentage ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Joanna , `` may it please your grace , I had rather wed with Sir Richard . ''"
`` How so ? ''
"he asked , harshly ."
I hung on to my blue straw sailor as long as I could .
How I hate the green velvet hat !
It is so elaborate and conspicuous .
I do n't see how I could ever have liked it .
But I vowed to wear it and wear it I will .
`` Shirley and I went down to the station this morning to take Little Dog Monday a bang-up Christmas dinner .
"Dog Monday waits and watches there still , with just as much hope and confidence as ever ."
Sometimes he hangs around the station house and talks to people and the rest of his time he sits at his little kennel door and watches the track unwinkingly .
We never try to coax him home now : we know it is of no use .
"When Jem comes back , Monday will come home with him ; and if Jem -- never comes back -- Monday will wait there for him as long as his dear dog heart goes on beating ."
`` Fred Arnold was here last night .
He was eighteen in November and is going to enlist just as soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have .
"He has been coming here very often lately and though I like him so much it makes me uncomfortable , because I am afraid he is thinking that perhaps I could care something for him ."
"I ca n't tell him about Ken -- because , after all , what is there to tell ?"
And yet I do n't like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be going away so soon .
It is very perplexing .
I remember I used to think it would be such fun to have dozens of beaux -- and now I 'm worried to death because two are too many .
`` I am learning to cook .
Susan is teaching me .
"I tried to learn long ago -- but no , let me be honest -- Susan tried to teach me , which is a very different thing ."
I never seemed to succeed with anything and I got discouraged .
But since the boys have gone away I wanted to be able to make cake and things for them myself and so I started in again and this time I 'm getting on surprisingly well .
"Susan says it is all in the way I hold my mouth and father says my subconscious mind is desirous of learning now , and I dare say they 're both right ."
"Anyhow , I can make dandy short-bread and fruitcake ."
"I got ambitious last week and attempted cream puffs , but made an awful failure of them ."
They came out of the oven flat as flukes .
I thought maybe the cream would fill them up again and make them plump but it did n't .
I think Susan was secretly pleased .
She is past mistress in the art of making cream puffs and it would break her heart if anyone else here could make them as well .
"I wonder if Susan tampered -- but no , I wo n't suspect her of such a thing ."
"`` Miranda Pryor spent an afternoon here a few days ago , helping me cut out certain Red Cross garments known by the charming name of ` vermin shirts . '"
"Susan thinks that name is not quite decent , so I suggested she call them ` cootie sarks , ' which is old Highland Sandy 's version of it ."
"`` It may be what it will , '' returned Dick ; `` and it must be as heaven please ."
"Reck we not a jot , but push on the livelier , and put it to the touch ."
"Up , friends -- enough breathed . ''"
"As they advanced , the snow became more and more trampled with hoof-marks , and it was plain that they were drawing near to the encampment of a considerable force of mounted men ."
"Presently they could see the smoke pouring from among the trees , ruddily coloured on its lower edge and scattering bright sparks ."
"And here , pursuant to Dick 's orders , his men began to open out , creeping stealthily in the covert , to surround on every side the camp of their opponents ."
"He himself , placing Alicia in the shelter of a bulky oak , stole straight forth in the direction of the fire ."
"At last , through an opening of the wood , his eye embraced the scene of the encampment ."
"The fire had been built upon a heathy hummock of the ground , surrounded on three sides by thicket , and it now burned very strong , roaring aloud and brandishing flames ."
"Around it there sat not quite a dozen people , warmly cloaked ; but though the neighbouring snow was trampled down as by a regiment , Dick looked in vain for any horse ."
He began to have a terrible misgiving that he was out-manoeuvred .
"At the same time , in a tall man with a steel salet , who was spreading his hands before the blaze , he recognised his old friend and still kindly enemy , Bennet Hatch ; and in two others , sitting a little back , he made out , even in their male disguise , Joanna Sedley and Sir Daniel 's wife ."
"`` Well , '' thought he to himself , `` even if I lose my horses , let me get my Joanna , and why should I complain ? ''"
"And then , from the further side of the encampment , there came a little whistle , announcing that his men had joined , and the investment was complete ."
"Bennet , at the sound , started to his feet ; but ere he had time to spring upon his arms , Dick hailed him ."
"`` Bennet , '' he said -- `` Bennet , old friend , yield ye ."
"Ye will but spill men 's lives in vain , if ye resist . '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , by St. Barbary ! ''"
cried Hatch .
`` Yield me ?
Ye ask much .
What force have ye ? ''
"`` I tell you , Bennet , ye are both outnumbered and begirt , '' said Dick ."
`` Caesar and Charlemagne would cry for quarter .
"I have two score men at my whistle , and with one shoot of arrows I could answer for you all . ''"
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` it goes against my heart ; but I must do my duty ."
The saints help you ! ''
And therewith he raised a little tucket to his mouth and wound a rousing call .
"Then followed a moment of confusion ; for while Dick , fearing for the ladies , still hesitated to give the word to shoot , Hatch 's little band sprang to their weapons and formed back to back as for a fierce resistance ."
"In the hurry of their change of place , Joanna sprang from her seat and ran like an arrow to her lover 's side ."
"`` Here , Dick ! ''"
"she cried , as she clasped his hand in hers ."
"`` Now , men , '' said he , `` do you hear me ? ''"
There was no answer from the forecastle .
"`` It 's to you , Abraham Gray -- it 's to you I am speaking . ''"
Still no reply .
"`` Gray , '' resumed Mr. Smollett , a little louder , `` I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain ."
"I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you 's as bad as he makes out ."
I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds to join me in . ''
There was a pause .
"`` Come , my fine fellow , '' continued the captain ; `` do n't hang so long in stays ."
I 'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second . ''
"There was a sudden scuffle , a sound of blows , and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek , and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle ."
"`` I 'm with you , sir , '' said he ."
"And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us , and we had shoved off and given way ."
"We were clear out of the ship , but not yet ashore in our stockade ."
17 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : The Jolly-boat 's Last Trip THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others .
"In the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded ."
"Five grown men , and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry ."
"Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags ."
The gunwale was lipping astern .
"Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards ."
"The captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly ."
"All the same , we were afraid to breathe ."
"In the second place , the ebb was now making -- a strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south ` ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning ."
"Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft , but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point ."
"If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs , where the pirates might appear at any moment ."
"`` I can not keep her head for the stockade , sir , '' said I to the captain ."
"I was steering , while he and Redruth , two fresh men , were at the oars ."
`` The tide keeps washing her down .
Could you pull a little stronger ? ''
"`` Not without swamping the boat , '' said he ."
"`` You must bear up , sir , if you please -- bear up until you see you 're gaining . ''"
"I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east , or just about right angles to the way we ought to go ."
Kettley was one such place ; it had come very lately into his clutches ; he still met with opposition from the tenants ; and it was to overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way .
"By two in the morning , Sir Daniel sat in the inn room , close by the fireside , for it was cold at that hour among the fens of Kettley ."
By his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale .
"He had taken off his visored headpiece , and sat with his bald head and thin , dark visage resting on one hand , wrapped warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak ."
"At the lower end of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay asleep on benches ; and somewhat nearer hand , a young lad , apparently of twelve or thirteen , was stretched in a mantle on the floor ."
The host of the Sun stood before the great man .
"`` Now , mark me , mine host , '' Sir Daniel said , `` follow but mine orders , and I shall be your good lord ever ."
"I must have good men for head boroughs , and I will have Adam-a-More high constable ; see to it narrowly ."
"If other men be chosen , it shall avail you nothing ; rather it shall be found to your sore cost ."
"For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take good measure -- you among the rest , mine host . ''"
"`` Good knight , '' said the host , `` I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion ."
"Nay , bully knight , I love not the rogue Walsinghams ; they were as poor as thieves , bully knight ."
Give me a great lord like you .
"Nay ; ask me among the neighbours , I am stout for Brackley . ''"
"`` It may be , '' said Sir Daniel , dryly ."
`` Ye shall then pay twice . ''
"The innkeeper made a horrid grimace ; but this was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times , and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily ."
"`` Bring up yon fellow , Selden ! ''"
cried the knight .
"And one of his retainers led up a poor , cringing old man , as pale as a candle , and all shaking with the fen fever ."
"`` Sirrah , '' said Sir Daniel , `` your name ? ''"
"`` A n't please your worship , '' replied the man , `` my name is Condall -- Condall of Shoreby , at your good worship 's pleasure . ''"
"`` I have heard you ill reported on , '' returned the knight ."
"`` Ye deal in treason , rogue ; ye trudge the country leasing ; y ' are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals ."
"How , fellow , are ye so bold ?"
But I will bring you down . ''
"`` Right honourable and my reverend lord , '' the man cried , `` here is some hodge-podge , saving your good presence ."
"I am but a poor private man , and have hurt none . ''"
"`` The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely , '' said the knight . ''"
"` Seize me , ' saith he , ` that Tyndal of Shoreby . ' ''"
"`` Condall , my good lord ; Condall is my poor name , '' said the unfortunate ."
"`` Condall or Tyndal , it is all one , '' replied Sir Daniel , coolly ."
Susan wandered by with a hoe in her hand and her second best bonnet on her head .
`` I have just finished reading a piece in the Enterprise which told of a couple being married in an aeroplane .
"Do you think it would be legal , doctor dear ? ''"
she inquired anxiously .
"`` I think so , '' said the doctor gravely ."
"`` Well , '' said Susan dubiously , `` it seems to me that a wedding is too solemn for anything so giddy as an aeroplane ."
But nothing is the same as it used to be .
"Well , it is half an hour yet before prayer-meeting time , so I am going around to the kitchen garden to have a little evening hate with the weeds ."
But all the time I am strafing them I will be thinking about this new worry in the Trentino .
"I do not like this Austrian caper , Mrs. Dr. dear . ''"
"`` Nor I , '' said Mrs. Blythe ruefully ."
`` All the forenoon I preserved rhubarb with my hands and waited for the war news with my soul .
When it came I shrivelled .
"Well , I suppose I must go and get ready for the prayer-meeting , too . ''"
"Every village has its own little unwritten history , handed down from lip to lip through the generations , of tragic , comic , and dramatic events ."
"They are told at weddings and festivals , and rehearsed around winter firesides ."
And in these oral annals of Glen St. Mary the tale of the union prayer-meeting held that night in the Methodist Church was destined to fill an imperishable place .
The union prayer-meeting was Mr. Arnold 's idea .
"The county battalion , which had been training all winter in Charlottetown , was to leave shortly for overseas ."
"The Four Winds Harbour boys belonging to it from the Glen and over-harbour and Harbour Head and Upper Glen were all home on their last leave , and Mr. Arnold thought , properly enough , that it would be a fitting thing to hold a union prayer-meeting for them before they went away ."
"Mr. Meredith having agreed , the meeting was announced to be held in the Methodist Church ."
"Glen prayer-meetings were not apt to be too well attended , but on this particular evening the Methodist Church was crowded ."
Everybody who could go was there .
Even Miss Cornelia came -- and it was the first time in her life that Miss Cornelia had ever set foot inside a Methodist Church .
It took no less than a world conflict to bring that about .
"`` I used to hate Methodists , '' said Miss Cornelia calmly , when her husband expressed surprise over her going , `` but I do n't hate them now ."
There is no sense in hating Methodists when there is a Kaiser or a Hindenburg in the world . ''
So Miss Cornelia went .
Norman Douglas and his wife went too .
"And Whiskers-on-the-moon strutted up the aisle to a front pew , as if he fully realized what a distinction he conferred upon the building ."
"People were somewhat surprised that he should be there , since he usually avoided all assemblages connected in any way with the war ."
"But Mr. Meredith had said that he hoped his session would be well represented , and Mr. Pryor had evidently taken the request to heart ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"you said you 'd take good care of me , '' he sighed , as the sun seemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden ."
`` Well I am taking good care of you as hard as I can .
"Do n't be cross , child ; I 'll go in a minute , '' said Nan , who considered five-year-old Robby a mere infant compared to herself ."
"So little Rob sat looking anxiously about him , and waiting patiently , for , spite of some misgivings , he felt great confidence in Nan ."
"`` I guess it 's going to be night pretty soon , '' he observed , as if to himself , as a mosquito bit him , and the frogs in a neighboring marsh began to pipe up for the evening concert ."
`` My goodness me !
so it is .
"Come right away this minute , or they will be gone , '' cried Nan , looking up from her work , and suddenly perceiving that the sun was down ."
"`` I heard a horn about an hour ago ; may be they were blowing for us , '' said Rob , trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill ."
`` Where was it ? ''
"asked Nan , stopping short ."
`` Over that way ; '' he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely wrong direction .
"`` Let 's go that way and meet them ; '' and Nan wheeled about , and began to trot through the bushes , feeling a trifle anxious , for there were so many cow-paths all about she could not remember which way they came ."
"On they went over stock and stone again , pausing now and then to listen for the horn , which did not blow any more , for it was only the moo of a cow on her way home ."
`` I do n't remember seeing that pile of stones do you ? ''
"asked Nan , as she sat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation ."
"`` I do n't remember any thing , but I want to go home , '' and Rob 's voice had a little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him gently down , saying , in her most capable way , `` I 'm going just as fast as I can , dear ."
"Do n't cry , and when we come to the road , I 'll carry you . ''"
`` Where is the road ? ''
and Robby wiped his eyes to look for it .
`` Over by that big tree .
Do n't you know that 's the one Ned tumbled out of ? ''
`` So it is .
May be they waited for us ; I 'd like to ride home would n't you ? ''
and Robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the great pasture .
"`` No , I 'd rather walk , '' answered Nan , feeling quite sure that she would be obliged to do so , and preparing her mind for it ."
"Another long trudge through the fast-deepening twilight and another disappointment , for when they reached the tree , they found to their dismay that it was not the one Ned climbed , and no road anywhere appeared ."
`` Are we lost ? ''
"quavered Rob , clasping his pail in despair ."
`` Not much .
"I do n't just see which way to go , and I guess we 'd better call . ''"
`` Mostly .
"Rather a neat job , I flatter myself . ''"
`` I should say so .
What a clever fellow you are !
Any new inventions lately ? ''
"asked Frank , coming up to examine and admire ."
"`` Only an anti-snoring machine and an elbow-pad , '' answered Ralph , with a twinkle in his eye , as if reminded of something funny ."
"`` Go on , and tell about them ."
I never heard of an anti-snorer .
"Jack better have one , '' said Frank , interested at once ."
"`` Well , a rich old lady kept her family awake with that lively music , so she sent to Shirtman and Codleff for something to stop it ."
"They thought it was a good joke , and told me to see what I could do ."
"I thought it over , and got up the nicest little affair you ever saw ."
"It went over the mouth , and had a tube to fit the ear , so when the lady snored she woke herself up and stopped it ."
It suited exactly .
"I think of taking out a patent , '' concluded Ralph , joining in the boys ' laugh at the droll idea ."
`` What was the pad ? ''
"asked Frank , returning to the small model of an engine he was making ."
"`` Oh , that was a mere trifle for a man who had a tender elbow-joint and wanted something to protect it ."
"I made a little pad to fit on , and his crazy-bone was safe . ''"
"`` I planned to have you make me a new leg if this one was spoilt , '' said Jack , sure that his friend could invent anything under the sun ."
`` I 'd do my best for you .
"I made a hand for a fellow once , and that got me my place , you know , '' answered Ralph , who thought little of such mechanical trifles , and longed to be painting portraits or modelling busts , being an artist as well as an inventor ."
"Here Gus , Ed , and several other boys came in , and the conversation became general ."
"Grif , Chick , and Brickbat were three young gentlemen whose own respectable names were usually ignored , and they cheerfully answered to these nicknames ."
"As the clock struck seven , Frank , who ruled the club with a rod of iron when Chairman , took his place behind the study table ."
"Seats stood about it , and a large , shabby book lay before Gus , who was Secretary , and kept the records with a lavish expenditure of ink , to judge by the blots ."
"The members took their seats , and nearly all tilted back their chairs and put their hands in their pockets , to keep them out of mischief ; for , as every one knows , it is impossible for two lads to be near each other and refrain from tickling or pinching ."
"Frank gave three raps with an old croquet-mallet set on a short handle , and with much dignity opened the meeting ."
"`` Gentlemen , the business of the club will be attended to , and then we will discuss the question , ` Shall girls go to our colleges ? '"
The Secretary will now read the report of the last meeting . ''
"Clearing his throat , Gus read the following brief and elegant report : -- `` Club met , December 18th , at the house of G. Burton , Esq. ."
"As for me , I had n't any real objection to marrying him , after all , for if he was short of romance he was good-natured and has a fat bank account ; but I hated to be driven into it that way ."
"`` You 'd better take him , Melissa , '' I said entreatingly ."
`` I 've had one husband and that is enough . ''
"`` More than enough for me , thank you , '' said Melissa sarcastically ."
"`` Isaac is a fine man and has a lovely house ; and you are n't sure the Kingsbridge man really means anything , '' I went on ."
"`` I would rather , '' said Melissa , with the same awful calmness , `` jump down from this roof and break my neck , or be devoured piecemeal by that fiend down there than marry Isaac Appleby . ''"
It did n't seem worth while to say anything more after that .
We sat there in stony silence and the time dragged by .
"I was hot , hungry , thirsty , cross ; and besides , I felt that I was in a ridiculous position , which was worse than all the rest ."
We could see Isaac sitting in the shade of one of his apple trees in the front orchard comfortably reading a newspaper .
I think if he had n't aggravated me by doing that I 'd have given in sooner .
"But as it was , I was determined to be as stubborn as everybody else ."
We were four obstinate creatures -- Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I .
At four o'clock Isaac got up and went into the house ; in a few minutes he came out again with a basket in one hand and a ball of cord in the other .
"`` I do n't intend to starve you , of course , ladies , '' he said politely , `` I will throw this ball up to you and you can then draw up the basket . ''"
"I caught the ball , for Melissa never turned her head ."
"I would have preferred to be scornful , too , and reject the food altogether ; but I was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride in my pocket and hauled the basket up ."
"Besides , I thought it might enable us to hold out until some loophole of escape presented itself ."
Isaac went back into the house and I unpacked the basket .
"There was a bottle of milk , some bread and butter , and a pie ."
"Melissa would n't take a morsel of the food , but she was so thirsty she had to take a drink of milk ."
"She tried to lift her veil -- and something caught ; Melissa gave it a savage twitch , and off came veil and hat -- and all her front hair !"
You never saw such a sight .
"I 'd always suspected Melissa wore a false front , but I 'd never had any proof before ."
"Melissa pinned on her hair again and put on her hat and drank the milk , all without a word ; but she was purple ."
I felt sorry for her .
And I felt sorry for Isaac when I tried to eat that bread .
It was sour and dreadful .
"As for the pie , it was hopeless ."
"I tasted it , and then threw it down to Julius Caesar ."
"Julius Caesar , not being over particular , ate it up ."
"I thought perhaps it would kill him , for anything might come of eating such a concoction ."
Make it up to him -- show him but this chance to become wealthy -- and I will go pledge he will forgive you . ''
"So far Dick had spoken pretty much at random ; but it was now necessary , under the supervision of six eyes , to invent and tell some marvellous story , and , if it were possible , get back into his hands the all-important signet ."
To squander time was the first necessity .
"The longer his stay lasted , the more would his captors drink , and the surer should he be when he attempted his escape ."
"Well , Dick was not much of an inventor , and what he told was pretty much the tale of Ali Baba , with Shoreby and Tunstall Forest substituted for the East , and the treasures of the cavern rather exaggerated than diminished ."
"As the reader is aware , it is an excellent story , and has but one drawback -- that it is not true ; and so , as these three simple shipmen now heard it for the first time , their eyes stood out of their faces , and their mouths gaped like codfish at a fishmonger 's ."
Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale was called for ; and while Dick was still artfully spinning out the incidents a third followed the second .
"Here was the position of the parties towards the end : Arblaster , three-parts drunk and one-half asleep , hung helpless on his stool ."
"Even Tom had been much delighted with the tale , and his vigilance had abated in proportion ."
"Meanwhile , Dick had gradually wormed his right arm clear of its bonds , and was ready to risk all ."
"`` And so , '' said Pirret , `` y ' are one of these ? ''"
"`` I was made so , '' replied Dick , `` against my will ; but an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share , I should be a fool indeed to continue dwelling in a filthy cave , and standing shot and buffet like a soldier ."
Here be we four ; good !
"Let us , then , go forth into the forest to-morrow ere the sun be up ."
"Could we come honestly by a donkey , it were better ; but an we can not , we have our four strong backs , and I warrant me we shall come home staggering . ''"
Pirret licked his lips .
"`` And this magic , '' he said -- `` this password , whereby the cave is opened -- how call ye it , friend ? ''"
"`` Nay , none know the word but the three chiefs , '' returned Dick ; `` but here is your great good fortune , that , on this very evening , I should be the bearer of a spell to open it ."
It is a thing not trusted twice a year beyond the captain 's wallet . ''
`` A spell ! ''
"said Arblaster , half awakening , and squinting upon Dick with one eye ."
`` Aroint thee !
no spells !
I be a good Christian .
"Ask my man Tom , else . ''"
"`` Nay , but this is white magic , '' said Dick ."
"`` It doth naught with the devil ; only the powers of numbers , herbs , and planets . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Pirret ; '' 't is but white magic , gossip ."
"There is no sin therein , I do assure you ."
"But proceed , good youth ."
This spell -- in what should it consist ? ''
"`` Nay , that I will incontinently show you , '' answered Dick ."
"Presently Wendy took the hat , because John said it struck against his knee as he flew ; and this , as we shall see , led to mischief , for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy ."
"In the black topper the light was completely hidden , and they flew on in silence ."
"It was the stillest silence they had ever known , broken once by a distant lapping , which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford , and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together , but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives ."
Even these noises ceased .
To Michael the loneliness was dreadful .
` If only something would make a sound ! '
he cried .
"As if in answer to his request , the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard ."
The pirates had fired Long Tom at them .
"The roar of it echoed through the mountains , and the echoes seemed to cry savagely , ` Where are they , where are they , where are they ? '"
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true .
"When at last the heavens were steady again , John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness ."
"John was treading the air mechanically , and Michael without knowing how to float was floating ."
` Are you shot ? '
John whispered tremulously . '
"I have n't tried yet , ' Michael whispered back ."
We know now that no one had been hit .
"Peter , however , had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea , while Wendy was blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell ."
It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat .
"I do n't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink , or whether she had planned it on the way , but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction ."
"Tink was not all bad : or , rather , she was all bad just now , but , on the other hand , sometimes she was all good ."
"Fairies have to be one thing or the other , because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time ."
"They are , however , allowed to change , only it must be a complete change ."
At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy .
"What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand , and I believe some of it was bad words , but it sounded kind , and she flew back and forward , plainly meaning ` Follow me , and all will be well . '"
What else could poor Wendy do ?
"She called to Peter and John and Michael , and got only mocking echoes in reply ."
She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman .
"And so , bewildered , and now staggering in her flight , she followed Tink to her doom ."
"CHAPTER V THE ISLAND COME TRUE Feeling that Peter was on his way back , the Neverland had again woke into life ."
"We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened , but woke is better and was always used by Peter ."
In his absence things are usually quiet on the island .
"`` This morning , '' he said , `` I was somewhat jealous of your favour ; it hath not been of a long growth ; and now , Sir Richard , it is with a very good heart that I offer you this horse -- to ride away with . ''"
"`` Suffer me yet a moment , '' replied Dick ."
`` This favour of mine -- whereupon was it founded ? ''
"`` Upon your name , '' answered Catesby ."
`` It is my lord 's chief superstition .
"Were my name Richard , I should be an earl to-morrow . ''"
"`` Well , sir , I thank you , '' returned Dick ; `` and since I am little likely to follow these great fortunes , I will even say farewell ."
"I will not pretend I was displeased to think myself upon the road to fortune ; but I will not pretend , neither , that I am over-sorry to be done with it ."
"Command and riches , they are brave things , to be sure ; but a word in your ear -- yon duke of yours , he is a fearsome lad . ''"
Catesby laughed .
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` of a verity he that rides with Crooked Dick will ride deep ."
"Well , God keep us all from evil !"
Speed ye well . ''
"Thereupon Dick put himself at the head of his men , and giving the word of command , rode off ."
"He made straight across the town , following what he supposed to be the route of Sir Daniel , and spying around for any signs that might decide if he were right ."
"The streets were strewn with the dead and the wounded , whose fate , in the bitter frost , was far the more pitiable ."
"Gangs of the victors went from house to house , pillaging and stabbing , and sometimes singing together as they went ."
"From different quarters , as he rode on , the sounds of violence and outrage came to young Shelton 's ears ; now the blows of the sledge-hammer on some barricaded door , and now the miserable shrieks of women ."
Dick 's heart had just been awakened .
He had just seen the cruel consequences of his own behaviour ; and the thought of the sum of misery that was now acting in the whole of Shoreby filled him with despair .
"At length he reached the outskirts , and there , sure enough , he saw straight before him the same broad , beaten track across the snow that he had marked from the summit of the church ."
"Here , then , he went the faster on ; but still , as he rode , he kept a bright eye upon the fallen men and horses that lay beside the track ."
"Many of these , he was relieved to see , wore Sir Daniel 's colours , and the faces of some , who lay upon their back , he even recognised ."
"About half-way between the town and the forest , those whom he was following had plainly been assailed by archers ; for the corpses lay pretty closely scattered , each pierced by an arrow ."
"And here Dick spied among the rest the body of a very young lad , whose face was somehow hauntingly familiar to him ."
"He halted his troop , dismounted , and raised the lad 's head ."
"As he did so , the hood fell back , and a profusion of long brown hair unrolled itself ."
At the same time the eyes opened .
`` Ah !
lion driver ! ''
said a feeble voice .
`` She is farther on .
If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died .
Now his son inherited all this money .
"He lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five-pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones ."
"In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did ."
"At last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown ."
His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him .
"But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message , ` Pack up ! ''"
"That was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself ."
"It was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly ."
"He pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away ."
"But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it !"
In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks .
"He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves , and then walked into the town ."
"He could do that quite well , for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers ."
He met a nurse with a little child .
` Halloa !
"you Turkish nurse , ' said he , ` what is that great castle there close to the town ?"
The one with the windows so high up ? '
"` The sultan 's daughter lives there , ' she replied ."
"` It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband , and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by . '"
"` Thank you , ' said the merchant 's son , and he went into the wood , sat himself in his trunk , flew on to the roof , and crept through the window into the princess 's room ."
"She was lying on the sofa asleep , and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her ."
"Then she woke up and was very much frightened , but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her , and that pleased her very much ."
"They sat close to each other , and he told her a story about her eyes ."
They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids .
"And her forehead was a snowy mountain , grand and shining ."
These were lovely stories .
"Then he asked the princess to marry him , and she said yes at once ."
"` But you must come here on Saturday , ' she said , ` for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me ."
They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks .
"But mind you have a really good story ready , for my parents like them immensely ."
"My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown , and my father likes something merry to make him laugh . '"
"asked Oliver Sloane , arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla ."
`` Have n't you heard ? ''
said Jane wrathfully .
"`` Well , its simply this ... Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green ... a deep , brilliant blue , the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows ."
"And Mrs. Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building , especially when combined with a red roof , that she ever saw or imagined ."
You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I heard it .
"It 's heartbreaking , after all the trouble we 've had . ''"
`` How on earth could such a mistake have happened ? ''
wailed Diana .
The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the Pyes .
The Improvers had decided to use Morton-Harris paints and the Morton-Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card .
A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number .
"Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr. Roger Pye sent word to the Improvers by his son , John Andrew , that he was going to town and would get their paint for them , the Improvers told John Andrew to tell his father to get 147 ."
"John Andrew always averred that he did so , but Mr. Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him 157 ; and there the matter stands to this day ."
That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an Improver lived .
The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it quenched even Davy .
Anne wept and would not be comforted .
"`` I must cry , even if I am almost seventeen , Marilla , '' she sobbed ."
`` It is so mortifying .
And it sounds the death knell of our society .
We 'll simply be laughed out of existence . ''
"In life , as in dreams , however , things often go by contraries ."
The Avonlea people did not laugh ; they were too angry .
Their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake .
Public indignation centered on the Pyes .
"Roger Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them ; and as for Joshua Pye , he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint ."
"Joshua Pye , when thus animadverted upon , retorted that the Avonlea taste in colors was no business of his , whatever his private opinion might be ; he had been hired to paint the hall , not to talk about it ; and he meant to have his money for it ."
"The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit , after consulting Mr. Peter Sloane , who was a magistrate ."
"`` You 'll have to pay it , '' Peter told him ."
"`` You ca n't hold him responsible for the mistake , since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead ."
But it 's a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful . ''
"The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them ; but instead , public sympathy veered around in their favor ."
"Y ' are called to count for this ; in the end , I wot not how , ye have ever the uppermost at law , and ye think all patched ."
"But give me leave , Sir Oliver : the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is but the angrier , and some day , when the black devil is by , he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards . ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , y ' are in the wrong ."
"Bennet , ye should be glad to be corrected , '' said Sir Oliver ."
"`` Y ' are a prater , Bennet , a talker , a babbler ; your mouth is wider than your two ears ."
"Mend it , Bennet , mend it . ''"
"`` Nay , I say no more ."
"Have it as ye list , '' said the retainer ."
"The priest now rose from the stool , and from the writing-case that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper , and a flint and steel ."
"With these he sealed up the chest and the cupboard with Sir Daniel 's arms , Hatch looking on disconsolate ; and then the whole party proceeded , somewhat timorously , to sally from the house and get to horse . ''"
"'T is time we were on the road , Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , as he held the priest 's stirrup while he mounted ."
"`` Ay ; but , Bennet , things are changed , '' returned the parson ."
`` There is now no Appleyard -- rest his soul !
-- to keep the garrison .
"I shall keep you , Bennet ."
I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows .
"` The arrow that flieth by day , ' saith the evangel ; I have no mind of the context ; nay , I am a sluggard priest , I am too deep in men 's affairs ."
"Well , let us ride forth , Master Hatch ."
The jackmen should be at the church by now . ''
"So they rode forward down the road , with the wind after them , blowing the tails of the parson 's cloak ; and behind them , as they went , clouds began to arise and blot out the sinking sun ."
"They had passed three of the scattered houses that make up Tunstall hamlet , when , coming to a turn , they saw the church before them ."
Ten or a dozen houses clustered immediately round it ; but to the back the churchyard was next the meadows .
"At the lych-gate , near a score of men were gathered , some in the saddle , some standing by their horses ' heads ."
"They were variously armed and mounted ; some with spears , some with bills , some with bows , and some bestriding plough-horses , still splashed with the mire of the furrow ; for these were the very dregs of the country , and all the better men and the fair equipments were already with Sir Daniel in the field ."
"`` We have not done amiss , praised be the cross of Holywood !"
"Sir Daniel will be right well content , '' observed the priest , inwardly numbering the troop ."
`` Who goes ?
Stand !
if ye be true ! ''
shouted Bennet .
"A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among the yews ; and at the sound of this summons he discarded all concealment , and fairly took to his heels for the forest ."
"The men at the gate , who had been hitherto unaware of the stranger 's presence , woke and scattered ."
"About a mile from Kettley , Dick came to one such break in the plain line of causeway , where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the eye ."
"The gap , besides , was more than usually long ; it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief ; and Dick bethought him , with something like a pang , of the lad whom he had so imperfectly directed ."
"As for himself , one look backward to where the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven -- one look forward to the high ground of Tunstall Forest , and he was sufficiently directed and held straight on , the water washing to his horse 's knees , as safe as on a highway ."
"Half-way across , and when he had already sighted the path rising high and dry upon the farther side , he was aware of a great splashing on his right , and saw a grey horse , sunk to its belly in the mud , and still spasmodically struggling ."
"Instantly , as though it had divined the neighbourhood of help , the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly ."
"It rolled , meanwhile , a blood-shot eye , insane with terror ; and as it sprawled wallowing in the quag , clouds of stinging insects rose and buzzed about it in the air ."
`` Alack ! ''
"thought Dick , `` can the poor lad have perished ?"
"There is his horse , for certain -- a brave grey !"
"Nay , comrade , if thou criest to me so piteously , I will do all man can to help thee ."
Shalt not lie there to drown by inches ! ''
"And he made ready his crossbow , and put a quarrel through the creature 's head ."
"Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy , somewhat sobered in spirit , and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor in the way ."
"`` I would I had dared to tell him further , '' he thought ; `` for I fear he has miscarried in the slough . ''"
"And just as he was so thinking , a voice cried upon his name from the causeway side , and , looking over his shoulder , he saw the lad 's face peering from a clump of reeds ."
`` Are ye there ? ''
"he said , reining in ."
`` Ye lay so close among the reeds that I had passed you by .
"I saw your horse bemired , and put him from his agony ; which , by my sooth !"
"an ye had been a more merciful rider , ye had done yourself ."
But come forth out of your hiding .
Here be none to trouble you . ''
"`` Nay , good boy , I have no arms , nor skill to use them if I had , '' replied the other , stepping forth upon the pathway ."
`` Why call me ` boy ' ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` Y ' are not , I trow , the elder of us twain . ''"
"`` Good Master Shelton , '' said the other , `` prithee forgive me ."
I have none the least intention to offend .
"Rather I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour , for I am now worse bested than ever , having lost my way , my cloak , and my poor horse ."
"To have a riding-rod and spurs , and never a horse to sit upon !"
"And before all , '' he added , looking ruefully upon his clothes -- `` before all , to be so sorrily besmirched ! ''"
`` Tut ! ''
Mr. Pryor 's once ruddy face was ashen .
But he turned at bay .
"`` I 'll have the law on you for this , '' he gasped ."
"`` Do -- do , '' roared Norman , making another rush ."
But Mr. Pryor was gone .
He had no desire to fall a second time into the hands of an avenging militarist .
"Norman turned to the platform for one graceless , triumphant moment ."
"`` Do n't look so flabbergasted , parsons , '' he boomed ."
`` You could n't do it -- nobody would expect it of the cloth -- but somebody had to do it .
You know you 're glad I threw him out -- he could n't be let go on yammering and yodelling and yawping sedition and treason .
Sedition and treason -- somebody had to deal with it .
I was born for this hour -- I 've had my innings in church at last .
I can sit quiet for another sixty years now !
"Go ahead with your meeting , parsons ."
I reckon you wo n't be troubled with any more pacifist prayers . ''
But the spirit of devotion and reverence had fled .
Both ministers realized it and realized that the only thing to do was to close the meeting quietly and let the excited people go .
"Mr. Meredith addressed a few earnest words to the boys in khaki -- which probably saved Mr. Pryor 's windows from a second onslaught -- and Mr. Arnold pronounced an incongruous benediction , at least he felt it was incongruous , for he could not at once banish from his memory the sight of gigantic Norman Douglas shaking the fat , pompous little Whiskers-on-the-moon as a huge mastiff might shake an overgrown puppy ."
And he knew that the same picture was in everybody 's mind .
Altogether the union prayer-meeting could hardly be called an unqualified success .
But it was remembered in Glen St. Mary when scores of orthodox and undisturbed assemblies were totally forgotten .
"`` You will never , no , never , Mrs. Dr. dear , hear me call Norman Douglas a pagan again , '' said Susan when she reached home ."
`` If Ellen Douglas is not a proud woman this night she should be . ''
"`` Norman Douglas did a wholly indefensible thing , '' said the doctor ."
`` Pryor should have been let severely alone until the meeting was over .
"Then later on , his own minister and session should deal with him ."
That would have been the proper procedure .
"Norman 's performance was utterly improper and scandalous and outrageous ; but , by George , '' -- the doctor threw back his head and chuckled , `` by George , Anne-girl , it was satisfying . ''"
"CHAPTER XXI `` LOVE AFFAIRS ARE HORRIBLE '' Ingleside 20th June 1916 `` We have been so busy , and day after day has brought such exciting news , good and bad , that I have n't had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks ."
"I like to keep it up regularly , for father says a diary of the years of the war should be a very interesting thing to hand down to one 's children ."
"The trouble is , I like to write a few personal things in this blessed old book that might not be exactly what I 'd want my children to read ."
I feel that I shall be a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than I am for myself !
Next moment I was face to face with Anderson .
"He roared aloud , and his hanger went up above his head , flashing in the sunlight ."
"I had not time to be afraid , but as the blow still hung impending , leaped in a trice upon one side , and missing my foot in the soft sand , rolled headlong down the slope ."
"When I had first sallied from the door , the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us ."
"One man , in a red night-cap , with his cutlass in his mouth , had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across ."
"Well , so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture , the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over , another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade ."
"And yet , in this breath of time , the fight was over and the victory was ours ."
"Gray , following close behind me , had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow ."
"Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony , the pistol still smoking in his hand ."
"A third , as I had seen , the doctor had disposed of at a blow ."
"Of the four who had scaled the palisade , one only remained unaccounted for , and he , having left his cutlass on the field , was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him ."
`` Fire -- fire from the house ! ''
cried the doctor .
"`` And you , lads , back into cover . ''"
"But his words were unheeded , no shot was fired , and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood ."
"In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen , four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade ."
The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter .
"The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets , and at any moment the fire might recommence ."
"The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke , and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory ."
"Hunter lay beside his loophole , stunned ; Joyce by his , shot through the head , never to move again ; while right in the centre , the squire was supporting the captain , one as pale as the other ."
"`` The captain 's wounded , '' said Mr. Trelawney ."
`` Have they run ? ''
asked Mr. Smollett .
"`` All that could , you may be bound , '' returned the doctor ; `` but there 's five of them will never run again . ''"
`` Five ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Come , that 's better ."
Five against three leaves us four to nine .
That 's better odds than we had at starting .
"We were seven to nineteen then , or thought we were , and that 's as bad to bear . ''"
"* * The mutineers were soon only eight in number , for the man shot by Mr. Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound ."
"But this was , of course , not known till after by the faithful party ."
She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens .
The stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks .
"`` I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in that fashion for a handful of seaweeds , '' he said ."
"`` I have n't the faintest idea what you mean , '' said Miss Rangely ."
"`` You do n't look crazy , but you talk as if you were . ''"
`` Do you mean to say you do n't know that what the people hereabouts call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point -- the most dangerous spot along the whole coast ? ''
"`` No , I did n't , '' said Katherine , horrified ."
"She remembered now that Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along shore , but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it to be in quite another direction ."
`` I am a stranger here . ''
"`` Well , I hardly thought you 'd be foolish enough to be out there if you knew , '' said the other in mollified accents ."
"`` The place ought not to be left without warning , anyhow ."
It is the most careless thing I ever heard of .
There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever been able to find the bottom of it .
A person who got into it would never be heard of again .
The rocks there form an eddy that sucks everything right down . ''
"`` I am very grateful to you for calling me in , '' said Katherine humbly ."
`` I had no idea I was in such danger . ''
"`` You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds , I see , '' said the unknown ."
But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds .
"She suddenly realized what she must look like -- bare feet , draggled skirts , dripping arms ."
And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was undoubtedly a gentleman .
"Oh , if he would only go and give her a chance to put on her shoes and stockings !"
Nothing seemed further from his intentions .
"When Katherine had picked up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward , he walked beside her , still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly accustomed to walking with barefooted young women ."
"In spite of herself , Katherine could n't help listening to him , for he managed to invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest ."
"She finally decided that as he did n't seem to mind her bare feet , she would n't either ."
He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly amateurish beside him .
He looked over her specimens and pointed out the valuable ones .
"He explained the best method of preserving and mounting them , and told her of other and less dangerous places along the shore where she might get some new varieties ."
"When they came in sight of Harbour Hill , Katherine began to wonder what on earth she would do with him ."
"It was n't exactly permissible to snub a man who had practically saved your life , but , on the other hand , the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated ."
The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself .
Then I tell myself ` mere coincidence ' -- ` subconscious memory ' and so forth . ''
"`` I do not see how any memory could remember a thing before it was ever said at all , '' persisted Susan , `` though of course I am not educated like you and the doctor ."
"I would rather not be , if it makes anything as simple as that so hard to believe ."
"But in any case we need not worry over Verdun , even if the Huns get it ."
Joffre says it has no military significance . ''
"`` That old sop of comfort has been served up too often already when reverses came , '' retorted Gertrude ."
`` It has lost its power to charm . ''
`` Was there ever a battle like this in the world before ? ''
"said Mr. Meredith , one evening in mid-April ."
"`` It 's such a titanic thing we ca n't grasp it , '' said the doctor ."
`` What were the scraps of a few Homeric handfuls compared to this ?
The whole Trojan war might be fought around a Verdun fort and a newspaper correspondent would give it no more than a sentence .
I am not in the confidence of the occult powers '' -- the doctor threw Gertrude a twinkle -- `` but I have a hunch that the fate of the whole war hangs on the issue of Verdun .
"As Susan and Joffre say , it has no real military significance ; but it has the tremendous significance of an Idea ."
If Germany wins there she will win the war .
"If she loses , the tide will set against her . ''"
"`` Lose she will , '' said Mr. Meredith : emphatically ."
`` The Idea can not be conquered .
France is certainly very wonderful .
It seems to me that in her I see the white form of civilization making a determined stand against the black powers of barbarism .
I think our whole world realizes this and that is why we all await the issue so breathlessly .
It is n't merely the question of a few forts changing hands or a few miles of blood-soaked ground lost and won . ''
"`` I wonder , '' said Gertrude dreamily , `` if some great blessing , great enough for the price , will be the meed of all our pain ?"
Is the agony in which the world is shuddering the birth-pang of some wondrous new era ?
Or is it merely a futile struggle of ants In the gleam of a million million of suns ?
"We think very lightly , Mr. Meredith , of a calamity which destroys an ant-hill and half its inhabitants ."
Does the Power that runs the universe think us of more importance than we think ants ? ''
"`` You forget , '' said Mr. Meredith , with a flash of his dark eyes , `` that an infinite Power must be infinitely little as well as infinitely great ."
"We are neither , therefore there are things too little as well as too great for us to apprehend ."
To the infinitely little an ant is of as much importance as a mastodon .
"We are witnessing the birth-pangs of a new era -- but it will be born a feeble , wailing life like everything else ."
I am not one of those who expect a new heaven and a new earth as the immediate result of this war .
But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements .
"If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade , he argued , they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold ."
Nor had we much time left to us for thought .
"Suddenly , with a loud huzza , a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade ."
"At the same moment , the fire was once more opened from the woods , and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor 's musket into bits ."
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys .
"Squire and Gray fired again and yet again ; three men fell , one forwards into the enclosure , two back on the outside ."
"But of these , one was evidently more frightened than hurt , for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees ."
"Two had bit the dust , one had fled , four had made good their footing inside our defences , while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men , each evidently supplied with several muskets , kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house ."
"The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building , shouting as they ran , and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them ."
"Several shots were fired , but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect ."
"In a moment , the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us ."
"The head of Job Anderson , the boatswain , appeared at the middle loophole ."
"`` At 'em , all hands -- all hands ! ''"
he roared in a voice of thunder .
"At the same moment , another pirate grasped Hunter 's musket by the muzzle , wrenched it from his hands , plucked it through the loophole , and with one stunning blow , laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor ."
"Meanwhile a third , running unharmed all around the house , appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor ."
Our position was utterly reversed .
"A moment since we were firing , under cover , at an exposed enemy ; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow ."
"The log-house was full of smoke , to which we owed our comparative safety ."
"Cries and confusion , the flashes and reports of pistol-shots , and one loud groan rang in my ears ."
"`` Out , lads , out , and fight 'em in the open !"
Cutlasses ! ''
cried the captain .
"I snatched a cutlass from the pile , and someone , at the same time snatching another , gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt ."
I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight .
"Someone was close behind , I knew not whom ."
"Right in front , the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill , and just as my eyes fell upon him , beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face ."
"`` Round the house , lads !"
Round the house ! ''
"cried the captain ; and even in the hurly-burly , I perceived a change in his voice ."
"Mechanically , I obeyed , turned eastwards , and with my cutlass raised , ran round the corner of the house ."
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""
Loving Laili
"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
"""I think,"" remarked a Red-headed Woodpecker, ""that I have the best wing feathers now that I ever had. They seem to be a little longer, and they hook together so well. I almost wish I were going South to try them on a long journey."""
"""Mr. Woodpecker's wing feathers are certainly excellent,"" said his wife, who was always glad to see him well dressed. ""I am sure that the strongest wind will never part them. I don't see how the Owls can stand it to wear their feathers unhooked so that some of the air passes through their wings each time they flap them. It must make flying hard."""
"""Well, if you were an Owl you would understand,"" chuckled the Crow. ""If their great wings were like ours, the noise of their flying would scare every creature within hearing, and there would not be much fun in hunting."""
"And so they chatted on, while from the meadow came the sound of the happy insects piping in the sunshine. It was chilly now at night and in the early morning, and they could give concerts only at noonday. The next day the Wild Turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. The Squirrels were busier than ever storing up all the acorns that they could before the newcomers reached the oak trees; and the Blue Jays were so jealous of the Turkeys that they overate every day for fear there would not be enough to go around. As though there were any danger!"
"The Ground Hog was getting so sleepy now that he would doze off while people were talking to him, and then he would suddenly straighten up and say: ""Yes, yes, yes! Don't think that I was asleep, please. The colors of the trees are so bright that they tire my eyes and I sometimes close them."" The dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding."
"The Snakes, too, were growing dull and slow of motion, while the Bats talked freely of hanging themselves up for the winter. The Grouse and Quail made daily trips to the edges of the grain-fields, and found rich picking among the stubble. You could almost fancy that they came home each night fatter than when they went away in the morning."
"Life went on in this way for many days, and the birds had all stopped singing. There were no more happy concerts at sunrise and no more carols at evening; only chirrupings and twitterings as the feathered people hopped restlessly from one perch to another. All could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. The truth was that each bird who was not to spend the winter in the Forest felt as though something were drawing drawing drawing him southward. It was something they could not see or hear, and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. They spoke of it often to each other, and the older birds told the young ones how, before long, they would all start South, and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home."
"""How do we know where to go?"" asked the children."
"""All that you have to do,"" the older ones said, ""is to follow us."""
"""And how do you know?"" they asked."
"""Why, we have been there before,"" they answered; ""and we can see the places over which we pass. But perhaps that is not the real reason, for sometimes we fly over such great stretches of water that we can see nothing else and it all looks alike. Then we cannot see which way to go, but still we feel that we are drawn South, and we only have to think about that and fly onward. The fathers and sons can fly the faster and will reach there first. The mothers and daughters come a few days later."
"We never make a mistake."""
"""It is wonderful, wonderful,"" thought a young Rabbit on the grass below."
"""I must watch them when they go."""
"The very next morning the Forest People awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red, brown, and yellow leaves from the trees. Over the river and all the lowland near it hung a heavy veil of white mist."
"""It is time!"" whispered the Robins to each other."
"""It is time!"" cooed the Mourning Doves."
"""It is time!"" cried the Cowbirds in their hoarse voices."
"All through the forest there was restlessness and quiet haste. The Juncoes had already come from the cold northland and were resting from their long flight. The Ground Hogs, the Rabbits, and the Squirrels were out to say good-by. The Owls peeped from their hollow trees, shading their eyes from the strong light of the sun. And then the travellers went. The Robins started in family parties. The Mourning Doves slipped quietly away. The Cowbirds went in a dashing crowd. And the Crows, after much talking and disputing on the tree-tops, took a noisy farewell of the few members of the flock who were to remain behind, and, joining other flocks from the North, flew off in a great company which darkened the sky and caused a shadow to pass over the stubble-field almost like that of a summer cloud."
"""They are gone!"" sighed the Ground Hog and his wife. ""We shall miss them sadly. Well, we can dream about them, and that will be a comfort."""
"""Jay! Jay!"" shrieked a handsome-crested fellow from the tree above."
"""What if they are gone? They will be back in the spring, and we have plenty to eat. What is the use of feeling sad? Jay! Jay!"""
"But all people are not so heartless as the hungry Blue Jays, and the song-birds had many loving friends who missed them and longed for their return."
THE RUFFED GROUSE'S STORY
"The Ruffed Grouse cocked his crested head on one side and looked up through the bare branches to the sky. It was a soft gray, and in the west were banks of bluish clouds. ""I think it will snow very soon,"" said he. ""Mrs. Grouse, are the children all ready for cold weather?"""
"""All ready,"" answered his cheerful little wife. ""They have had their thickest feathers on for quite a while. The Rabbits were saying the other day that they had never seen a plumper or better clothed flock than ours."" And her beautiful golden-brown eyes shone with pride as she spoke."
"Indeed, the young Ruffed Grouse were a family of whom she might well be proud. Twelve healthy and obedient children do not fall to the lot of every Forest mother, and she wished with a sad little sigh that her other two eggs had hatched. She often thought of them with longing. How lovely it would have been to have fourteen children! But at that moment her brood came crowding around her in fright."
"""Some cold white things,"" they said, ""came tumbling down upon us and scared us. The white things didn't say a word, but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. Tell us what to do. Must we hide?"""
"""Why, that is snow!"" exclaimed their mother. ""It drops from the clouds up yonder quite as the leaves drop from the trees in the fall. It will not hurt you, but we must find shelter."""
"""What did I tell you, Mrs Grouse?"" asked her husband. ""I was certain that it would snow before night. I felt it in my quills."" And Mr. Grouse strutted with importance. It always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen."
"""How did you feel it in your quills?"" asked one of his children. ""Shall I feel it in my quills when I am as old as you are?"""
"But alas! he went out to die. In one battle, a small band of the English bravely attacked a large army of their enemies. The horse which Sidney was riding was killed under him, and as he mounted another, he was shot in the leg, and his thigh-bone was broken. The horse took fright and galloped away from the fight, but its wounded and bleeding rider held to his seat, and when he reached a place of safety was lifted from his horse, and gently laid upon the ground. He was faint from loss of blood, and in great pain, and his throat was parched with thirst."
"""Bring me water,"" said he to a friend."
"This was not easy to do, for there was not a stream near at hand, and in order to get to one it would be necessary to pass where the shot from the enemy's cannons was falling fast. But his friend was brave and went through the danger. Then he found some water, and brought it to him."
"Sidney eagerly held out his hand for the cup, and as he was preparing to drink, another poor wounded soldier was carried past. This man was dying; he could not speak, but he looked with longing eyes at the water."
"Sir Philip saw the look, and taking the cup from his own lips, passed it to the soldier, saying: ""Thy need is greater than mine."" The poor man quenched his thirst, and blessed him as he died."
"Sir Philip lived on for a few weeks, growing weaker every day, but he never came back to his own land, and the many friends who loved him."
"Sidney was great in many ways; very fair to see, very wise and good, and very clever and witty. He was one of the bravest fighters, one of the finest poets, and one of the best gentlemen who ever lived. He will always be remembered for his brave deeds, and his wise sayings, but most of all do men bless his name for this act of kindness to his poor dying comrade."
"The ""Revenge"""
"In the days of Queen Elizabeth, English sailors first began to find their way across the seas to new lands, from which they brought home many strange, and rich, and beautiful things. The Spaniards sailed across the seas too, to fetch gold and silver from the mines in Mexico, which belonged to the King of Spain. Sometimes the English ships met the Spanish ones, and robbed them of their gold, for it was thought quite right and fair in those days to take every chance of doing harm to the enemies of England. Of course the Spaniards hated the English for this, and whenever they met English ships which were weaker than theirs they attacked them, and robbed them, killing the sailors, or taking them prisoners."
"Once, a small ship, called the Revenge, was sailing home to England, when it met with fifty great Spanish vessels. The captain of the Revenge was Sir Richard Grenville, and he had a great many sick men on board. There was no time to escape from the Spanish ships, which soon surrounded the little Revenge. So there were only two courses which Sir Richard could take. One was to give up his ship to the Spaniards; the other was to fight with them till his men were all killed, or his ship sank."
"Some of the sailors wished him to take the first course, but the others, and all the sick men, said: ""Nay, let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of Spain."" This they said because they thought it better to die, than to be made prisoners by the cruel Spaniards."
"Sir Richard made up his mind to fight. It was after noon when the firing began, and all night long, until daylight came, the little English ship kept the fifty Spanish vessels at bay. Then it was found that all the powder was gone, and all the English were dead or dying."
"And then only was the flag of the Revenge pulled down, to show that she surrendered to her enemies."
"The brave Sir Richard was taken on board a Spanish ship, where he soon died of his wounds."
"These were his last words: ""Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind, for I have ended my life as a good soldier ought. I have fought for my country and my queen, for honour, and for God."""
The Pilgrim Fathers
"There was a time when the people of England were not allowed to pray to God in the way they thought right, but were punished if they did not worship as the king ordered. This was very hard, and when James I was king, a little band of brave people, who found that they could not obey the king, left their country to make a new home across the sea, where they could be free. They are called the ""Pilgrim Fathers""."
"A hundred people men, women, and children set sail in a little ship called the Mayflower for the new world which a great explorer called Columbus had discovered away in the west, and which we now call America."
"They had a long and stormy voyage, but at last, in mid-winter, they landed on the shores of North America, and set up their huts."
"At first they had much trouble, for the ground was frozen and barren."
"They suffered from hunger and sickness, and the wild Indians who lived in that land came down upon them and tried to drive them away. But the Pilgrim Fathers did not lose courage. They were free, and they worked hard, and waited in patience for brighter days. By and by other ships from England brought food to keep them alive, and more people to help them. Then they made friends with the Indians, and when spring came they planted seeds and grew crops for themselves."
"After a time many other Englishmen, who wished to be free, followed the Pilgrim Fathers, and settled in America. They founded the colonies of New England, which are now a part of the United States."
Guy Fawkes
"In the time of James I, many of the English people were very hardly treated because of their religion. At last they could bear the ill-usage no longer, and they thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen and their eldest son."
"Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a cellar under the Parliament House, where James was to meet his lords and commons on November 5; and a man named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at the right time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it."
"All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that a friend of his would be at the meeting next day. As he did not wish him to be killed, he sent him a letter, without signing his name, saying: ""Do not go to the House, for there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not see who hurts them""."
"The lord who received this letter took it to the King's Council, and when King James saw it, he guessed what the ""sudden blow"" would be. Men were sent to search the cellars, and there, on the very night before the deed was to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time should come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly tortured to make him tell all he knew, but he was a brave man, and he died without betraying his friends."
"Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November, bonfires have been lighted in many places in England, and ""guys"" burned, to remind people how an English king was once saved from a great danger."
repeated Punchkin.
"""Not so fast, my master,"" rejoined the Prince; ""I must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."""
"The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried, in an imploring voice, ""Give me my parrot!"" the whole garden became suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before, stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses, and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's right arm fell off."
"Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, ""Give me my parrot!"""
"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's left arm tumbled off."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off:"
"the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's left."
"Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, ""Give me my parrot!"" ""Take your parrot, then,"" cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!"
"Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own house."
The Broken Pot
"There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was Svabhavakripana, which means ""a born miser."" He had collected a quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he thought, ""Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman."
"When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she, distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and give her such a kick with my foot."" While he thought this, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and made him quite white. Therefore, I say, ""He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the father of Somasarman."""
The Magic Fiddle
"Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family."
"It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, ""She does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time."" They then called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, ""At midday when our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear. In this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own."""
"At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her, and she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to rise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it would not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and cry to her brother:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began to wail again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then she cried aloud:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water measures a man's height,     Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill."""
"The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was drowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and carried her off."
"After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing it, said to himself, ""This will make a splendid fiddle."" So one day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the bamboo called out, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up."" When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, ""Do not cut near the top, cut at the root."" When the Jogi again prepared himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up;"" and when he was about to cut higher up, it again called out to him, ""Do not cut high up, cut at the root."" The Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away made a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went a-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned home every evening with a full wallet."
"He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly."
"""Nay, but you have been in here,"" said he; ""and now you shall lose your life."""
"Then the lad begged and prayed so hard that he got off with his life, but the man gave him a good thrashing. And when it was over, they were as good friends as ever."
"Some time after the man set off again, and said he should be away fourteen days; but before he went he forbade the lad to go into any of the rooms he had not been in before; as for that he had been in, he might go into that, and welcome. Well, it was the same story over again, except that the lad stood out eight days before he went in. In this room, too, he saw nothing but a shelf over the door, and a big stone, and a pitcher of water on it. Well, after all, there's not much to be afraid of my seeing here, thought the lad."
"But when the man came back, he asked if he had been into any of the rooms. No, the lad hadn't done anything of the kind."
"""Well, well; I'll soon see that,"" said the man; and when he saw the lad had been in them after all, he said:"
"""Ah! now I'll spare you no longer; now you must lose your life."""
"But the lad begged and prayed for himself again, and so this time too he got off with stripes; though he got as many as his skin would carry. But when he got sound and well again, he led just as easy a life as ever, and he and the man were just as good friends."
"So a while after the man was to take another journey, and now he said he should be away three weeks, and he forbade the lad anew to go into the third room, for if he went in there he might just make up his mind at once to lose his life. Then after fourteen days the lad couldn't bear it, but crept into the room, but he saw nothing at all in there but a trap door on the floor; and when he lifted it up and looked down, there stood a great copper cauldron which bubbled up and boiled away down there; but he saw no fire under it."
"""Well, I should just like to know if it's hot,"" thought the lad, and struck his finger down into the broth, and when he pulled it out again, lo! it was gilded all over. So the lad scraped and scrubbed it, but the gilding wouldn't go off, so he bound a piece of rag round it; and when the man came back, and asked what was the matter with his finger, the lad said he'd given it such a bad cut. But the man tore off the rag, and then he soon saw what was the matter with the finger."
"First he wanted to kill the lad outright, but when he wept, and begged, he only gave him such a thrashing that he had to keep his bed three days. After that the man took down a pot from the wall, and rubbed him over with some stuff out of it, and so the lad was as sound and fresh as ever."
"So after a while the man started off again, and this time he was to be away a month. But before he went, he said to the lad, if he went into the fourth room he might give up all hope of saving his life."
"Well, the lad stood out for two or three weeks, but then he couldn't hold out any longer; he must and would go into that room, and so in he stole. There stood a great black horse tied up in a stall by himself, with a manger of red-hot coals at his head and a truss of hay at his tail. Then the lad thought this all wrong, so he changed them about, and put the hay at his head. Then said the Horse:"
"""Since you are so good at heart as to let me have some food, I'll set you free, that I will. For if the Troll comes back and finds you here, he'll kill you outright. But now you must go up to the room which lies just over this, and take a coat of mail out of those that hang there; and mind, whatever you do, don't take any of the bright ones, but the most rusty of all you see, that's the one to take; and sword and saddle you must choose for yourself just in the same way."""
So the lad did all that; but it was a heavy load for him to carry them all down at once.
"When he came back, the Horse told him to pull off his clothes and get into the cauldron which stood and boiled in the other room, and bathe himself there. ""If I do,"" thought the lad, ""I shall look an awful fright;"" but for all that, he did as he was told. So when he had taken his bath, he became so handsome and sleek, and as red and white as milk and blood, and much stronger than he had been before."
"""Do you feel any change?"" asked the Horse."
"""Yes,"" said the lad."
"""Try and lift me, then,"" said the Horse."
"Oh yes! he could do that, and as for the sword, he brandished it like a feather."
"""Now saddle me,"" said the Horse, ""and put on the coat of mail, and then take the bramble-bush rod, and the stone, and the pitcher of water, and the pot of ointment, and then we'll be off as fast as we can."""
"So when the lad had got on the horse, off they went at such a rate, he couldn't at all tell how they went. But when he had ridden awhile, the Horse said, ""I think I hear a noise; look round! can you see anything?"""
"""Yes; there are ever so many coming after us, at least a score,"" said the lad."
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll coming,"" said the Horse; ""now he's after us with his pack."""
"So they rode on a while, until those who followed were close behind them."
"""Now throw your bramble-bush rod behind you, over your shoulder,"" said the Horse; ""but mind you throw it a good way off my back."""
"So the lad did that, and all at once a close, thick bramblewood grew up behind them. So the lad rode on a long, long time, while the Troll and his crew had to go home to fetch something to hew their way through the wood. But at last the Horse said again:"
"""Look behind you! can you see anything now?"""
"""Yes, ever so many,"" said the lad, ""as many as would fill a large church."""
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll and his crew,"" said the Horse; ""now he's got more to back him; but now throw down the stone, and mind you throw it far behind me."""
"And as soon as the lad did what the Horse said, up rose a great black hill of rock behind him. So the Troll had to be off home to fetch something to mine his way through the rock; and while the Troll did that, the lad rode a good bit further on. But still the Horse begged him to look behind him, and then he saw a troop like a whole army behind him, and they glistened in the sunbeams."
"""Aye, aye,"" said the Horse, ""that's the Troll, and now he's got his whole band with him, so throw the pitcher of water behind you, but mind you don't spill any of it upon me."""
"President Lincoln was not admired by a class of people in the North and South who heard with horror that he had at one time worked for ten dollars a month. They thought the President's salary too much for him, and feared that he would buy watermelons with it. They also feared that some day he might tell a funny story in the presence of Queen Victoria."
The snobocracy could hardly sleep nights for fear that Lincoln at a state dinner might put sugar and cream in his cold consommé.
"Jefferson Davis, it was said, knew more of etiquette in a minute than Lincoln knew all his life."
"The capture of Sumter united the North and unified the South. It made ""war Democrats"" i.e., Democrats who had voted against Lincoln join him in the prosecution of the war. More United States property was cheerfully appropriated by the Confederacy, which showed that it was alive and kicking from the very first minute it was born."
"Confederate troops were sent into Virginia and threatened the Capitol at Washington, and would have taken it if the city had not, in summer, been regarded as unhealthful."
"The Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, hurrying to the capital, was attacked in Baltimore and several men were killed. This was the first actual bloodshed in the civil war which caused rivers and lakes and torrents of the best blood of North and South to cover the fair, sweet clover fields and blue-grass meadows made alone for peace."
"The general opinion of the author, thirty-five years afterwards, is that the war was as unavoidable as the deluge, and as idiotic in its incipiency as Adam's justly celebrated defence in the great ""Apple Sass Case."""
"Men will fight until it is educated out of them, just as they will no doubt retain rudimentary tails and live in trees till they know better."
It's all owing to how a man was brought up.
"Of course after we have been drawn into the fight and been fined and sent home, we like to maintain that we were fighting for our home, or liberty, or the flag, or something of the kind. We hate to admit that, as a nation, we fought and paid for it afterwards with our family's bread-money just because we were irritated. That's natural; but most great wars are arranged by people who stay at home and sell groceries to the widow and orphan and old maids at one hundred per cent. advance."
"Arlington Heights and Alexandria were now seized and occupied by the Union troops for the protection of Washington, and mosquito-wires were put up in the Capitol windows to keep the largest of the rebels from coming in and biting Congress."
"Fort Monroe was garrisoned by a force under General Benjamin F. Butler, and an expedition was sent out against Big Bethel. On the way the Federal troops fired into each other, which pleased the Confederates very much indeed. The Union troops were repulsed with loss, and went back to the fort, where they stated that they were disappointed in the war."
"West Virginia was strongly for the Union in sentiment, and was set off from the original State of Virginia, and, after some fighting the first year of the war over its territory, came into line with the Northern States. The fighting here was not severe. Generals McClellan and Rosecrans (Union) and Lee (Confederate) were the principal commanders."
"The first year of the war was largely spent in sparring for wind, as one very able authority has it."
"In the next chapter reference will be made to the battle of Bull Run, and the odium will be placed where it belongs. The author reluctantly closes this chapter in order to go out and get some odium for that purpose."
CHAPTER XXV.
BULL RUN AND OTHER BATTLES.
"On the 21st of July, 1861, occurred the battle of Bull Run, under the joint management of General Irwin McDowell and General P. G. T."
"Beauregard. After a sharp conflict, the Confederates were repulsed, but rallied again under General T. J. Jackson, called thereafter Stonewall Jackson. While the Federals were striving to beat Jackson back, troops under Generals Early and Kirby Smith from Manassas Junction were hurled against their flank.[5] McDowell's men retreated, and as they reached the bridge a shell burst among their crowded and chaotic numbers. A caisson was upset, and a panic ensued, many of the troops continuing at a swift canter till they reached the Capitol, where they could call on the sergeant-at-arms to preserve order."
"As a result of this run on the banks of the Potomac, the North suddenly decided that the war might last a week or two longer than at first stated, that the foe could not be killed with cornstalks, and that a mistake had been made in judging that the rebellion wasn't loaded.[6]"
Half a million men were called for and five hundred million dollars voted. General George B. McClellan took command of the Army of the Potomac.
"The battle of Ball's Bluff resulted disastrously to the Union forces, and two thousand men were mostly driven into the Potomac, some drowned and others shot. Colonel Baker, United States Senator from Oregon, was killed."
"The war in Missouri now opened. Captain Lyon reserved the United States arsenal at St. Louis, and defeated Colonel Marmaduke at Booneville."
"General Sigel was defeated at Carthage, July 5, by the Confederates: so Lyon, with five thousand men, decided to attack more than twice that number of the enemy under Price and McCulloch, which he did, August 10, at Wilson's Creek. He was killed while making a charge, and his men were defeated."
"General Frémont then took command, and drove Price to Springfield, but he was in a short time replaced by General Hunter, because his war policy was offensive to the enemy. Hunter was soon afterwards removed, and Major-General Halleck took his place. Halleck gave general satisfaction to the enemy, and even his red messages from Washington, where he boarded during the war, were filled with nothing but kindness for the misguided foe."
"Davis early in the war commissioned privateers, and Lincoln blockaded the Southern ports. The North had but one good vessel at the time, and those who have tried to blockade four or five thousand miles of hostile coast with one vessel know full well what it is to be busy. The entire navy consisted of forty-two ships, and some of these were not seaworthy."
Some of them were so pervious that their guns had to be tied on to keep them from leaking through the cracks of the vessel.
"Hatteras Inlet was captured, and Commodore Dupont, aided by General Thomas W. Sherman, captured Port Royal Entrance and Tybee Island. Port Royal became the dépôt for the fleet."
"It was now decided at the South to send Messrs. Mason and Slidell to England, partly for change of scene and rest, and partly to make a friendly call on Queen Victoria and invite her to come and spend the season at Asheville, North Carolina. It was also hoped that she would give a few readings from her own works at the South, while her retinue could go to the front and have fun with the Yankees, if so disposed."
"These gentlemen, wearing their nice new broadcloth clothes, and with a court suit and suitable night-wear to use in case they should be pressed to stop a week or two at the castle, got to Havana safely, and took passage on the British ship Trent; but Captain Wilkes, of the United States steamer San Jacinto, took them off the Trent, just as Mr. Mason had drawn and fortunately filled a hand with which he hoped to pay a part of the war-debt of the South and get a new overcoat in London."
"Later, however, the United States disavowed this act of Captain Wilkes, and said it was only a bit of pleasantry on his part."
"Once, Queen Victoria herself gave medals to some wounded and disabled soldiers who had fought very bravely. Some of these men could not raise their arms to salute their queen; some could not walk, but had to be wheeled in chairs to her side; but all were proud to receive their medals of honour from her hands."
"""Noble fellows,"" she wrote of them afterwards, ""I feel as if they were my own children."""
The Relief of Lucknow
"During the time of the terrible Indian Mutiny, when most of the native troops rose against their British rulers, and vowed to kill every white person in the land, many cruel deeds were done. A great number of white people were slain before the British troops could come to their rescue, but in some places they managed to hold out until help reached them."
"This was the case in the city of Lucknow, where the British governor with a small body of troops, and a great many women and children, took refuge in the Government House from a vast host of rebels who came to attack them. Many of the brave defenders were killed by the shot and shell of the enemy. Many others, and especially the little children, fell sick and died, for the heat was very great, and there was no good water to be had. Then, after many days, a small body of white soldiers fought their way into the city, and brought help and hope to the rest of the party. They were only just in time. Had they come a few days later they would have found the Government House a heap of ruins, and their friends dead, for the rebels were making a mine under the building and meant to blow it up with gunpowder. But alas! the newcomers were not strong enough to fight their way out of Lucknow with a crowd of helpless women and children and sick folk, so they, too were now shut in. For two months longer they held out. Then at last, when they had almost lost hope, the great Sir Colin Campbell with his brave Highlanders and other soldiers defeated the rebels, and brought the band of sick, starving, and weary people safely away."
Grace Darling
"On a small rocky island, off the north coast of England, there is a lighthouse. A man named William Darling was once keeper of this lighthouse, and his daughter Grace lived with him. Every day Grace Darling helped her father to trim the lamps, so that at night they might shine brightly, and warn sailors to steer their ships away from the dangerous rocks, upon which they would have been dashed to pieces."
"One stormy night Grace woke with the sound of screams in her ears. The screams came from the sea, so she knew that some ship must be in distress. She roused her father, but they could see nothing in the darkness. When daylight came, they found that a ship had been wrecked upon the rocks some way off, and a few people were clinging to the masts. Grace wished to go at once in a boat to save them; but at first her father hung back, for the wind and sea were wild, and he feared that the small boat would be overturned by the great waves. Then Grace ran to the boat, and seized an oar, for she could not bear to let the poor men die without trying to save them; and the father could not let his brave, daughter go alone, so he followed, and they rowed off."
"It was hard work pulling against the strong sea, and several times the small boat was almost sunk. But at last it reached the wreck, and William Darling managed to land upon the rock, and with great care and skill helped the half-frozen people into the small boat. Then they were taken to the lighthouse, where Grace warmed and fed them, until the storm ceased, and they could return to their homes."
David Livingstone
"At one time many people believed that the middle of Africa was a sandy desert, where nothing could live but camels and ostriches. But they were mistaken. The great traveller, David Livingstone, journeyed into this unknown country, and he found that it was not a desert but a beautiful land, where many tribes of black people dwelt. He also saw that these people were often seized by strangers, and taken away to be sold as slaves. This sight filled him with sadness, and he made up his mind to put a stop to this cruel traffic. He worked hard, tracing the courses of the rivers, finding the best tracts of land, and teaching the natives."
"Then he urged his countrymen to send others after him to settle in this fair country, to help the natives to learn useful trades, and to drive away the slave-merchants."
"For some years he was quite alone, with his black servants, in the midst of this wild land. His friends grew anxious, and sent Mr. Stanley, another great traveller, to look for him. Stanley marched for nearly a year before he found Livingstone. The old explorer was white and worn with sickness and hardship, and he was overjoyed to clasp once more the hand of a white man, and to hear again the English tongue. But he would not return to England. He said his work was not yet done, and he set out once more on his travels. It was his last journey. One morning his servants found him dead upon his bed. Since that time much has been done to make Central Africa a prosperous land. Other white men have followed where Livingstone led, and wherever they have settled, the wicked slave-trade has been stopped."
The Battle of Waterloo
"Fields of waving corn, green woods, fruitful orchards, a pretty farmhouse and a few cottages such was the plain of Waterloo. And there, on a summer Sunday, nearly a hundred years ago, was fought a famous battle, in which the British troops under the Duke of Wellington beat the French army, and broke the power of the great Napoleon for ever."
"""We have them,"" cried Napoleon as he saw the British drawn up before him. He thought it would be easy to destroy this army, so much smaller than his own, before their friends the Prussians, who were on the way to help them, came up. But he was mistaken. Wellington had placed his foot-soldiers in squares, and though the French horsemen, then the finest soldiers in the world, charged again and again, these little clumps of brave men stood fast. On his favourite horse ""Copenhagen"", Wellington rode to and fro cheering his men. ""Stand firm, my lads,"""
"cried he. ""What will they say to this in England?"""
"Not till evening, when the Prussians came, would he allow them to charge the French in their turn. Then, waving his cocked hat over his head, he gave the order, ""The whole line will advance"", and the impatient troops dashed forward. The French bravely tried to stand against this terrific charge, but they were beaten back, and the battle of Waterloo was ended."
"Sixty thousand men lay dead or wounded under the fruit-trees, and among the trampled corn and grass at the end of that terrible day."
The Charge of the Light Brigade
Forward the Light!
"Such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred British soldiers. Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready to shoot them down as they came, while on the hills on either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the Russians."
"""Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent to certain death,"""
thought the leader of the Light Brigade.
"""Forward! Attack!"""
"The order was repeated, and with the obedience of well-trained soldiers the Brigade started."
"On November 16, Sherman started, his army moving in four columns, constituting altogether a column of fire by night, and a pillar of cloud and dust by day. Kilpatrick's cavalry scoured the country like a mass meeting of ubiquitous little black Tennessee hornets."
"In five weeks Sherman had marched three hundred miles, had destroyed two railroads, had stormed Fort McAllister, and had captured Savannah."
"On the 5th and 6th of May, 1864, occurred the battle of the Wilderness, near the old battleground of Chancellorsville. No one could describe it, for it was fought in the dense woods, and the two days of useless butchery with not the slightest signs of civilized warfare sickened both armies, and, with no victory for either, they retired to their intrenchments."
"Grant, instead of retreating, however, quietly passed the flank of the Confederates and started for Spottsylvania Court-House, where a battle occurred May 8-12."
"Here the two armies fought five days without any advantage to either. It was at this time that Grant sent his celebrated despatch stating that he ""proposed to fight it out on this line if it took all summer."""
"Finally he sought to turn Lee's right flank. June 8, the battle of Cold Harbor followed this movement. The Union forces were shot down in the mire and brush by Lee's troops, now snugly in out of the wet, behind the Cold Harbor defences. One historian says that in twenty minutes ten thousand Yankee troops were killed; though Badeau, whose accuracy in counting dead has always been perfectly marvellous, admits only seven thousand in all."
"Grant now turned his attention towards Petersburg, but Lee was there before him and intrenched, so the Union army had to intrench. This only postponed the evil day, however."
"Things now shaped themselves into a siege of Richmond, with Petersburg as the first outpost of the besieged capital."
"On the 30th of July, eight thousand pounds of powder were carefully inserted under a Confederate fort and the entire thing hoisted in the air, leaving a huge hole, in which, a few hours afterwards, many a boy in blue met his death, for in the assault which followed the explosion the Union soldiers were mowed down by the concentrated fire of the Confederates. The Federals threw away four thousand lives here."
"On the 18th of August the Weldon Railroad was captured, which was a great advantage to Grant, and, though several efforts were made to recapture it, they were unsuccessful."
"General Early was delegated to threaten Washington and scare the able officers of the army who were stopping there at that time talking politics and abusing Grant. He defeated General Wallace at Monocacy River, and appeared before Fort Stevens, one of the defences of Washington, July 11. Had he whooped right along instead of pausing a day somewhere to get laundry-work done before entering Washington, he would easily have captured the city."
"Reinforcements, however, got there ahead of him, and he had to go back."
"He sent a force of cavalry into Pennsylvania, where they captured Chambersburg and burned it on failure of the town trustees to pay five hundred thousand dollars ransom."
"General Sheridan was placed in charge of the troops here, and defeated Early at Winchester, riding twenty miles in twenty minutes, as per poem."
At Fisher's Hill he was also victorious. He devastated the Valley of the Shenandoah to such a degree that a crow passing the entire length of the valley had to carry his dinner with him.
"It was, however, at the battle of Cedar Creek that Sheridan was twenty miles away, according to historical prose. Why he was twenty miles away, various and conflicting reasons are given, but on his good horse Rienzi he arrived in time to turn defeat and rout into victory and hilarity."
"Rienzi, after the war, died in eleven States. He was a black horse, with a saddle-gall and a flashing eye."
"He passed away at his home in Chicago at last in poverty while waiting for a pension applied for on the grounds of founder and lampers brought on by eating too heartily after the battle and while warm, but in the line of duty."
"The Red River campaign under General Banks was a joint naval and land expedition, resulting in the capture of Fort de Russy, March 14, after which, April 8, the troops marching towards Shreveport in very open order, single file or holding one another's hands and singing ""John Brown's Body,"" were attacked by General Dick Taylor, and if Washington had not been so far away and through a hostile country, Bull Run would have had another rival. But the boys rallied, and next day repulsed the Confederates, after which they returned to New Orleans, where board was more reasonable. General Banks obtained quite a relief at this time: he was relieved of his command."
"August 5, Commodore Farragut captured Mobile, after a neat and attractive naval fight, and on the 24th and 25th of December Commodore Porter and General Butler started out to take Fort Fisher. After two days' bombardment, Butler decided that there were other forts to be had on better terms, and returned. Afterwards General Terry commanded the second expedition, Porter having remained on hand with his vessels to assist. January 15, 1865, the most heroic fighting on both sides resulted, and at last, completely hemmed in, the brave and battered garrison surrendered; but no one who was there need blush to say so, even to-day."
At the South at this time coffee was fifty dollars a pound and gloves were one hundred and fifty dollars a pair. Flour was forty dollars a barrel; but you could get a barrel of currency for less than that.
"Money was plenty, but what was needed seemed to be confidence. Running the blockade was not profitable at that time, since over fifteen hundred head of Confederate vessels were captured during the war."
"The capture of Fort Fisher closed the last port of the South, and left the Confederacy no show with foreign Powers or markets."
"The Alabama was an armed steam-ship, and the most unpleasant feature of the war to the Federal government, especially as she had more sympathy and aid in England than was asked for or expected by the Unionists."
"However, England has since repaid all this loss in various ways. She has put from five to eight million dollars into cattle on the plains of the Northwest, where the skeletons of same may be found bleaching in the summer sun; and I am personally acquainted with six Americans now visiting England who can borrow enough in a year to make up all the losses sustained through the Alabama and other neutral vessels."
"Captain Semmes commanded the Alabama, and off Cherbourg he sent a challenge to the Kearsarge, commanded by Captain Winslow, who accepted it, and so worked his vessel that the Alabama had to move round him in a circle, while he filled her up with iron, lead, copper, tin, German silver, glass, nails, putty, paint, varnishes, and dye-stuff. At the seventh rotation the Alabama ran up the white flag and sunk with a low mellow plunk. The crew was rescued by Captain Winslow and the English yacht Deerhound, the latter taking Semmes and starting for England."
"This matter, however, was settled in after-years."
"The care of the sick, the dying, and the dead in the Union armies was almost entirely under the eye of the merciful and charitable, loyal and loving members of the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, whose work and its memory kept green in the hearts of the survivors and their children will be monument enough for the coming centuries."
"In July, 1864, the debt of the country was two billion dollars and twenty cents. Two dollars and ninety cents in greenbacks would buy a reluctant gold dollar."
"Still, Abraham Lincoln was re-elected against George B. McClellan, the Democratic candidate, who carried only three States. This was endorsement enough for the policy of President Lincoln."
"Troubles arose in 1878 over the right to fish in the northeast waters, and the treaty at Washington resulted in an award to Great Britain of five million five hundred thousand dollars, with the understanding that wasteful fishing should cease, and that as soon as either party got enough for a mess he should go home, no matter how well the fish seemed to be biting."
"The right to regulate Chinese immigration was given by treaty at Pekin, and ever since the Chinaman has entered our enclosures in some mysterious way, made enough in a few years to live like a potentate in China, and returned, leaving behind a pleasant memory and a chiffonnier here and there throughout the country filled with scorched shirt-bosoms, acid-eaten collars, and white vests with burglar-proof, ingrowing pockets in them."
The next nominations for President and Vice-President were James A.
"Garfield, of Ohio, and Chester A. Arthur, of New York, on the Republican ticket, and Winfield S. Hancock, of Pennsylvania, and William H."
"English, of Indiana, on the Democratic ticket. James B. Weaver was connected with this campaign also. Who will tell us what he had to do with it? Can no one tell us what James B. Weaver had to do with the campaign of 1881? Very well; I will tell you what he had to do with the campaign of 1881."
"He was the Presidential candidate on the Greenback ticket, but it was kept so quiet that I am not surprised to know that you did not hear about it."
"After the inauguration of Garfield the investigation and annulling of star-route contracts fraudulently obtained were carried out, whereby two million dollars' worth of these corrupt agreements were rendered null and void."
"On the morning of July 2, President Garfield was shot by a poor, miserable, unbalanced, and abnormal growth whose name will not be discovered even in the appendix of this work. He was tried, convicted, and sent squealing into eternity."
"The President lingered patiently for two months and a half, when he died."
"After the accession of President Arthur, there occurred floods on the lower Mississippi, whereby one hundred thousand people lost their homes."
The administration was not in any way to blame for this.
"In 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge across East River was completed and ready for jumping purposes. It was regarded as a great engineering success at the time, but it is now admitted that it is not high enough. A person jumping from it is not always killed."
"The same year the Civil Service Bill became a law. It provides that competitive examinations shall be made of certain applicants for office, whereby mail-carriers must prove that they know how to teach school, and guards in United States penitentiaries are required to describe how to navigate a ship."
"Possibly recent improvements have been made by which the curriculum is more fitted to the crime, but in the early operations of the law the janitor of a jail had to know what length shadow would be cast by a pole 18 feet 6-1/4 inches high on the third day of July at 11 o'clock 30 min."
"and 20 sec. standing on a knoll 35 feet 8-1/8 inches high, provided 8 men in 9 days can erect such a pole working 8 hours per day."
"In 1883 letter postage was reduced from three cents to two cents per half-ounce, and in 1885 to two cents per ounce."
"In 1884 Alaska was organized as a Territory, and after digging the snow out of Sitka, so that the governor should not take cold in his system, it was made the seat of government."
"Chinese immigration in 1882 was forbidden for ten years, and in 1884 a treaty with Mexico was made, a copy of which is on file in the State Department, but not allowed to be loaned to the author for use in this work."
"Grover Cleveland and Thomas A. Hendricks were nominated and elected at the end of President Arthur's term, running against James G. Blaine and John A. Logan, the Republican candidates, also Benjamin F. Butler and A."
"M. West, of Mississippi, on the People's ticket, and John P. St. John and William Daniel on the Prohibition ticket. St. John went home and kept bees, so that he could have honey to eat on his Kansas locusts, and Daniel swore he would never enter the performing cage of immoral political wild beasts again while reason remained on her throne."
"In 1886 a Presidential succession law was passed, whereby on the death of the President and the Vice-President the order of succession shall be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Attorney-General, the Postmaster-General, and the Secretaries of the Navy and of the Interior. This gives the Secretary of Agriculture an extremely remote and rarefied chance at the Presidency. Still, he should be just as faithful to his trust as he would be if he were nearer the throne."
"May 4, 1886, occurred a terrible outbreak of Chicago Anarchists, whereby seven policemen sent to preserve order were killed by the bursting of an Anarchist's bomb. The Anarchists were tried and executed, with the exception of Ling, who ate a dynamite capsule and passed into rest having had his features, and especially his nose, blown in a swift and earnest manner. Death resulted, and whiskers and beer-blossoms are still found embedded in the stone walls of his cell. Those who attended the funeral say that Ling from a scenic point of view was not a success."
"Governor Altgeld, of Illinois, an amateur American, in the summer of 1893 pardoned two of the Anarchists who had escaped death by imprisonment."
"August 31, 1886, in Charleston, occurred several terrible earthquake shocks, which seriously damaged the city and shocked and impaired the nerves and health of hundreds of people."
The noted heroism and pluck of the people of Charleston were never shown to greater advantage than on this occasion.
"Mr. Cleveland was again nominated, but was defeated by General Benjamin Harrison. Hon. James G. Blaine, of Maine, was made Secretary of State, and Wm. Windom, a veteran financier, Secretary of the Treasury."
"Secretary Windom's tragic death just as he had finished a most brilliant address to the great capitalists of New York after their annual dinner and discussion at Delmonico's is, and will ever remain, while life lasts, a most dramatic picture in the author's memory."
"Personally, the administration of President Harrison will be long remembered for the number of deaths among the families of the Executive and those of his Cabinet and friends."
"Nebraska, the thirty-seventh State, was admitted March 1, 1867. The name signifies ""Water Valley."" Colorado, the Centennial State, was the thirty-eighth. She was admitted July 1, 1876. Six other States have been since admitted when the political sign was right. Still, they have not always stuck by the party admitting them to the Union. This is the kind of ingratitude which sometimes leads to the reformation of politicians supposed to have been dead in sin."
"President Harrison's administration was a thoroughly upright and honest one, so far as it was possible for it to be after his party had drifted into the musty catacombs of security in office and the ship of state had become covered with large and expensive barnacles."
"As we go to press, his successor, Grover Cleveland, in the first year of his second administration, is paying a high price for fleeting fame, with the serious question of what to do with the relative coinage of gold and silver, and the Democrats in Congress, for the first time in the history of the world, are referring each other with hot breath and flashing eye to the platform they adopted at the National Convention."

"""Never!"""
Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""you think!  No, that is impossible!""  He walked twice"
"very quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said"
"sharply: ""Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work."""
Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
"""Nice old chap!"""
"At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid.  Going to do the"
"music-room that morning, she had ""found the master sitting on the sofa,"
"holding his head, and groaning awful.  He's not been at home, ma'am,"
"since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do.  I ran"
"for cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am,"
"I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and"
he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
"go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am.  So I didn't know what to do."""
"Gyp, pale to the lips, said:"
"""Wait here a minute, Ellen,"" and went into the dining-room.  Winton"
"followed.  She turned to him at once, and said:"
"""Oh, Dad, what am I to do?  His brain!  It would be too awful to feel I'd"
"brought that about."""
Winton grunted.  Gyp went on:
"""I must go and see.  If it's really that, I couldn't bear it.  I'm afraid"
"""When it gets dark I'm coming out to the _Arabella_ and stay all night."
Maybe they'll come back and I'll find out why. That fellow said
something 'bout Rockman's not being safe. They'll learn the _Arabella_
"isn't safe either!"""
"""But Lav, I'm coming with you!"""
"""You can't. And this isn't any work for a girl to get mixed up in."""
Sidney drew herself to her full height.
"""Lavender Green, if you think you're going to lose me _now_ you're"
mistaken. I guess we went into this in a sort of partnership and it's
going to hold. I found out just as much as you did! And if you come out
"to the _Arabella_, _I'm_ coming, and Mart, too, if she's home."""
Lav still hesitated.
"""Aunt Achsa won't let you. How'd you get away?"""
"This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she thought of a ""way."" This"
was Wednesday night and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night she
was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney might go with her. From
Truro Miss Letty was going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think
Sidney wanted to see Cap'n Davies again. She explained all this
"breathlessly to Lavender. ""This is important enough to warrant a fib."
And when it's all over Aunt Achsa will understand. Let's go home now
"and find Mart."""
Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney's right to share with him his
night's vigil at any cost. Again they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.
"Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come before the name), as"
"_Hon., Mrs., Rev._, etc., should in the heading be placed before"
"the Christian name (as _Smith, Capt. John_), and suffixes as"
"_Jr., D.D., LL.D._, after it (as _Channing, James Ellery, D.D._)."
"Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name, as _Derby,"
"Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of_; but British courtesy titles (i.e.,"
"those given to the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede,"
"as _Wellesley, Lord Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)_. In"
"other languages than English, French, and German the title usually"
"precedes the forename; as, _Alfieri, Conte Vittorio_. Occasionally a"
"French nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames; as,"
"_Gasparin, Comte Agénor de_."
_Lord_ should be replaced by the exact title in the names of English
"noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay should be entered as _Macaulay, 1st"
baron_. _Lord_ in the title of Scotch judges follows the family name;
"as, _Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord_."
"The title Baronet is given in the form _Scott, Sir Walter, bart._"
"Patronymic phrases, as _of Dedham_, follow all the names; but they must"
immediately follow the family name when they are always used in close
"connection with it, as _Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe_; similarly"
"_aîné_, _fils_, _jeune_, as _Dumas fils, Alexandre_; _Didot fils,"
Ambroise_. Latin appellatives should not in general be separated from
"their nouns by a comma; as, _Caesar Heisterbacensis_."
"The name of a king's wife should be written thus: _Charlotte, Queen,"
"consort of George III of England_. _Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of"
Henry VIII of England._
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
"""But the diamonds!"" she cried."
"""_Diamonds_--"" Cap'n Davies stared at her, his mouth open."
"""Why, yes, they're on this boat. They _must_ be! We were in the forward"
cabin watching and Jed Starrow came on board and they talked right
where we could hear. They were going to take them off and then they
decided it wasn't safe and they'd wait and they went away. And then
they must have cut the boat adrift. But we're _sure_ they're on this
"boat."""
"""So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly tricks! Well, never mind"
"your diamonds, now. We got to get back to shore and let a few folks"
"know--"""
"""But I won't _go_ until we've looked!"" Sidney protested, almost in"
"tears. ""Why, that was why we risked everything! And Lav wants to save"
"the name of the Cape--the--the way--you do! Oh, please look!"""
"The old Captain dropped his hold of the girl's arm. ""Well, I'll be"
"ding-blasted!"" he stormed. But he motioned to Saunders. ""Climb aboard"
and give us a hand. 'Taint likely they'd hide their stuff above deck.
You look round the stern and the girls and me'll give a hunt forward.
"Of all the stubborn, crazy-headed female pieces you'll beat 'em all!"""
While Saunders searched the stern of the schooner the Captain and
"Sidney and Mart searched the fo'castle cabin. Sidney, tugging away the"
"heavy tarpaulins, disclosed a small wooden box."
"""I'm _sure_ it wasn't there before--"" she cried. ""Why--why, I was"
"_sitting_ on it--"""
"me--I imagine you are in diplomacy, as I noticed you went through"
"with a Red passport.--I am Vivien Warren, just out of prison, and an"
"outlaw, more or less."""
"""'The outlaws of to-day are the in-laws of to-morrow,' as the"
English barrister said when he married the Boer general's daughter.
I have thought I recognized you. I have heard you speak at Lady
Maud's and also at Lady Feenix's Suffrage parties. My name is Hawk.
I suppose you've been in prison for some Suffrage offence? So has my
"aunt, for the matter of that."""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but in her case they only sentenced her to the First"
"Division; whereas _I_ have been doing nine months' hard."""
"_Hawk_: ""What was your crime?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I admit nothing, it is always wisest. But I was accused of"
"burning down Mr. ----'s racing stables--and other things..."""
"_Hawk_: ""_That_ beast. Well, I suppose it was very wrong. Can't"
"quite make up my mind about militancy, one way or the other. But"
"here we are up against the biggest war in history, and such"
"peccadilloes as yours sink into insignificance. By the bye, my aunt"
"was amnestied and so I suppose were you?"""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but not so handsomely. I was requested to go away"
"from England for a time, so here I am, about to join my mother in"
"Brussels--or in a little country place near Brussels."""
"_Hawk_: ""Well, I've been Secretary of Legation there. I'm just going"
"back to--to--well I'm just going back."""
"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's
"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”
"""It ain't,"" said the crew suspiciously."
"""And even if it's all right, we bein' strangers might be led into"
makin' a treaty without knowin' all there is to know.  I vote waitin'
"till the officers comes up."""
They squatted down on rocks and on the lumps of tussac grass till the
captain and the two mates came along with the rest of the Frenchmen.
"Hart communicated his suspicions to the skipper, who was decidedly"
under the influence of alcohol.
"""That's all right,"" said the Guffin thickly.  ""_We_ can manage"
Frenchmen.  They ain't goin' to make no French Shore question on no
more of our islands.  One Newfoundland's enough for me.  I'll show
"you n'gotiations--'gotiashuns is my forte!""  And he led the way over"
the hill.  Below them they saw the wreck of a French barquantine.
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, with a frown, ""if they 'aven't got the best"
"part of our hisland!"""
"It was not to be endured by any lot of Englishmen under the sun, that"
"the best part of this rock should be occupied by their natural foes,"
and soon there was evidence that in any attempt to turn the Frenchmen
out the British leader would have a united nation at his back.
"The Guffin and the two mates argued it, and Lampert was the"
Opposition.
"""W'y, wot's this you're sayin'?"" asked the disgusted skipper; ""did I"
think to 'ave shipped a Verning 'Arcourt among my lot?  You're a
"Little Englander, and nothin' but it, Lampert."""
"house of four stories, three gables in width. The upper stories jutted"
"out; the beams on which they rested were finely carved, the gables"
"were finished off with rich, wooden pinnacles. In each story, the"
"lowest excepted, were three long, low windows of the common Nuremberg"
"type, and the whole had a substantial and reputable air."
"The window at which I had seen Marie was farthest from the door, on"
"the first floor. To go to the door I had to lose sight of it, and"
perhaps for that reason I stood the longer. At last I went and
"knocked, and waited in a fever for some one to come. The street was a"
thoroughfare. There were a number of people passing. I thought that
all the town would go by before a dragging foot at last sounded
"inside, and the great nail-studded door was opened on the chain. A"
"stout, red-faced woman showed herself in the aperture."
'What is it?' she asked.
"'You have a girl in this house, named Marie Wort,' I answered"
"breathlessly. 'I saw her a moment ago at the window. I know her, and I"
wish to speak to her.'
The woman's little eyes dwelt on me stolidly for a space. Then she
made as if she would shut the door. 'For shame!' she said spitefully.
'We have no girls here. Begone with you!'
But I put my foot against the door. 'Whose house is this?' I said.
"'Herr Krapp's,' she answered crustily."
'Is he at home?'
"'No, he is not,' she retorted; 'and if he were, we have no baggages"
"""Ours was a foolish infatuation,"" she answered with an effort.  ""It is"
"best that we should both of us forget."""
"""Forget!""  I cried.  ""But I can never forget you, Yolande.  You are my"
"love.  You are all the world to me."""
"Her eyes were grave, and I saw that tears stood in them."
"""No,"" she protested quietly; ""do not say that.  I cannot be any more to"
"you than other women whom you meet daily.  Besides, I know well that in"
the diplomatic service marriage is a serious drawback to any save an
"ambassador."""
"""When a man is in love as I am with you, dearest, he throws all thoughts"
of his career to the winds; personal interests are naught where true
"love is concerned."""
"""You must not--nay, you shall not--wreck your future on my account,"" she"
"declared in a low, intense voice.  ""It is not just either to yourself or"
"to the Englishwoman who loves you."""
"""Why do you taunt me with that, Yolande?""  I asked reproachfully.  ""I do"
not love her.  I have never truly loved her.  I was lonely after you had
"gone out of my life, and she was amusing,--that was all."""
"""And now you find me equally amusing--eh?"" she remarked, with just a"
touch of bitter sarcasm.
"""Why should you be jealous of her?""  I asked.  ""You might just as well"
"be jealous of Sibyl, Lord Barmouth's daughter."""
"""With the latter you are certainly on terms of most intimate"
"He told her--he told her all he knew. She listened, horror-stricken,"
regarding him with open mouth and streaming eyes.
"“And what do you think is my duty?” asked John, abruptly."
Miss Lindon shook her head. “I 'm sure I don't know what to advise
"you, dear. I 'll try to find out some kind Christian people who want a"
servant.”
"“I don't want any kind Christian people at all,” said John. “I'm going"
to make up in ease and happiness for all the wrongs that humanity has
"inflicted on her. I am going to adopt her, educate her, fill her up with"
the good things of life.”
"“That's very fine of you, John,” said Miss Lindon. “Some people are"
as fond of their adopted children as of their own. I remember Miss
"Engleshaw adopted a little child. She was four, if I remember right,"
and she used to dress her so prettily. I used to go and help her choose
frocks. Really they were quite expensive. Now I come to think of
"it, John, I could help you that way with little Unity. I don't think"
gentlemen have much experience in choosing little girls' frocks. How old
is she?”
"“Nearly sixteen,” said John."
"“That's rather old,” said Miss Lindon, from whose mind this new interest"
seemed to have driven the tragic side of the question. “It's a pity you
could n't have begun when she was four.”
"“It is,” said John."
"“Only if you had begun with her at four, you would n't be wanting to"

"""Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we"
"might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,"
"she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four."""
"""How's that?"""
"""The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on"
Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way
"back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with"
the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die
or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the
"planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal"
"husband, he's not much to boast about."""
"The stranger nodded violently. ""Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody"
"anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a"
"bellyful!"""
"He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been"
able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little
islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a
"surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive"
"planet, he didn't know ""it's a woman's world,"" like the older boys in"
school used to say.
"""And what did they say, Lav? Oh, tell me quick!"""
"""I could only get scraps of it. I didn't dare look, I didn't dare move."
But one fellow called the other Jed. I heard 'em say something about
'risk' and a 'stranger from Boston asking too many questions 'round
"Rockman's to be healthy,' and Jed Starrow--I'm dead sure it was his"
"voice--said, sort of blustering like, 'Let them search the _Puritan_!"
They won't find anything on her _now_!' And the other fellow answered
"him: 'There's too much in this, Jed, to take any chances.' That's what"
"they said, Sid, and then they went on."""
"""Oh, Lav, they're pirates!"""
"""Well, not exactly pirates, but they're up to _something_ that's sure."
Maybe they're rum-runners. There's a lot of that going on. I thought
"you were crazy, but I guess you weren't."""
Sidney's lips trembled with eagerness. As long as Lavender knew what he
knew she felt that she would be justified in telling him what Cap'n
Davies had told her.
"""It isn't rum--Lav,"" she whispered, ""It's _diamonds_!"""
"""Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that stuff?"""
"""It's diamonds, Lav."" Then Sidney solemnly repeated what the old"
"Captain had told her concerning the letter and the reward. ""He asked me"
"not to tell a soul, but you're different because you know. And he said"
that the reward would be posted everywhere in two weeks at least and
"it's that long now. Everyone will know soon."""
"""Sid, five thousand dollars!"" Lavender whistled."
"Colonel Carmichael thrust her behind him, and an instant later she"
heard the report of his revolver. There was no answering volley. A
"dark, scantily-clad figure sprang through the trees, waving one hand"
as though in imperative appeal.
"""Don't fire--don't fire! It's me!"""
"The Colonel's still smoking revolver sank, and the supposed native"
"swayed toward him, only to sink a few yards farther on to the ground."
Carmichael ran to his side and lifted the fainting head against his
shoulder.
"""Good God, Geoffries! Don't say I've hit you! How on earth was I to"
"know!"""
"""That's all right, Colonel. Only winded--don't you know--never hurried"
so much in life. Have been in the midst of the beggars--just managed
"to slip through. O Lor', give me something to drink, will you?"""
Colonel Carmichael put his flask to the parched and broken lips.
"""Thanks, that's better. We got your message, and are coming on like"
fun. The regiment's only an hour off. You never saw Saunders in such a
"fluster--it's his first big job, you know."" He took another deep"
"draft, and wiped his mouth with the corner of his ragged tunic. ""I"
"say--don't look at me, Miss Lois. I'm not fit to be seen."" He laughed"
"hoarsely. ""These clothes weren't made in Bond Street, and Webb assured"
"me that the fewer I had the more genuine I looked. I say, Colonel,"
"this is a lively business!"""
Colonel Carmichael nodded as he helped the gasping and exhausted man
into the bungalow.
"someone looking at her, someone different, and someone smiling."
She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then she flung out her arms
with a low glad cry that was half sob.
"""Trude--_Oh, Trude!_"""
"Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn head, murmuring"
soothing words. Finally Sidney wriggled from her.
"""Have you come to take me home? But how could they send for you so"
"quickly? How long have I been asleep? Oh, Lavender--is he--is he--"""
"""One question at a time, Sid. Lavender is better. He'll be all right,"
"the doctor says, after a good rest. Yes, I think I'd better take you"
"home. No, they did not send for me."" Briefly, as though now that"
"earlier concern was of little consequence, Trude told of the sketch"
that had so bewildered and alarmed her.
"""I couldn't understand,"" she finished."
"""I couldn't either, at first. You see the boarder--the man who has"
boarded here so long and is dreadfully fond of Aunt Achsa wrote that
"letter to me and wrote it _nice_ so as to please her, and, at"
"first--but, oh, Trude, Aunt Achsa _is_ wonderful and so is Lavender,"
"really, truly, even though they are poor--"""
"""Hush, Sidney."" Trude's eyes darkened with feeling. ""You do not have to"
"tell me that. I have learned _that_ in only a few hours. Oh, I have"
"seen straight into souls--those kind men on the street, as concerned as"
"though you belonged to them, and here--Aunt Achsa with her great"
courage and her love. And that Miss Vine--they're so _simple_--and so
"'North,' he whispered."
"After that they were nothing to me, but I went with the rest. Our lair"
"was in some rocks overhanging the road. By the time we looked over,"
"the horsemen were below us, and we could see nothing of them; though"
"the sullen tramp of their horses, and the jingle of bit and spur,"
reached us clearly. Presently they came into sight again on the road
"beyond, riding steadily away with their backs to us."
'That is not General Tzerclas?' my lady muttered anxiously.
'Nor any of his people!' Steve said with an oath.
"That led me to look more closely, and I saw in a moment something that"
lifted me out of my moodiness. I sprang on the rock against which I
was leaning and shouted long and loudly.
"'Himmel!' Steve cried, seizing me by the ankle. 'Are you mad, man?'"
"But I only shouted again, and waved my cap frantically. Then I slipped"
"down, sobered. 'They see us,' I cried. 'They are Leuchtenstein's"
"riders. And Count Hugo is with them. You are safe, my lady.'"
"She turned white and red, and I saw her clutch at the rock to keep"
herself on her feet. 'Are you sure?' she said. The troop had halted
and were wheeling slowly and in perfect order.
"'Quite sure, my lady,' I answered, with a touch of bitterness in my"
tone. Why had not this happened yesterday or the day before? Then my
girl would have been saved. Now it came too late! Too late! No wonder
I felt bitterly about it.
"same meaning to her ear: ""You have helped to do this--this is your"
"work."""
"""No help will come,"" Mrs. Carmichael said, shaking her head at the"
"darkness. ""When a whole province rises as this has done, it takes"
"months to organize a sufficient force, and we shan't last out many"
days. I wonder what people in England are saying. How well I can see
"them over their breakfast cups! Oh, dear, I mustn't think of breakfast"
"cups, or I shall lose my nerve."" She laughed under her breath, and"
there was a long silence.
"Presently the door of the bungalow opened, letting in a stream of"
"moonlight. It was closed instantly, and soft footfalls came over the"
boarded floor.
"""Who is it?"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered."
"""I--Lois,"" was the answer. The new-comer crept down by Beatrice's side"
"and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. ""I am so tired,"" she"
"said faintly. ""I have been with Archibald. He has been moaning so. Mr."
"Berry says he is afraid mortification has set in. It is terrible."""
"""Poor little woman!"" Beatrice put her arm about the slender figure and"
"drew her closer. ""Lay your head on my lap and sleep a little. You can"
"do no good just now."""
"""Thank you. I will, if you don't mind. You will wake me if anything"
"happens, won't you?"""
"""Yes, I promise."" It gave Beatrice a sense of comfort to have Lois"
"near her. Very gently she passed her hand over the aching forehead,"
and presently Lois fell into a sleep of absolute exhaustion.
Sidney he admired the girl's gameness though he was beginning to wish
they had not let her come.
"""How long do you think we'll have to wait? And what if no one comes?"""
"""We'll have to wait until most morning anyway before the tide is out."
"And if no one comes tonight we'll have to come out again, that's all."
"We're not in this business for any fun!"""
"""Oh--h!"" sighed Pola, clinging closer to Sidney."
The wind howled over their heads with increasing velocity and Sidney
thought involuntarily of the snugness of Miss Letty's buggy. Miss Letty
was probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa thought she was with
her!
"""Is--is the boat tied tight?"" asked Pola; and Lav assured her that it"
"was. ""The wind could get a lot worse and you'd be as safe out here as"
"in your bed at home."""
"After a long while Mart muttered, ""What's that?"" The others leaned"
forward in the blackness of the cabin. They had all felt rather than
heard a soft thud as though something had touched the side of the boat.
And in a few moments heavy footsteps came straight toward the fo'castle.
"""Oh, will they come _here_?"" breathed Pola, shaking. And for answer"
Sidney caught Pola's arm with a warning clutch.
For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must descend to the cabin.
"But at the companionway they halted. A voice came, heavy and thick."
"""I tell you it ain't safe to take it off now. They got a man on"
"There was no one about, and a few children's faces at a window suddenly"
"disappeared. Everything here was small and poor, though only the barn was"
of peat; the house was a timbered fisherman's home. As I entered the
"house, I saw that though it was as poor within as without, the floor was"
clean and covered with pine twigs. There were many children here. The
mother was busy cooking something over the fire.
"I was offered a chair, and sitting down, began to chat with a couple of"
"small boys. As I was in no hurry and asked for nothing, the woman said:"
"""I expect you want a boat?"""
"""A boat?"" I said in my turn, for I had not come by boat on my last visit;"
I had walked instead over fjelds and valleys many miles from the sea.
"""Yes, why not?"" I said. ""But where does it go?"""
"""I thought you wanted a boat to go to the trading center,"" she replied,"
"""because that's where the steamer stops. We've rowed over lots of people"
"this year."""
Great changes here; the motor traffic in Stordalen must have completely
altered all the other traffic since my last visit ten months ago.
"""Where can I stop for a few days?"" I asked."
"""At the trading center, the other side of the islands. Or there's Eilert"
and Olaus; they're both on this side. You could go there; they've got big
"houses."""
"She showed me the two places on this side of the water, close to the"
"shore, and I proceeded thither."
“There’s Gilroy’s flock of bears!” Jimmie shouted.
"“And a little bit of a black bear at that,” Ned laughed. “If Gilroy had"
"made an ugly face at him, he’d have run away!”"
The tree into which the fat confidential clerk had climbed was not a
"large one. In fact, it was swaying dangerously under his weight. As he"
"moved his position at sight of the black back of the bear, the slender"
upshoot to which he clung gave way and he came clattering down through
the few lower branches.
“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” he shouted. “I never should have come into this
blasted country! I shall be eaten alive!”
"Instead of rushing to Gilroy’s assistance, his rescuers, boy-like, sat"
down on the mat of pine needles which strewed the ground and roared with
laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without attempting to rise to his
feet. His rage only made the scene more amusing.
“Why didn’t you shoot him?” he demanded at length.
“Shoot him?” repeated Jimmie. “That bear is a great deal more frightened
"than you are. At the rate of speed he’s now going, he’ll strike the"
arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow morning!”
"“He chased me up the tree,” whined Gilroy. “He nipped at my heels as I"
"left the ground, and I heard his teeth grinding together in the most"
frightful manner. I’ll never get over this!”
“I guess he would have climbed the tree after you in about another
"minute,” Jimmie declared, with a sly wink at Ned. “You see, it’s just"
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the
tribe of the Manhattans.
"The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until"
"she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,"
facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary
gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a
handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously
out the window.
"“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered."
“When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you
ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat. Mamma has been so
"alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,"
thoughtless Puss.”
"The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“Don’t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use"
mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie’s hat were just
"what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
“I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not
"walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better."
That is why I was so long.”
"The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the"
"""If someone 'round here's doing it Cap'n Davies wants to catch him"

Lavender's shoulders lifted. Why couldn't someone else save the fair
name of Cape Cod--someone like a crippled boy whom most of the
towns-people looked upon as a loafer?
"""I'd like to catch 'em, myself,"" he said slowly in such a low voice"
that Sidney barely caught the words.
"""Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance as anyone, knowing as much"
"as we do. What'll we do first?"" For Sidney was ready for adventure."
Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping the knife in his hand.
He looked down at it.
"""What we ought to do first is to find out how this knife got here."
Let's put it where we found it and go back around the other side of
that schooner so's no one on the _Puritan_'ll see us. Then we can come

"to look for it!"""
"""And then we'd know for sure that someone had been on the _Arabella_."""
"""That's the idea. You get on quickly for a girl, Sid. Come on, now,"
"we'll pull the dory round to the starboard side."""
Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck of the_ Arabella_. In

and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat--don't you know that
every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?

whether he had communicated with him between that date and the dead

"and he pointed again to the picture, and went on to tell the details of"
Benyon's subsequent application to him for a post under Government.

"""Yes, I refused it. I spoke to him once again, when we met on a social"
occasion. We had a sort of dispute then. I never saw him again to speak

"dignified. He stayed in the doorway, silent, a thin stream of"
"cigarette-smoke slowly filtering from his nostrils. His cold,"
calculating eyes were once more on Captain Dove's. And it was Captain
Dove's would-be mocking glance that at length gave way.
"""You offered to give me Sallie, if I paid you a hundred thousand"
"dollars,"" said Slyne, judicially."
"""To see you safely married to her,"" Captain Dove corrected him."
"Slyne nodded, in grave assent."
"""Well, I'm going to hold you to your offer,"" said he. ""The money's ready"
and waiting for you--just as soon as we can settle a few trifling
"formalities. I have Sallie's promise to marry me--"""
"""The devil you have!"" said Captain Dove, not slow to seize opportunity"
"either. ""I thought I heard her say--"""
"Slyne's face darkened again. ""And, if you'll come ashore with me now,"""
"he went on, controlling his temper, ""I'll prove to you that your money"
"is perfectly safe."""
"Captain Dove lay back in his bunk and laughed, most discordantly. He"
"laughed till his red-rimmed eyes were adrip, while Slyne sat looking at"
"him. He was still laughing when Slyne rose and, flicking the"
"cigarette-end from between two nicotine-stained fingers, began to button"
"Then, after an interminable time, Miss Craig called out cheerily;"
"""There, that's enough for this morning,"" and came down to the dory,"
opening a little crocheted bag. From it she took two crisp one dollar
"bills. ""Take this, girls, and divide it. And we are ever so"
"grateful--you were splendid types. We'll have you again some day."""
Sidney's hand had barely closed over her dollar bill when she spied a
"woman and a girl slowly walking along the wharf, watching with interest"
the artists who were still at work. The girl looked startlingly
familiar to Sidney. She gave a little gasp and ran forward.
"""_Pola!_"" she called loudly."
"The girl turned in astonishment at the sound of her name, stared for a"
"moment, then quickly advanced laughing."
"""Why, you're the Romley girl, aren't you? Of _all_ the things! What are"
"you doing here?"""
"""I'm visiting my aunt,"" explained Sidney, suddenly conscious of her"
appearance and in consequence painfully ill-at-ease.
"""Oh, and do they hire you to pose? What fun! I suppose that's a sort of"
"costume they make you wear, isn't it?"""
"""Y--yes,"" Sidney faltered, miserably. Pola's manner was prettily"
condescending and she made no move to join Sidney on the beach.
"""I'm a wreck myself,"" Pola went on, airily surveying her trim and"
"elegant person. ""Mother and I are motoring. And I made her bring me"
down here to see my cousin. He's an artist and lives here summers.
He'll just despise seeing us because he comes here to get rid of
difficult to make out whether the men had left the boat or not. Once
Lav crawled to the top of the companion ladder but a muttering like a
human voice drove him back. Queer sounds struck upon their sensitized
ears. And the boat seemed to lift to a new motion.
They waited for an interminable time. Then Mart spoke quickly.
"""Lav, we're moving!"""
"Lav needed no warning. He, too, had missed the pull of the boat on the"
anchor rope. He shot up the ladder.
"""Oh, what's the matter?"" cried Sidney and Pola, forgetting all caution."
"Mart had no time to explain her fears. In an instant Lav was back,"
fairly throwing himself into the cabin.
"""We're drifting! They cut the anchor rope! We're drifting out! Fast!"
"Way out! To sea!"""
"That had been the ""better scheme."" To cut the _Arabella_ free from its"
mooring and let the wind and tide carry it out into the bay. At first
Starrow had not favored the plan; he had declared that it was too much
"risk, that the wind was shifting and freshening fast and that the old"
"tub might open a seam, but Joe Josephs had convinced him with: ""the"
_Arabella_ would be good for a week out in a nastier sea than this.
It's safer than riskin' runnin' afoul one of Phin Davies' men ashore.
Guthrie's _Sally_'ll stand this squall and pick up the _Arabella_ easy
"and we can reckon sure on the course the old tub'll take, even 'lowin'"
"for the wind to shift."""
As she comprehended what had happened Pola screamed. Mart and Sidney
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE HOUSE IN THE CHURCHYARD.
The heat which Count Leuchtenstein had thrown into the matter
"surprised me somewhat when I came to think of it, but I was soon to be"
"more surprised. I did not go to my lady at once on coming in, for on"
"the landing the sound of voices and laughter met me, and I learned"
that there were still two or three young officers sitting with her who
had outstayed Count Hugo. I waited until they were gone--clanking and
"jingling down the stairs; and then, about the hour at which I usually"
"went to take orders before retiring, I knocked at the door."
Commonly one of the women opened to me. To-night the door remained
"closed. I waited, knocked again, and then went in. I could see no one,"
"but the lamps were flickering, and I saw that the window was open."
"At that moment, while I stood uncertain, she came in through it; and"
"blinded, I suppose, by the lights, did not see me. For at the first"
"chair she reached just within the window, she sat down suddenly and"
burst into tears!
'Mein Gott!' I cried clumsily. I should have known better; but the
laughter of the young fellows as they trooped down the stairs was
"still in my ears, and I was dumfounded."
"She sprang up on the instant, and glared at me through her tears. 'Who"
are--how dare you? How dare you come into the room without knocking?'
she cried violently.
"'I did knock, my lady,' I stammered, 'asking your pardon.'"
"“I want to talk to you, Wallie,” said he."
"“Have a drink? No? I sha' n't want anything, Perkins,” said he to"
the waiting dresser. “Call me when I 'm on in the second act. I don't
"change,” he explained."
"“I know,” said John. “That 's why I 've come now.”"
"“What's the matter?” Herold asked, sitting in the chair before the"
"dressing-table, bright with mirrors and electric lights and sticks of"
grease paint and silver-topped pots and other paraphernalia.
"“Nothing particular. Only hell, just as usual. I saw that child to-day.”"
Herold lit a cigarette.
“Have you ever speculated on what becomes of the victims in cases of
this kind?” asked John.
"“Not particularly,” said Herold, seeing that John wanted to talk."
“What do you think can become of a human creature in the circumstances
of this poor little wretch? Her childhood is one vista of bleak
"ugliness. Never a toy, never a kiss, not even the freedom of the gutter."
"Unless you 've been there, you can't conceive the soul-crushing despair"
of that infernal orphanage. She leaves it and goes into the world.
She goes out of a kind of dreary Greek hades into a Christian hell. It
"lasted for months. She was too ignorant and spiritless to complain, and"
"to whom was she to complain? Now she's sent back again, just like a sick"
"animal, to hades. Fancy, they would n't let her have a few flowers in'"
"the room! It makes me mad to think of it. And when she gets well again,"
"hands and arms a long pair of motoring doeskin gloves. By George, she"
"was a winner—in general looks, though. Well, something about the clerk,"
"I suppose, must have aroused her suspicions. For, a moment later, she"
was gone in the crowd. Evidently she had thought of the danger and had
picked out a time when the lobby would be full and everybody busy. But
she did not leave by the front entrance through which she entered. I
concluded that she must have left by one of the side street carriage
doors.”
“And she got away?”
“Yes. I found that she asked one of the boys at the door to crank up a
"car standing at the curb. She slid into the seat, and was off in a"
minute.”
Kennedy said nothing. But I knew that he was making a mighty effort to
restrain comment on the bungling amateur detective work of the son of
our client.
"Reginald saw the look on his face. “Still,” he hastened, “I got the"
number of the car. It was 200859 New York.”
“You have looked it up?” queried Kennedy quickly.
“I didn’t need to do it. A few minutes later Dr. Rae Wilson herself
came out—storming like mad. Her car had been stolen at the very door of
the hotel by this woman with the innocent aid of the hotel employees.”
Kennedy was evidently keenly interested. The mention of the stolen car
had apparently at once suggested an idea to him.
"“Mrs. Blake,” he said, as he rose to go, “I shall take this letter with"
he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front
"of the car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw"
the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind
"a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away."
"Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile."
He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale
about having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach
"lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a more"
interesting sight than this?
"“My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,” he said kindly,"
so that they would not be too greatly mortified. “I have letters here
that will show—”
"“You’ll come with us, please,” announced the plainclothes man. “‘Pinky’"
McGuire’s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A
detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and ’phoned down
to take you in. Do your explaining at the station-house.”
James Williams’s wife—his bride of two weeks—looked him in the face
"with a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks,"
looked him in the face and said:
"“Go with ’em quietly, ‘Pinky,’ and maybe it’ll be in your favour.”"
And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw
a kiss—his wife threw a kiss—at some one high up on the seats of the
Rubberneck.
"“Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,” said Donovan. “Come on,"
now.”
“And do you like Rome; eh?”
"“I should say so! At first, I didn’t, I must admit. It was a"
disappointment to me. I had dreamed so much about Rome!” and Kennedy
talked of the books and guides he had read about the Eternal City.
"“I must admit that I had never dreamed about Rome,” said Cæsar. “And"
you boast of that?” asked Laura.
"“No, I don’t boast of it, I merely state it. I understand how agreeable"
it is to know things. Cæsar died here! Cicero made speeches here! Saint
Peter stumbled over this stone! It is fine! But not knowing things
is also very comfortable. I am rather like a barbarian walking
indifferently among monuments he knows nothing about.”
“Doesn’t such an idea make you ashamed?”
"“No, why? It would be a bother to me to know a lot of things offhand. To"
"pass by a mountain and know how it was thrown up, what it is composed"
"of, what its flora and fauna are; to get to a town and know its history"
in detail.... What things to be interested in! It’s tiresome! I hate
"history too much. I far prefer to be ignorant of everything, and"
"especially the past, and from time to time to offer myself a capricious,"
arbitrary explanation.”
"“But I think that knowing things not only is not tiresome,” said"
"Kennedy, “but is a great satisfaction.”"
“You think even learning things is a satisfaction?”
“Thousands of years ago one could know things almost without learning
"them; nowadays in order to know, one has to learn. That is natural and"
"this ever happened."""
"She flipped down the computer's screen, then turned back."
"""Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple. I'm sorry to have to tell"
"you two that we haven't seen the last of each other."" She paused, then"
"continued. ""In fact, we are about to become much better acquainted."""
"""What do you mean?"""
"""You once told me, back when we met on the plane from Athens, you would"
welcome that. You should be happy that your wish is now about to be
"granted. You both are going to be our guests."""
"""That's kind of you."" He stared at her, startled. ""But we can probably"
"bear up to the separation."""
"""No, I must insist. You were right about the difficulties. Your death"
"now would be awkward, for a number of reasons. Alex will be trouble"
"enough to explain, but that is purely an internal Soviet matter. Moscow"
"Narodny can cover it. However, eliminating you two would raise awkward"
"inquiries. On the other hand, you represent a security risk to the"
"project. Consequently we have no option. Surely you understand."""
He understood all too well. This was the one turn he hadn't figured on.
Almost eight years. It had been that long ago. But what had Ken said?
The Tokyo _oyabun _never forgot. What this really meant was that Tanzan
Mino wanted to settle the score first hand. What did he have planned?
Vance had a sudden feeling he didn't want to know. It was going to be a
zero-sum game. Everything on the table and winner take all.
"""Oh, yes, a scratch. I hardly feel it. It isn't anything. It can't be"
"anything. There's nothing vital thereabouts, is there, Berry?"""
The missionary shrugged his shoulders. He had flung open the glass
"doors which led on to the verandah, and the brightening dawn flooded"
in upon them.
"""Come and help me carry this poor lady,"" he said. ""We have not a"
"minute to lose."""
"Travers tried to obey, but he had no strength, and the other thrust"
him impatiently on one side.
"""Mrs. Carmichael, you are a strong woman,"" he appealed. Between them"
"they managed to bring Mrs. Cary's heavy, unconscious frame down the"
"steps. It was a nerve-trying task, for their progress was of necessity"
"a slow one, and the sound of the desperate fighting seemed to surround"
them on every side. It was with a feeling of intense relief that the
little party saw Nicholson appear from amidst the trees and run toward
them.
"""That's right!"" he cried. ""Only be quick! They are at us on all sides"
"now, but my men are keeping them off until you are out of the"
bungalow. The old ruin at the back of the garden is our last stand.
"Carmichael is there already with a detachment, and is keeping off a"
"rear attack. I shall remain here."""
"""Alone?"" Berry asked anxiously."
"""Yes. I believe they will ransack the bungalow first. When they come,"
"the Rajah is sure to be at their head, and--well, it's going to be"
diamond cut diamond between us two when we meet. I know the beggars
"stood a pile of grips, stacked up, packed, and undisturbed."
Winters who had been studying the room while we got our bearings picked
up a queer-looking revolver from the floor. As he held it up I could
see that along the top of the barrel was a long cylinder with a ratchet
or catch at the butt end. He turned it over and over carefully.
"“By George,” he muttered, “it has been fired off.”"
Kennedy glanced more minutely at the body. There was not a mark on it.
I stared about vacantly at the place where Winters had picked the thing
up.
"“Look,” I cried, my eye catching a little hole in the baseboard of the"
woodwork near it.
"“It must have fallen and exploded on the floor,” remarked Kennedy. “Let"
"me see it, Winters.”"
Craig held it at arm’s length and pulled the catch. Instead of an
"explosion, there came a cone of light from the top of the gun. As"
"Kennedy moved it over the wall, I saw in the center of the circle of"
light a dark spot.
"“A new invention,” Craig explained. “All you need to do is to move it"
so that little dark spot falls directly on an object. Pull the
trigger—the bullet strikes the dark spot. Even a nervous and unskilled
marksman becomes a good shot in the dark. He can even shoot from behind
the protection of something—and hit accurately.”
It was too much for me. I could only stand and watch Kennedy as he
deftly bent over Schloss again and placed a piece of chemically
"“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks"
you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat
"with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on"
to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it
here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”
The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.
"His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by"
the time he had finished. The note was rather short.
_Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match
to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago.
"Somehow I couldn’t do it myself, so I went around and got a plain"
clothes man to do the job.

LOST ON DRESS PARADE
Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.
One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed
vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be
seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler’s patent
leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero’s
toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed
by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next
view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house
Her complacency irritated him. The canary never ceased his ear-splitting
"noise. The canary is a beautiful, gentle bird--stuffed; alive, he is"
pestilence made vocal. Risca lost his temper.
"“Surely you must know, Aunt Gladys. I 've been wandering through hell"
with a pack of little devils at my heels.”
"Startled, she lifted up her arms and dropped Dandy, who slithered down"
her dress and sought a morose shelter under the table.
“My dear John!” she exclaimed.
"“I'm very sorry; I did n't mean to use strong language,” said he,"
putting his hands to his ears. “It's all that infernal canary.”
"“Oh, poor Dickie! Don't you like to hear Dickie sing? He sings so"
"beautifully. The gas-man was here the other day and said that, if I"
"liked, he would enter him for a competition, and he was sure he would"
"get first prize. But if you don't like to hear him, dear--though I"
really can't understand why--I can easily make him stop.” She drew a
white napkin from the drawer of the table on which the cage was placed
and threw it over the top. The feathered steam-whistle swallowed his din
"in an angry gurgle or two and became silent “Poor Dickie, he thinks it"
"'s a snowstorm! What were we talking about, John? Do sit down.”"
"John resumed his seat on the slippery couch, and Miss Lindon, having"
"snatched Dandy from his lair, sat by his side, depositing the dog"
between them.
"“You asked me what I had been doing for the last few years,” said he."
"“I’m afraid it wouldn’t do much good in case of an attack,” Ned"
suggested. “We’d soon get hungry and thirsty and have to surrender.”
"“Anyway, it’s an all right thing to shoot from!” Jimmie announced. “If"
"you’d seen the way we sweat rolling those rocks, you’d think it was all"
"right, anyway. I wonder where the boys are.”"
"“I was thinking more about the boys than about the barricade,” Ned"
admitted. “Were they all here when you left?”
"“All sitting in front of the entrance,” Jimmie replied, “except Gilroy,"
and he was asleep on a pile of blankets in the cave.”
"“He may be there yet,” suggested Ned. “Suppose we go and see.”"
"Jimmie made his way through the narrow entrance, found a searchlight,"
and turned a round circle of flame on a great heap of blankets in a back
corner. There was no one in the cave at all save only himself.
"Before returning to report to Ned, the hungry boy seized a plate of corn"
pones and a can of tinned beans from the provision chest.
"“Look here, Ned,” he said in a moment, appearing before his chum with"
"his mouth full of beans, “the appetite of our midnight visitor seems to"
be for confidential clerks as well as for bread. Someone has stolen
"Gilroy! Anyway, he’s not in the cave!”"
"“He may have gone away with the boys,” suggested Ned."
"“He wasn’t thinking of going away with the boys when I left,” Jimmie"
"answered. “He was telling how much he liked New York, and how he’d like"
"this way, Mr. Gilroy,” he went on, “the bears out here are hungry for"
"fat clerks from Wall street. I’ve heard they make stews of ’em,” he"
concluded.
Gilroy now arose to his feet and stood gazing into the thicket in the
direction of the bear’s disappearance. Jimmie’s assertion that bruin
would hit the Arctic circle early the next morning seemed to give him
"great comfort. As the distance between the bear and himself increased,"
he grew braver and began throwing out his chest.
"“What a chance that was for me to kill a bear!” he began, boastfully,"
"“If I’d only had a gun with me, I might have had a fine rug made out of"
his hide! It would have been fine to show my friends.”
“Sure it would!” declared Jimmie. “I’m glad you didn’t remember that you
had a gun in your pocket. The bears out here are pretty sensitive about
"being shot at. If you’d blazed away at that cub, and hadn’t shot him"
"dead in his tracks the first time, he would have eaten you.”"
Gilroy put his hand to his pistol pocket and a look of pretended
amazement came over his fat face.
"“Upon my word!” he said, “I thought I left my gun in the bunk!”"
"“After this,” Ned advised, “always keep your gun in sight when you go"
"into the forest. Suppose there had been no tree to climb, what then?”"
"“I should have grappled with him, sir!” exclaimed Gilroy. “I certainly"
should have grappled with him.”
"“You would have had to catch him first,” Jimmie grinned."

they walked along the waterfront fishermen and tourists and boys and
girls stared and nodded and Sidney's sensitive soul mistook their
obvious interest for ridicule. She walked with lowered eyes lest she
encounter Mrs. Calkins or Pola's mother.
Cap'n Phin was waiting outside the door of the shed on Rockman's wharf.
He nodded to Sidney and Trude and beckoned them inside. At any other
"time, in any other state of mind, Sidney would have thrilled to his air"
of mystery.
Four men sat in wooden chairs tipped at various angles and on the floor
before them stood the wooden box from the _Arabella_. The men nodded
and smiled at Sidney and brought their chairs to the floor as though to
attention.
Cap'n Davies solemnly motioned Sidney and Trude to two vacant chairs
and then cleared his throat.
"""I cal'late, Miss Sidney, that you've a sort o' interest in this cargo"
we brought in on the _Sally_ so we stood by 'til you hove in sight.
"Now, mebbe it's what we think it is and mebbe it isn't. Si, give a hand"
"and unload."""
One of the men knelt down by the box and proceeded to open it with a
hammer and a chisel. The others leaned forward with interest. Sidney
held her breath.
"The man Si, having torn off the cover, put his hands into the paper"
wrappings and drew forth yards and yards of magnificently embroidered
fabric that made Sidney and Trude gasp in admiration and astonishment.
But the others were plainly disappointed. A low murmur of disgust went
around the room.
instant he fell full length on the boarded floor of the loft with the
hand outstretched in which was the handkerchief he had been staunching
the blood from the wound in his side.
With a whispered injunction that he was all right and was not to move on
"any account, the Girl put the ladder back in its place. But no sooner"
was this done than on looking up she caught sight of the stained
"handkerchief. She called softly up to him to take it away, explaining"
that the cracks between the boards were wide and it could plainly be
seen from below.
"""That's it!"" she exclaimed on observing that he had changed the position"
"of his hand. ""Now, don't move!"""
"Finally, with the lighted candle in her hand, the Girl made a quick"
survey of the room to see that nothing was in sight that would betray
"her lover's presence there, and then throwing open the door she took up"
such a position by it that it made it impossible for anyone to get past
her without using force.
"""You can't come in here, Jack Rance,"" she said in a resolute voice. ""You"
"can tell me what you want from where you are."""
"Roughly, almost brutally, Rance shoved her to one side and entered."
"""No more Jack Rance. It's the Sheriff coming after Mr. Johnson,"" he"
"said, emphasizing each word."
The Girl eyed him defiantly.
"""Yes, I said Mr. Johnson,"" reiterated the Sheriff, cocking the gun that"
"he held in his hand. ""I saw him coming in here."""
"words on any subject as fast as pen could travel, no matter what torture"
"burned his brain, could not find a foolish message for a sick child. At"
last he wrote like a school-boy:
"_Darling: The flowers were beautiful, and so is the new picture, and I"
want to see you early in the morning. I hope you are well. John Risca._
And he had to tear the letter out of its envelope and put it into a
fresh one because he had omitted to add the magic initials “G. H. B.” to
"his name. Compared with his usual imaginative feats of correspondence,"
this was a poverty-stricken epistle. She would wonder at the change.
"Perhaps his demand for an immediate interview would startle her, and"
"shocks were dangerous. He tore up the letter and envelope, and went to"
his own room. It was past two o'clock when he crept downstairs again to
lay his letter on the hall table.
At the sight of him the next morning the color deepened in the delicate
"cheeks of Stellamaris, and her dark eyes grew bright. She held out a"
welcoming hand.
"“Ah, Belovedest, I 've been longing to see you ever since dawn. I woke"
up then and could n't go to sleep again because I was so excited.”
"He took the chair by her bedside, and her fingers tapped affectionately"
on the back of the great hand that lay on the coverlid.
"“I suppose I was excited, too,” said he, “for I was awake at dawn.”"
“Did you look out of window?”
"“Yes,” said John."
to pound his ear for about three days and nights.”
"“Anyway,” Ned decided, “we’ll wait here a little while and see if they"
"don’t return. In the meantime, you can get yourself something to eat.”"
“Don’t you call this something to eat?” asked Jimmie.
“One poor little can of beans and one poor little plate of corn pones
"won’t make much of an impression on your appetite,” Ned laughed. “What"
"you need is one of those neat little bear steaks, about as large as a"
warming pan. You’ll have plenty of time in which to cook it.”
"“And that means that I can cook one for you, too?” asked Jimmie."
"“Why, of course you can!” returned Ned."
“I’d like to cook one for the Boy Scout who got us both into such
"trouble,” Jimmie declared. “I’d put poison on it!”"
"“Now, don’t you be too severe on that Boy Scout,” Ned advised."
"“According to your own story, he warned you and Frank in the thicket,"
"and I know very well that he wanted to tell me something, but didn’t"
dare do it.”
"“Well, here’s another thing,” Jimmie explained. “When I went out to look"
"for you, I gave the ‘help’ smoke signal from the top of a granite rock"
in the pines. In five minutes after the columns of smoke became large
"enough to be seen at a distance, the signal was answered from the north,"
"it seemed to me from the vicinity of the old mission. Now, of course,"
you didn’t send out that signal.”
"“I rather think not,” smiled Ned."
Besides--in a hundred years it will all be forgotten. Why do we struggle?
In a hundred years someone will read about it in memoirs and letters and
"think: ""How she wriggled, how she fussed--dear me!"" There are others about"
whom nothing at all will be written or read; life will close over them
like a grave. Either way....
"What sorrows she had--dear, dear, what sorrows! The day she had been"
"unable to pay the bill, she thought herself the center of the universe;"
"everybody stared at her, and she was at her wits' end. Then she heard a"
"man's voice outside saying: ""Haven't you watered Blakka yet?"" That was"
_his_ preoccupation. So she was not the center of the universe after
all.
"Then she and her companion had left the house, and set out on their tour."
"The center? Not at all. Day after day they walked across fields, and"
"through valleys, had meals in houses by the way, and water from the"
"brooks. If they met other travelers, they greeted them, or they did not"
"greet them; no one was less a center of attention than they, and no one"
"more. Her companion walked in vacant thoughtlessness, whistling as he"
went.
At one place they stopped for food.
"""Will you pay for mine for the time being?"" he said."
"She hesitated and then said briefly that she could not pay ""for the time"
"being"" all the way."
"""Of course not, by no means,"" said he. ""Just for the moment. Perhaps we"
"can get a loan further down the valley."""
Frances and I felt that we were traitors to our country in helping the
"French king, but we knew that in the end he would buy Dunkirk from our"
"spendthrift monarch, and that out country's loss would be no greater by"
reason of our gain. Therefore I wrote George as follows:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""The Duchess of Hearts is eager and confident. Write at once, giving full"
directions.
"""YOUR FRIEND."""
"Frances added a postscript in cipher, but I shall not translate it."
"One morning, some three weeks after sending my letter, Frances came to me"
"in my closet in the Wardrobe, and I saw at once she was in great trouble."
"Her eyes were red with weeping, and the woebegone expression of her face"
would have been amusing had I not known that some good cause was back of
"it. As soon as she entered I saw that she was going to speak, but closets"
"in Whitehall have ears, so I placed my finger on my lips to enjoin"
"silence, and spoke loud enough to be heard if any one was listening:--"
"""Ah, Frances, I forgot that I had promised to go with you to your"
father's this morning. Wait for me at Holbein's Gate. I'll be there in
"ten minutes."""
"Within the promised time I found Frances at Holbein's Gate, and we walked"
"up to Charing Cross, thence down the Strand toward Temple Bar."
"""What is the trouble, Frances?"" I asked, anxious to hear her news, which"
"I feared was bad. She was in great distress, and I saw that a flood of"
"keeping his eye vigilantly on his fellow guard, who, having seated"
"himself in the window-sill, had dozed off to sleep, the cigarette still"
"drooping from the corner of his mouth. Yes, he was certainly asleep."
"He held out his hand to Etienne, who readily gave him the last he had"
"rolled. The sentry thanked him with a quick martial salute, and after a"
"turn or two more, deftly dropped the crumbled tobacco upon the floor and"
let the leaf drop on Rollo's knees with a stump of pencil rolled up in
it.
"Then the young man, turning his back upon the dozing guard in the stone"
"window-sill, wrote with some difficulty the following note, lying on his"
breast and using the uneven floor of the granary for a desk.
"""Little Concha"" (it ran), ""we are General Cabrera's prisoners."
Bring the papers as soon as you receive this. Otherwise we are
"to be shot at day-break.--ROLLO BLAIR."""
"There was still a little space left upon the leaf of Alcoy paper, and"
"with a half shamefaced glance at El Sarria, he added, ""_And in any case"
"do not wholly forget R. B._"""
"He passed the note to the outlaw, who folded it to the size of a postage"
stamp and apparently gave directions where and to whom it was to be
delivered.
"""In half an hour we shall be relieved and I will go,"" said the Carlist"
"ex-Miguelete, and resumed his steady tramp. Presently he awoke his"
comrade so that he might not be found asleep at the change of guard.
*       *       *       *       *
"sheer ecstatic bravado, emitted a Tarzan roar."
Instantly a weight hit the door from the outside. It shuddered but did
"not give. Dennis crouched, gripping his knife. Frank Corson staggered to"
his feet and hurled himself groggily at the android. Dennis roared
"again, pushed away and arced the knife at his throat."
"Rhoda screamed and lunged at Dennis' legs. ""No! No! Stop it! Please!"""
Dennis teetered under her weight and the knife slanted downward across
Frank's chest. It ripped a red gash as the door shuddered a third time.
Dennis turned in that direction and crouched. The door splintered and
"flew open. Dennis lunged, like a line-bucking football player. He hit"
"both Brent Taber and Captain Abrams simultaneously, sprawling them both"
and sending Abrams' gun spinning out of his hand.
He leaped over them and dashed down the hall where the elevator man
"waited uncertainly, not sure whether to dispute the right of way or not."
"His indecision was fatal. Dennis wrapped an arm around his neck, pulled"
his head back and cut his throat with one slash of the knife.
Captain Abrams' head had hit a doorjamb opposite the entrance to Rhoda's
apartment. He stirred and tried to come erect but he was unable to make
it.
Brent Taber clawed the gun off the floor and came to one knee. He got
off one shot as the elevator door was closing and saw the android spin
away from the controls as the impact of the slug smashed the bone of his
shoulder.
Taber lunged to his feet and went for the stairs.
"wiping it. All the while his eyes were emotionless, betraying no hint"
of what was in his mind.
"After the utensils were ceremonially cleansed, he wordlessly scooped a"
"portion of pale-green powdered tea into the bowl, then lifted a"
dipperful of boiling water from the kettle and poured it in. Finally he
"picked up a bamboo whisk and began to whip the mixture, continuing"
until it had acquired the consistency of green foam.
"Authority, control, and--above all--discipline. Those things, Vance knew,"
"were what this was really about. As was traditional and proper, not a"
"word was spoken. This was the Zen equivalent of High Mass, and Tanzan"
"Mino was silently letting him know he was a true master--of himself, of"
his world.
"Then the _oyabun _reached over and formally presented the bowl, placing"
it on the _tatami  _in front of his guest.
"Vance lifted it up, rotated it a half turn in his hand, and took a"
"reserved sip. As the bitter beverage assaulted his mouth, he found"
himself thinking this was probably intended to be his Last Supper. He
hoped he remembered enough to get the moves right.
"He sipped one more time, then wiped the rim, formally repositioned the"
"bowl on the _tatami_, and leaned back."
"""Perfectly done,"" Tanzan Mino smiled as he broke the silence. ""I'm"
"impressed."" He nodded toward the white bowl. ""Incidentally, you were"
"just handling one of the finest pieces in all Japan."""
"""Shino ware. Mino region, late sixteenth century. Remarkably fine"
"glaze, considering those kilns had just started firing _chawan_."""
"know--all strangers, save one.  This was a cabinet portrait in a heavy"
"silver frame, and as I took it up to scrutinise it more closely a cry"
involuntarily escaped my lips.
The picture was a three-quarter length representation of a
"black-bearded, keen-eyed man, standing with his hands thrust idly in his"
"pockets, and smoking a cigarette.  There was no mistaking those"
features.  It was the photograph of the man the discovery of whose
presence in Paris had produced such an extraordinary effect upon her--
Rodolphe Wolf.
CHAPTER SEVEN.
BY A THREAD.
"I was still standing by the window, holding the photograph in my hand,"
"and gazing upon it in wonder, when Dick Deane was shown in."
"""What's the matter, old chap?  Are you the man in possession here?"" he"
"asked breezily, gripping me by the hand."
"He was a fair, merry-faced fellow of thirty-five, rather good-looking,"
"smartly dressed in black frock-coat of professional cut, and wearing a"
"pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez.  He had been born in Paris, and had spent"
"the greater part of his life there, except during the years when he was"
"at school with me before going to Edinburgh, where he took his degree."
"Then he had returned to Paris, taken his French degree, and had soon"
risen to be one of the fashionable doctors in the French capital.  He
"was an especial favourite in the salons, and, like every good-looking"
"doctor, a favourite with the ladies."
"""I'm not in possession,"" I answered.  ""A very serious affair has"
"The android advanced with his knife raised. In desperation, Taber fired"
at the lethal fist that held the weapon. And he was lucky. The hand
snapped open under the ripping impact of the bullet and the knife rang
sharply against the wall as it ricocheted to the ground.
"Only then, did the patrolman obey the order to drop. He went to one knee"
and Brent Taber fired three shots into the chest of the android.
He hesitated. There was only one slug left in the revolver. If the three
"didn't spot the android, he planned to wait for closer contact and put"
the sixth slug into the forehead.
The android shuddered. The fire and frenzy went out of him. He tried to
lift a leg and was surprised when it didn't move. He looked down at it.
"Completely bemused, he peered down at his crimson chest. He looked up at"
"Taber without anger, only with surprise. A distinct expression of"
wistful regret crossed his face as he sank to the ground.
The tenth android was dead.
The patrolman came shakily to his feet. His face was as pale as death.
"""I--I don't know what happened. Buck fever. Pure buck fever, and I've"
"been on the force for ten years."""
"""Don't worry about it,"" Taber said."
"""Don't _worry_. All of a sudden I freeze under pressure and he says,"
"'Don't worry.'"""
"""I meant it. This is no ordinary man. It wasn't buck fever at all. I"
couldn't have faced him myself if I hadn't rattled him with that lucky
"""The murder!"" exclaimed the Captain."
"""Don't talk to me about it, Perry,"" the Chief Justice requested, opening"
"a paper in front of his face. He did not, however, withdraw out of"
earshot.
"""They've got a sort of a clue. A wretched hobbledehoy of a fellow,"
"something in the bookseller's shop at the corner of Kettle Street, has"
come with a rigmarole about a society that he and a few more belonged
"to, including this François Gaspard, who is missing. He protests that"
"the thing was legal, and all that--only a Radical inner ring--but he"
says that at the last meeting this fellow was dropping hints about
putting somebody out of the way. Dyer--that's the lad's name--swears the
"rest of them disowned him and said they'd have nothing to do with it,"
"and hoped he'd given up the idea."""
"""I suppose he's in a blue funk?"" asked the Captain."
"""He is no doubt alarmed,"" said Sir Robert. ""He gave the police the names"
"of the rest of their precious society, and, oddly enough, Ned Evans, of"
"the House--you know him, Coxon?--was one."""
"""Heard such an awful lot of debates, poor chap,"" observed Captain"
Heseltine.
"""Well, they went to Evans' and collared him. For a time he stuck out"
"that he knew nothing about it, but they threatened him with heaven knows"
"what, and at last he confessed to having seen this Gaspard in company"
with the murdered man in Digby Square a little before twelve on the
"night."""
"""By Jove! That's awkward!"" said the Captain."
"found him. He didn't come down in the morning, and, as she couldn't make"
"him hear, she forced the door, and found him with his throat cut."""
"""Awful!"" shuddered Lady Eynesford. ""He looked such a respectable man"
"too."""
"""Ah, I fancy he'd gone a bit to the bad lately--taken to drinking and so"
"on."""
"""He was a friend of Mr. Kilshaw's, wasn't he?"" asked Alicia."
"""A sort of hanger-on, I think. Anyhow, there he was dead, and with his"
"pockets empty."""
"""Perhaps he killed himself,"" she suggested."
"""They think not. They've arrested the woman, but she declares she knows"
"nothing about it!"""
"""Poor man!"" said Alicia; and, at another time, she might have thought a"
good deal about the horrible end of a man whom she had known as an
"acquaintance. But, as it was, she soon forgot him again, and, leaving"
"the rest, returned to her solitary seat."
"In the town, the news of the murder was but one ruffle more on the wave"
"of excitement, and not a very marked one. Few people knew Benham's"
"name, and when the first agitation following on the discovery of the"
"body died away and the onlookers found there was no news to be had, they"
turned away to join the processions or to stare at them. The police were
"left to pursue their investigations in peace, and they soon reached a"
"conclusion. The landlady of the house where Benham died lived alone,"
save for the occasional presence of her son: he was away at work in an
me. Will you see that Buster is sent up to my laboratory immediately?”
She nodded. It was evident that Buster was a great pet with her and
that it was with difficulty she kept from smoothing his silky coat.
“You—you won’t hurt Buster?” she pleaded.
"“No. Trust me. More than that, if there is any possible way of"
"untangling this mystery, I shall do it.”"
"Mrs. Blake looked rather than spoke her thanks. As we went downstairs,"
"accompanied by Miss Sears, we could see in the music room a very"
"interesting couple, chatting earnestly over the piano."
"Betty Blake, a slip of a girl in her first season, was dividing her"
attention between her visitor and the door by which we were passing.
"She rose as she heard us, leaving the young man standing alone at the"
piano. He was of an age perhaps a year or two older than Reginald
"Blake. It was evident that, whatever Miss Betty might think, he had"
eyes for no one else but the pretty debutante. He even seemed to be
"regarding Kennedy sullenly, as if he were a possible rival."
"“You—you don’t think it is serious?” whispered Betty in an undertone,"
scarcely waiting to be introduced. She had evidently known of our
"visit, but had been unable to get away to be present upstairs."
"“Really, Miss Blake,” reassured Kennedy, “I can’t say. All I can do is"
to repeat what I have already said to your mother. Keep up a good heart
and trust me to work it out.”
"“Thank you,” she murmured, and then, impulsively extending her small"
And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed
his hat far upon the back of his head.
"“My wife seems to think I am a burglar,” he said, recklessly. “I never"
"heard of her being crazy; therefore I must be. And if I’m crazy, they"
can’t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness.”
Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops
"had to be whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few"
thousand delighted spectators.
At the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name.
"“McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which,” was James"
Williams’s answer. “But you can bet I’m a burglar; don’t leave that
out. And you might add that it took five of ’em to pluck the Pink. I’d
especially like to have that in the records.”
"In an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison"
"Avenue, in a respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero’s"
innocence—for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an
automobile mfg. co.
After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a
copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the
"department was capable of, Mrs. Williams rearrested him and swept him"
into an angle of the station-house. James Williams regarded her with
one eye. He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody
was holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word
of reproach or of reproof.
moment a German soldier on leave came up and spat in his face. The
Frenchman felled the German with a resounding box on the ear.
Alarums! Excursions! A German officer rushed up to enquire while the
Frenchman was struggling with two colossal German military policemen
and the Englishman was striving to free him. Vivie explained to the
officer what had occurred. He bowed and saluted: seized the
soldier-spitter by the collar and kicked him so frightfully that
Vivie had to implore him to cease.
Moreover the Red Placards of von Bissing were of increasing
frequency. As a rule Vivie only heard what other people said of
"them, and that wasn't very much, for German spies were everywhere,"
inviting you to follow them to the dreaded Kommandantur in the Rue
de la Loi--a scene of as much in the way of horror and mental
anguish as the Conciergerie of Paris in the days of the Red Terror.
But some cheek-blanching rumour she had heard on a certain Monday in
October caused her to look next day on her way home at a fresh Red
Placard which had been posted up in a public place. The daylight had
"almost faded, but there was a gas lamp which made the notice"
legible. It ran:
CONDAMNATIONS
"Par jugement du 9 Octobre, 1915, le tribunal de campagne a"
prononcé les condamnations suivantes pour trahison commise
pendant l'état de guerre (pour avoir fait passer des recrues
à l'ennemi):
"1° Philippe BAUCQ, architecte à Bruxelles;"
"2° Louise THULIEZ, professeur à Lille;"
"Lights were flashing here and there, and when Jimmie at last found"
"himself inside the chimney, he knew that the very room he had recently"
left was being occupied by the outlaws.
"The electric light was out again, and the boy groped with his hands in"
the darkness. Much to his surprise they failed to locate his chum.
“Ned!” he called softly. “Where are you hiding?”
Jimmie heard a chuckle in the darkness and felt a hand on his shoulder.
Then Ned whispered in his ear:
“I guess I’ve stumbled on one of the hidden cells of the mission!” he
said. “Anyway there’s a hole leading out of this chimney that’s big
enough to keep house in.”
"“We’ll be finding a train of cars and an East river ferryboat next,”"
Jimmie chuckled. “We always do find something when we go away from camp.
"If we don’t find anything else, we find trouble.”"
"It was thought safe, now, to turn on the electric light. The rays showed"
a room perhaps twelve feet in size with furniture and furnishings of the
description of those in the chamber below. Although the apartment seemed
to be somewhere near the center of a lofty finger of rock which lifted
"from the eastern slope of the mountain, the air was remarkably fresh and"
pure.
"“There’s an opening somewhere,” Ned suggested. “A shut-in room like this"
would asphyxiate one if there were no ventilation.”
“Then I think we’d better be finding it!” Jimmie advised. “Just listen
to those fellows chewing the rag in the room we recently left!”
"At that hour before the theatres rose, a lull brooded in the London"
"streets; in this quiet narrow one, the town's hum was only broken by the"
clack of a half-drunken woman bickering at her man as they lurched along
"for home, and the strains of a street musician's fiddle, trying to make"
"up for a blank day.  The sound vaguely irritated Winton, reminding him of"
those two damnable foreigners by whom she had been so treated.  To have
them at the point of a sword or pistol--to teach them a lesson!  He heard
her say:
"""Dad, I should like to pay his debts.  Then things would be as they were"
"when I married him."""
He emitted an exasperated sound.  He did not believe in heaping coals of
fire.
"""I want to make sure, too, that the girl is all right till she's over her"
"trouble.  Perhaps I could use some of that--that other money, if mine is"
"all tied up?"""
"It was sheer anger, not disapproval of her impulse, that made him"
hesitate; money and revenge would never be associated in his mind. Gyp
went on:
"""I want to feel as if I'd never let him marry me.  Perhaps his debts are"
"all part of that--who knows?  Please!"""
"Winton looked at her.  How like--when she said that ""Please!""  How"
"like--her figure sunk back in the old chair, and the face lifted in"
shadow!  A sort of exultation came to him.  He had got her back--had got
her back!
"how the merchant passed the factory and disappeared into the wood, and"
he wished very much that he might fall and break all his bones.  He sat
"imagining many horrible forms of disaster while watching Petunikoff,"
who was descending the hill into the wood like a spider going into its
web.  Last night he even imagined that the wood gave way before the
merchant and he fell ... but afterwards he found that he had only been
dreaming.
"And to-day, as always, the red building stands out before the eyes of"
"Aristid Kuvalda, so plain, so massive, and clinging so strongly to the"
"earth, that it seems to be sucking away all its life.  It appears to be"
laughing coldly at the Captain with its gaping walls.  The sun pours
its rays on them as generously as it does on the miserable hovels of
the main street.
"""Devil take the thing!"" exclaimed the Captain, thoughtfully measuring"
"the walls of the factory with his eyes. ""If only ..."""
Trembling with excitement at the thought that had just entered his
"mind, Aristid Kuvalda jumped up and ran to Vaviloff's eating-house,"
muttering to himself all the time.
"Vaviloff met him at the bar, and gave him a friendly welcome."
"""I wish your honour good health!""  He was of middle height, and had a"
"bald head, grey hair, and straight moustaches like tooth-brushes."
"Upright and neat in his clean jacket, he showed by every movement that"
he was an old soldier.
"""Egorka, show me the lease and plan of your house,"" demanded Kuvalda,"
impatiently.
door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or
"explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in"
"the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say"
"that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed"
sternly.
"""First, Mr. Brown,"" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in"
"class, ""you realize that you are not only committing the political"
"crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away"
"without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores"
"intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?"""
*       *       *       *       *
He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.
Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.
"""I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,"" Sis added"
caustically.
Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.
"""Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And _you_ want to foul up"
"Venus."""
"""We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of"
"politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before--"""
"""Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world."""
"""It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee"
"Brown."" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over"
"her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, ""What"
basis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were
"adapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the"
"vernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely"
"recognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as"
"for instance, the tune “Hamburg.” Some of the music in the Amish church"
services is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.
The singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and
confined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The
"laity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so."
"Congregational singing, so important in our worship today, had for"
centuries been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was
inevitable and it came in due time.
"While only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the Western"
Church have been translated from the Latin and a few choice ones have
found their way into the _Hymnary_.
Latin Hymns in the Hymnary
"Prudentius, 348-c. 413, “Bethlehem, of noblest cities” (88)"
"Gregory the Great, 540-604, “Father, we praise Thee” (24)"
"Anonymous, 6th or 7th century, “Christ is made the sure” (277)"
“Joy dawned again on Easterday” (415)
"Theodulph of Orleans, 9th century, “All glory, laud, and honor”"
(100)
"Bernard of Clairvaux, 1091-1153, “Jesus the very thought” (155)"
"“O sacred Head, now wounded” (539)"
"Bernard of Cluny, 12th century, “Jerusalem, the golden” (262-3)"

"Savonarola, 1452-98 (Italian), “Jesus, Refuge of the weary” (536)"
"replied, her powdered face again puckering into a smile.  ""Do you want"
"to know my honest opinion?"" she added."
"""Yes, I do."""
"""Well,"" she went on, ""I attach very little importance to the rumours of"
a projected sale or lease of Ceuta to us.  I might tell you in
"confidence,"" she went on, dropping her voice, ""that from some words I"
overheard at the garden-party at de Wolkenstein's I have come to a firm
"conclusion that, although during the next few years important changes"
"will be made upon the map of the world, Ceuta will remain Spanish.  My"
country will never menace yours in the Mediterranean at that point.  A
Ministry might be found in Madrid to consider the question of its
"disposal, but the Spanish people would rise in revolution before they"
"would consent.  Spain is very poor, but very proud.  Having lost so many"
"of her foreign possessions, she will hold more strongly than ever to"
"Ceuta.  There you have the whole situation in a nutshell."""
"""Then the report that it is actually sold to France is untrue?""  I asked"
eagerly.
"""A mere report I believe it to be."""
"""But Spain's financial indebtedness to France might prove an element of"
danger when Europe justifies Lord Beaconsfield's prediction and rushes
"into war over Morocco?"""
"""Ah, my dear M'sieur Ingram, I do not agree with the prediction of your"
"great statesman,"" the old lady said vehemently.  ""It is not in that"
"direction in which lies the danger of war, but at the other end of the"
"Mediterranean."""
"“This is up-to-date gambling in cleaned-up New York,” he remarked as we"
waited for the elevator to return for us. “And the worst of it all is
that it gets the women as well as the men. Once they are caught in the
"net, they are the most powerful lure to men that the gamblers have yet"
devised.”
"We rode down in silence, and as we went down the steps to the street, I"
"noticed the man whom we had seen watching the place, lurking down at"
the lower corner. Kennedy quickened his pace and came up behind him.
"“Why, Winters!” exclaimed Craig. “You here?”"
"“I might say the same to you,” grinned the detective not displeased"
evidently that our trail had crossed his. “I suppose you are looking
"for Schloss, too. He’s up in the Recherche a great deal, playing poker."
I understand he owns an interest in the game up there.”
"Kennedy nodded, but said nothing."
“I just saw one of the cappers for the place go out before you went
in.”
“Capper?” repeated Kennedy surprised. “Antoinette Moulton a steerer for
a gambling joint? What can a rich society woman have to do with a place
like that or a man like Schloss?”
Winters smiled sardonically. “Society ladies to-day often get into
"scrapes of which their husbands know nothing,” he remarked. “You didn’t"
"know before that Antoinette Moulton, like many of her friends in the"
"smart set, was a gambler—and loser—did you?”"
Craig shook his head. He had more of human than scientific interest in
"ruffian,"" said he to himself. ""If they have the same effect on Sallie, I"
"won't grudge the few francs I paid for them!"""
"He tiptoed down the short stairway, and, having tapped very quietly at"
"the door of the after-saloon, entered without more ado. He judged that"
he might have difficulty in gaining admission if he delayed to ask
leave.
The saloon was empty. But from an adjoining cabin came the sound of
"splashing, and from its neighbour the shuffle of heavy feet, a faint"
suggestion of deft hands busy among crisp muslin and sibilant silk.
Slyne hesitated; he wanted to be very tactful and yet was unwilling to
give up the advantage he had thus gained. He closed the door carefully
behind him. It creaked a little.
From the room whence had come the rustle of feminine garments an
"uncanny-looking figure appeared, and darted an angry, apprehensive"
glance about the saloon. The sound of splashing had ceased.
"""'Morning, Ambrizette,"" said Slyne briskly and standing his ground. ""Is"
your mistress up yet? Tell her I have Captain Dove's leave to pay her a
"call."""
"The dumb black dwarf's scowl grew darker, but her hand fell away from"
her breast and she halted as Sallie's voice sounded from within.
"""Is that you, Jasper!"" it ejaculated. ""What do you want? I thought--"""
"""I've come back--with good news for you, Sallie--wonderful news!"" said"
"Slyne. ""And I'm in no end of a hurry to be off again. Call Ambrizette in"
"and get dressed, as quick as you can. Captain Dove's waiting breakfast"
"""With all my heart!"" cried the soldier."
"Petunikoff was silent for a moment, then looked at him, and suddenly"
"asked, coldly and drily, ""And why do you wish to do so?"""
"Vaviloff did not expect such a question, and therefore had no reply"
ready.  In his opinion the question was quite unworthy of any
"attention, and so he laughed at young Petunikoff."
"""That is easy to understand.  Men like to live peacefully with one"
"another."""
"""But,"" interrupted Petunikoff, ""that is not exactly the reason why.  As"
"far as I can see, you do not distinctly understand why you wish to be"
"reconciled to us ...  I will tell you."""
"The soldier was a little surprised.  This youngster, dressed in a check"
"suit, in which he looked ridiculous, spoke as if he were Colonel"
"Rakshin, who used to knock three of the unfortunate soldier's teeth out"
every time he was angry.
"""You want to be friends with us because we should be such useful"
neighbours to you ... because there will be not less than a hundred and
"fifty workmen in our factory, and in course of time even more.  If a"
"hundred men come and drink one glass at your place, after receiving"
"their weekly wages, that means that you will sell every month four"
"hundred glasses more than you sell at present.  This is, of course, the"
lowest estimate ... and then you have the eating-house besides.  You
"are not a fool, and you can understand for yourself what profitable"
"neighbours we shall be."""
"""I wait for you!"""
Raniero broke into a boisterous laugh.
"""The bastard! The monk! Go home, Francesco, and don your lady's"
"attire! What would you with a sword?"""
Francesco's mouth was a hard line. He breathed through hungry
"nostrils, as he went step by step toward Raniero."
Then with a swift shifting of his sword from right to left he smote
"him on each cheek, then, lowering his vizor, he put up his guard."
"With an oath Raniero's sword flashed, feinted, turned with a cunning"
"twist, and swept low for Francesco's thigh."
"Francesco leaped back, but was slashed by the point a hair's breadth"
"above the knee. It was a mere skin wound, but the pain of it seemed to"
snap something that had been twisted to a breaking point within him.
He gave a great cry and charged down Raniero's second blow.
"Their shields met and clashed, and Raniero staggered. Francesco rushed"
him across the hall as a bull drives a rival about a yard. Raniero
"crashed against the wall, and Francesco sprang back to use his sword."
The blow hewed the top from Raniero's shield and smote him slant-wise
across the face.
"Raniero gathered himself and struck back, but the blow was caught on"
"Francesco's shield. Francesco thrust at him, before he could recover,"
and the point slipped under the edge of Raniero's gorget. He twisted
free and blundered forward into a fierce exchange of half-arm blows.
"Once he struck Francesco upon the mouth with the pommel of his sword,"
"There was no one in the lobby when he arrived there--no dead bodies,"
"either. But on the sidewalk, in front of the building, a woman lay dead"
in a pool of blood.
"In a sick rage, Taber looked in both directions and saw the android dive"
through a group of people half a block away. He tipped them over like
tenpins and ran on. Taber gripped the gun tight and started in pursuit.
He could not fire because there was enough sidewalk traffic to make it
"dangerous. On ahead, the android's path was blocked by a man. He sought"
to get clear but the android passed him close enough to jam the knife
into his neck and send him screaming to the sidewalk.
"A uniformed patrolman appeared on the other side of the street, further"
down. He took the situation in and understood Taber's frantic gesture. A
"car screamed to a halt as the patrolman raced across the street, drawing"
his gun.
"The android, seeing his escape cut off, veered into an areaway. The"
patrolman got there first and plunged in after him.
"Taber, gasps tearing at his lungs, arrived thirty seconds later. During"
"that time, he'd expected the sound of shots from the patrolman's gun."
But there was silence.
"He braked on his heels, skidded into the areaway, and saw the android"
"advancing on the patrolman. The latter stood motionless, the gun hanging"
useless at his side.
"""Drop! Drop!"" Taber yelled. He cursed as he tried to angle in the narrow"
areaway in order to get a clear shot.
"Mr. Coxon may be forgiven for being, on this same important Monday, in a"
state of some nervous excitement. He had a severe attack of what are
"vulgarly called ""the fidgets,"" and Sir John, who was spending the"
"morning at the Club (for his court was not sitting), glanced at him over"
his eye-glasses with an irritated look. The ex-Attorney-General would
"not sit still, but flitted continually from window to table, and back"
"from table to window, taking up and putting down journal after journal."
"Much depended, in Mr. Coxon's view, on the event of that day, for Sir"
"John spoke openly of his approaching retirement, and an appointment"
sometimes thought worthy of a Premier's acceptance might be in Coxon's
"grasp before many weeks were past, if only Medland and his noxious idea"
of getting a first-class man out from England could be swept together
into limbo.
"""What's the betting about to-night?"" asked the Chief Justice, as in one"
of his restless turns the brooding politician passed near.
"""We reckon to beat him by five,"" answered Coxon."
"""Unless any of your men turn tail, that is? I hear Fenton's very"
wobbly--says he daren't show his face in the North-east Ward if he
"throws Medland over."""
"""Oh, he's all right."""
"""Been promised something?"""
"""You might allow some of us to have consciences, Chief Justice,"" said"
"Coxon, with an attempt at geniality."
"""Oh, some of you, yes. But I'll pick my men, please,"" remarked Sir John,"
"with a pleasant smile. ""Perry's got a conscience, and Kilshaw--well,"
That evening I sat eating alone in the dining room. Since we had not
"brought back any haddock, the visitors upstairs had no desire to come"
"down. All they wanted, Eilert's wife said, was some bread and butter and"
milk to be sent up.
XXVIII
Next morning they had gone.
"Yes, indeed, they left at four in the morning, at dawn; I heard them"
"perfectly well, for my room was near the stairs. The knight of the plump"
"thighs came first, clumping heavily down the stairs. She hushed him, and"
her voice sounded angry.
"Eilert had just risen too, and they stood outside for some minutes,"
"negotiating with him for the boat--yes, at once; they had changed their"
"minds and wanted to leave, immediately. Then they went down to the boat,"
"Eilert with them. I could see them through the window, chilled by the cold"
of early morning and short-tempered with each other. There had been a
"frost during the night; ice lay on the water in the buckets, and the"
"ground was harsh to walk on. Poor things--no food, no coffee; a windy"
"morning, with the sea still running rather high. There they go with their"
knapsacks on their backs; she is still wearing her red hat.
"Well, it was no concern of mine, and I lay down again, intending to sleep"
"till about noon. Nothing was any concern of mine, except myself. I could"
"not see the boat from my bed, so I got up again--just to while the time"
"away--to see how far they had gone. Not very far, though both men were"
When the three lads came to the finger of granite upon the top of which
"the two fires showed, they first made a careful examination of the"
thickets close by and then ascended to the top.
"“These fires were made to constitute a signal, all right!” Jack"
"declared, poking at the now dying embers."
"“Sure!” answered Frank. “You see, no cooking was done here, and there is"
no camp in sight.”
"“Besides, the position of the blazes on this high rock shows that the"
"fires were built so that the columns of smoke might be seen,” suggested"
"Harry. “It was Indian talk, all right!”"
"“Well, there’s no one here in need of help so far as I can see!” laughed"
"Jack, “and so we may as well go back to the camp.”"
"“That’s the thing to do,” Frank urged. “To tell the truth, I don’t feel"
exactly right about leaving Gilroy there alone.”
"“Aw, we’ll hear him sleeping before we get within a rod of the cave,”"
"laughed Jack. “Gilroy is a good old chap, and father thinks a lot of"
"him, but he doesn’t know much about this kind of a life. I’ll bet that"
"right now he’s dreaming about grizzly bears, and lions, and crocodiles,"
and panthers.”
"From their position in the forest, after their departure from the rock,"
they could see nothing of the signal from the north which had attracted
"Jimmie’s attention, so there seemed nothing for them to do but to return"
to camp. Therefore they set out at good speed.
"""To what do you refer?"""
"""You told me that you loved me, Gerald,"" she said in a deep voice,"
"suddenly grown calm.  ""You swore by all you held most sacred that I was"
"all the world to you, and that no one should come between us.  Yet past"
events have shown that you have forgotten those words of yours on the
"day when we idled in the Bois beneath the trees.  You, too, remember"
"that day, do you not--the day when our lips met for the first time, and"
"we both believed our path would in future be strewn with flowers?  Ah!"""
"she sighed, ""and what an awakening life has been to me since then!"""
"""We parted because of your refusal to satisfy me as to the real state of"
"your feelings towards the man who was my enemy,"" I said rather warmly."
"""But was it justifiable?"" she asked in a tone of deep reproach and"
mingled sweetness.  Her blue eyes looked full upon me--those eyes that
"had held me in such fascination in the golden days of youth.  ""Has any"
single fact which you have since discovered verified your suspicions?
"Tell me truthfully;"" and she leaned towards me in an attitude of deepest"
earnestness.
"""No,"" I answered honestly, ""I cannot say that my suspicions have ever"
"been verified."""
"""And because of that you have returned to me when it is too late."""
"""Too late!""  I cried.  ""What do you mean?"""
"""Exactly what I have said.  You have come back to me when it is too"
"late."""
recognized by those whom I did know ha my former life.  There is scarce
an antechamber in those fine houses where patrons dwell where I might
not meet the curious and impertinent regard of those who would know me
"again. That I will not brook.""  And now Grey’s eyes flashed, thinking of"
"Lord Sandford, and how he would chuckle to hear how low his rival had"
"fallen.  ""No; if I am to succeed at all, I must needs do so without a"
"patron. If I fail, there is one resource left.  Able-bodied paupers are"
"sent to the wars.  I can go thither and fight."""
Again a smile flickered over the Old Lion’s face; but the tapster was
"entering with the smoking viands, and the gleam in Grey’s eyes bespoke"
the wolf within him.
"""Set to, my friend, and make a good meal.  When we have cleared the"
"trenchers, you shall come with me to my lodging.  I would hear the end"
"of your tale; but that can wait till after supper."""
*CHAPTER XI.*
*THE LION’S DEN.*
"""Welcome to the Lion’s Den!"" spoke the man Wylde, as he threw open the"
"door of a room which he had unlocked, and kicking a smouldering log upon"
"the hearth, evoked a cheery blaze, by the aid of which he lighted a lamp"
"that swung over a table littered with books, papers, and quills."
"Grey stepped within the threshold, and looked about him with curious"
eyes.  The house they had entered a few minutes before was a tall and
"had no use. Yet, yet--my original guess stuck firmly in my mind,"
"improbable though it might be, and had just been nailed down"
tightly--I scorn to mystify the reader--by a few simple sentences
spoken in French.
CHAPTER VII
THE MARINE SENTRY
We had a whole day to fill in before we could get any news of Dawson's
"vigil in the _Malplaquet_, and I have never known a day as drearily"
"long. Cary and I were both restless as peas on a hot girdle, and could"
not settle down to talk or to read or to write. Cary sought vainly to
persuade me to read and pass judgment upon his Navy Book. In spite of
my interest in the subject my soul revolted at the forbidding pile of
manuscript. I promised to read the proofs and criticise them with
"severity, but as for the M.S.--no, thanks. Poor Cary needed all his"
sweet patience to put up with me. By eleven o'clock we had become
"unendurable to one another, and I gladly welcomed his suggestion to"
"adjourn to his club, have lunch there, and try to inveigle the"
"Commander of the _Malplaquet_ into our net. ""I know him,"" said Cary."
"""He is a fine fellow; and though he must be pretty busy, he will be"
glad to lunch somewhere away from the ship. If we have luck we will go
"back with him and look over the _Malplaquet_ ourselves."""
"""If you can manage that, Cary, you will have my blessing."""
He did manage to work the luncheon part by telephoning to the yard
and whispered in his ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to
"act promptly. Crouching low, he slid over the edge of the car, hung"
"lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the"
"top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming"
it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional
manner of alighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger
"dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between"
a furniture van and a florist’s delivery wagon.
"The girl in the tan jacket turned again, and looked in the eyes of Mrs."
James Williams. Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck
auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the
plainclothes man.
"“What’s eatin’ you?” demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his"
professional discourse for pure English.
"“Keep her at anchor for a minute,” ordered the officer. “There’s a man"
on board we want—a Philadelphia burglar called ‘Pinky’ McGuire. There
"he is on the back seat. Look out for the side, Donovan.”"
Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams.
"“Come down, old sport,” he said, pleasantly. “We’ve got you. Back to"
"Sleepytown for yours. It ain’t a bad idea, hidin’ on a Rubberneck,"
though. I’ll remember that.”
Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor:
"“Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour.”"
James Williams belonged among the level heads. With necessary slowness
"Accordingly, within four hours of receiving his appointment, Terence"
"bade his parent farewell and proceeded by rail to Devonport, where"
"the ""Sunderland"" was lying. It was nearly dark when he alighted at"
Millbay station. Here he called a taxi and was whirled off to the
"Dockyard, whence a picquet boat conveyed him to the cruiser, which"
was lying at a buoy in the Hamoaze.
"""We're off under sealed orders at six o'clock tomorrow morning,"""
"announced one of his new shipmates, a junior lieutenant, Teddy"
"Barracombe by name. ""Of course, we are quite in the dark, but there's"
a strong idea floating around that the ship's off to the Near East.
Just my mark! According to all accounts we'll be pretty busy in the
"Dardanelles."""
"""That's all very fine for you,"" commented Oswestry, the torpedo"
"lieutenant, ""but where do I come in? We can't use torpedoes against"
"fortifications, you know, and there's precious little floating about"
"for us to go for."""
"""Don't take on, Torps,"" said Barracombe cheerfully. ""You never know"
"your luck. Wait and see."""
"""I'd rather t'were the other way about,"" corrected Torps. ""Seeing"
your torpedo leave the tube and waiting for the enemy ship to be
blown up. No Dardanelles for me. So I hope to goodness it's the North
"Sea. By Jove, I do!"""
"As soon as the ""Sunderland"" was clear of the breakwater the momentous"
orders were opened. It was not to the Near East; the cruiser had to
proceed to Dover and await further instructions.
"be prolonged, seeing that the glow of the sun-rising was already"
reddening the sky to the east.
Etienne was secretly fingering his beads. And El Sarria thought with
satisfaction of the safety of Dolóres; he had given up hope of Concha a
full hour ago. The ex-Miguelete had doubtless again played the traitor.
He took a cigarette from Rollo without speaking and followed him across
the uneven floor between the heaps of trodden grain.
"They were led down the stairway one by one, and as they passed through"
"the ground floor, with its thick woolly coating of grey flour dust, a"
"trumpet blew without, and they heard the trampling of horses in the"
courtyard.
"""Quick!"" said a voice at Rollo's elbow, ""here is your chocolate. Nothing"
like it for strengthening the knee-joints at a time like this. I've seen
"men die on wine and on rum and on brandy; but for me, give me a cup of"
"chocolate as good as that, when my time comes!"""
Rollo drank the thick sweet strength-giving stuff to the accompaniment
of clattering hoofs and jingling accoutrements.
"""Come!"" said a voice again, ""give me the cup. Do not keep the general"
"waiting. He is in no good temper this morning, and we are to march"
"immediately."""
The young man stepped out of the mill-door into the crisp chill of the
"dawn. All the east was a glory of blood-red cloud, and for the second"
time Rollo and his companions stood face to face with General Cabrera.
It was within a quarter of an hour of the sun-rising.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE FLIGHT.
"One of the men--it was I--muttered something to Marie, and she snuffed"
"the wick, and blew up the light. In a moment it filled the room,"
"disclosing a strange medley of levelled weapons, startled faces, and"
flashing eyes. In one corner Fraulein Max and the two women cowered
"behind one another, trembling and staring. At the table sat my lady,"
"with dull, dazed eyes, looking on, yet scarcely understanding what was"
"happening. On either side of her stood Steve and I, covering the"
"general with our pistols, while the Waldgrave, who was still too weak"
"for much exertion, kept guard at the door."
"Tzerclas was the first to speak. 'What is this foolery?' he said,"
scowling unutterable curses at us. 'What does this mean?'
"'This!' I said, producing a piece of hide rope. 'We are going to tie"
"you up. If you struggle, general, you die. If you submit, you live."
"That is all. Go to work, Steve.'"
"There was a gleam in Tzerclas' eye, which warned me to stand back and"
"crook my finger. His face was black with fury, and for an instant I"
thought that he would spring upon us and dare all. But prudence and
"the pistols prevailed. With an evil look he sat still, and in a trice"
Steve had a loop round his arms and was binding him to the heavy
chair.
I knew then that as far as he was concerned we were safe; and I turned
"to bid the women get cloaks and food, adjuring them to be quick, since"
"A sigh escaped her, and her hand sought my arm."
"""I was young once, m'sieur,"" she said in that calm, refined voice which"
had long ago always sounded so much to me like that of my own dead
"mother.  ""I understand your feeling--I understand perfectly.  It is only"
my poor daughter who does not understand.  She knows that you have
"forsaken her--that is all."""
It was upon my tongue to lay bare to her the secret of my heart's
"longings, yet I hesitated.  I remembered that calm, serious, sweet-faced"
"woman on the other side of the English Channel, far from the glare and"
glitter of life as I knew it--the fevered life which the diplomat in
"Paris is forced to lead.  I remembered my troth to Edith, and my"
conscience pricked me.
"""Could it be possible,"" I reflected, ""that Yolande was really in the pay"
"of a Government hostile to England?""  Kaye was already nearing Berlin"
with the intention of searching out her actions and exposing her as a
"spy, while Anderson had already denounced her as having been a party to"
an attempt to secure the secret which he had carried from Berlin to
Downing Street.
With a mother's solicitude the Countess could for some time only speak
"of Yolande's mysterious attack; but at last, in order to prosecute my"
"inquiries further, I observed, during a lull in the conversation:"
"""At the Baroness de Chalencon's last night a friend of yours inquired"
"about you, madame."""
"""A friend?  Who?"""
"“Came in here an’ got some grub a full hour ago,” that servitor"
explained briefly. “When he’d eat it he went off agin.”
“Didn’t he say where he was going?” Bainbridge asked.
The cook shook his head. “Nary word.”
“And you didn’t happen to see what direction he took?”
"“Nary a sight,” was the reply. “I was busy inside.”"
"Bob frowned for a second, and then shrugged his shoulders. After all,"
"what did it matter where the fellow had gone, so long as he had taken"
himself away? It was very natural for him to avoid the man who had so
"humiliated him, though it was rather puzzling to have him slip away"
without apparently encountering any one.
"Bob proceeded to give his orders to the cook, explaining that he would"
have to pull up stakes at once and start down the river.
"“The boys will be a long way from here by nightfall,” he said, “so"
you’ll have to hustle. I’ve saved out a couple of men to help you and
"the cookee, who’ll be under your orders till you pitch camp to-night.”"
Outside the mess tent he hesitated an instant. Then he entered the other
"tent. This time he did not pause by the door, but crossed hastily to the"
"farther corner, where there was a small space crudely partitioned off"
"from the main portion. This would be Schaeffer’s sanctum, of course, and"
Bob entered it curiously--only to stop with an exclamation of mingled
"surprise, anger, and chagrin."
The place was in the utmost disorder. Blankets were rolled up in a ball
"second he stood in awkward silence, swallowing hard in his"
embarrassment. Then he raised his head again.
"“I don’t need your job,” he said, in a poor imitation of devil-may-care"
"defiance. “I’ll get my time, and----”"
Bainbridge cut him short. “You’ll get down to the drive and _work_. Beat
it now--quick!”
"Without another protesting word, Kollock turned meekly and obeyed."
CHAPTER XII. THE TEST
"Before he had taken a dozen steps, Kollock was furious with himself, and"
by the time Bainbridge was out of sight the wrath of the riverman had
risen to a white heat.
From the first he had tried to dislike Bainbridge. Pete Schaeffer had
"been his friend, and after he had been whipped Curly made up his mind"
that there could be no getting along in a crew bossed by the victor.
Then came that brief but pointed interview with Bob which affected him
so oddly. He had never before had anybody tell him that he was to be
"trusted; most bosses had been emphatic in saying the opposite thing. Or,"
"if they kept silent, they showed in a dozen obvious ways that they"
considered him in the same class with his notorious brother.
Then there was the incident of the day before. Curly could not help
admiring the manner in which Bainbridge had handled the crowd that was
trying to hold up the drive. It was exactly the sort of thing he would
"like to have done himself, and his heart warmed toward the man with the"
"courage and ability to act in that fashion. Moreover, Jack Joyce was an"
"""No, you have a problem."" She examined him confidently. ""Because if"
"those materials are not returned to us, we will be forced to take"
"actions you may find harsh."""
"""Give it your best shot,"" he went on, glancing at Eva and hoping they"
"could keep up the bravado, ""because we've got a few cards in our hand"
too. Forget the money--that's history now--but we could still be in a
"position to blow your whole project sky high."""
"""You two are the only ones outside our organization who know about the"
"protocol. That knowledge will not be allowed to go any farther."""
"""Don't be so sure. For all you know, we've already stashed a copy"
"somewhere. Left word that if anything happens to either one of us, the"
package gets sent to the papers. Made public. Think what some premature
"headlines would do for your little project."""
"""We have thought about it, Mr. Vance. That contingency has been"
"covered."""
"""Well, if I don't know what the other player's got, I tend to trust my"
"own cards."""
But why play at all? he suddenly found himself musing. Fold this hand
and go for the next move.
"Before leaving Crete he'd transmitted a copy of the protocol, still in"
"its encrypted form, to his office computer in Nassau. At the time it'd"
merely seemed like prudence; now it might turn out to be a lifeline.
One phone call and it could be transmitted back here this very
afternoon. The magic of satellites in space. Knock out another quick
"kept the drive from jamming. He was hot and sweaty, and generally weary"
"as he continued his way downstream, and his wrath was naturally instant"
"when, on suddenly rounding a bend, he came upon Curly Kollock, cool,"
"calm, and unruffled, sitting comfortably on a rock, enjoying a"
cigarette.
"As the latter saw Bainbridge, he flushed slightly, and half rose from"
"the bowlder. Then, with a stubborn twist of his lips, he sank back"
"again, pulling hard on the cigarette, and doing his best to look"
unconcerned.
"Bob walked straight up to him, and stopped."
"“Well,” he said bitingly, “I’m sorry you’ve lost the use of your feet"
and hands. Is it paralysis?”
"Kollock’s flush deepened, and he mumbled something inane about taking a"
"smoke. He found that he had arisen, apparently without volition, and was"
"standing before the other man, who stared at him a long half minute."
"“This is no rest cure,” said Bob at length. “You’re paid for helping the"
"drive along. I don’t want any loafers in this gang. Understand? Now, get"
down to the head of the drive--and do something!”
"Kollock’s face was flaming, and his eyes gleamed angrily. “I don’t take"
"that line of talk from anybody!” he growled, clenching his fists"
threateningly. “I’ll----”
"“You’ll do what I said, and do it quick!” Bainbridge’s voice was not"
"raised above a conversational pitch, but there was a ring in it which"
seemed to take the fight and bluster out of the big riverman with the
effectiveness of a keen knife thrust into an inflated bladder. For a
Wherewith they played so prettily
"That Lucifer laughed merrily,"
And all the residue of the fiends
Did laugh thereat full well like friends.

"Now, by our honour, said Lucifer,"
No devil in hell shall withhold her;
"And if thou wouldest have twenty mo,"
"Wert not for justice, they should go."
For all we devils within this den
Have more to-do with two women
Than with all the charge we have beside;

Apply thy pardons to women so
That unto us there come no mo.
"_Johan Johan_, or, at greater length, _The Merry Play between Johan"
"Johan the Husband, Tyb his Wife, and Sir Jhon the Priest_ (printed"
"1533), contains only the three characters mentioned, but possesses a"
"theme more nearly deserving the name of plot than do the other two,"
"namely, the contriving and carrying out of a plan by Tyb for exposing"
"her boastful husband's real and absolute subjection to her rule. Yet,"
"even so, it is extremely simple. Johan Johan is first heard alone,"
declaring how he will beat his wife for not being at home. The tuggings
"of fear and valour in his heart, however, give his monologue an"
"argumentative form, in which first one motive and then the other gains"
"the upper hand, very similar to the conflict between Launcelot Gobbo's"
conscience and the Devil. He closes in favour of the beating and
then--Tyb comes home. Oh the difference! Johan Johan suspects his wife
"and saw, a hundred yards or so away, a bent and dreary figure trudging"
down the metal paving of the street. It was a figure like those to be
"seen on Earth, which placed it as belonging to Greca's race."
"The tall leader drew forth one of the shock-tubes. Seen near at hand,"
it was observed to be bafflingly simple in appearance. It seemed
devoid of all mechanism--simply a tube of reddish metal with a sort of
handle formed of a coil of heavy wire.
The Rogan pointed the tube at the distant figure.
"Greca screamed, and screamed again. Coincident with her cry, as though"
"the sound of it had felled him, the distant slave dropped to the"
pavement.
*       *       *       *       *
That was all. The tube had merely been pointed: as far as Brand could
"see, the Rogan's ""hand"" had not moved on the barrel of the tube, nor"
even constricted about the coil of wire that formed its handle. Yet
"that distant figure had dropped. Furthermore, fumes of greasy black"
smoke now began to arise from the huddled body; and in less than
thirty seconds there was left no trace of it on the gleaming metal
pavement.
"""So that's what those things are like at full power!"" breathed Dex."
"""My God!"""
"The Rogan leader spoke a few words. Greca, huddled despairingly on the"
"floor, crushed by this brutal annihilation of one of her country-men"
"before her very eyes, did not translate. But translation was"
"unnecessary. The Rogan's icy, triumphant eyes, the very posture of"
"was striving after speech. Slyne, outwardly cool and contemptuous of his"
"visible fury, stood gazing down at him, hands in pockets. Mr. Jobling"
"was wriggling restlessly in his chair, glancing from one to the other,"
prepared to flee from the coming storm.
"Still without a word, Captain Dove reached again for the"
"brandy-decanter, directly defying Slyne. Slyne stepped forward and"
snatched it out of his hand.
"Simultaneously, the old man and Mr. Jobling sprang from their seats, the"
"former making for Slyne and the latter for the door, which opened just"
"as he reached it, so that he all but fell over a boy in buttons who had"
knocked and entered carrying a telegram on a tray.
"Slyne had not moved. Captain Dove, almost at his throat, spun round on"
one heel.
"""For me?"" Mr. Jobling exclaimed anxiously as he ripped the envelope"
open. And a slow pallor overspread his puffy pink features while he was
perusing its contents.
"""From Mullins, my managing clerk,"" he mumbled as he passed the message"
"to Slyne, who looked it over indifferently, and then re-read it aloud in"
"a low but very ominous voice: ""'_American claimant landed at Genoa"
yesterday. Now on way to London. Court granted decree in his favour._'
"Handed in at Chancery Lane, in London,""--he pulled out his watch--""fifty"
"minutes ago."""
The page-boy had disappeared. Slyne pushed suddenly past Mr. Jobling and
set his back against the door. Captain Dove was approaching the
"terrified solicitor softly, on tiptoe, his fists clenched, all his"
tobacco-stained fangs displayed in a grin of fury. One of his long arms
"""I win,"" he announced, briefly, his eyes alone betraying the inward"
"fever. He dropped the cards before her on the table. ""Three kings,--and"
"the _last hand_!"""
"Suddenly, as though some inward cord had snapped under the strain, the"
"Girl collapsed. Limply she slid downward in her chair, one groping hand"
"straying aimlessly to her forehead, then dropping of its own weight."
"""Quick, Jack,--I'm ill,--git me somethin'!"" The voice trailed off to"
nothingness as the drooping eyelids closed.
"In real consternation, the Sheriff sprang to his feet. In one sweeping"
"glance his alert eye caught the whisky bottle upon the mantel. ""All"
"right, Girl, I'll fix you in no time,"" he said cheeringly over his"
shoulder. But where the deuce did she keep her tumblers? The next minute
he was groping for them in the dark of the adjoining closet and softly
cursing himself for his own slowness.
"Instantaneously, the Girl came to life. The unturned cards upon the"
table vanished with one lightning movement; the Girl's hand disappeared
"beneath her skirts, raised for the moment knee-high; then the same,"
"swift reverse motion, and the cards were back in place, while the Girl's"
"eyes trembled shut again, to hide the light of triumph in them. A smile"
flickered on her lips as the Sheriff returned with the glass and bottle.
"""Never mind,--I'm better now,"" her lips shaped weakly."
"The Sheriff set down the bottle, and put his arm around the Girl with a"
rough tenderness.
"""Oh, you only fainted because you lost,"" he told her."
"Averting her gaze, the Girl quietly disengaged herself, rose to her feet"
"""I am going up to try and see the Premier at the House to-day,"" he said."
"""I think we shall have to trouble him. You see, he knew Gaspard as well"
"as the deceased."""
"""I'll give you a lift. You can keep out of the way till he's at"
"leisure."""
"At this moment one of the police entered, and handed the Superintendent"
a copy of the _Evening Mail_.
"""It's as you feared, sir,"" he remarked as he went out."
"The Superintendent opened the paper, looked at it for an instant, and"
then indicated a passage with his forefinger.
"""It is rumoured,"" read Mr. Kilshaw, ""that certain very startling facts"
"have come to light regarding the identity of the deceased man Benham,"
"and that the name of a very prominent politician, now holding an exalted"
"office, is likely to be introduced into the case. As the matter will be"
"public property to-morrow, we may be allowed to state that trustworthy"
reports point to the fact of the Premier being in a position to give
some important information as to the past life of the deceased. It is
"said that a photograph of two persons, one of whom is Mr. Medland, has"
been discovered among the papers at Mr. Benham's (or we should say
Benyon's) lodgings. Further developments of this strange affair will be
"awaited with interest."""
"""I wish,"" commented the Superintendent grimly, ""that my men could keep a"
"secret as well as their man can sniff one out."""
But Mr. Kilshaw was too excited to listen.
"""Oh, there's nothing in it,"" said the watchmaker reassuringly. He had"
not a letter in his pocket.
"The doorkeeper opened his mouth to speak, but seeing his wife"
"approaching, he shut it again and busied himself with his meal."
"""What was the letter, Ned?"""
"""Oh, about the procession,"" he answered."
"""Then you got it too late. Who was it from?"""
"""If you'd give us the tea,"" he broke out roughly, ""and let the damned"
"letter alone, it 'ud be a deal better."""
"""La, you needn't fly out at a woman so,"" said Mrs. Evans. ""It ain't the"
"way to treat his wife, is it, mister?"""
"""Mister"" gallantly reproved his friend, but pleaded that they were both"
"weary, and weary legs made short tempers. Giving them the tea, she left"
them to themselves; her work was not finished till three small children
were safely in bed.
The sensation of having one's neck for the first time within measurable
"distance of a rope must needs be somewhat disquieting. The doorkeeper,"
"in spite of his secret society doings, was a timid man, with a vastly"
"respectful fear of the law. To talk about things, to vapour idly about"
"them over the cups, is very different from being actually, even though"
"remotely, mixed up in them. Ned Evans was a man of some education: he"
"read the papers, accounts of crimes and reports of trials; he had heard"
of accessories after and before the fact. Was he not an accessory after
"the fact? He fancied they did not hang such; but if they caught him, and"
"shut his mouth by and by, when I have more time to attend to such"
"matters."""
"""How much do you want?"" Slyne inquired with a frown evidently meant to"
warn his friend to be modest.
"""Can you spare twenty pounds--to go on with?"""
"Slyne hesitated, but only for a few seconds. Then he pulled out a"
pocket-book and surreptitiously passed that sum to the penniless man of
"law, who accepted it with no more than a nod of thanks."
"""I'll pay Mullins now,"" he remarked, and immediately hurried out of the"
room. Captain Dove was gasping for breath and showed every other symptom
of a forthcoming explosion.
"As soon as the door shut behind him, the old man gave open vent to his"
wrath. And a most furious quarrel followed between Slyne and him.
"Sallie, too, learned then, for the first time, of the vast inheritance"
"which would be hers, of Slyne's cunning plan to buy Captain Dove out for"
"a mere pittance, and how he himself expected to profit through marrying"
her.
But she was not overwhelmed with surprise by that belated discovery. She
had almost anticipated the final disclosure of some such latent motive
behind all Slyne's professions to her. The only difference it might make
would be to Captain Dove. Slyne and he were still snarling at each other
when Mr. Jobling walked jauntily in again. But at sight of him Captain
Dove began to subside.
"""We mustn't be late. Mr. Spettigrew will be expecting us now. I've sent"
"Mullins on ahead with my papers,"" observed Mr. Jobling breezily, and"
"girl's arm and whispered in her ear that she must be brave, a true"
"Andaluse, and not compromise the expedition by any spoken word."
"Concha turned indignantly upon her, shaking off her restraining hand as"
she did so.
"""Do you think I am a fool?"" she whispered. ""I will do nothing to spoil"
"their chances. But oh, Giralda, at any moment he might be shot!"""
"""Trust José Maria. He hath taken risks far greater than this,"" said La"
"Giralda in a low voice, wilfully mistaking her meaning. But Concha,"
"quite unconsoled, did nothing but clasp her hands and quicken her"
supplications to the Virgin.
"The ladder was reared against the gilded iron railing and Rollo mounted,"
immediately dropping lightly down on the further side. The Sergeant
"followed, and presently both were on the ground. At a word from Rollo,"
El Sarria pushed the ladder over and the two received it and laid it
along the parapet in a place where it would remain completely hidden
till wanted.
"The two moved off together in the direction of the porter's lodge, at"
"the door of which the Sergeant knocked lightly, and then, obtaining no"
"answer, with more vehemence. A window was lifted and a frightened voice"
asked who came there at that time of night.
The Sergeant answered with some sharpness that they wished for the key
of the great gate.
Upon this the same old woman who had ushered out La Giralda appeared
"trembling at the lattice, and was but little relieved when the Sergeant,"
"putting on his most serious air, informed her that her life was in the"
to the minute. In his earlier days he had frequently felt the same
"nervousness, the same intense mental activity, just prior to an"
"important race or game, and he was familiar with those disquieting,"
"panicky moments when, for no apparent reason, his heart thumped and a"
"physical sickness mastered him. He knew that the fever would leave him,"
"once the salmon began to run, just as it had always vanished at the"
crack of the starter's pistol or the shrill note of the referee's
"whistle. He was eager for action, eager to find himself possessed of"
"that gloating, gruelling fury that drives men through to the finish"
"line. Meanwhile, he was anxious to divert his mind into other channels."
Cherry's house was situated a short distance above the cannery which
"served as Willis Marsh's headquarters, and Boyd's path necessarily took"
him past his enemy's very stronghold. Finding the tide too high to
"permit of passing beneath the dock, he turned up among the buildings,"
"where, to his surprise, he encountered his own day-foreman talking"
earnestly with a stranger.
"The fisherman started guiltily as he saw him, and Boyd questioned him"
sharply.
"""What are you doing here, Larsen?"""
"""I just walked up after supper to have a talk with an old mate."""
"""Who is he?"" Boyd glanced suspiciously at Larsen's companion."
"""He's Mr. Marsh's foreman."""
"Emerson spoke out bluntly: ""See here. I don't like this. These people"
"have caused me a lot of trouble already, and I don't want my men"
"hanging around here."""
whilst I settle the bill and ask for food for the journey. The brown
woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of
"coarse boiled pork, and gives me two of these, hot, with bread and salt."
This is the luncheon. I pay the bill: which amounts to twenty-four
"francs, for everything. (One says francs or liras, irrespective, in"
"Italy.) At that moment arrives the train from Cagliari, and men rush in,"
"roaring for the soup--or rather, for the broth. ""Ready, ready!"" she"
"cries, going to the black pot."
V.
TO SORGONO.
"The various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long,"
long talks before at last we were off. It was wonderful to be running in
"the bright morning towards the heart of Sardinia, in the little train"
"that seemed so familiar. We were still going third class, rather to the"
disgust of the railway officials at Mandas.
"At first the country was rather open: always the long spurs of hills,"
"steep-sided, but not high. And from our little train we looked across"
"the country, across hill and dale. In the distance was a little town, on"
"a low slope. But for its compact, fortified look it might have been a"
town on the English downs. A man in the carriage leaned out of the
"window holding out a white cloth, as a signal to someone in the far off"
"town that he was coming. The wind blew the white cloth, the town in the"
distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow. And the little train
pelted along.
"she had reached the great dramatic moment, the child raised his hands"
"in terror and said: “Oh! Auntie, don't let the bear _really_ eat the"
boy!”
"“Don't you know,” said an impatient boy who had been listening to a"
"mild adventure story considered suitable to his years, “that I don't"
take any interest in the story until the decks are dripping with gore?”
Here we have no opportunity of deciding whether or not the actual
description demanded would be more alarming than the listener had
realised.
"Here is a poem of James Stephens, showing a child's taste for"
sensational things:--
A man was sitting underneath a tree
"Outside the village, and he asked me"
"What name was upon this place, and said he"
Was never here before. He told a
Lot of stories to me too. His nose was flat.
"I asked him how it happened, and he said,"
"The first mate of the  “Mary Ann”  done that,"
"With a marling-spike one day, but he was dead,"
"And a jolly job too, but he'd have gone a long way to have"
killed him.
"A gold ring in one ear, and the other was bit off by a crocodile,"
"bedad,"
That's what he said: He taught me how to chew.
He was a real nice man. He liked me too.
The taste that is fed by the sensational contents of the newspapers
"and the dramatic excitement of street life, and some of the lurid"
"representations of the Kinematograph, is so much stimulated that the"
I'm afraid the door of this little paradise might be shut to me after--
"Let's say this is my one hour--the hour that gave me--that kiss I want."""
"""Go long! You go to grass!"" returned the Girl with a nervous little"
laugh.
"Johnson made one more effort and won out; that is, he succeeded, at"
"last, in getting her in his grasp."
"""Listen,"" said the determined lover, pleading for a kiss as he would"
have pleaded for his very life.
"It was at this juncture that Wowkle, silently, stealthily, emerged from"
the cupboard and made her way over to the door. Her feet were heavily
moccasined and she was blanketed in a stout blanket of gay colouring.
"""Ugh--some snow!"" she muttered, as a gust of wind beat against her face"
"and drove great snow-flakes into the room, fairly taking her breath"
"away. But her words fell on deaf ears. For, oblivious to the storm that"
"was now raging outside, the youthful pair of lovers continued to"
concentrate their thoughts upon the storm that was raging within their
"own breasts, the Girl keeping up the struggle with herself, while the"
man urged her on as only he knew how.
"""Why, if I let you take one you'd take two,"" denied the Girl,"
"half-yielding by her very words, if she but knew it."
"""No, I wouldn't--I swear I wouldn't,"" promised the man with great"
earnestness.
"""Ugh--very bad!"" was the Indian woman's muffled ejaculation as she"
peered out into the night. But she had promised her lover to come to him
the fact that at one time I thought this passage beautiful. But the beat
of the blank verse carried me on. Sometimes it seemed to blend with the
buzzing of those angry wasps above and sometimes the two rhythms would
"vie with each other for speed, so that they hurried along each"
alternately ahead of the other. I came to a line where my memory failed
"me. I faltered for a moment, but the droning sound seemed to grow into"
"an enormous roar, and I leapt back to the beginning:"
"""He above the rest...."""
and then on and on a second time until my head throbbed with the double
pulsation.
Suddenly a man who had been lying on the far side of the marquee got up
and said:
"""I've had enough of this, I'm going to sleep in a ditch."""
"He went off. The wasps were still buzzing, but the interruption had"
broken the spell. I felt a sense of relief. I became conscious of
intense weariness and felt ashamed of my fears. I cursed the German
"aeroplanes and thought, ""Let them do their worst, I don't care."" I made"
up my mind to go to sleep and resolutely buried my face in my pillow.
Then it occurred to me that I would never be able to enjoy _Paradise
"Lost_ again, and I was half-amused and agreeably distracted by the"
trivial thought.
But the wasps were still buzzing. Another man began to groan loudly:
"""Gawd--this is bloody awful--why the bloody 'ell can't they leave us"
"alone!"""
CHAPTER V
BAFFLED
"When at last I arrived at Cary's flat it was very late, and I was"
exceedingly tired and out of temper. A squadron of Zeppelins had been
"reported from the sea, the air-defence control at Newcastle had sent"
"out the preliminary warning ""F.M.W.,"" and the speed of my train had"
been reduced to about fifteen miles an hour. I had expected to get in
"to dinner, but it was eleven o'clock before I reached my destination."
"I had not even the satisfaction of seeing a raid, for the Zepps, made"
"cautious by recent heavy losses, had turned back before crossing the"
"line of the coast. Cary and his wife fell upon my neck, for we were"
"old friends, condoled with me, fed me, and prescribed a tall glass of"
mulled port flavoured with cloves. My stern views upon the need for
Prohibition in time of war became lamentably weakened.
"By midnight I had recovered my philosophic outlook upon life, and Cary"
began to enlighten me upon the details of the grave problem which had
brought me eagerly curious to his city.
"""I expect that Dawson will drop in some time to-night,"" he said. ""All"
"hours are the same to him. I told him that you were on the way, and he"
"wants to give you the latest news himself. He is dead set upon you,"
"Copplestone. I can't imagine why."""
"""Am I then so very unattractive?"" I inquired drily. ""It seems to me"
"that Dawson is a man of sound judgment."""
"""I confess that I do not understand why he lavishes so much attention"
"in the Absence of any such Order, or so far as any such Order does not"
"extend, then in such Manner and Form and subject to such Regulations as"

"""No!"" he exclaimed. ""I'm not a fighting man, but I'm a good general."
"You know, Napoleon was about my size."""
"""I never noticed the resemblance,"" remarked Fraser."
"""All the same, your idea ain't so bad,"" said Balt. ""There's somebody"
"stirring those fellows up, and I think it's that detective. I wouldn't"
"mind getting my hands on him, and if you'll all stick with me I'll go"
"out after him."""
"""Not for mine,"" hastily declared ""Fingerless"" Fraser. ""I don't want to"
"fight anybody. I'm here as a spectator."""
"""You're not afraid?"" questioned Emerson."
"""Not exactly afraid, but what's the use of my getting mixed up in this"
"row? It ain't _my_ cannery."""
"Now, while a mob is by nature noisy and threatening, there is little"
real danger in it until its diffusive violence is directed into one
"channel by a leader. Then, indeed, it becomes a terrible thing, and to"
"the watchers at the dock it became evident, in time, that a guiding"
"influence was at work among their enemies. Sure enough, late in the"
"afternoon of the fourth day, without a moment's warning, the strikers"
"rushed in a body, bearing down the guards like reeds. They came so"
unexpectedly that there was no time to muster reinforcements at the
"gate; almost before the fishermen could drop their tasks, their enemies"
were inside the building and pandemonium had broken loose. The
"structure rocked to the tumult of pounding heels, of yells and"
"imprecations, the lofty roof serving to toss back and magnify the"
CHAPTER XXII
HIS MOTHER'S ROSARY
"It was, as the soldier had said most truly, a cold morning to be shot"
"in. But the Carlists, accustomed to Cabrera's summary methods, appeared"
"to think but little of the matter, and jested as the firing parties were"
selected and drawn out. Ragged and desolate they looked as they stood on
"a slight slope between the foreigners and the red dawn, biting their"
cartridges and fingering the pulls of their rifles with hands numbed
with cold. At elbow and knee their rags of uniforms flapped like bunches
of ribbons at a fair.
"""In the garden!"" whispered Luis Fernandez to Cabrera."
"""To the garden!"" commanded the general, lighting a new cigarette and"
"puffing vigorously, ""and at this point I may as well bid you good-bye. I"
"wish our acquaintance had been pleasanter. But the fortune of war,"
gentlemen! My mother had not so long time to say her prayers at the
"hands of your friend Nogueras--and she was a woman and old, gentlemen. I"
"doubt not you know as well how to die as she?"""
"And they did. Not one of them uttered a word. John Mortimer, seeing"
"there was now no chance of making his thousand pounds, set an example"
"of unbending dignity. He comported himself, indeed, exactly as he would"
"have done on his marriage day. That is, he knew that the eyes of many"
"were upon him, and he resolved not to shame the performance. So he went"
through his part with the exact English mixture of awkward shyness and
The duke ignited a pine-wood torch. The blue resinous light spluttered
in the wind.
"Three times he circled it above his head, then he flung it into the"
sea.
"""Bernardo Sarriano and the Pisan galleys,"" he turned to Francesco."
"""They are heading for the Cape of Circé."""
A shout of command rang through the woods.
As with phantom cohorts the forest-aisles teemed with moving shadows.
A ride of some five miles lay between them and the Cape of Circé. Much
of that region was wild forest land and moor; bleak rocky wastes let
"into woods and gloom. Great oaks, gnarled, vast, terrible, held giant"
sway amid the huddled masses of the underbrush. Here the wild boar
lurked and the wolf hunted. But for the most it was dark and
"calamitous, a ghostly wilderness forsaken by man."
As they rode along they struck the occasional trail of the Crusaders
"of the Church. A burnt hamlet, a smoking farmhouse with a dun mist"
"hanging over it like a shroud, and once they stumbled upon the body of"
a dead girl. They halted for a brief space to give her burial. The
duke's men dug a shallow grave under an oak and they left her there
and went on their way with greater caution.
"""There is one man on earth to whom I owe a debt,"" the duke, leading"
"the van beside Francesco, turned to the latter, ""a debt that shall be"
"paid this night, principal and interest."""
"Francesco looked up into the duke's face, and by the glare of the now"
CHAPTER XXIII
THE POTTER'S WHEEL
'Life is like a great whirlpool wherein we are dashed to and fro by
our passions.'--_Saying of the Buddha._
"It is a hard teaching, this of the Buddha about death. It is a teaching"
"that may appeal to the reason, but not to the soul, that when life goes"
"out, this thing which we call 'I' goes out with it, and that love and"
remembrance are dead for ever.
It is so hard a teaching that in its purity the people cannot believe
"it. They accept it, but they have added on to it a belief which changes"
"the whole form of it, a belief that is the outcome of that weakness of"
humanity which insists that death is not and cannot be all.
"Though to the strict Buddhist death is the end of all worldly passion,"
"to the Burmese villager that is not so. He cannot grasp, he cannot"
"endure that it should be so, and he has made for himself out of Buddhism"
a belief that is opposed to all Buddhism in this matter.
"He believes in the transmigration of souls, in the survival of the 'I.'"
"The teaching that what survives is not the 'I,' but only the result of"
"its action, is too deep for him to hold. True, if a flame dies the"
"effects that it has caused remain, and the flame is dead for ever. A new"
"flame is a new flame. But the 'I' of man cannot die, he thinks; it lives"
and loves for all time.
"surely do as much for a mountain gipsy if, as you said just now, the"
"range is likely to be a short one!"""
Rollo began somewhat to change his opinion about the husband of the
"Queen. At first he had seemed both dandy and coward, a combination which"
Rollo held in the utmost contempt. But when Rollo had once seen him
"handle a gun, he began to have more respect for his recent Excellency"
the Duke of Rianzares.
"""Can you tell us, from your military experience,"" Rollo asked, ""which is"
"the most easily vulnerable part of this palace."""
"""It is easily vulnerable in every part,"" answered Muñoz, carelessly"
snapping the lock of a rifle again and again.
"""Nay, but be good enough to listen, sir,"" cried Rollo, with some heat."
"""There are women and children here. You do not know the gipsies. You do"
not know by whom they are led. You do not know the oaths of death and
"torture they have sworn----"""
"""By whom are they led?"" said Muñoz, still playing carelessly with the"
"rifle. ""I thought such fellows were mere savages from the hills, and"
"might be slaughtered like sheep."""
"""Perhaps--at any rate they are led by your own daughter!"" said Rollo,"
"briefly, growing nettled at the parvenu grandee's seeming indifference."
"""_My daughter!_"" cried Muñoz, losing in a moment his bright complexion,"
"and becoming of a slaty pallor, ""my daughter, that mad imp of hell--who"
"thrice has tried to assassinate me!"""
"And as he spoke, he let the gun fall upon the floor at his feet. Then he"
complete and solemn silence. Only in front of the door several
"she-goats, with bunching, over-full udders, waited to be milked with"
plaintive whimperings and tokens of unrest.
La Giralda looked at her companion. The Sergeant looked at La Giralda.
The same thought was in the heart of each.
"La Giralda went up quickly to the door, and knocked loudly. At"
"farmhouses in Old Castile it is necessary to knock loudly, for the"
"family lives on the second floor, while the first is given up to bundles"
"of fuel, trusses of hay, household provender of the more indestructible"
"sort, and one large dog which invariably answers the door first and"
expresses in an unmistakable manner his intention of making his
breakfast off the stranger's calves.
But not even the dog responded to the clang of La Giralda's oaken cudgel
"on the stout door panels. Accordingly she stepped within, and without"
"ceremony ascended the stairs. In the house-place, extended on a bed, lay"
"a woman of her own age, dead, her face wearing an expression of the"
utmost agony.
In a low trundle-bed by the side of the other was a little girl of four.
"Her hands clasped a doll of wood tightly to her bosom. But her eyes,"
"though open, were sightless. She also was dead."
"La Giralda turned and came down the stairs, shaking her head mournfully."
"""These at least are ours,"" she said, when she came out into the hot"
"summer air, pointing to the little flock of goats. ""There is none to"
"hinder us."""
"""Have the owners fled?"" asked the Sergeant, quickly."
"""I will undertake that no one of them hath ever been further South than"
"this village of Sarria,"" said Concha, somewhat hastily, and without"
sufficient authority.
Cabrera looked at the papers. There was a Carlist commission in the name
"of Don Rollo Blair duly made out, a letter from General Elio, chief of"
"the staff, commending all the four by name and description to all good"
"servants of Don Carlos, as trustworthy persons engaged on a dangerous"
"and secret mission. Most of all, however, he seemed to be impressed with"
"the ring belonging to Etienne, with its revolving gem and concealed"
portrait of Carlos the Fifth.
"He placed it on his finger and gazing intently, asked to whom it"
"belonged. As soon as he understood, he summoned the little Frenchman to"
"his presence. Etienne came at the word, calm as usual, and twirling his"
moustache in the manner of Rollo.
"""This is your ring?"" he demanded of the prisoner. Concha tried to catch"
Etienne's eye to signal to him that he must give Cabrera that upon which
his fancy had lighted. But her former lover stubbornly avoided her eye.
"""That is my ring,"" he answered dryly, after a cursory inspection of the"
article in question as it lay in the palm of the _guerillero's_ hand.
"""It is very precious to you?"" asked the butcher of Tortosa,"
suggestively.
"""It was given to me by my cousin, the king,"" answered Etienne, briefly."
"""Then I presume you do not care to part with it?"" said Cabrera, turning"
"it about on his finger, and holding it this way and that to the light."
"“And then,” Frank went on, “Dad might take a notion to send an"
"expedition out here to round up these dirty greasers. If he does, I’m"
coming out just on purpose to see them hanged.”
“Cut it out!” advised Jack.
"“Of all the rotten, unwashed specimens of humanity I ever came across,”"
"Frank continued, speaking in a still louder tone, “this escort of ours"
takes the bun. They’re imitation bad-men all right.”
"“A little of that goes a long way, young man,” the leader of the party"
"said. “It makes no difference to me what you say, but several of these"
men understand the English language and can speak it fluently.”
"“I presume so,” returned Frank. “I’ve seen just such a collection as"
"that in jail in New York. Say, honest, Captain,” he went on, “if a bunch"
"like this should run up against the strong-arm squad in New York, they’d"
get their heads beaten off just because of their ugly mugs.”
"“Aw, what’s the use!” demanded Harry."
"By this time several of the guards were casting ugly glances at Frank,"
who seemed to regard their disfavor with great joy.
"“You’d better come on ahead and walk with me, young fellow,” the leader"
"said, taking Frank roughly by the arm and jerking him to a position in"
"front. “If you get back there where those ugly ones are, they’ll put a"
couple of bullets into your back and swear that you were trying to
escape.”
"On his way to the front of the party, Frank passed Jack and paused for a"
Laura found herself besieged by the Englishman; she couldn’t decide to
"discourage him entirely, and at critical moments she would take the"
"train, go off to Naples, and come back two or three days later,"
doubtless with more strength for withstanding the siege.
"“As a matter of reciprocal justice, since he makes love to my sister,"
"I ought to make love to his wife,” thought Cæsar, and he went several"
times to the Hotel Excelsior to call on Susanna.
The Yankee wife was full of complaints against her husband. Her father
"had advised her simply to get a divorce, but she didn’t want to."
"She found such a solution lacking in distinction, and no doubt she"
"considered the advice of an author in her own country very true, who had"
given this triple injunction to the students of a woman’s college: “Do
"not drink, that is, do not drink too much; do not smoke, that is, do not"
"smoke too much; and do not get married, that is, do not get married too"
much.”
It did not seem quite right to Susanna to get married too much. Besides
she had a desire to become a Catholic. One day she questioned Cæsar
about it:
"“You want to change your religion!” exclaimed Cæsar, “What for? I don’t"
believe you are going to find your lost faith by becoming a Catholic.”
"“And what do you think about it, Kennedy?” Susanna asked the young"
"Englishman, who was there too."
“To me a Catholic woman seems doubly enchanting.”
“You would not marry a woman who wasn’t a Catholic?”
speak; but finding nothing epigrammatic enough to say--and an epigram
alone would have saved the situation--he planted a carefully cut cigar
"between the parted lips aforesaid, and deliberately struck a match."
"“Your idea, John,” said Lady Blount, aware of victory, “is preposterous."
What would Stella do without you?”
"“Yes,” said Sir Oliver, after lighting his cigar; “Stella has to be"
considered before everything.”
Risca frowned on the unblushing turncoat. Stella! Stella! Everything
"was Stella. Here were three ordinary, sane, grown-up people seriously"
putting forward the proposition that he had no right to go and mend his
own broken life in his own fashion because he happened to be the favored
playmate of a little invalid girl!
"On the one side was the driving force of Furies of a myriad hell-power,"
and on the other the disappointment of Stella Blount. It was ludicrous.
"Even Walter Herold, who had a sense of humour, did not see the grotesque"
incongruity. Risca frowned upon each in turn--upon three serene faces
smilingly aware of the absurd. Was it worth while trying to convince
them?
"“Our dear friends are quite right, John,” said Herold. “What would"
become of Stella if you went away?”
"“None of you seems to consider what would happen to me if I stayed,”"
"said John, in the quiet tone of a man who is talking to charming but"
"unreasonable children. “It will go to my heart to leave Stella, more"
"than any of you can realize; but to Australia I go, and there's an end"
of it.”
"Lynn Moulton made no fight and Kennedy did not pursue the case, for,"
"with the rescue of Antoinette Moulton, his interest ceased."
"Blackmail takes various forms, and the Moulton affair was only one"
phase of it. It was not long before we had to meet a much stranger
attempt.
"“Read the letter, Professor Kennedy. Then I will tell you the sequel.”"
Mrs. Hunter Blake lay back in the cushions of her invalid chair in the
"sun parlor of the great Blake mansion on Riverside Drive, facing the"
Hudson with its continuous reel of maritime life framed against the
green-hilled background of the Jersey shore.
"Her nurse, Miss Dora Sears, gently smoothed out the pillows and"
adjusted them so that the invalid could more easily watch us. Mrs.
"Blake, wealthy, known as a philanthropist, was not an old woman, but"
had been for years a great sufferer from rheumatism.
"I watched Miss Sears eagerly. Full-bosomed, fine of face and figure,"
she was something more than a nurse; she was a companion. She had
"bright, sparkling black eyes and an expression about her well-cut mouth"
which made one want to laugh with her. It seemed to say that the world
was a huge joke and she invited you to enjoy the joke with her.
"Kennedy took the letter which Miss Sears proffered him, and as he did"
"so I could not help noticing her full, plump forearm on which gleamed a"
handsome plain gold bracelet. He spread the letter out on a dainty
wicker table in such a way that we both could see it.
CHAPTER XX.
THE LAW _VERSUS_ RULE 3.
Among the many tired but satisfied lovers of liberty who sought their
"houses that night, while an enthusiastic remnant was still parading the"
"streets, illuminations yet shining from windows, and weary police"
"treading their unending beats, was the doorkeeper, who had borne a"
banner in Company A of Procession 1. His friend the watchmaker came with
"him, to have a bit of supper and exchange congratulations and"
"fulminations. Hardly, however, had the doorkeeper pledged the cause in a"
first draught when his wife broke in on his oration by handing him a
"letter, which she said a boy in a blue jersey had left for him about ten"
"o'clock in the morning, just after he had started to join his company."
The envelope was cheap and coarse; there was no direction outside. The
doorkeeper opened it. It was addressed to no named person and it bore no
"signature. It was very brief, being confined to these simple words--""You"
"did not see me last night. Remember Rule 3."""
"The doorkeeper laid the letter down, with a hurried glance at his"
"friend, whose face was buried in a mug. He knew the handwriting; he knew"
"who it was that he had not seen; he remembered Rule 3, the rule that"
"said--""The only and inevitable penalty of treachery is death."" He turned"
white and took a hasty gulp at his liquor.
"""Who brought this?"" he asked."
"""I told you,"" answered his wife; ""a lad in a blue jersey; he looked as"
"if he might be from the harbour."" She put food before them, adding as"
"dairy--I have a kitchen. Milk the goats here, I command you, nowhere but"
"here!"""
"And thrusting the bucket into the old woman's hand, she watched"
carefully and eagerly as La Giralda pressed the milk downwards in
hissing streams. The she-goat operated upon expressed her gratitude by
turning to lick the hand which relieved her.
At this the little girl danced with delight.
"""It looks so easy--I could do it myself! I am sure of it. I tell you,"
"Susana, I will do it. Stand still, _cabra_! Do you not know that I am"
"Isabel the Second, Queen of all the Spains!"""
"But the she-goat, having no very strong monarchial sentiments, or"
"perhaps being inclined to Carlist opinions, as soon as she felt the grip"
of unaccustomed fingers promptly kicked over in the dust the Queen of
all the Spains.
The little girl had not time to gather herself up or even to emit the
"howl of disappointment and anger which hovered upon her lips, before her"
attendant rushed at her with pitiful cries:
"""Oh, the wicked goat! The devil-possessed emblem of Satan! Let it be"
slain! Did not your poor Susana warn you to have nothing to do with such
"evil things--thus to overturn in the dust the best, the sweetest, the"
"noblest of Princesses!"""
"But the best and sweetest of Princesses, having violent objections to"
"being gathered up into the capacious embrace of her nurse, especially"
"before company, vigorously objected in much the same manner as the goat"
"had done, and at last compelled Doña Susana to deposit her once more on"
"“Runs through a pass, foolish!” answered Jack."
"“But there’s no break in the formation,” Frank insisted."
“Then it runs through a tunnel manufactured by itself!” Jack explained.
"“Anyway, it gets out somehow.”"
“What a dandy place to catch mountain trout!” shouted Harry.
fourteen hours at a stretch. They must be swift as lightning in their
"movements, and possessed of judgment, ability, and nerve."
"It was impossible, of course, for Bob to pick out an ideal rear crew"
from merely having seen the men in action for a scant few minutes. He
"did not try. He simply used his very excellent judgment, reserving"
"mentally the right to change his mind whenever he felt like it, and"
juggle the men around as he chose.
"The principal necessity was to start things moving. When he had done so,"
Bainbridge returned to camp with the twofold object of giving the cook
"his orders, and having a final settlement with Schaeffer. The latter was"
"not particularly pleasant, but it was important. The man must quit the"
crew at once. Bob had made up his mind not to let the fellow spend even
the night where he would have a chance to talk with and perhaps
"influence the others. With this determination uppermost, he passed by"
"the mess tent to the other where the men slept, pulled aside the flap,"
and stepped inside.
"The place was a mess of blankets and half-dried clothes, but to Bob’s"
surprise it was vacant of anything in the nature of a man. Evidently
"Schaeffer had recovered and vamoosed. Thoughtfully he sought the cook,"
and put the question.
stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down
with her head in her sister’s lap.
"“We will have to marry some day,” she said dreamily—“both of us. We"
have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the
"public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love,"
Sis?”
"“Go on, you scatterbrain,” smiled the other."
"“I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and"
"respectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to"
"flirt. But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some"
work to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I could
"help him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always"
meet—the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs—I
"could not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were"
ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.”
BY COURIER
It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters;
"and it is likely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the"
"benches at the side of the walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to"
sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring.
"She rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched"
"her countenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet"
"He turned to the landlady. ""What's the address here, sister?"""
"And later, with the landlady back in her lair, Brent Taber sat down on"
the stairs to wait; sat there with surprise at the feeling of relief
that filled his mind. He had no feeling of triumph about it; no sense of
"a job well done. But there was no great guilt at having failed, either."
"Mostly, he thought, it was the simplification that had come about. There"
had been so many confusing and bewildering complications in the affair;
improbability piled on the impossible; the ridiculous coupled with the
incredible.
"But now, with one stroke of a knife, it had been simplified and brought"
into terms everyone could understand; into terms Captain Abrams of the
New York Police Department would grasp in an instant.
A killer was on the loose.

One of Senator Crane's priceless gifts was a sense of timing. Much of
his success had sprung from the instinctive knowledge of when to act. He
"had a sense of the dramatic which never deserted him. As a result, he"
had been known to turn in an instant from one subject to another--to
dodge defeats and score triumphs with bewildering agility.
His preoccupation on this particular day was with a home-state
"issue--the location of a government plant. After he obtained the floor,"
he counted the house and noted that only a bare quorum was present.
"Gradually, the members of the Senate of the United States would drift to"
their seats. So Crane began reading letters which tended to support his
you to find what you want by looking for it. You ought to leave it a
little to chance.”
"“Abandon myself to events as they arrive? All right, it seems a good"
idea.”
"“Then if you find something practicable, utilize it.”"
Kennedy took his friend to a statue-shop where he used to pass some of
"his hours. The shop was in a lane near the Forum, and its stock was in"
"antiques, majolicas, and plaster casts of pagan gods."
"The shop was dark and rather gloomy, with a small court at the back"
"covered with vines. The proprietor was an old man, with a moustache,"
"an imperial, and a shock of white hair. His name was Giovanni Battista"
Lanza. He professed revolutionary ideas and had great enthusiasm about
Mazzini. He expressed himself in an ironical and malicious manner.
"Signora Vittoria, his wife, was a grumbling old woman, rather devoted to"
"wine. She spoke like a Roman of the lowest class, was olive-coloured and"
"wrinkled, and of her former beauty there remained only her very black"
eyes and hair that was still black.
"The daughter, Simonetta, a girl who resembled her father, blond, with"
"the build of a goddess, was the one that waited on customers and kept"
the accounts.
"Simonetta, being the manager, divided up the profits; the elder son was"
head of the workshop and he made the most money; then came two workmen
"from outside; and then the father who still got his day’s wages, out"
"of consideration for his age; and finally the younger son, twelve or"
"fourteen years old, who was an apprentice."
of having the administration of all the Church’s property kept entirely
"at home, as in the time of Pius IX. Leo XIII had preferred to replace"
"this paternal method by a trained bureaucracy, but the Church had not"
"gained anything by it, and they had lost credit through unfortunate"
"negotiations, buying land and taking mortgages."
Cæsar realized that it was useless to attempt to convince a man of
"the intelligence and austerity of the Cardinal, and he listened to him"
respectfully.
"Monsignor Spada conversed amiably, he escorted them as far as the door,"
and shook hands when they said good-bye.
THE ABBÉ TARDIEU
Then they went to see the Abbé Tardieu. The abbé lived in the Piazza.
"Navona. His office, furnished in modern style, produced the effect of a"
"violent contrast with Cardinal Spada’s sumptuous study, and yet brought"
"it to mind. The Abbé Tardieu’s work-room was small, worldly, full of"
books and photographs.
"The abbé, a tall young man, thin, with a rosy face, a long nose, and a"
"mouth almost from ear to ear, had the air of an astute but jolly person,"
and laughed at everything said to him. He was liveliness personified.
When they entered his office he was writing and smoking.
"Cæsar explained about his financial knowledge, and how he had gone on"
"acquiring it, until he got to the point where he could discern a law, a"
"system, in things where others saw nothing more than chance. The Abbé"
"Tardieu promised that if he knew a way to utilize Cæsar’s knowledge, he"
"going to be: all the wind tunnel tests, all the computer simulations,"
even the supersonic test flights--everything said go. _Daedalus I_ was
going to make history tomorrow morning.
"Except, he told himself, it's going to be a very different history from"
the one everybody expects.
"""Major Yuri Andreevich Androv, please report to Hangar Quadrant"
"immediately."""
The stridency of the facility's paging system always annoyed him. He
"glanced at the long line of computer screens one last time, then"
shrugged and checked his watch. Who wanted him?
"Well, a new planeload of Soviet VIPs reportedly had flown in yesterday,"
though he hadn't seen any of them yet. He figured now that everything
"looked ready, the _nomenklatura _were flooding in to bask in triumph."
Maybe after a day of vodka drinking and back slapping with the
"officials in Project Management, they'd sobered up and realized they"
were expected to file reports. So they were finally getting around to
talking to the people who were doing the actual work. They'd summon in
a few staffers who had hands-on knowledge of the project and commission
"a draft report, which they'd then file, unread, under their own names."
Typical.
"He reached for his leather flight jacket, deciding on a brisk walk to"
work off the tension. The long corridor leading from the East Quadrant
to the Hangar Quadrant took him directly past Checkpoint Central and
"the entry to West Quadrant, the Soviet sector, which also contained the"
"flight simulator and the main wind tunnel, or Number One, both now"
quiet.
CHAPTER XXIX
A LITTLE QUEEN AT HOME
"Meanwhile, leaving the grave in the shaded corner of the farm garden, La"
Giralda went out with many strange things moving in her heart. More than
"once she had seen her own children laid in the dust, with far less of"
emotion than this nameless little girl clutching her wooden puppet and
"smiling, well-pleased, in the face of the Last Terror."
She found the donkey standing still and patient between his fagot
"bundles. The she-goats, on the other hand, had scattered a little this"
way or that as this blade of grass or that spray of _encina_ had allured
them. But a sharp cry or two called them together. For it was many hours
"since any of them had been milked, and the full teats standing out every"
way ached for the pressing fingers.
"The Sergeant had, of course, long since completely disappeared up the"
"hillside, so La Giralda, with one comprehensive look back at the"
"desolate farmhouse, drove her little flock before her towards the town"
"gates of San Ildefonso. Like a picture, the dustily red roofs lay"
"beneath in the sunshine, spire and roof-garden, pigeon-house and terrace"
"walk. Parts of the white palace of La Granja also were to be seen, but"
"indistinctly, since it lay amid a pleasant distraction of greenery, and"
the woods waved and the falling waters glimmered about it like the
landscape of a dream.
"From the _Colegiata_ came the tolling of a bell, slow and irregular. All"
"else was silent. Presently, with her little flock before her, La Giralda"
The officer hesitated. In such circumstances one might easily do wrong.
"He might shoot these men, and after all find that they were innocent. He"
preferred to wait. The living are more easily deprived of life than the
dead restored to it. Such was his thought.
In any case he had not long to wait.
"Round the angle of the mill-house swept the general and his staff,"
"brilliant in scarlet and white, heightened by the glitter of abundant"
"gold-lace. For the ex-butcher of Tortosa was a kind of military dandy,"
and loved to surround himself with the foppery of the _matador_ and the
"brigand. At heart, indeed, he was still the _guerrillero_ of Morella,"
riding home through the streets of that little rebel city after a
successful foray.
As his eyes fell on the row of men dark against the dusty _adobe_ of the
"garden wall, and on the two pale women, a dark frown overspread his"
face.
"""What is the meaning of this?"" he cried. ""Why have you not obeyed your"
"instructions? Why are these men not yet dead?"""
"The officer trembled, and began an explanation, pointing to Concha and"
"La Giralda, both of whom stood for a moment motionless. Then flinging"
herself over the low wall of the garden as if her years had more nearly
"approached seventeen than seventy, La Giralda caught the great man by"
the stirrup.
"""Little Ramon, Ramon Cabrera,"" she cried, ""have you forgotten your old"
"nurse, La Giralda of Sevilla, your mother's gossip, your own playmate?"""
"The general turned full upon her, with the quick indignant threat of one"
"hundred Pounds, such Forfeiture to be enforced as Forfeitures for"
"Offences against the Laws relating to the Customs are enforced, and"
every such Ship shall be liable to such Searches as other Ships are
"liable to, and the Officers of the Customs may freely go on board such"
"Ship and bring to the Queen's Warehouse any Goods on board the same,"
"subject, nevertheless, to such Regulations in respect of Ships of War"
belonging to Her Majesty as shall from Time to Time be issued by the
Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury.

may remit the whole or such Part of the said Duties as they see fit.

dramatic advance for disciples of the Senecan school lay in improved
"dialogue. This was possible in four directions, namely, in more stirring"
"topics, in more personal feeling, in shorter speeches, and in a change"
"in the style of language and verse. Unfortunately for Thomas Hughes, it"
"is just here that he fails, and fails lamentably. What is more, he fails"
because of his methods. The dominant desire of the English 'classical'
school was to be impressive. Hence the adoption by Hughes of a ghostly
"introduction and conclusion. His conversations, therefore, must reflect"
"the same idea. He saw, indeed, that long speeches, except at rare"
"intervals, were tedious, and reduced his to reasonable proportions, even"
"making extensive use--as, we shall see, the author of _Damon and"
Pythias_ did before him--of the Greek device of stichomythia. He was
"most anxious, also, to provide stirring topics for his characters to"

"omnipresent"" in the city of the popes. The new government has wrought"
"a great change in this respect, and Rome is in many parts of it now"
quite a clean city.
"There, then, are the facts as to the influence of the Roman Catholic"
"Church. I am, of course, very far from saying that there are no good"
"people in that church. As I have already stated, I believe that there"
"are many good people in it, but my own observation has satisfied me"
that the verdict of history as to the baleful influence of the system
is absolutely correct.
"""What, then,"" some one may ask, ""do the good people in that church"
think of all the immoralities and frauds that it has condoned and
"fostered?"" The answer is that the really good people in that church"
must grieve over them and deplore them just as the good people in other
churches do.

"that the new Pope, Pius X., is a better man than many of his"
"predecessors, and that he cannot be charged with the immoralities or"
the ambition and avarice which characterized them. Let us hope that he
will have the courage to attempt some real reform in the lives of many
of his clergy.
FOOTNOTES:
"stay for his health's sake in the fresh sea-air; and when he yielded,"
"they prided themselves, after the manner of humans, on their own powers"
of persuasion. One morning Sir Oliver asked him point-blank:
“When are you going to Australia?”
"“I don't know,” said John. “There 's no immediate hurry.”"
"“I hope, dear,” said Julia, “you 'll give up the idea altogether.”"
"“Have n't I told you that I've made up my mind?” said John, in his gruff"
tone of finality.
“When are you going to break the news to Stella?” asked Sir Oliver.
"“Now,” said John, who had begun to loathe the mention of the doomful"
subject; and he stalked away--the three were strolling in the garden
"after breakfast--and went to Stella's room, and of course made no"
mention of it whatsoever.
"Then Herold came down for the week-end, and when he heard of Risca's"
pusillanimity he threw back his head and laughed for joy; for he knew
"that John would never go to Australia without telling Stellamaris, and"
also that if he could not tell Stellamaris in the first madness of his
"agony, he would never be able to tell her at all."
"And so, in fact, the fantastically absurd prevailed. Before the"
"Unwritten Law, mainly promulgated and enforced by Risca himself, which"
"guarded the sea-chamber against pain and sorrow, the driving Furies"
slunk with limp wing and nerveless claw. And one day Risca was surprised
"at finding himself undriven. Indeed, he was somewhat disconcerted. He"
fell into a bad temper. The Furies are highly aristocratic divinities
forward.
"“Stop!” he roared. “You young whelp, if you----”"
"He broke off with a gurgling sound, and the color left his face. With a"
"final swing, Bob loosened his hold on the bundle, which curved in a"
"perfect arc over the rear of the jam, over the jagged crest, and dropped"
swiftly out of sight amid the massive timbers upended in confusion along
the face and close to the spot where protruded the freshly driven spiles
which had caused all the trouble.
An instant later the whole throng of men hustled frantically for cover.
CHAPTER X. THE POWER BEHIND IT ALL
In less than sixty seconds--so close had been Bob’s calculations--came a
"detonation which shook the earth, making several of the running men"
"stagger and lose their stride. Up spurted a great mass of water,"
carrying with it massive logs leaping like agonized things alive. They
"fell back again, followed by a shower of débris mingled with fine spray,"
"which the wind sifted down on the heads of the ducking, dodging men."
"From his place behind a stump Bainbridge rose swiftly, shielding his"
face with one crooked arm from the rain of chips and splinters and bits
"of bark, and stared eagerly toward the jam. It took but a moment to see"
"that the spiles had disappeared, and the boom was shattered. Moreover,"
the key logs of the jam were so loosened that the whole drive was again
on its way downstream. Bob turned to Peters with a gesture of
satisfaction.
"“She’s off, Jack,” he said. “Get a wiggle on, now, and rush her along."
"enclosed like a lake by mountains and volcanic cones, all this must"
"also appear strange and beautiful to the Trobrianders. In the villages,"
"they are entertained by their male friends, the language spoken by both"
"parties being that of Dobu, which differs completely from Kiriwinian,"
but which the Sinaketans learn in early youth. It is remarkable that
no one in Dobu speaks Kiriwinian.
"As said above, no sexual relations of any description take place"
between the visitors and the women of Dobu. As one of the informants
told me:
"""We do not sleep with women of Dobu, for Dobu is the final mountain"
"(Koyaviguna Dobu); it is a taboo of the mwasila magic."""
"But when I enquired, whether the results of breaking this taboo would"
"be baneful to their success in Kula only, the reply was that they were"
"afraid of breaking it, and that it was ordained of old (tokunabogwo"
ayguri) that no man should interfere with the women of Dobu. As a
"matter of fact, the Sinaketans are altogether afraid of the Dobuans,"
and they would take good care not to offend them in any way.
"After some three or four days' sojourn in Dobu, the Sinaketan"
fleet starts on its return journey. There is no special ceremony of
"farewell. In the early morning, they receive their talo'i (farewell"
"gifts) of food, betel-nut, objects of use and sometimes also a Kula"
valuable is enclosed amongst the the talo'i. Heavily laden as they
"are, they lighten their canoes by means of a magic called kaylupa,"
and sail away northwards once more.
grounded with a coaxial sheath. But there was a clear section that led
"directly down to the CPU. That's where he'd place the blade, and hope"
it'd at least short- circuit the power feed even if it didn't sever the
wires completely.
"He tested the radio transmitter one last time, making sure it would"
"activate the blade, then reached down and clamped the mechanism onto"
"the wire, tightening it with thumb screws. When it was as secure as he"
"could make it, he stood back and examined his handiwork. If somebody"
"decided to remove the faceplate, they'd spot it in a second, but"
otherwise . . .
"Quickly, hands trembling from the cold, he fitted the cover back on the"
module and began replacing the screws with the tiny screwdriver. It
"wasn't magnetized, a deliberate choice, so the small screws kept"
"slipping between his bulky fingers, a problem made more acute by the"
numbing cold.
Three screws to go . . . then he heard the noise. Footsteps on the
aluminum catwalk in the pressure bay above. . . . _Shit_.
"He kept working as fast as he could, grimly holding the screws secure"
and fighting back the numbness and pain in his freezing fingers.
"Only one more. Above, he could hear the sounds of someone checking each"
"of the equipment bays, methodically opening and then resecuring them."
"First the starboard side bay was opened and closed, then the portside"
bay. Now he heard footsteps advancing down the metal stairs leading to
the computer bay. They were five seconds away from discovering him.
The last screw was in.

was received immediately after breakfast had been eaten. There
"was retention of urine and constipation for three days, but no"

"of three weeks there was still local tenderness, slight"

The injury was followed by pain in the left half of the abdomen

"Kennedy went to look at a picture by Sassoferrato, which is in one of"
"the chapels, and meanwhile the rosary-seller showed the church door to"
"Cæsar and explained the different bas-reliefs, cut in cypress wood by"
"Greek artists of the V Century, and representing scenes from the Old and"
New Testaments.
"Kennedy came back, they got into the carriage again, and they drove to"
the Benedictine abbey.
“Is the abbot Hildebrandus here?” asked Kennedy.
"Out came the abbot, a man of about fifty, with a gold cross on his"
"breast. They exchanged a few friendly words, and the superior showed"
them the convent.
The refectory was clean and very spacious; the long table of shining
"wood; the floor made of mosaic. The crypt held a statue, which Cæsar"
"assumed must be of Sant’ Anselmo. The church was severe, without"
"ornaments, without pictures; it had a primitive air, with its columns of"
"fine granite that looked like marble. A monk was playing the harmonium,"
"and in the opaque veiled light, the thin music gave a strange impression"
of something quite outside this life.
Afterwards they crossed a large court with palm-trees. They went up to
"the second story, and down a corridor with cells, each of which had on"
the lintel the name of the patron saint of the respective monk. Each
door had a card with the name of the occupant of the room.
It looked more like a bath-house than a monastery. The cells were
"comfortable inside, without any air of sadness; each held a bed, a"
"divan, and a small bookcase."
"Vance's attention, however, was riveted on what awaited at the end of"
"the stony walkway. It was a traditional teahouse, set in a grove of"
flowering azaleas. And standing in the doorway was a silver-haired
figure dressed in a formal black kimono. He was beckoning.
"""Did I neglect to tell you I prefer Japanese _cha-no-yu _to the usual"
"British afternoon tea?"" Tanzan Mino announced. ""It is a ritual designed"
"to renew the spirit, to cleanse the mind. It goes back hundreds of"
"years. I always enjoy it in the afternoon, and I find it has"
marvelously restorative powers. This seemed the ideal occasion for us
"to meet and chat."""
"""Don't want to slight tradition."" Vance slipped on the pair of wooden"
clogs that awaited at the bottom of the path.
"""My feelings entirely,"" the CEO continued, smiling as he watched him"
"approach. ""You understand the Japanese way, Dr. Vance, which is one"
"reason we have so much to discuss."""
He bowed a greeting as Vance deposited his clogs on the stepping stone
by the teahouse door. Together they stooped to enter.
A light murmur of boiling water came from a brazier set into the
"_tatami_-matted floor, but otherwise the room was caught in an ethereal"
"silence. The decor was more modern than most teahouses, with fresh"
cedar and pine for the ceiling and walls rather than the customary
"reed, bark, and bamboo."
Tanzan Mino gestured for him to sit opposite as he immediately began
"the formalities of ritually cleaning the bamboo scoop, then elevating"
the rugged white tea bowl like an ancient chalance and ceremonially
"George's brother, Count Anthony Hamilton. He had never been friendly to"
"his younger brother, and had ceased to look upon him as a brother at all"
after his disgraceful reformation. Then when the king turned against
"George, Anthony, good courtier that he was, turned likewise, and there is"
no bitterness that may be compared with that of an apostate brother.
"After we had talked for a minute or two, Count Anthony asked if I knew"
"anything of ""the fool,"" as he was pleased to call his brother."
"""I know nothing of your brother George, my lord, if it is him you mean."""
"""He is no brother of mine, and if you wish to become a member of our"
"family, you will cease to consider him your friend,"" returned his"
"Lordship, making an effort to conceal his anger."
"I was not in the mood to take his remark kindly, therefore I answered"
warmly:--
"""Shall my entering the ranks of your noble family curtail my privilege of"
"choosing my own friends?"""
"""No, with one exception,"" he replied."
"""The honor of the alliance is great, my lord, but I shall not consent to"
"even one exception at your dictation. Your sister, my future wife, loves"
"her brother, and if she does not object to my friendship for him, your"
"Lordship oversteps your authority, as head of your house, by protesting."""

"lukewarm ardor of late, Baron Clyde. Perhaps you would not grieve if your"
"friendship for a family outcast were to bar you from the family."""

immediate vicinity.
"The Western portion of the Sarhad, extending roughly from Khwash to"
"Galugan, is held by the Ismailzais under their redoubtable leader,"

All three of these tribes possess approximately one thousand
"families apiece, and, of course, each family has many members, as"
"well as large numbers of camels, and herds of sheep and goats."
"Each of these tribes, at the time of which I write, could muster,"
"roughly, from one to two thousand riflemen, chiefly armed with Mauser"
"courage. As the man emerges upon the narrow platform, he is engulfed in"
"the swirling flakes, and often is pinned against the masonry so tightly"
by the wind that he cannot move a limb; at other times he is swept
"almost off his feet. While engaged in his freezing task, he also runs"
the risk of being drenched by a rising comber.

"The men on the lonely, exposed Tillamook Rock, off the Oregon coast,"
"have had more than one occasion to respect the storm-fiend. One night,"
"while a fearful gale was raging, a huge mass of rock was torn away from"
"the islet, snatched by the waves, and thrown high into the air. It"
"forces along the various jutting balconies of the second floor,"
"carefully darkening all the rooms in their rear, so that, till the"
"moment of the attack itself, the assailants would have no idea that they"
were expected. It was his idea that the small doors on the garden side
"of the house, which led right and left to the servants' quarters, would"
be attacked first. He was the more assured of this because the Sergeant
"had recognised, in the bivouac of the gipsies, a man who had formerly"
been one of the royal grooms both at La Granja and at Aranjuez. He would
"be sure to be familiar, therefore, with that part of the interior of the"
"palace. Besides, being situated upon the side most completely removed"
"from the town, the assailants would have the less fear of interruption."
"While Rollo was thus cogitating, Concha came softly to his side,"
appearing out of the gloom with a suddenness that startled the young
man.
"""I have pulled up the ladder by which we ascended and laid it across the"
"balcony,"" she said. ""Was that right?"""
"""You--alone?"" cried Rollo in astonishment."
She nodded brightly.
"""Certainly,"" she answered; ""women are not all so great weaklings as you"
"think them--nor yet such fools!"""
"""Indeed, you have more sense than I,"" Rollo responded, gloomily; ""I"
"ought to have remembered that before. But, as you know, I have had many"
"things to think of."""
"""I am glad,"" she said, more quietly and submissively than ever in her"

Books of the beginning of last century to realise the difference of
appeal. Everything offered then was either an appeal to fear or to
"priggishness, and one wonders how it is that our grandparents and their"
parents ever recovered from the effects of such stories as were offered
to them. But there is the consoling thought that no lasting impression
"was made upon them, such as I believe _may_ be possible by the right"
kind of story.
I offer a few examples of the old type of story:
Here is an encouraging address offered by a certain Mr. Janeway to
children about the year 1828:
"“Dare you do anything which your parents forbid you, and neglect to"
"do what they command? Dare you to run up and down on the Lord's Day,"
"or do you keep in to read your book, and learn what your good parents"
command?”
Such an address would have almost tempted children to envy the lot of
"orphans, except that the guardians and less close relations might have"
"been equally, if not more, severe."
"From “The Curious Girl,” published about 1809: “Oh! papa, I hope you"
"will have no reason to be dissatisfied with me, for I love my studies"
"very much, and I am never so happy at my play as when I have been"
assiduous at my lessons all day.”
"“Adolphus: How strange it is, papa, you should believe it possible for"
"me to act so like a child, now that I am twelve years old!”"
Here is a specimen taken from a Chap-book about 1825:
"Jogues, Isaac, referred to, 73."
"Orange, Fort, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Rochelle, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Torture, Indian, Bressani by the Iroquois, 73."
ESCAPE OF BRESSANI                           73
"march of several days,--during which Bressani, in wading a rocky"
"stream, fell from exhaustion and was nearly drowned,--they reached"
an Iroquois town. It is needless to follow the revolting details
of the new torments that succeeded. They hung him by the feet
"with chains; placed food for their dogs on his naked body, that"
they might lacerate him as they ate; and at last had reduced his
emaciated frame to such a condition that even they themselves stood
"in horror of him. ""I could not have believed,"" he writes to his"
"Superior, ""that a man was so hard to kill."" He found among them"
"those who, from compassion or from a refinement of cruelty, fed"
"him, for he could not feed himself. They told him jestingly that"
they wished to fatten him before putting him to death.
The council that was to decide his fate met on the nineteenth of
"June, when to the prisoner's amazement, and, as it seemed, to their"
"own surprise, they resolved to spare his life. He was given, with"
"due ceremony, to an old woman, to take the place of a deceased"
"relative; but since he was as repulsive, in his mangled condition"
"as, by the Indian standard, he was useless, she sent her son"
"with him to Fort Orange, to sell him to the Dutch. With the same"
"humanity which they had shown in the case of Jogues, they gave a"
Against the class-interest behind the East India Company the republican
"party, as led and represented by De Witt, were strongly arrayed. They"
could point to the expansion of the Greenland whaling trade that had
followed on the abolition of the original monopoly in that adventure--an
increase of from ten to fifteen times the old quantity of
product[818]--and the treatise expounding their policy strongly
condemned the remaining monopolies of all kinds. But there was no
sufficient body of enlightened public opinion to support the attack; and
the menaced interests spontaneously turned to the factor which could
best maintain them against such pressure--the military power of the
"House of Orange. The capitalist monopolists and ""imperialists"" of the"
republic were thus the means first of artificially limiting its economic
"basis, and later of subverting its republican constitution--a disservice"
"which somewhat outweighs the credit earned by them, as by the merchant"
"oligarchies of Venice, for an admirable management of their army.[819]"
"""And you have no further thought of her?"" she asked."
"""As far as marriage is concerned, no,"" I responded.  ""Nevertheless, I"
still regard her as an intimate friend.  I was here only two or three
"hours ago chatting with her."""
"""You!"" she cried, glaring at me strangely.  ""You were here--to-day?"""
"""Yes,"" I replied.  ""I thought she would certainly tell you of my visit."""
"""She told me nothing.  I was quite unaware of it.  I was out, and the"
"servants told me that a gentlemen had called in my absence."""
"""I gave a card,"" I replied.  ""It is no doubt in the hall."""
I expect he will come back to us occasionally to see what he looks like.
"The egregious O’Myre also hath descended on London town--stays,"
"however, but a little while----"
"Yet a wondrous thing of a man, the O’Myre--the most consistent surely"
of all created things--always wrong. He and _The Times_. He must have
"been suckled on half-truths, and nurtured on the Irish Bull; he now"
"browses on false conclusions. But with what an air! Nevertheless, he"
has it all on the most philosophic basis--has for ever been blaming
something for his lack of greatness. It now appears the English drama
is dead. The O’Myre will breathe new life into it.
"Meanwhile, he has laid it down, like a minor god with a throaty tenor"
"voice, that scenery destroys the illusion of the drama--therefore it"
comes about to-day that if you would be in the vogue with the ladies
"you must go in state not to the play, but to the dress rehearsal--the"
"bare theatre and the dinginess being alone at back, the low tone"
and the cobwebs and the like giving mystery to the spoken word that
requires for enunciation but beautiful lips. God! how the ducks quack!
"Thus mews he much monstrous wisdom, sitting like a pale emotional"
maggot upon the apple of discord that is called the modern drama.”...
The rest of the letter is a matter of affection and goodwill. A man
"is always ridiculous about his first-born--exaggerative, egotistical."
"As though he had invented the business. Whereas, like heredity,"
"immortality, and the latest fashion, it is thrust upon us."

"[Sidenote: Custody of ships taken as prize. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s."

"16. Where a ship (not being a ship of war) is taken as prize, and is or"
"is brought within the jurisdiction of a prize court, she shall forthwith"
"be delivered up to the marshal of the court, or, if there is no such"
"marshal, to the principal officer of customs at the port, and shall"
"remain in his custody, subject to the orders of the court."

"(2) The officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"capturing ship, or some other person who was present at the capture and"
"saw the ship papers delivered up or found on board, shall make oath that"
"they are brought in as they were taken, without fraud, addition,"
"subduction, or alteration, or else shall account on oath to the"
satisfaction of the court for the absence or altered condition of the

"In truth, this is the one principle which can give men guidance in the"
"tangled intricacy of modern life. It is necessary to salvation, _now_,"
"not hereafter only, to believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord"
Jesus Christ.
"For, first of all, men need to be saved from the apathy of despair."
They need some hope that there is an answer to the riddle of the
Universe. Let them once begin to feel that it _may_ be true that the
very God cares for His creatures and has made His love for them
"manifest by taking to Himself the body, mind and spirit of man, and"
"joining for ever human nature to the Godhead, then through the"
darkness comes a human voice saying--
"“O heart I made, a heart beats here!"
"Face, my hands fashioned, see it in Myself."
"Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,"
"But love I gave thee, with Myself to love,"
And thou must love Me who have died for thee.”
A man regains his self-respect when once he has escaped from the
paralyzing sense that his is only
“a life of nothings nothing worth
From that first nothing ere our birth
To that last nothing under earth.”
And there is only one starting-point for those who journey on this
quest of an answer to the enigma of life. They must resolutely abandon
the long travelled “_a priori_ road.” They must understand that the
"science of to-day is not tied to any materialistic axioms, that"
"metaphysic cannot be ignored by the physician, and that no competent"
"infection, absorption taking place from the large foul cavity"
behind the colon. As the cavity in part surrounded the
"descending duodenum, this possibly accounted for the attack of"
vomiting which preceded death.

"prone position. _Entry_ (Mauser), over ninth rib in line of"
"right linea semilunaris; _exit_, in right buttock, just below"
and behind the top of the great trochanter.
"The injury was followed by little abdominal pain, but a strange"
sensation of local gurgling was noted. The bowels acted as soon
"as the patient reached camp, some hours after being wounded."
There was no sickness and nothing abnormal was noted in the
"motions, except that they were loose and light-coloured."
On the evening of the third day the patient came under
observation in the ambulance train for Capetown. He looked
"somewhat anxious and ill, but he complained of little pain; the"
"temperature was 102°, pulse 88, fair strength, soft and"
"regular. There was local dulness, tenderness, and deficiency of"
"movement in the right iliac region. As it was night, he was"
removed from the train and an operation was performed the next
morning.
"Prior to operation the condition was as follows: Pulse 84,"
"temperature 100°; respiration easy, 20. Tongue moist, but"
"thickly coated in centre. Abdomen moves fairly, and is"
"resonant, except in right lower quadrant. No distension."
"Dulness, tenderness, and rigidity in right iliac region, marked"

by their titles: but a list of these is given at the close of vol.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
The demand for this work so far exceeded my expectations that I was
"unable to make any considerable changes in the second edition, issued"
"in March, 1902; and circumstances again make it impossible for me to"
"give the work that thorough recension which I should desire. I have,"
"however, carefully considered the suggestions offered by critics, and"
have adopted them in some cases. Professor Fournier of Vienna has most
kindly furnished me with details which seem to relegate to the domain
of legend the famous ice catastrophe at Austerlitz; and I have added a
"note to this effect on p. 50 of vol. ii. On the other hand, I may"
justly claim that the publication of Count Balmain's reports relating
"to St. Helena has served to corroborate, in all important details, my"
account of Napoleon's captivity.
It only remains to add that I much regret the omission of Mr. Oman's
"name from II. 12-13 of page viii of the Preface, an omission rendered"
all the more conspicuous by the appearance of the first volume of his
"""History of the Peninsular War"" in the spring of this year."
asked.
"""Nay,"" said Sergeant Cardono; ""but when I am required to guide a party"
"secretly to San Ildefonso, where the court of the Queen-Regent is"
"sojourning, it does not require great penetration to see the general"
"nature of the service upon which I am engaged!"""
Rollo recovered himself.
"""You have not yet told me what you have discovered,"" he said,"
expectantly.
"""No,"" replied the Sergeant with great composure--""that can wait."""
For little Concha was approaching; and though he had limitless
expectations of the good influence of that young lady upon the military
"career of his officer, he did not judge it prudent to communicate"
"intelligence of moment in her presence. Wherein for once he was wrong,"
"since that pretty head of the Andalucian beauty, for all its clustering"
"curls, was full of the wisest and most far-seeing counsel--indeed, more"
to be trusted in a pinch than the _juntas_ of half-a-dozen provinces.
"But the Sergeant considered that when a girl was pretty and aware of it,"
she had fulfilled her destiny--save as it might be in the making of
military geniuses. Therefore he remained silent as the grave so long as
"Concha stayed. Observing this, the girl asked a simple question and then"
"moved off a little scornfully, only remarking to herself: ""As if I could"
"not make him tell me whenever I get him by himself!"""
"She referred (it is needless to state) not to Sergeant Cardono, but to"
"his commanding officer, Señor Don Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the"
self-sufficient shire of Fife.

GUAYMI INDIAN MAN
Note the tattoed marking of face and the negroid lips]
The Choco Indians are one of the smaller and least known tribes of the
Darien. Prof. Pittier--who may without disrespect be described as the
most seasoned “tropical tramp” of all Central America--described them so
vividly that extracts from his article in the National Geographic
Magazine will be of interest:
"“Never, in our twenty-five years of tropical experience, have we met"
"with such a sun-loving, bright and trusting people, living nearest to"
nature and ignoring the most elementary wiles of so-called civilization.
They are several hundred in number and their dwellings are scattered
"along the meandrous Sambu and its main reaches, always at short"
"distance, but never near enough to each other to form real villages."
"Like their houses, their small plantations are close to the river, but"
mostly far enough to escape the eye of the casual passer-by.
“Dugouts drawn up on the beach and a narrow trail breaking the reed wall
"at the edge of the bank are the only visible signs of human presence,"
"except at the morning hours and near sunset, when a crowd of women and"
"children will be seen playing in the water, and the men, armed with"
"their bows and long harpooned arrows, scrutinizing the deeper places for"
CHAPTER IX
HALF-LIGHT
"Once before she had placed herself in his path, trusting to her skill,"
"her daring, above all, her beauty. With laughter in her heart and"
cold-blooded coquetry she had chosen out the spot before the altar
where the sunlight struck burnished gold from her waving hair and lent
"deeper, softening shades to her eyes. With cruel satisfaction, not"
"unmixed with admiration, she had seen her power successful and the"
awe-struck wonder and veneration creep into his face. In the silence
and peace of the temple she had plunged reckless hands into the woven
"threads of his life. Amidst the shriek of war, face to face with"
"death, she sought to save him. It was another woman who stood opposite"
"the yielding, cracking door, past whose head a half-spent bullet spat"
"its way, burying itself in the wall behind her,--another woman,"
"disheveled, forgetful of her wan beauty, trusting to no power but that"
which her heart gave her to face the man she had betrayed and ruined.
Yet both in an instantaneous flash remembered that first meeting. The
"drawn sword sank, point downward. He stood motionless in the shattered"
"doorway, holding out a hand which commanded, and obtained, a"
"petrified, waiting silence from the armed horde whose faces glared"
hatred and the lust of slaughter in the narrow space behind. Whatever
"had been his resolution, whatever the detestation and contempt which"
"had filled him, all sank now into an ocean of reborn pain."
"""Why are you here?"" he asked sternly. ""Why have you not fled?"""
"into balls at the approach of danger. It is in this attitude,"
"taken at the approach of death, that trilobites are often found in"
the Ordovician and later rocks. The gigantic crustaceans called
the EURYPTERIDS were also present in this period.
The arthropods had now seized upon the land. Centipedes and
"insects of a low type, the earliest known land animals, have been"
discovered in strata of this system.
BRYOZOANS. No fossils are more common in the limestones of the
time than the small branching stems and lacelike mats of the
"bryozoans,--the skeletons of colonies of a minute animal allied in"
structure to the brachiopod.
"BRACHIOPODS. These multiplied greatly, and in places their shells"
formed thick beds of coquina. They still greatly surpassed the
mollusks in numbers.
CEPHALOPODS. Among the mollusks we must note the evolution of the
cephalopods. The primitive straight Orthoceras has now become
abundant. But in addition to this ancestral type there appears a
"succession of forms more and more curved and closely coiled, as"
"illustrated in Figure 285. The nautilus, which began its course in"
"this period, crawls on the bottom of our present seas."
VERTEBRATES. The most important record of the Ordovician is that
"of the appearance of a new and higher type, with possibilities of"
development lying hidden in its structure that the mollusk and the
insect could never hope to reach. Scales and plates of minute
"fishes found in the Ordovician rocks near Canon City, Colorado,"
show that the humblest of the vertebrates had already made its
appearance. But it is probable that vertebrates had been on the
MARGINS
A feature not to be overlooked in the appearance of a well-printed
book is that of the margins. The perfect type-page is supposed to be
proportioned in such a way that its diagonal is twice its width. With
"this page as a basis, the location of the type upon the paper leaf is"
"to be studied carefully. In general, the two pages, right and left,"
"should be considered as a unit, and the top margin and the inside"
"margin of each page should be approximately the same. Doing this, the"
total blank between the two pages is supposed approximately to equal
the outside and the bottom margins.
"The proportion of margin is, to a certain extent, dependent upon the"
"size of the book, the margins becoming greater as the volume increases"
from the thirty-two mo size up to the folio. A student of typography
"has ingeniously estimated that, taking the height of the paper leaf"
"as 100 units, the height of the type page of the ordinary trade book"
"should be from 72% to 75%; that of a library edition, from 66% to 71%;"
"that of a de luxe volume, from 60% to 65%."
MAKING THE INDEX
"EVERY book of a permanent nature, or intended as a work of reference,"
"requires an index. The length of the Index, or its minuteness, depends"
"upon the nature of the subject treated, and the importance of making it"
easily available to the reader. The Index belongs to the same family
"as the Table of Contents, and the Topical Analyses often placed at the"

“If it is a sin--don’t you love me enough to sin a little for my sake?”
"“Not that sin,” he said."
Yvonne lifted her shoulders helplessly.
"“I would commit any sin for your sake,” she said. “It would seem so"
easy.”
"Curiously assorted as they were, a poetic idealism on the one side and"
grateful veneration on the other had hitherto bound them together. Now
they were sundered leagues apart; mutual understanding was hopeless.
Each was bewildered by the other’s moral attitude.
"The logical consequences of the discovery, that appeared so luridly"
"devious to the Canon’s intellect, failed entirely to appeal to Yvonne."
She referred them entirely to his personal inclinations. On the other
"hand, the Canon had a false insight into her soul that was a chilling"
disillusion.
The beauty of her exquisite purity and innocence had always captivated
in him the finer man. It was a mirage. It was gone. Emptiness remained.
"She was simply a graceful, non-moral being--a spiritual anomaly."
"Yvonne shivered, and rising, walked unsteadily to the wardrobe, whence"
"she took a dressing-jacket. Putting it on, she returned to the couch. It"
"was almost dark. The Canon watched her dim, slight figure as it passed"
"him, with a strange feeling of remoteness. A hundred trivial instances"
of her want of moral sense crowded into his mind to support his
"view--her inability to see the wrong-doing of Stephen, her indefinite"
"notions in religious matters, her mental attitude toward the girl that"
"had gone astray, of whom she had been talking only the night before, her"

Part V.--SPECIAL CASES OF JURISDICTION.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of capture in land expedition. [27 & 28
"Vict. c. 25, s. 34.]]"
"34. Where, in an expedition of any of His Majesty's naval or naval and"
military forces against a fortress or possession on land goods belonging
"to the state of the enemy, or to a public trading company of the enemy"
"exercising powers of government, are taken in the fortress or"
"possession, or a ship is taken in waters defended by or belonging to the"
"fortress or possession, a prize court shall have jurisdiction as to the"
"goods or ships so taken, and any goods taken on board the ship, as in"
case of prize.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of prize taken in expedition with ally.
"[27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 35.]]"
35. Where any ship or goods is or are taken by any of His Majesty's
naval or naval and military forces while acting in conjunction with any
"forces of any of His Majesty's allies, a prize court shall have"
"jurisdiction as to the same as in case of prize, and shall have power,"
"after condemnation, to apportion the due share of the proceeds to His"
"Majesty's ally, the proportionate amount and the disposition of which"
share shall be such as may from time to time be agreed between His
"men of learning, men of character who will take on themselves the burden"
"of the world."" Such is the prophetic vision given to the greatest of"
teachers. The modern teacher from England will set before him an ideal
"not less exalted--regarding his pupils as his comrades, he as an"
Englishman will instill into them greater virility and a greater public
spirit. This will be his special contribution to the forming of our
Indian youths.
Turning to the Indian students he could say that it was his good fortune
never to have had the harmonious relation between teacher and pupils in
any way ruffled during his long connection with them for more than three
decades. The real secret of success was in trying at times to see things
from the student's point of view and to cultivate a sense of humour
enabling him to enjoy the splendid self-assurance of youth with a
"feeling not unmixed with envy. In essential matters, however, one could"
not wish to meet a better type or one more quickly susceptible to finer
appeals to right conduct and duty as Indian students. Their faults are
"rather of omission than of commission, since in his experience he formed"
"that the moment they realised their teachers to be their friends, they"
"responded instantly and did not flinch from any test, however severe,"
that could be laid on them.

LIGHT VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
"On the 14th January 1916, Dr. J. C. Bose delivered a public lecture, on"
"Light Visible and Invisible, at the third Indian Science Congress held"
"""run"" across the mountains or beached on the desolate sands of"
Catalunia.
"""I am no inlander,"" he said, ""I am of the sea-coast of Tarragona. I have"
never been south of Tortosa in my life; but there does not live a man
who has conducted more good cigars and brandy to their destination than
"old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds!"""
The sergeant with grave courtesy reached him a well-rolled cigarette.
"""I have heard of your fame, brother,"" he said; ""even at Ronda and on the"
Madrid-Seville road your deeds are not unknown. But what of this venture
"to-night? Have you enough men, think you, to overpower the town watchmen"
"and the palace-guards?"""
The old gipsy tossed his bony hands into the air with a gesture of
incomparable contempt.
"""The palace guards are fled back to Madrid,"" he cried, ""and as to the"
"town watch they are either drunk or in their dotage!"""
Meantime the main body of the gipsies waited patiently in the
"background, and every few minutes their numbers were augmented by the"
arrival of others over the various passes of the mountains. These took
"their places without salutation, like men expected, and fell promptly to"
"listening to the conversation of the two great men, who sat smoking"
their cigarettes each on his own stone in the wide wild corrie among the
rocks of the Guadarrama which had been chosen as an appropriate
rendezvous.
"Singularly enough, after the sergeant had shown the scarlet mark of the"
"strangling ring about his neck, no one of all that company doubted for a"
Doome took an early opportunity to draw me aside and to whisper to me
the grave disappointment it must be to all who respected him if they
"should discover the real Don Juan, begged me not to expose him, and"
pointed out the serious loss of prestige he must suffer in the eyes of
the British Public; so we sat down together on a sofa and pitied him
for his decencies.
"Luddy, luddy! how the homely virtues will persist!"
"The idol of our youth, the dark, mysteriously wicked man--with feet of"
"honest clay and a clean simple heart after all! Even prolific, and----"
"Well, damn romance, say I...."
"Oh, and more!"
Even the gods fall out--drift apart.
Aubrey and the O’Myre go different ways--Aubrey in pain that O’Myre
has now discovered that there is no great work of art without a moral
"purpose--Aubrey holding that Aubrey himself is sufficient purpose. He,"
"Aubrey, avers that he has found himself--nothing matters after that."
He must back to Paris. There the women have secular lips and voices
of brocade and understand being loved. Tiens! He will in future give
his splendid talents to attack the Philistinic brutality of strength
and the barbarity of the over-rated glory in mere outdoor delight
that to-day holds England in poisonous embrace; in all the pride of
"effeminacy he withdraws into the palace of his Egoism, where he is"
"lord--back to Paris--_there_ are mirrors, where he may reflect upon"
"himself, take himself up by the roots and dwell upon his own image!"
"him--namely, that the Regent and her daughter were by no means averse to"
"Holy Church, nor yet eager to keep the true King out of his own. But,"
"they were in the power of unscrupulous men--Mendizábal, Linares, and"
"others, who for their own ends published edicts and compelled the ladies"
"to sign them. If they were captured and sequestered for their own good,"
the ministry would break down and Don Carlos would reign undisturbed.
Rollo thought the exposition a marvel of clearness and point. It was
"somewhat disappointing, therefore, when he had finished to hear from"
"Cabrera the unmoved declaration: ""A Cristino is a Cristino whether in"
the palace of Madrid or on the mountains of Morella. And the quickest
"way is the best way with such an one, wherever met with!"""
"""But you do not mean to say that you would shoot the girl-Queen or the"
"mother-Regent if they fell into your hands?"" cried Rollo, aghast at the"
horror.
The deep underlying anger leaped up fiery red into the eyes of the
_guerrilla_ chief.
"""Aye, that would I,"" he cried, ""as quickly as they slew my own old"
"mother in the barrack yard of Tortosa!"""
"And thinking of that tragedy and the guilt of Nogueras, Rollo felt there"
"was something to be said for the indomitable, implacable little"
butcher-general of Don Carlos.
"Cabrera was silent for a while after making this speech, and then"
abruptly demanded of Rollo how many men he would require for his
undertaking.
"""I am bidden to place my entire command at your service,"" he said with"

It will be realised from the scanty number of examples offered in
"this section that it is only a side issue, a mere suggestion of an"
"occasional alternative for the Story-hour, as likely to develop the"
imagination.
I think it is well to have a good number of stories illustrating the
importance of common sense and resourcefulness. For this reason I
consider that stories treating of the ultimate success of the youngest
"son are very admirable for the purpose, because the youngest child,"
"who begins by being considered inferior to the elder ones, triumphs in"
"the end, either from resourcefulness, or from common sense, or from"
"some high quality, such as kindness to animals, courage in overcoming"
"difficulties, etc.[27]"
Thus we have the story of Cinderella. The cynic might imagine that it
was the diminutive size of her foot that ensured her success: the child
"does not realise any advantage in this, but, though the matter need not"
"be pressed, the story leaves us with the impression that Cinderella had"
"been patient and industrious, forbearing with her sisters. We know that"
"she was strictly obedient to her godmother, and in order to be this"
she makes her dramatic exit from the ball which is the beginning of
her triumph. There are many who might say that these qualities do not
ten of them.
"At last they met with a French vessel, a Martinico ship, of twelve guns,"
"and hunger drove them to attack even so big a ship as this, but the sight"
of the Black flag so terrified the French crew that they surrendered
"without firing a shot. After this, they took several vessels, and matters"
began to look much brighter. Phillips quickly developed into a most
"accomplished and bloody pirate, butchering his prisoners on very little or"
on no provocation whatever. But even this desperate pirate had an
"occasional ""qualm of conscience come athwart his stomach,"" for when he"
"captured a Newfoundland vessel and was about to scuttle her, he found out"
"that she was the property of a Mr. Minors of that island, from whom they"
"stole the original vessel in which they went a-pirating, so Phillips,"
"telling his companions ""We have done him enough injury already,"" ordered"
"the vessel to be repaired and returned to the owner. On another occasion,"
"they took a ship, the master of which was a ""Saint"" of New England, by"
"name Dependance Ellery, who gave them a pretty chase before being"
"overhauled, and so, as a punishment, the ""Saint"" was compelled to dance"
the deck until he fell down exhausted.
"This pirate's career ended with a mutiny of his unruly crew, Phillips"
being tripped up and then thrown overboard to drown off Newfoundland in
"April, 1724."
"During the nine months of Phillips's command as a pirate captain, he"
accounted for more than thirty ships.
"PHILLIPS, JOSEPH."
One of Teach's crew. Hanged in Virginia in 1718.
"the Field hospital three days, during which time he exhibited"
"no serious abdominal symptoms, but during the journey to Orange"
River (53-1/2 miles) he was sick. He remained at Orange River
"two days, and while there an enema was administered, producing"
a normal motion. The abdomen was slightly distended; it moved
"fairly, there was slight rigidity, but little tenderness."
"Temperature 100.8°, pulse 120. No appearance of fæces in wound."
When seen on the sixth day the condition was as
follows:--Patient cheerful and not in great pain. Temperature
"99.2°; pulse 120; respirations 48, very shallow. Abdomen soft,"
"moving freely, no distension or general tenderness. Fluid fæces"
escaping in abundance from the wound in loin. Redness of skin
"and swelling below level of wound, and cellular emphysema"
above. Fæcal-smelling fluid was also escaping from the thoracic
wound.
"The wound was enlarged, but the patient rapidly sank, and died"
of septicæmia on the seventh day.
(183*) An exactly similar case came under observation from the
"battle of Modder River, except that the opening in the loin was"
"somewhat larger, and earlier and freer escape of fæces took"
place from it. In this also fæcal matter passed freely into the
"left pleural cavity, and fæcal matter was expectorated, while"
there was an almost complete absence of abdominal symptoms.
Death occurred on the fourth day.
"No _post-mortem_ examination was made in either case, but I"
believe in both the extra-peritoneal aspect of the colon was
implicated and that the septicæmia was in great part due to
"absorption from the pleural rather than the peritoneal cavity,"
"odor, free from yeastiness and a fruity, agreeable, slightly spirituous"
"taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. The Pharmacopoeia (1890)"
"directs that the wine should contain from 7 to 12 per cent, by weight,"
"of absolute alcohol. California Hock and Reisling, Ohio Catawba, Sherry,"
"Muscatel, Madeira or the stronger wines of the Rhine, Mediterranean and"
Hungary come within the pharmacopoeial limits. Wines containing more
"than 14 per cent of alcohol are usually fortified, i. e., have alcohol"
"or brandy added to them, and much imported Sherry and Madeira contain 15"
"to 20 per cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol."
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
VINUM RUBRUM--RED WINE
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting the juice of fresh
"colored grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera, in presence of their"
skins.
"PROPERTIES.--A deep red liquid, having a pleasant odor, free from"
"yeastiness, and a fruity moderately astringent, pleasant and slightly"
"acidulous taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. Should contain"
"not less than 7 nor more than 12 per cent, by weight, of alcohol. Native"
"Claret, Burgundy, Bordeaux and Hungarian wines may be included within"
the pharmacopoeial limits of vinum rubrum. Port (vinum portense) is
"fortified with brandy during fermentation, and contains 15 to 25 per"
"cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol. Port is astringent from tannic"
"acid in the grapes, skin and stalks, or the astringency may be due to"
"logwood. Red wines are said to be rough, contain tannic acid and"
therefore are astringents. Dry wines are those which contain little
sugar. The wines develop ethers with age and these improve their flavor
and action.

"I thought before I began to write, and I have become more and more"
"certain of it as I have taken up subject after subject, that to all the"
great differences of thought between them and us there is one key. And
"this key is that they believe the world is governed by eternal laws,"
"that have never changed, that will never change, that are founded on"
"absolute righteousness; while we believe in a personal God, altering"
"laws, and changing moralities according to His will."
"If I were to rewrite this book, I should do so from this standpoint of"
"eternal laws, making the book an illustration of the proposition."
"Perhaps it is better as it is, in that I have discovered the key at the"
end of my work instead of at the beginning. I did not write the book to
"prove the proposition, but in writing the book this truth has become"
apparent to me.
"The more I have written, the clearer has this teaching become to me,"

sufficiently high to attract the very best material. In colonial
Universities they manage to get very distinguished men without any
extravagantly high pay. Possibly the present departmental method of
election does not admit of sufficiently wide publicity of notice to
attract the best candidates.

that Indian graduates of European Universities who have distinguished
themselves in a remarkable manner do not for one reason or other find
facilities for entering the higher Educational Service.

"At a quarter to one two ""G's""--the officers' call--sounded, and the"
"first hundred men, mustering by open list, assembled in the Port"
"Battery. On the quarter-deck tables were placed in position, on each"
of which were teak trays divided into small compartments by brass
strips. In each of these divisions a man's monthly pay and allowance
money had already been placed and checked by the paymaster and his
staff.
"Owing to the conditions of war-time the captain was not present, his"
duty of superintending the payment being taken by the commander. At
"the tables stood the staff-paymaster, the R.N.R. assistant-paymaster,"
and the chief writer.
"The staff-paymaster glanced at the commander, indicating that all was"
"in readiness. The commander gave the word to carry on, and the"
disbursing of coin began.
The assistant-paymaster called the men's names from a book. Each
"seaman stepped briskly forward to the chalk line, removed his cap,"
"discovered embrace all the leading types of invertebrate life, and"
are so varied that we must believe that their lines of descent
stretch far back into the pre-Cambrian past.
"PLANTS. No remains of plants have been found in Cambrian strata,"
"except some doubtful markings, as of seaweed."
"SPONGES. The sponges, the lowest of the multicellular animals,"
were represented by several orders. Their fossils are recognized
"by the siliceous spicules, which, as in modern sponges, either"
were scattered through a mass of horny fibers or were connected in
a flinty framework.
COELENTERATES. This subkingdom includes two classes of interest to
"the geologist,--the HYDROZOA, such as the fresh-water hydra and"
"the jellyfish, and the CORALS. Both classes existed in the"
Cambrian.
The Hydrozoa were represented not only by jellyfish but also by
"the GRAPTOLITE, which takes its name from a fancied resemblance of"
some of its forms to a quill pen. It was a composite animal with a
"horny framework, the individuals of the colony living in cells"
"strung on one or both sides along a hollow stem, and communicating"
by means of a common flesh in this central tube. Some graptolites
"were straight, and some curved or spiral; some were single"
"stemmed, and others consisted of several radial stems united."
Graptolites occur but rarely in the Upper Cambrian. In the
"Ordovician and Silurian they are very plentiful, and at the close"
"of the Silurian they pass out of existence, never to return."
"CORALS are very rarely found in the Cambrian, and the description"
of their primitive types is postponed to later chapters treating
The gypsum and salt deposits of the Salina show that toward the
close of the Silurian period a slight oscillation brought the sea
"floor nearer to the surface, and at the north cut off extensive"
"tracts from the interior sea. In these wide lagoons, which now and"
then regained access to the open sea and obtained new supplies of
"salt water, beds of salt and gypsum were deposited as the briny"
waters became concentrated by evaporation under a desert climate.
Along with these beds there were also laid shales and impure
limestones.
"In New York the ""salt pans"" of the Salina extended over an area"
one hundred and fifty miles long from east to west and sixty miles
"wide, and similar salt marshes occurred as far west as Cleveland,"
"Ohio, and Goderich on Lake Huron. At Ithaca, New York, the series"
"is fifteen hundred feet thick, and is buried beneath an equal"
thickness of later strata. It includes two hundred and fifty feet
"of solid salt, in several distinct beds, each sealed within the"
shales of the series.
Would you expect to find ancient beds of rock salt inclosed in
beds of pervious sandstone?
The salt beds of the Salina are of great value. They are reached
"by well borings, and their brines are evaporated by solar heat and"
by boiling. The rock salt is also mined from deep shafts.
"Similar deposits of salt, formed under like conditions, occur in"
the rocks of later systems down to the present. The salt beds of
"Texas are Permian, those of Kansas are Permian, and those of"
Louisiana are Tertiary.
"to form a much better ""idea of the greatness of the religion of their"
"fathers""? Does it not seem strange that so many hundreds of these"
relics should be kept in those enlightened and happy countries like
"Italy, where ""the achievements of Catholic life"" are so well known,"
"and where Mother Church has for centuries had full sway, and that none"
"of them should be brought to these benighted Protestant regions, where"
they could effect such a salutary change in the faith of the people?
"But, seriously, as I added to my friend in the conversation referred"
"to, I have a better opinion of the intelligence of our good Roman"
Catholic people in America than to believe that they put the slightest
credence in these childish superstitions. Whatever the bishop above
"quoted may believe, I am confident that the intelligent Roman Catholic"
people of our country have no more faith in many of these alleged
relics than we have.

CHAPTER II
WANDERJAHRE--SOCIAL LIFE IN SCOTLAND--BEGINNING OF HIS LITERARY LIFE
In the present century in Germany we have seen a period of almost
unparalleled literary glory succeeded by a time of great commercial
prosperity and national enthusiasm. But when Ferrier visited that
country in 1834 the era of its intellectual greatness had hardly passed
"away; some, at least, of its stars remained, and others had very"
"recently ceased to be. Goethe had died just two years before, but Heine"
"lived till many years afterwards; amongst the philosophers, though Kant"
"and Fichte, of course, were long since gone, Schelling was still at"
"work at Munich, and Hegel lived at Berlin till November of 1831, when"
he was cut off during an epidemic of cholera. Most of the great men had
"disappeared, and yet the memory of their achievements still survived,"
and the impetus they gave to thought could not have been lost. The
traditional lines of speculation consistently carried out since
"Reformation days had survived war and national calamity, and it"
remained to be seen whether the greater tests of prosperity and success
would be as triumphantly undergone.
We can imagine Ferrier's feelings when this new world opened up before
"him, a Scottish youth, to whom it was a new, untrodden country. It may"
be true that it was his literary rather than his speculative affinities
that first attracted him to Germany. To form in literature he always
"attached the greatest value, and to the end his interest in letters was"
only second to his attachment to philosophy. German poetry was to him
"follow, and then occurs the sentence--unhappily a stereotyped one in"
our day--“_This is the lowest rate recorded in any quarter since civil

Now and again a blue-book upon the subject of the birth-rate is
dissected by a journalist and the result appears in his newspaper as a
series of startling figures. The story of England’s decadence is set
out in the plainest language for every one to read.
"At rarer intervals still, some prominent clergyman or sociologist"
"writes or lectures in order to call attention to what is going on, and"
thus to bring home the spiritual and economic dangers of our racial

A few people read or listen and are convinced. A good many other
people are too utterly ignorant of either the Philosophy of
Christianity or the Science of Sociology to understand in the least
what the point of view of the protesters is. According to their
"temperament, they smile quietly and dismiss the subject, or bellow"
their disgust at such a subject being mentioned at all.

Mr. Watson Cheyne[19] published a very remarkable instance of one of the
"dangers of an injury from a spent bullet, in which, in spite of"
"non-penetration of the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was"
ruptured in two places.
I believe the majority of the wounds designated as explosive were the
"result of the passage of large leaden bullets, either of the"
Martini-Henry or Express type. The small opportunity of observing such
injuries in the hospitals of course depended on the fact that the
majority were rapidly fatal.
_Nature of the anatomical lesion in wounds of the intestine._--The
openings in the parietal peritoneum tended to assume the slit or star
"forms, probably on account of the elasticity of the membrane. A diagram"
of one of these forms is appended to fig. 89. In this instance the
"opening in the peritoneum was made from the abdominal aspect, prior to"
"the escape of the bullet from the cavity, and on the impact of the tip,"
the long axis of the bullet was oblique to the surface of the abdominal
wall.
In the intestinal wall the openings varied in character according to the
mode of impact.
In some cases the gut was merely contused by lateral contact of the
passing bullet. The result of this was evidenced later by the presence
of localised oval patches of ecchymosis. These were identical in
appearance with the patches shown surrounding the wounds in fig. 87.

"away, he could discern the débris of the bridge. Charthouse,"
"stanchions, semaphore, signal-lockers--all had vanished, and with"
them the captain and those of the officers and men who had dared fate
"by rejecting the shelter afforded by the conning-tower, which,"
"stripped of its surroundings, stood out a gaunt, fire-pitted steel"
box.
"The shell, a 42-centimetre, had literally cleared the forepart of the"
"ship, from the for'ard 6-inch gun to the second funnel. Everything in"
"its path had been literally pulverized, with the exception of the"
conning-tower. Had the projectile burst on or below the main deck the
"fate of the ""Sunderland"" would have been sealed; as it was, she was"
still intact under the waterline.
Instinctively Aubyn realized that the ship was not under control.
"Steaming rapidly she was heading towards the ""Bradford""--her sister"
ship--which was steering in a north-easterly direction at about five
cables' distance on her port bow.
With a tremendous effort of will-power Terence cleared at a bound the
formidable glowing plate of metal that obstructed his path. Making
"his way across the scorched and splintered planks, some of which gave"

It is a matter of intense regret that so very few people have
sufficiently clear remembrance of their own childhood to help them to
understand the taste and point of view of the _normal_ child. There
is a passage in the “Brownies” (by Mrs. Ewing) which illustrates the
confusion created in the child mind by a facetious allusion in a
dramatic moment which needed a more direct treatment.
"When the nursery toys have all gone astray, one little child exclaims"
joyfully:
"“Why, the old Rocking-Horse's nose has turned up in the oven!”"
"“It couldn't” remarks a tiresome, facetious doctor, far more anxious"
to be funny than to sympathise with the joy of the child; “it was the
"purest Grecian, modelled from the Elgin marbles.”"
"Now, for grown-up people this is an excellent joke, but for a child"
"who has not yet become acquainted with these Grecian masterpieces, the"
whole remark is pointless and hampering.[20]
VI.--_Stories which appeal to fear or priggishness._ This is a class of
story to be avoided which scarcely counts to-day and against which the
teacher does not need a warning; but I wish to make a passing allusion
"to it, partly to round off my subject and partly to show that we have"
made some improvement in choice of subject.

"offered to our children within the last hundred years, I feel that,"
"though our progress in intelligent mental catering may be slow, it"
is real and sure. One has only to take some examples from the Chap
PREFACE
The aim of this book is to serve as a companion to the _Mennonite
"Hymnary_. It seeks to explain, as far as possible, the origin of the"
words and music of every hymn in the _Hymnary_.
"The great lyrics of the church, contributed by every age since the days"
"of the apostles, are a precious heritage, and a source of inspiration"
and power. This work is intended to foster an understanding of and love
"for our hymns, new and old, and to stimulate the time-honored and"
blessed practice of congregational singing in the church today.
The _Handbook_ may be found useful as an aid (1) in the private study of
hymns or their use in family devotions; (2) in selecting suitable hymns
for the many and varied services of public worship; (3) in preparing
special music services or hymn sings where such occasions are planned to
improve the singing in the church; (4) for study groups in hymnology in
churches and schools. The historical development of hymnology may be
followed in the brief “Introduction to Our Hymns and Tunes.”
The author has endeavored to make the work as comprehensive as possible
without overburdening the reader with too many details. Many hymns have
"interesting stories connected with their origin and use while others,"
"equally valuable, were just written, without drama or incident, the poet"
"scarcely knowing how or why, except that the Inner Voice spoke. The"
apocryphal tales which have been circulated concerning some hymns have
been studiously avoided. The aim has been to include only such material
as seems to bear genuine marks of authenticity. The bibliography of
"4th February 1916. ""Many striking addresses were delivered on the"
occasion. Professor J.C. Bose in his masterly address went to the root
of the matter and pointed in an inspiring manner what should be done to
make the Hindu University worthy of its name. He deprecated a repetition
"of the Universities of the West."" He said:--"
In tracing the characteristic phenomenon of life from simple beginnings
"in that vast region which may be called unvoiced, as exemplified in the"
"world of plants, to its highest expression in the animal kingdom, one is"
repeatedly struck by the one dominant fact that in order to maintain an
organism at the height of its efficiency something more than a
mechanical perfection of its structure is necessary. Every living
"organism, in order to maintain its life and growth, must be in free"
communion with all the forces of the Universe about it.
STIMULUS WITHIN AND WITHOUT
"Further, it must not only constantly receive stimulus from without, but"
"must also give out something from within, and the healthy life of the"
organism will depend on these two fold activities of inflow and
"outflow. When there is any interference with these activities, then"
"morbid symptoms appear, which ultimately must end in disaster and death."
This is equally true of the intellectual life of a Nation. When through
narrow conceit a Nation regards itself self-sufficient and cuts itself
"from the stimulus of the outside world, then intellectual decay must"
inevitably follow.
SPECIAL FUNCTION OF A NATION
So far as regards the receptive function. Then there is another function
"will attribute such qualities as are predominant in themselves, as they"
"consider admirable; and, indeed, all supernatural beings are but the"
magnified shadows of man cast by the light of his imagination upon the
mists of his ignorance.
"Therefore, when you find that a people make their spirits beautiful and"
"fair, calm and even tempered, loving peace and the beauty of the trees"
"and rivers, shrinkingly averse from loud words, from noises, and from"
"the taking of life, it is because the people themselves think that these"
"are great qualities. If no stress be laid upon their courage, their"
"activity, their performance of great deeds, it is because the people who"
"imagine them care not for such things. There is no truer guide, I am"
"sure, to the heart of a young people than their superstitions; these"
"they make entirely for themselves, apart from their religion, which is,"
"to a certain extent, made for them. That is why I have written this"
chapter on Nats: not because I think it affects Buddhism very much one
"way or another, but because it seems to me to reveal the people"
"themselves, because it helps us to understand them better, to see more"
"with their eyes, to be in unison with their ideas--because it is a great"
key to the soul of the people.
CHAPTER XXII
"DEATH, THE DELIVERER"
"'The end of my life is near at hand; seven days hence, like a man"
"who rids himself of a heavy load, I shall be free from the burden"
of my body.'--_Death of the Buddha._
"cliffs. Each was followed at regular intervals, until a double row of"
swift air-craft flying with methodical precision headed towards the
Flanders shore.
"Already the ""Sunderland"" and three other light cruisers, accompanied"
"by a torpedo-boat destroyer flotilla, were shaping a course for the"
Belgian coast.
Off the East Goodwins they were joined by two monitors and three
"pre-Dreadnought battleships, and the battle line was formed. Away"
"steamed the destroyers to act as screens to the heavier vessels, and"
to guard them from submarine attack. The monitors led the main
"division, the cruisers acting as links between them and the"
"battleships, which, owing to their greater draught, could not"
approach the coast nearer than a distance of from four to seven
miles.
From Aubyn's point of view the forthcoming operations were entirely
new. For the first time in his experience he was to take part in an
"action between ships and shore batteries, the latter being both fixed"
and mobile. It was a comparatively easy matter to plant shells into
"forts the position of which were known, but the Germans had brought"
"up heavy guns mounted on travelling platforms, which could be moved"
"with considerable celerity behind the long, low-lying sand dunes"
between Nieuport and Zeebrugge.
It was partly to locate the latter that the airmen had preceded the
"bombarding ships, and also to harass the enemy's lines of"
"communication. Moreover, hostile submarines were reported to have"
"been brought in sections to Zeebrugge, where they were being bolted"
together ready to take the offensive against the British vessels
operating off the Belgian coast.
elevation of the main figures and intensifying of the catastrophe which
"tragic emotion demands. Unfortunately, from the start the author seems"
to have been obsessed with the notion that the familiar rant of Herod
"was peculiarly suited to his subject. In such a notion there lay, of"
"course, the half-truth that lofty thoughts and impassioned speech are"
"more befitting the sombre muse than the foolish chatter of clowns. But,"
"except where his own deliberately introduced mirth-makers are speaking,"
he will have nothing but pompous rhetoric from the lips of his
characters. His prologue begins his speech with the sounding line:
Who doth desire the trump of fame to sound unto the skies--
Virginius's wife makes her début upon the stage with this encouraging
remark to her companion:
"The pert and prickly prime of youth ought chastisement to have,"
"But thou, dear daughter, needest not, thyself doth show thee grave."
To which Virginia most becomingly answers:
"Refell your mind of mournful plaints, dear mother, rest your mind."
"After this every one feels that the wicked judge, Appius, has done no"
"more than his duty when he exclaims, at his entrance:"
The furrowed face of fortune's force my pinching pain doth move.
Virginius slays his daughter on the stage and serves her head up in a
"charger before Appius, who promptly bursts into a cataclysm of C's ('O"
"curst and cruel cankered churl, O carl unnatural'); but there is not a"
suggestion of the pathos noticed in _Cambyses_. Instead there is in one
"place a sort of frantic agitation, which the author doubtless thought"
Presently the seaplanes ceased firing and circled triumphantly over
"their vanquished foe. They knew that the Zeppelin was doomed, and"
instincts of humanity forbade them to take undue advantage of the
plight of her crew.
"""Away, boats!"" ordered the ""Sunderland's"" captain."
Instantly there was a rush to man the boats and to stand by the
"falls. With an alacrity that was part of his nature, Jack Tar"
"prepared to rescue his enemy, in spite of the fact that that enemy"
had sallied forth with the deliberate intention of hurling bombs with
"the utmost indiscrimination upon combatants and non-combatants alike,"
not excepting helpless women and children.
"Before the boats could be lowered a lurid blaze of light rolled out,"
rivalling the rays of the rising sun. Where the Zeppelin had been
"only a cloud of flame-tinged smoke remained, while from the"
mushroomed pall of vapour that marked a funereal pyre of yet another
"unit of the Kaiser's air-fleet, scorched and twisted girders and"
other débris streamed seawards.
Whether by accident or design the only remaining petrol tank had
"exploded, and the flames instantly igniting the huge volume of"
hydrogen had in the twinkling of an eye completed the work of
destruction.
For ten minutes the destroyers cruised over the spot where the
"débris had disappeared, but there were no signs of survivors, not"
even of wreckage. The remains of the Zeppelin had been swallowed up
"by the insatiable sea, and no visible trophy remained in the hands of"
the men who had baulked an attempted raid on the largest city of the
CHAPTER III
PHILOSOPHY BEFORE FERRIER'S DAY
In attempting to give some idea of philosophy as it was in Scotland in
"the earlier portion of the present century, we shall have to go back"
"two hundred years or thereabout, in order to find a satisfactory basis"
"from which to start. For philosophy, as no one realised more than"
"Ferrier, is no arbitrary succession of systems following one upon"
another as their propounders might decree; it is a development in the
truest and highest significance of that word. It means the gradual
working out of the questions which reason sets to be answered; and
"though it seems as if we had sometimes to turn our faces backwards, and"
"to revert to systems of bygone days, we always find, when we look more"
"closely, that in our onward course we have merely dropped some thread"
"in our web, the recovery of which is requisite in order that it may be"
duly taken up and woven with the rest.
"At the time of which we write the so-called 'Scottish School' of Reid,"
"Stewart, and Beattie reigned supreme in orthodox Scotland; it had"
"undisputed power in the Universities, and besides this obtained a very"
"reputable place in the estimation of Europe, and more especially of"
France. As it was this school more especially that Ferrier spent much
"of his time in combating, it is its history and place that we wish"
"shortly to describe. To do so, however, it is needful to go back to its"
"real founder, Locke, in order that its point of view may fairly be set"
forth.
"from an atomizer, about one ounce, usually being enough for the painless"
"opening of abscesses or fistulae, but cocaine is better in our patients."
"_As an anesthetic_ it should be used in preference to chloroform, for"
"the smaller and young animals, especially dogs, which are easily killed"
by chloroform. Ether is less prompt in action but much safer than
"chloroform, as it never paralyzes a healthy heart; it should be inhaled"
"in as concentrated a form as possible, very little air being allowed, so"
"it will exert its effects quickly, in the dog; a light or fire of any"
"kind should not be allowed near, as ether is very inflammable and its"
vapor explosive. Always have a bottle of aqua ammonia fort. at hand as a
restorer.
ALCOHOL
"Alcohol is derived directly from fruit sugar, and indirectly from"
"starch. The grains, as wheat, rye, corn; and potatoes, supply starch"
most economically. The starch in these substances is converted into
"glucose by heating with very dilute sulphuric acid, or by fermentation"
with malt. Glucose is further acted upon by yeast containing the Torula
"cerevisiae, which converts 15 per cent of glucose into alcohol and"
carbonic dioxide. The weak alcohol resulting is subjected to repeated
distillation until sufficiently pure and concentrated. In the natural
"fermentation of fruit sugar in grape juice, during the formation of"
"wine, the amount of alcohol is self-limited to 15, rarely 20 per cent,"
since the ferment is killed by a larger amount of alcohol than this.
"DERIVATION.--The official alcohol is derived from rectified spirits, by"
"maceration, first with anhydrous potassium carbonate, then freshly fused"
"intrusions of molten rock, and have been broken, crumpled, and"
"crushed, and left in interlocking masses so confused that their"
true arrangement can usually be made out only with the greatest
difficulty if at all. The condition of this body of crystalline
rocks is due to the fact that they have suffered not only from the
"faultings, foldings, and igneous intrusions of their time, but"
"necessarily, also, from those of all later geological ages."
At present three leading theories are held as to the origin of
these basal crystalline rocks.
1. They are considered by perhaps the majority of the geologists
who have studied them most carefully to be igneous rocks intruded
in a molten state among the sedimentary rocks involved with them.
In many localities this relation is proved by the phenomena of
contact; but for the most part the deformations which the rocks
have since suffered again and again have been sufficient to
destroy such evidence if it ever existed.
2. An older view regards them as profoundly altered sedimentary
"strata, the most ancient of the earth."
3. According to a third theory they represent portions of the
"earth's original crust; not, indeed, its original surface, but"
deeper portions uncovered by erosion and afterwards mantled with
sedimentary deposits. All these theories agree that the present
foliated condition of these rocks is due to the intense
metamorphism which they have suffered.
It is to this body of crystalline rocks and the stratified rocks
"involved with it, which form a very small proportion of its mass,"
"that the term ARCHEAN (Greek, ARCHE, beginning) is applied by many"

14. If during the continuance of any war in which Her Majesty may be
"neutral, any ship, goods, or merchandize captured as prize of war within"
"the territorial jurisdiction of Her Majesty, in violation of the"
"neutrality of this realm, or captured by any ship which may have been"
"built, equipped, commissioned, or despatched, or the force of which may"
"have been augmented, contrary to the provisions of this Act are brought"
"within the limits of Her Majesty's dominions by the captor, or any agent"
"of the captor, or by any person having come into possession thereof with"
"the knowledge that the same was prize of war so captured as aforesaid,"
"it shall be lawful for the original owner of such prize, or his agent,"
or for any person authorised in that behalf by the Government of the
"foreign state to which such owner belongs, to make application to the"
"Court of Admiralty for seizure and detention of such prize, and the"
"court shall, on due proof of the facts, order such prize to be restored."
Every such order shall be executed and carried into effect in the same
"manner, and subject to the same right of appeal as in the case of any"
"various oscillations. The order to produce short electric oscillations,"
"to detect them and study their optical properties, he had to construct a"
large number of instruments. It was a hard task to produce very short
"electric waves which had enough energy to be detected, but Dr. Bose"
overcame this difficulty by constructing radiators or oscillators of his
"own type, which emitted the shortest waves with sufficient energy. As a"
"receiver he used a sensitive metallic coherer, which in itself led to"
new and important discoveries. When electric waves fall on a loose
"contact between two pieces of metals, the resistance of the contact"
changes and a current passes through the contact indicating the
existence of electrical oscillations. Dr. Bose discovered the surprising
fact that with potassium metal the resistance of the contact increases
under the action of electric waves and that this contact exhibits an
automatic recovery. He found further that the change of the metallic
"contact resistance when acted upon by electric waves, is a function of"
the atomic weight. These phenomena led to a new theory of metallic
coherers. Before these discoveries it was assumed that the particles of
"the two metallic pieces in contact are, as it were, fused together, so"
that the resistance decreases. But the increasing resistance appearing
"for some elements, led to the theory that the electric forces in the"
waves produced a peculiar molecular action or a re-arrangement of the
"molecules, which may either increase or decrease the contact resistance."

"Come on, let's go and pay for the stuff."

"Hello, love."
"It's me, Richie Rich."
A-ha!

I'll give you a mensh on my next prog.
"£200, please."
"My dear girl, you don't seem to understand."
"I, Richie Rich, am offering you, nobody, a mensh on my next prog."
- Right.
This requires subtle handling.
"- £200, please."
How does it feel to be a checkout girl who's reached the peak of your potential?
How does it feel to know that you're a talentless git who never even had any potential?
- I see.
"- £200, please."
Uh.

I know a come-on when I see it.
This is ridiculous.

She fell down the stairs.
Potentially a blow to the head before she fell.
Potentially?
- l don't have all the facts yet.
- Is she all right?
"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.

I'll pass.
"You know, I could do it like in the movies."
I could walk over and borrow a cup of sugar or flour.
"Yeah, if you could find a cup."

- I don't care any more.
- Is that where Julie-Ann died?
"If you jump, they'll say you did it."
I didn't!
I'd never hurt her.
But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.
"David, I know about you and Julie-Ann."
No.
"No, you don't."
She was everything to me.
She...
She was beautiful.
She took away my pain... all of it.
"All I wanted was for us to get away from here, from the estate, the drugs."
From her selling herself.
He thought she was just a junkie with a big mouth.
He didn't know who she was or what she meant to me.
I can see it now.
It's gonna be great.

-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Why?
"Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
"In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner."
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
"What's going on, huh?"
Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe I can help.
"Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
"You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex."
"-So anyway, what is it?"

That's bacon.

I'm not eating it.
"Well, not yet anyway."
Do you know I haven't had bacon for over 30 years?
Because it goes against our beliefs?
"Well, I'm just not sure what our beliefs are anymore."
"Mom, what do you mean?"
You're a Muslim!
What if I'm a Muslim because I was married to a Muslim?
"Well, um, how long have you been feeling this way?"

Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch?"
Do I have to hold a real cat?
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Mmm, yummers."
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What?
"No, ew, Jenna."
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
"Hi, uh, what are you doing down here?"
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
Afghanistan is a different situation...
I'll have an apple juice.
"Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a...
"Leslie Davison was Emma's donor, correct?"
How did you get that information?
She has something to do with the murders.
"Yeah, Leslie Davison is the donor."
Emma's with her mother right now.
Someone who said he was her lawyer... gave me the address.
"Leslie, put it on."
You're so beautiful.
Stand by for the all call.
Attention all units and all districts.
I'm on South Sawyer.
Can you hear me?
Unit 12 proceeding southwest Harvard.
ETA South Sawyer 3 minutes.
You're not Leslie.
You're one of them.
You killed her to give you life... like that fat sow who had her heart... her little beating heart and all that f...
"Blind as a fucking bat, aren't you?"
I'm closer than you think.
I could be right beside you... and you wouldn't even know.
I'm coming.
I should've just gone for her.
I should've just...
I should be with her.
Help!
Somebody!
I'm in here!
Help!

[Outboard Engine Running]
[Speaking French]
[French]
[Chuckles]
Alain.
Bonjour.
Enchanté.
[Tapping]
[Cloudy] Our friend's name is Boca—
Salvatore Boca.
B-O-C-A.
They call him Sal.
He's a sweetheart.
He was picked up on suspicion of armed robbery.
"Now, get this."
Three years ago he tries to hold up Tiffany's... on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight.
He coulda got two and a half to five... but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute.
"Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled off a contract on a guy named DeMarco."
[Jimmy] What about his old lady?
Her name's Angie.
She's a fast filly.
- She drew a suspended for shoplifting a year ago.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
She's only a kid.
"Nineteen, according to the marriage license."
Mmm.
Nineteen going on 50.
What else?
He's had the store a year and a half.
Takes in a fast seven grand a year.
So what's he doing with two cars... and hundred-dollar tabs at the Chez?
The LTD's in his wife's name.
And where do you think you're going?
"Oh, I thought I'd try my luck in Haematology."
I know what you are.
"So, you know what I'll do if you come any nearer, Goldie."
"- What, like the rapper?"
"- No, the Blue Peter dog."
"Oh, right, yeah, cos..."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's, um... cutting."
"But, you know, having worked with drunks in AE for two years, it takes a little more than that to scare me."
"Look, I'm not some naughty little kid."
"Yeah, draining a defenceless old man of blood is a step beyond naughty."
Now... settle!
"OK, um... just keep telling yourself, ""I've got this job."""
I've turned up.
I have got this job.
"Ah, the banks have crunched."
Do not get cocky.
"Oh, thank you."
Thank you so much for the vote of confidence.
"Mm, and keep saying the interviewer's name."
That builds a bond.
"Like, ""Yes, Ken."
"You're right, Ken."
"""I totally agree with you..."
"Ken."""
- See?
- Mr Mitchell.
- Yeah.
- Don't call her Ken.
Hmm.
Seriously.
"- Tennison, are you hurt?"
- No.
No.
It's...
It's not my blood.
It's...
It's David Bentley's.
He's dead.
Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"We'll get you in the car, all right?"
"Take her to the station, OK?"
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
"Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?"
No doubt the same as mine.
That you were mad.
She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
"Kath, you can't give up."
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
"It's not giving up, accepting your limitations."
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.
Funeral's tomorrow.
So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.
Ted Carter?
- No.
"- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!"
I'm not lying to you.
"Doc, help me."
I need your help.
"What do you mean by ""help""?"
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.
There's nothing I can give you.
Tell me who's responsible.
I can help you that way.
You can get married.
He's already married.
Then he'll have to take care of you and provide for the baby.
Who is it?
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!
"I've done a lot of things, but I've never broken a law."
What you're asking me to do is break the law of man and God.
"Now, tell me, who is the man?"
"Selena, tell me who he is."
Who is he?
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather!
It's Lucas!
"Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink."
I've got Selena in my office.
Selena?
What for?
She's pregnant.
I told her she'd get in trouble.
"I'll take you to a movie, ok?"
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, rags."
"We'll have a good day, huh?"
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's ok."
"Well, thank you very much, but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?"
You like him.
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
"What is this, huh?"
"You're going to marry him, aren't you?"
"Oh, God, are you kidding?"
Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you get that idea?
But you like him.
Of course.
"I like pizzas, too, but I'm not going to marry one."
You don't like him like daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
Burke just comes around here a lot because...
"Well, he's lonely."
Don't got nothin' to do.
"Well, I heard..."
Differently.
"Oh, you did?"
What did you hear?
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
(sighs)
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
-l'm stuck here with you.
-Yeah.
"And what have you got, huh?"
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
-How could that possibly matter?
"-What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
-lt means everything.
-What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
-Mmm-hmm...
-This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
"You think you're not a part of this, huh?"
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
-Safety's off. lt's good to go.
I'll wait.
It's okay.
"Just tell me anytime, I just wanted to give it to you now just in case..."
No.
No?
"I can't wait to tell you yes, I'll marry you."
Load it 300 okay?
.
Thank you!
-Just there in the other block.
-I'll ask permission first.
"-Hello, Grandma!"
"-That's why be good my dear, okay?"
"But of course Grandma, I'm being a good girl!"
-You can even ask sister...
-You're such a joker!
"Hello Grandma, of course I should still be your prettiest and your favorite granddaughter!"
"Oh my, my granddaughter is really clever."
So how are you my dear?
What made you call?
"Well, there's something I'd like to ask your permission for."
I'm getting married.
Really?
Is it to your boyfriend who's a doctor?
.
"Yes Grandma, to Migs!"
Our wedding will be on June 1 0.
-Oh my I'm excited!
-You know what Grandma?
I love Migs so much.
And I know he'll take care of me.
"Come on, my dear."
Trying to get into shape.
Some other shape other than hot dog or igloo.
I can't think of nothing new.
"You know, there's more than just those two shapes?"
There is?
Let's try this one.
An octagon.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like that Chuck Norris movie?
That ain't Chuck Norris.
And it's not an octagan either.
"Hey, do Octopussy."
Like this here?
That's what I'm talking about.
There you go.
You know what?
I gotta go take a dump.
I don't know.
All these shapes just freakin' hurtin' my kidneys.
Why can't people just like me for me?
"But sadly, no one does."
Not even the president.
"He's a great guy, though."
"If I don't come up with some new shapes,"
I'm gonna lose my damn job.
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.
I have an idea.
That will cost you $20 dollars.
What do you want?
Shake:
Get your car washed.

-I'll introduce you to my childhood best friend.
-But why will I meet her just now?
"-Because she came from Canada, she just arrived."
-Make sure she's just your best friend okay?
-Yes!
Come on!
What?
"You know, Migs and I have been playing together since we're 2 years old."
"As a matter of fact, he's my first boyfriend!"
How old was I when I answered you?
"-Around 1 6, right?"
-What 1 6?
Around 1 5 and three fourths!
-Come on.
-So you've been a couple.
Yes!
"We're childhood sweethearts, right?"
"I'm sorry, I thought Migs told you."
"No, it's okay!"
I was just surprised because he never mentioned that to me.
Haven't I told you about it?
"You know, why don't you guys tell me how you met?"
Oh!
It's like this.
"We were together in the hospital, she's a nurse there."
There it is!
Hence the uniform!
Then it's okay that you're together!
"Are you okay, Joy?"
.
Are you okay?
It isn't ladylike.
I don't want to be ladylike.
"Yes, you do."
"That's why you're joining the Honeybee Scouts, so you can play with normal kids instead of those two animals."
I'm getting cleaned!
I don't want to be a Honeybee Scout.
I like rockets and computers.
So marry an astronaut.
"But for now, go play with those girls down there doing girl stuff."
Dad!
- What're you guys doing?
- Waking up fish.
Cool!
I give up.
"Christ, she's got bigger balls than Bill."
Fight for my pleasure!
That jerk ruins everything fun.
We have to stand up to him this year.
"I just curl into a ball and sing ""Hot Cross Buns."""

We'll fix this place up.

I just came to apologize for calling your Mom Mrs. Hakkarainen.
I don't know...
"You never know, except in here."
"Remember Pepita the Elephant, Jemina?"
"When your real pa died, you and Selena and Joey had to have a father."
Lucas tries hard to be a good man.
"- Goodbye, Ma."
- Paul.
"Selena, don't you ask me to stay."
My babysitting money.
I wish there was more.
Paul.
"Paul, I'll do extra work."
I'll find a job and get the money back.
Don't leave.
I'm sorry we got into a fight.
It won't happen again.
I give you my word.
"Paul, Paul!"
He'll come back.
"You wait and see, he'll come back."
Nellie I'm going to try hard not to drink anymore.
Selena I'm gonna try harder than I ever tried anything.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
"May I have fried eggs and a cup of coffee, please?"
- All right.
- Do you have a washroom where I can clean up?
- First door.
"Oh, yeah."
Thank you.
- What you selling?
- Nothing.
"Sorry, I thought you might be a traveling man."
"No, I came here to get a job."
I should have known.
That cave...
I feel cold.
That place... it is strong with the dark side.
"Mm, a domain of evil, it is."
In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
"Yeah, whatever."
"What's good, Robert?"
!
What's really good?
!
Aah!
"That's right, Robert!"
I'm you!
Aah!
"I can't believe you going out like this, granddad."
"Nigga, hush!"
"Uh, yes, I-I just want to make sure that the sergeant know it's Robert Freeman."
"I'm at the mall, and I'm gonna be attacked by this crazy nigga at any time."
Okay?
So they're on their way?
"Okay, just making sure."
"Granddad, you do this, you really gonna be a bitch-ass nigga."
"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised 'cause if I Google ""bitch nigga,"" I'll find you, but damn!"
Ow!
I'm afraid to show my face!
"Hey, look who's coming."
"Go home, old man!"
You're a loser!
- [Cheers and applause
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?
Nothing.
It's just...
Fresh margs!
This is some weak margarita.
Whatever.
You're the lightweight.
"Oh, ho, ho, say it over here."
Come here.
I hope your parents never come home.
"Seriously, dawg, let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground."
Who dat?
That freak from Chino.
He was all up in Luke's grill.
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.
I heard he's like a total psycho.
He's a little bitch.
"I see that kid around again, I'm going to beat his ass."
"Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure."
I gotta go.
Hey wait up.
Where you going?
I can't be here right now.
What's the matter?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about him.
He could be anywhere.
"Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine."
We should just try again when it's light out.
Could be too late by then.
Number...
"I mean, how hard is that?"
"I mean, a talking monkey could do her job."
It's embarrassing.
"Actually, that's 16."
"See, you're holding it upside-down."
"Oh, it's..."
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
It's no big deal.
"Look, I've seen it my whole life."
I've never seen it under the six.
"Why don't we ask Natalie, then?"
"Well, she's the expert."
Okay.
Okay.
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
All I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie.
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night, after the show, she got somebody fired."
Really?
One of the crew.
Sound guy.
There were some wires on the floor.
She was...
"You know, complaining."
"And, I mean, I met the guy when I was there."
He was a nice kid.
Was he on his way to tell me that he loved me?
What should I do if he wasn't?
"Gil Da Ran,"
I love you.
He was probably going to say it like that to you.
Alright then.
Is that so?
"It would be so, right?"
"If it's like that, I worried uselessly."
Like a fool!
"Yeah, yeah."
Like a fool.
Let's pack up your clothes!
This color suits Yoon Jae very well.
This color is good too!
This one matches well too.
"Here, go pack it up."
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
"Aish, what's this?"
Are these the keys for this house?
No.
Is it the contracted room for us after we get married?
What should we do?
"Wait a moment, and go answer the phone naturally."
What?
Hello?
"Oh, Yoon Jae."
- It's Se Young.
- So you were home?
- The doctor friend that you saw at the hospital.
I was so worried because you didn't answer your phone.
"I know with our history, you'll think I made this up--"
"Andy, what?"
"Now, an incident has occurred at my apartment. lt's not fit for visitors."
-l don't believe this.
-You wanna know what happened?
-No.
"-Hey, John, good morning."
"I've heard about fungus in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--"
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?
What happened?
"Well, I have a very bad gas leak."
"Now, I called the gas people."
There is no way I'm gonna feel comfortable exposing you to danger.
-We're back to square one?
-We are definitely not at square one.
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a changed man. I have a dangerous leak.
"That's all we're talking about here, now."
"You want some advice, Andy?"
Get it fixed.
WOMAN:
Mike?
Roberts?
-Mike Roberts around?
I gotta see Mike.
DONNA:
He's not here.
Mike?
"-Hey, Roberts."
-Excuse me.
Who is it?
It's Gargan.
Long distance.
- Huh?
- Gargan.
- At this hour?
- Yeah.
"Hello, Mr. Gargan."
"Oh, listen, Thompson, I'm gonna be out of the state for a week or 10 days."
"Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Gargan."
We'll miss you.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
"But listen, I gotta make a business trip."
"When I come back, I'm gonna have a conference with the governor."
- You get me?
"- Sure, I understand, Mr. Gargan."
"I don't know how long it's gonna take me but meanwhile, I want you to get this straight."
I want everything run just exactly as I left it.
No changes.
"If there's any argument, whatever Miss Griffith decides, goes."
You understand?
- Is she around there now?
- No.
"I think she's in her cottage, Mr. Gargan, I could get her for you if--"
"No, no, that's all right."
Never mind.
Just tell her I called.
"Yeah, so long."
"And remember, no changes."
"All right, Mr. Gargan."
"Yeah, I understand."
Take this.
It will give you the edge you need.
I'll bring it back.
"Where are you, Robo Knight?"
Previously on AMC's Hell on Wheels...
"Governor, my men are going back to work."
I want your guarantee they'll be left alone.
"Sidney Snow, did you get him?"
It's a fire!
It was him.
It was Sidney Snow.
- Ezra hasn't come back.
- Under the floor.
[screams]
- You and me got unfinished business.
- Drop that gun.

What are you doing here?
"Daniel, help!"
Johnny was she sleeping with him?
"If I'd have seen something like that, I would tell you."
You think that maybe he was just an old friend?
That's all there was?
We didn't talk.
He didn't seem impressive.
I handed him an envelope.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He's gone and he knows not to come back.
"You know, that would be just like her."
"You see, you know, always looking to help someone."
"I'm dying, John."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"It's gonna be okay about this guy, so forget about it."
- I let Jimmy down.
"- No, you didn't."
He's gonna die now...
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
"- Listen to me, he knows you love him."
"And all he wanted was a little more time, where it didn't hurt so bad."
And he's gonna get it.

[HELICOPTER BLADES whirring ]
"He can do anything, Zone, South Beach, Atkins."
He's fantastic.
And he's cheap.
- How much?
"- Oh, I don't know."
[LAUGHING]
"Oh, shoot, I didn't bring enough double-stick tape."
Could you run down to the storage room and grab me some more?
Me?
"Yeah, I'd go myself, but I have nice shoes on."
"Oh, nice shoes."
"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
I get all my shoes at the car wash.
She works at a car wash?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
[GRO ANS]
"God, my shoes are nice."
I spent $40 on these shoes.
"- Oh, God, I hate those women."
- Which women?
All women.
"I mean, it's enough with them already, right?"
You wouldn't happen to be talking about those meanie moms?
"I'm sorry, I can't afford a personal chef."
I don't have time to take a three-hour yoga class.
I work.
Women are allowed to work.
It doesn't make them bad people or bad mothers.
Exactly.
I work.
"Oh, my God."
You want to see the way little boys kiss?
"Well, that's nice, Wilbur."
This comes a little later.
Now cut that out!
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, oh, nothing's wrong."
I was just trying to show you what I shouldn't do.
"Well, that's right."
That's what you shouldn't do.
(BELL RINGING) No.
"Well, I..."
I must go.
"I hope you won't forget our little talk, Willy."
"No, I won't forget, Aunt Nancy."
(DOOR CLOSING)
"Goodbye, Uncle Bob."
"Now, wait a minute."
I want to have a little talk with you.
"Oh, oh, I can't."
Natalie has me until 4:30.
Natalie can wait.
Why don't you straighten up?
"Oh, I am straightened up."
It's just that my shoulders are stupid.
"That's funny, I got stupid shoulders."
I have to go.
"Now, look."
It's possible I could have had you all wrong.
Had me all wrong?
"Maybe you are a nice, simple, warm-hearted kid after all."
"Yeah, and a loyal, trustworthy pal."
That's right.

Of course.
My public defender.
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- What?
Far out.
Can I try it?
Far out.
I need to tell you that I love you
I could win or lose you
But I need to tell you that I love you
Beautiful.
You have mine.
I have yours.
Miami I can get you for $7 50.
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?
There's a flight with stopover in Paraguay for $650.
$650...
It's still a little high.
"No, thanks."
You can't get a hotel in New York for less than $7 0 a day.
I'm staying with my boyfriend.
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?
"No, he doesn't know me yet."
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?
No.
Let me go.
Takao!
What are you doing hitting me?
!
Takao!
What?
!
Let me go.
"Mother, Father says he's going to America."
to America?
He tells me I should go to Hawaii.
He says that we should split up and think of each other.
We used to think of each other and help each other out.
He probably wants to hold on to his memories of that time.
"Mother, is it possible for a broken home to be mended?"
"Won't you come home, Mother?"
MizumiBalletCompany Swan Lake
Girl Someone named Takehara asked me to give this to you.
"""I'll be waiting for you at Tokyo station."""
Mother-
"Ah, so you came."
Yes.
I was at Father's place this morning and he said I should go.
seems much different when she's on stage.
She seems much more grown up.
"Yes, she does."
She's much better than before.
Father has a cold.
Since when?
He's already taken two days off of school.
Mother asked me to give this to you.
Please forgive her.
"Let's see your fingers, prune girl."
"Talk to the hand, 'cause the face ain't gonna listen."
"He asked me to come up with something new, something fresh."
You read it.
It was good.
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script we've had all year!
"Yes, it was."
So what was their problem?
"Hey, I want to hear."
"Oh, yeah?"
"I want to sing opera, but I can't, so I don't."
That downstairs is...
"Well, your dad has a high-pressure job."
What's a high-pressure job?
"It's when you don't get to do what you want and when you do, you don't have time to do it."
Do spies have high-pressure jobs?
Only when they're caught.
I'm never caught.
You're right.
You never are.
"Oh, look, a ugly water bug!"
Hey!
Caught ya.
Here she is.
Night.
Good night.
Good night.
You want me to tuck you in?
Golly can do it.
"""'The time has come,' the Walrus said."
"""To talk of many things."""
Doesn't matter.
See?
You keep to yourself some things too.
But it's not the same.
-Why not?
You're 13...
Daniel is 18...
I'm your father...
And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy!
"Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.."
And nothing else!
Had he kissed you?
I said nothing else.
Won't you have slept with him!
That's why you're worried.
The whole point was this.
It's not funny.
What if I'd answer yes.
Nothing.
What could I do?
Who knows..
The first thing would be telling mom.
Do you think I should tell her?
You should know.
So you've slept with him.
If you say so...
Want to make me angry?
That's what you said when I was little.
And what are you now?
If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this.
"It's true, but now..."
-Now everything changed right?
"I don't think you are, Dad."
"You know who's in there, right, besides the little girl?"
Her mother and her father--Charlie.
That means he knows.
And that's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years.
They have to go.
"Dr Penzler, too."
I can't risk a leak.
It's too important.
They don't matter anymore.
It's all about Allie.
"You're not in charge here, Mary."
I am.
Take a step back.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"Just, the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous."
- They could really gum us up.
"- No one's getting killed here, Mary."
Of course not.
CYNTHIA:
I got to go to the bathroom.
Grab a cup.
Knock yourself out.
"Lisa, hows he doing?"
He's still breathing.
Are you all right?
I just don't want any more bad news.
Mr Watson?
"Luke, when he died, he wasn't mad at you anymore."
DALE:
It broke.
I don't know what happened.
"Oh, it's ok."
I'll fix it.
Unless you forget where you put it.
"Don't you worry, I'll find a perfectly safe place for it."
We're out of juice.
Norman.
Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
"Jess, come on."
I'm serious.
"Look, I feel bad enough about what my Dad did already."
Everybody's always giving Roman a raw deal.
He's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just...
I know you don't see it but...
He scares me.
And I don't trust him.
"Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom."
"Come on, Jess."
He's not a bad person.
I plead his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
I can't do this for another 18 months.
We need to get him into a halfway house.
Alright.
"As soon as we find a place, he's out of here."
Hello.
Hey.
-It was New York.
-Johnny Sack?
What was it?
The fat joke?
I'm sure that didn't help.
Carmine.
"This HUD thing we're into, they wanted a piece of it."
I think they confronted Ralph...
-things went sour.
"-What'd he say, John?"
Wasn't what he said so much as what he didn't say.
We're talking about New York here.
Before we do anything in terms of a payback... you go to your people.
I want a full investigation.
Nobody makes a move until we know what happened.
You understand?
What the fuck?
-What's going on?
-Have a seat.
I'm Dominic.
"I know you don't know me, but...."
You're the guy who broke into Stew Leonard's that time.
You stole all those pork loins.
"Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today."
-We're here to talk about your drug problem.
-What?
"-Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?"
"-Sorry, baby, please."
"No, fuck this shit."
You were told once.
"Now, sit down."
Sit down.
Do you understand?
"May your knowledge rain upon Toni's bar, so the seeds of education and prosperity take root."
What do you want?
I saw mom in the supermarket.
- Attention!
Report to 08...
- Supermarket...
The last time I heard from her she was in Sweden.
That was the end of the seventies.
What would she be doing in a supermarket around here?
What do I know?
You imagined it.
Why would she suddenly just show up here?
Sweden is much too far away for a short visit.
But suppose I did see her.
You've got her mixed up.
I didn't get her mixed up.
Do you hear that?
"This singing, you hear that?"
Isn't that great?
It' s been going on for days.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
You'll get the file in the morning.
Alright?
Fine.
Shouldn't I come with you?
It's not necessary.
Too bad!
"A 1,000 Euro show."
"How come 1,000 Euros?"
What were you thinking?
Toni's 999 Euro show?
You still want to play charades?
Yeah.
I got to go.
(laughs) Really?
Mm-hmm.
Parker.
"You know, I can help you, Doc, with your ex."
(chuckles)
"No, you can't."
"Oh, yeah, I can."
I need to go home and check my judgment.
It's about Wickes again?
You were right about the tell.
He looked at that photo for a reason.
"Yeah, he did."
That's not enough.
"So, you were wrong about the guy."
No one here likes you any less.
"I want to stop running, Gibbs."
Really see the people around me and not just blurs as I fly by.
Really see them.
I just don't know if I can.
Not yet.
"I'm here, Doc."
I know.

Previously on Dance Academy...
Our problem is with your kind.
You're a second-year in a first-year leotard and we don't like the second-years.
"Even if there was a moment, we've probably missed it, so there's no point in..."
That's what I just said.
"Where did he get it, right here?"
So why are we here?
Johnny Cannata and Frank Doss own this hotel.
Why would they kill a comic?
I don't think they did.
FBI has had them under surveillance.
"Price was involved with Cannata and Doss, very tight."
Silent partner?
We don't know.
Let's go nose around.
How was fishing?
Rainy.
Hi.
Someday I'm gonna be wearing threads like that.
Mrs. Noogman.
"Yeah, definitely his better half."
Where's Miami's favorite mouth?
I don't care.
I got an agent.
I'm a singer now.
I ran into Annie downstairs.
Said she saw a cocktail waitress named Dorothy Bain... head up here with Morty Price about 4:00 this morning.
What's your connection with Miss Bain?
We're acquainted.
"She's a sweet kid, Sonny."
You'd like her.
She's got a cute little boy.
Yeah.
I'd like to meet her.
You know where we can find her?
My lips are sealed.
"Look, I've never met anyone like me before."
"Apart from the first time, and that was mostly fighting him off."
Badly.
Please.
No-one's ever taught me how to do this.
"Adam, here's the thing, right?"
I don't care.
"Yeah, like I want to hang out with some whiffy Goth anyway."
Excuse me?
Just cos you're a vampire doesn't mean you have to smell like the undead.
"One word, Mitch."
Deodorant.
Tch!
"- Oh, good."
You two have met.
- He's just leaving.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
She's been giving me the glad eye ever since I arrived.
- Loves a bit of fang.
- I do not!
That is a terrible thing to say.
I do not like a bit of fang.
"Not his fang, or anyone else's."
"Er... you know, I'm not ruling it out."
Just if the right fang came along.
But I haven't even thought about it.
At all.
For ages.
Oh.
"OK, ladies."
I'll catch you later.
Can we?
It's...
L.A. You can wear whatever you want.
"Ok, I'll just grab my purse."
I'll get your heels.
"Well, hello to you, too."
Thought you said you had...
a meeting to go to.
What?
"You said you had... a meeting, remember when I texted you... earlier?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I did, but uh, but I'm done now."
"Oh, great."
"Hallie, what's up?"
What's going on?
What's going on?
I think I should be asking you that question.
Excuse me?
"What is going on, Dale?"
"Uh, nothing."
"Look, I'm just-"
"I'm, did I miss something here?"
Wait.
Do you like him now?
Is that it?
"Look, I'm just gonna leave."
All right?
Of course you are.
"Zach, you're a piece of crap you know that?"
You're just another famous asshole guy who thinks he can screw around with any girl he wants and then not call them.
Well... fuck you!
"We're not... even dating, Hallie."
I've told you that 10... times.
"I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
"- Oh, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They stole it right offthe street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Yeah, well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
Yes.
"Where's my car, please?"
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
Let's go!
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.
"- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight."
"- OK, babe."
Take care.
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Give 'em the gas!
Hold your fire!
"L""m damn blissful."
"Pete is happy, Joan."
He loves you.
The two are completely separate issues.
My PI was right.
Marriage is a big sham.
- How old is she?
- Twenty-two.
"She""s the towel girl at the 24 Hour Fitness."
"For weeks, Pete was complaining:"
"""Why aren""t our towels as white as the towels at the gym?"""
"And then one day, not another word about towels."
"That""s when I knew."
- I guess I have to leave him.
- I would.
- No way.
- Brenda.
"You""ll just have to win him back."
"Women""s Club."
Same time every Tuesday.
When was the last time you and Pete had a date?
"We went to Tiffany""s soccer game on Friday night."
"A date, Joan."
"High heels, tight skirt, pretending to be the maid?"
"Joan is a grownup, not a Barbie doll."
She has real-life responsibilities.
- Pete needs to suck it up and be a man.
- Says a woman twice divorced.
"Look, Joan, is Pete being a prepubescent jerk?"
Yes.
"He""s a man in his 40s."
What do you expect?
X-rays are up.
"-C-spine clear, mediastinum looks okay."
-Very good.
-So where are you registered?
-What?
-Definitely have to.
-Could someone get SonoSite?
"My ex-wife didn't, we ended up with clocks."
"With my sister, salad bowls."
Seven of them.
Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient?
"Okay, then."
"Can we have that SonoSite, please?"
Neela.
Can you get away?
-We need to go get a license.
-We don't know where to get married.
-We do.
Hospital chapel.
-When did we decide that?
"-You were busy, I thought you--"
-And Jerry's gonna marry us?
"Yeah, he has some kind of minister's license, so l-- ls that really who we want?"
"What's Frank gonna be, the ring bearer?"
We don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.
-Are you gonna choose the flowers too?
"-No, no."
"But you like lilies, right?"
"-Michael, we have to talk."
-About what?
-l think this is getting a little-- Dr. Gallant.
"Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner."
Then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab..
where we trashed the place and freed 20 monkeys.
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!
"Last year, a monkey did attack me at the bus stop!"
"So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross.."
it just isn't gonna happen.
It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
-Hey.
-Hey.
"How's my favorite dog, huh?"
How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.
-Will you excuse us?
We need to talk.
-Sure.
"Oh, me, right."
-He's miserable.
What happened to him?
-Nothing.
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
"Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!"
This is the happiest dog in the world.
"He spends a day with you, and look!"
He's breathing.
"Okay, well, he's watching us so just look happy, okay?"
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
And so are we.
You are so explaining this to me.
"Hey, baby."
"If this bar were a meat market, you'd be the prime rib."
"Oh, god."
"You reek of cannabis, Bender."
Cannabis?
"Hey Maxine, you've got something on your chest - my eyes!"
Go away.
It's never going to happen.
"Hey, are you like a parking ticket or something?"
"Cuz you've got ""fine"" written all over you."
I have a headache.
You can stand here but don't talk to me.
"Look, you look a lot like my next girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?"
"Oh, my god."
How long does this go on before you actually quit?
I never quit.
That's one thing that you're gonna learn about me.
I never quit.
Never.
Fuck it.
[BENDER] Fuck what?
Fuck it - let's do it.
What?
Where we going?
We're gonna go to your place.
We're gonna go- we're gonna go to my place?
Mm-hmm.
Sweet.
- Now.
"- Oh, now."
You say that like there's only one problem.
God knows what Lance is going to come up with while you try to produce a mother out of thin air.
Pay the bill.
[line ringing]
"Hey, uh, I hope you're having a great Sunday because we got a big fucking problem."
Marjorie:
Okay.
How soon can you make it to Bridgeport?
Why?
Because I need you to be the rope.
Okay.
Who am I playing?
Pete's mom Maggie.
"Uh, isn't she, like, north of 50?"
"I just played your mistress a few years ago, Marius."
"What, now I'm your mother?"
"What is this, Hollywood?"
"Well, we're screwed if you don't."
Ohh.
Do you have any idea of her height?
No.
Oh.
Good.
I'll sit.
"Uh, need to be dark, and I'll need something that makes them not want to look too closely."
Okay.
"I need to know a few things about her, please."
I don't know much beyond her name.
"Well, figure it out."
- [phone rings]
- Shit.
Yeah.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hi.
So are we doing something tonight or not?
I can't.
My girlfriends are sleeping over.
I'm having a sleepover.
This is like the first normal thing I've done since I got pregnant.
"All right, well..."
Just let me know where I fit in here.
"Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody and Francine and I'll let you know."
(SCOFFS)
I'm just joking.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, not funny."
And...
You know what?
This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"No, I have to go."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"And I don't like your friends, either."
They're not nice.
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.
We'll see.
"Yeah, we will."
Boyfriend problems?
He thinks my friends aren't nice.
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.
But it's high school and you have to have friends and these are the only friends I can get right now.
- What's going on?
- I just got fired.
"Oh, my gosh, are you serious?"
"Oh, don't act so shocked, Carrie."
"All the times I've watched ""All About Eve,"""
"and I didn't even realize you were ""All About Eve-ing"" me."
What are you talking about?
Me?
I didn't want to get you fired.
"I mean, I've been working my butt off to save your job."
Yeah?
"Well, nice work..."
Taking my assignment and all.
"Bennet, you vanished."
I couldn't reach you.
"And apparently, you were out partying."
So what was I supposed to do?
Not stab me in the back.
Thanks for being such a good friend.
I didn't mean to get him fired.
Oh.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dorrit...
Bradshaw.
I'm just waiting to meet my dad.
"Oh, I didn't realize Tom had kids."
"Yep, me and my sister."
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I just need some money.
Got it.
"Don't tell him, but he's super easy to manipulate."
That's not really an answer.
I totally thought I was being abducted.
"I was so happy to wake up in my bunker and not some alien mother ship, but also, same time, a little bummed it didn't happen."
"I, uh..."
I need a minute with Oleg.
That's fine with me.
How's everybody doing?
Good?
(gun fires)
"(man screams) No, uh, everything's fine."
At ease.
"Uh, he's got it under control."
"I'm pretty sure, okay?"
(man shouting in Russian) Thanks.
See?
You get it?
Yeah.
Great.

It was strange.
It was like we were back in 'nam.
It didn't matter if it was right or wrong.
I just did it.
"And don't worry about Maria and the kids, 'cause I figured out a way to get some money for them."
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.

"I look forward to work with you, too."
"No, I talked with them yesterday."
Thank you.
"OK, goodbye."
Au revoir.
- I met this handsome guy at the gym.
- So Albert is history now?
No.
"But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away."
"That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all."
"Thank you, God!"
This guy will make your mouth water!
Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away.
He can pick up the keys on Saturday.
I love you!
If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering -

- I know a trick.
- What's keeping him?
- What if he can't find it?
- Relax.
He's smart and he's gorgeous.
I swear.
If I knew anything.
I can handle it from here.
Okay.
"So, if he loves Sara so much why did he lie to us about seeing his mother?"
"He didn't lie to us, he lied to his father."
Huh.
"Your parents are still married, aren't they?"
"Okay, so Jessica's angry enough to manipulate her son."
You think she's angry enough to go further?
Angry ex-wives don't leave their last vic on ice and a prayer card at the scene.

Hello?
Are you alone?
Yeah.
What's going on?
I said I didn't want the FBI protection.
Did Dad have me followed anyway?
"I don't know, Marce."
Probably.
Are you with Ben?
No.
I slept in my car.
What are you talking about?
I'm scared.
"Look, whatever's going on, just come home."
I can't.
Not yet.
The FBI wants to talk to you.
They know you and Sara were fighting.
How do they know that?
I told them.
Right now!
"What, what have you done to me?"
"I'm gonna tell, I'll talk about that."
Just... give me your hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Alex.
What are you doing here?
Getting you out.
Please?
Here is a... cashier's check for 4 million dollars.
It's what you need to get that property from Taylor.
- And you want in on the deal?
- No.
I only want Chase.
"Alex, you do know that relationships between Pure Bloods and non Pure Bloods is frowned upon."
To speak nothing of a... financial arrangement between Erebus ans the House of Chthon...
Trust me.
"No one knows I'm here, this is strictly between you and me."
"So... take the money, buy whatever you want, but let Chase go."
You're buying me.
I'm rescuing you.
There's a difference.
"Yes, there is."
You're right.

I suppose I'd better save some for my mother.

"Now, I am disappointed in you for even thinking it."
"L""m hurting."
"Oh, my God."
"Daddy, you""re lying."
Lying right to my face!
"Oh, my God!"
- Keep your voice down.
"- How could you cheat, Daddy?"
How could you cheat on Clara?
Get out of my house.
"Clara, honey, patients are waiting."
"You know, Lisa hasn""t shown up in four days."
I guess whatever she has is contagious.
"- How""s David?"
- Fine.
- Are you okay?

"Driving to work this morning, it was rattle, rattle, rattle."
"L""m sorry."
"It""s all my fault."
"Of course it is, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, do you love her?"
- Do you love me?
- I want to come home.
- Did Iris come in at a bad time?
Maybe.
"Okay, then next time!"
"Next time you cry, be sure to show me!"
Didn't you have a report from Ryner and Ferris to give me?
"Oh, yeah."
Here you go!
"The dog is Ryner, and the angel is Ferris, I take it?"
Yup!
"The wild beast and the dazzling beautiful avenging angel, Sister Ferris!"
"Same as always, hm?"
What's this?
"Um, they dug a hole and pulled out a dagger-looking thing."
"They had no idea what it was and threw it, and a dragon suddenly came to life, they said!"
A hero relic?
They really existed?
- Your Majesty.
"- What is it, Miller?"
Have a look.
You're certain of this?
The information comes from him.
"You know who I mean, I'm sure."

"Okay, Ryner."

"No, I don't know where she went."
"Okay, you can turn 'em on."
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this up in the rain in the first place.
"Finish up, already."
-You check the connections?
"-Yes, I checked the connections."
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
"Well, go check the hookup."
"Your boss say, ""Sign work both day and night."" I wanna lights on."
"-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?"
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
"Well, hurry up."
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
"Where the hell is it, anyhow?"
"Go around there, he said it's around to the left."
"Yeah, I think I've found it."
He would have found us anyway.
"It's a morning thing, right?"
When you wake up?
You work too much.
Sure.
Excuse me.
"Oui, mon ange."
"Yes, sweetheart, I know."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Daddy will call you back, but now I'm... wait, hang on."
Would you excuse me a second?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
"Honey, I can't talk to you now."
"Rachel, check out that guy for me... now."
Of course you're coming for vacation.
Sure you are.
"No, honey, I can't come get you."
"We'll do just like last time, I..."
We'll see.
"Okay, I'll call you back."
Love you.
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.
I've got a screwball in my office.

He's head of a department at St. Louis.
Ross didn't tell you anything else?
"No, nothing."
"They say the swan sings only once, just before dying."
"Yes, I know."
"He senses he's going to die, so he sings."
It's not because of the pain.
"No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop."
And now they're gonna be in a show together?

"Jesus, it's all over for me."
They'll probably even have a kissing scene!
What did I do to deserve this?
And what am I supposed to do now?

She gave us exactly 15 minutes.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"Come in, you can leave the gate open."
Are you the one I spoke to?
- Are you Jonah's son?
"- No, I'm her daughter Dorona's husband."

"- And these are her sons, Natanel..."

How is she?
She died three weeks ago.
I'm so sorry.
I thought her children wanted to bring her and Maurice together but I guess that only happens in movies.
Come.
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
And now I'm here.
- So you want money from me?
- Money?
"Earn it, yes."
Together with you guys I wanna earn money.
Work together.
I thought it would work out in a more respectable way but I've been a fool.
"Now, I'm here."
What am I supposed to do?

"No, I'd rather be a thief."

- So that's your new attitude?
- No no no no!
I did the best I could!
Now I'm here and I will stay!
Now you can think about it.
- What are you doing here?
"- Franz, come home please!"
What happened to you?
- What happened to you?
- None of your business!
It's gonna be allright.
Do you really think so?
I've been starving and freezing and it all turned out just fine.
You are Mieze.
I used to be Franz's girlfriend.
I'm Cilly.
I really know nothing about Franz.
You look very pretty.
- Really?
- Sure did.
"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
"Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi."
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
"No, I told him to send you my regards."
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
"- Yeah, regards."
"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug."
"Oh, I hate smugness."
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
"Oh, my God, that man over there."
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex- boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Sir, sir?"
- Yeah.
"If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
"Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
"Now, if somebody comes around your little sister and starts talking like that, you just gonna stand there and smile?"
No.
"You're gonna ask him to stop, which I did."
"And if they don't stop, what?"
You're not gonna do anything?
So are you saying you should not have apologized?
Not the way he's talking.
So that's a yes?
He didn't deserve an apology.
He deserved worse than what I gave him.
I should've messed him up worse.
"And with that latest salvo from Smash Williams, it appears the Dillon Panthers problems are far from over."
"Turn it off, will you, Crowley?"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Hubby's home.
"How was your day, darling?"
It was...
It was good.
It was good.
"I sold a car, so..."
What?
You did?
Out-freaking-standing!
"Oh, man!"
You did!
Whoa.
"So, what?"
"You're like, you're like a car salesman now."
You're like Willy Loman!
"Yeah, you a salesman, huh?"
Yeah.
I guess I am.
There are no other customers.
Why do they keep adding up bills and cooking noodles?
Why would a small shop like this hire so many workers?
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
"Even if you're in GuangZhou, we still have to arrest you."
"Bounty hunters from both sides of the rivers, ZheJiang, SanXi, GanSu and Hubei, all join forces to capture us."
You want us to turn ourselves in without a fight?
Come and get me.
Watch out!
Think you can get us?
Fat chance!
Husband!
Husband... run.
Boss Wong!
Boss Wong!
- What?
- I'm here to collect the laundry money.
Come and get it.
I just sent him away.
He's such a coward.
Lucky I've not been bitten by that dog with rabies!
Big Mouth.
- Big Mouth.
"- Yes, Boss?"
What can I do for you?
Get Ah Seng to dress me.
Big Mouth.
Still memorizing your script?
Where were you last night?
What's with the make-up?
Hurry up!
Don't take advantage of my good nature!
"Me, when I go to the movies, it's just for the music."
And I'm in love with the prettiest babe in the world.
"Me, I've never been in love."
I've only been sick.
What's the difference?
Me...
I was locked up in a mental hospital.
"I was yelling in the streets, because my father, see, was put in jail."
- Did they bang him up?
- Five years times two!
- As for my father:
One times even equals seven!
- My name's Léo!
"You're kidding, that's my name too!"
But my father was top dog... a King!
- Mine was only a Prince!
- Mine was old school:
"Poet, Jew, writer!"
Me not...
"Hi, my name is Mickey!"
Delighted.
My brothers:
"François, how French can you get,"
"- Antoine, even worse..."
- Don't push it too far.
Ferdinand the Baron.
"This guy's just an idiot, can't you see?"
Wanna see her face?
What do you make of her?
She craves warmth.
You'll do it.
"I was there, gawking like the rest."
I'm not wearing pants.
Told you!
Nina told me why she dumped me.
She said I was too needy.
Am I too needy?
Tell me!
I need to know!
"Fez, I'm sorry, man."
You're the definition of needy.
"Remember, one time, you called me at 3:00 in the morning... just to make sure we were still friends?"
"Look, if you wanna get Nina back, you gotta act like you don't care."
- But I don't know how to do that.
"- Well, we can help you."
Oh!
We'll rebuild you like the Six Million Dollar Man!
Fez One to Control.
We have liftoff.
All systems are go.
Proceed to eat candy.
- [Klaxon Blaring]
- Uh-oh.
Emergency!
Emergency!
We are breaking up.
"I repeat, Nina and I are breaking up."
"[Kelso's Voice] Fez, a teenager, a boy with needs."
"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him."
We have the technology.
[Hyde's Voice] We can make him more appealing to Nina by making him less needy.
[Grunting]
"We can make him cooler, suaver, aloofer."
"""Aloofer""?"
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle but a dangerous joke.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all dangerous jokes."
Do me a favor and don't write them off just yet.
I said they were dangerous.
Wonder what Vinnie's doing in a place like this?
Wonder what we're doing in a place like this.
- This is it.
- Where's our boy?
- I don't know.
- Think Vinnie had a change of heart?
"If he's a Zapatti, he has no heart."
- Let's go.
- Don't turn around.
"Marybeth, right?"
Who's this?
He's the deputy mayor.
Deputy mayor?
"What do I need you for, then?"
Don't get smart.
I'm the only chance you got.
All right.
Let's go.
This a Searider?
"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.
The flat's yours.
You are the one who pays the rent.
Anyway I'm going to Manchester tomorrow.
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
This is a success then?
It's success.
I'm glad.
You know the first time I painted you outside the steelworks?
Maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away.
Oh!
I don't know Ellis.
Maybe you shouldn't have made me so bloody small.
One ticket madam.
Safe journey.
Next please.
War widows.
War widows.
There you are.
War widows.
War widows.
War widows.

(DOOR SLAMS)
Wow.
"Damn, Finn."
This must be your best one yet.
How long you been workin' on this?
"Like two, three weeks?"
Fuck off.
I don't go to the bar and complain when it takes you 10 minutes to make a martini.
(PHONE RINGS)
I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.
I just hit a little creative block.
That's all.
(BEEPS) Hello?
"Oh, hi, Mrs. Anderson."
"Why, yes."
The building manager's right here.
"Oh, I'm sure he'd be delighted to come over and fix your toilet."
He's givin' me the thumbs up right now.
He'll be over in a second.
"(BEEPS) You were saying something, right?"
About you being perfectly happy with where you're at in life?
Hello.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Well, he said he was thinking of going to art school."
"And I said, ""Oh, what a coincidence!"
"Our building manager used to be a painter."""
(CHUCKLES)
"When you're 18, everybody wants to be an artist."
- Shh!
- FINN:
Where did you get that?
Garage sale.
"Look, I said I was out."
"I know, I know."
I respect your decision.
This is for Morgan.
He was your patient.
He talk about medieval torture?
In disturbing detail.
Big weirdo.
"Well, see ya."
"Annie, wait."
You just said you respected my decision.
It's not about that.
I have a favor to ask you.
A favor for you is like the kiss of death.
"I need you to go to this address and babysit on this guy for the day, make sure he stays sober."
- Not interested.
- I'll pay you.
"Look, I know I'm an asshole."
And I've been reckless... but everything I've done was to try to protect us.
"And I can fix this, but I need your help."
Who is he?
He's a friend.
$50 an hour.
"You really will be a millionaire one day, Annie."
I know.
"Hey,"
I bet this is one of them self-melting driveways.
Yeah.
I bet you should've been a football player.
Yeah.
Mrs. Dixon?
What's going on?
Let's just clear some of this.
I'm on pine cone duty.
"To be fair, when we make tents I'm normally the one who just pretends to be busy the whole time."
"Oh, it's good..."
-...that the instructions are in Swedish.
"-Don't need instructions, Liam."
-Here we go.
This is the one we need.
"-Yeah, this is the floor."
What?
You put it through the things or this?
-What you do with this?
"-And this bit goes on there, I think."
Stick the-
- clip the little siIver--
I think we've done the wrong one.
"Looking good, lads."
Because then the other bit goes over the top of it.
"-No, you have to--"
-This is not going very well.
That little hole.
"Oh, there we go."
I've smashed it.
Liam's nearly clocked it in about five minutes.
Has anybody got a hammer?
Where are you making the fire?
Here.
"Oh, thanks, lads."
Yeah.
Cheers.
You're not doing a tepee fire?
"Listen, forget what they taught you in Scouts."
What do we think?
Uncool!
It's not uncool!
Who said uncool?
Me!
Why is it uncool?
It's a Peugeot!
What's that got to do with it?
It's ugly!
That's nothing to do with coolness!
Anyone think it is cool?
"Right, I do."
I'm gonna explain why.
It's a hot hatchback - hot hatchbacks are cool.
"They're small, they're easy to run."
"I had one the other week, came down here, drove it in second gear all the way, made me feel 18!"
"All of which is good, and they're good cars."
I just...
"Everybody else thinks it's uncool, you think it's cool."
Casting vote here.
"I reckon, apply your own test."
The Kristen Scott Thomas test.
Picture her outside her apartment in that.
She'll get in.
No.
She'll get in the diesel one of the bloke behind.
I think it's uncool.
"Oh, my God!"
What's up with you?
Chinese burn.
Why don't you give him a dead leg?
I will.
- Where will you go?
- Into the wolf's den.
To be near the woman he loves.
The Dulce base.
-Are you sure you're not human?
How will you get there?
I will take you.
Jaelen?
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
Robert.
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE] Jaelen.
[SPEAKS NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE] Alyssa.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN TONGUE]
"-Despite the circumstances, I'm happy to have known you, Robert."
-The feeling's mutual.
"-I hope that we've made a difference, you and I."
-We have.
"Jaelen,"
"I'd like to wish you good luck, but..."
-Luck won't help me.
"A miracle, perhaps."
-Where will you go?
-Chicago.
I've got a niece there that I'm quite fond of and a brother who hasn't spoken to me in twenty years.
He doesn't believe in all this UFO crap.
"-I see an exoneration in your near future, my friend."
-Human eyesight has been deceived for thousands of years.
-How so?
"- Huh, that's sweet."
"It's pathetic, but sweet."
"- Yeah, that's my niche... pathetic and sweet."
Hmm.
What?
No.
Mom!
"I don't know, maybe."
"Okay, I love you, too."
And say hi to Daddy.
What?
How old are you?
- Seventeen.
- What?
!
Really?
You don't go to school?
I used to.
I got kicked out.
"Of Corona, Matre Day, and even Newport Union."
"After that, my parents had enough, said, ""Go away, get a job, move out,"" which I did."
"I got my own studio on the numbered streets, and I work here, and I've never been happier."
- Yeah?
This is you happy?
"- Look, you barely earned these, but..."
"Hey, right on."
Thanks.
Ah!
"All right, Summer's going to be very stoked."
On-on the band.
"I hear they're really good live,and I think the best thing for our friendship, is like, a good, live, band."
"As a girl, I feel I should probably warn you, that this whole little game you're planning, she's gonna see right through it."
Shouldn't you be a delivery man by now?
Harriet!
"Well, Harriet, I'll tell you."
"Not long ago, I had another life."
"I had a big business, I had a lot of money, and you know what?"
I was the most miserable man alive.
"So, one day, I told my wife that..."
- Wife?
"- I told my wife that I wanted to start all over again and if she wanted to, she could start all over with me."
So what happened?
"Oh, she left me, but that's all right, that was her choice."
"My choice was to become a delivery boy... well, man."
"I don't have the business, of course."
I don't have the money.
You know what?
My life is sweet again.
Hmm.
The wurst!
"Oh, no!"
My wurst!
"No, no!"
Oh...
"Oh, Lord."
"Oh, no."
No.
"Don't be sad, Katherine."
This is a blessing in disguise.
That's a pretty good disguise.
Don't you see?
The three of us have to go out for dinner.
- No.
- Yeah!
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
Bright lady.
and experiences.
"My name is Fran, I'm 44 years old."
But I have 30 years experience behind me.
Right.
The chefs enjoy the limelight now.
"Hello, I'm Scott."
"I'm from Manhattan, New York."
I'm here to win Hell's Kitchen.
"But in Hell's Kitchen, you have to prove yourself."
Bold statement.
Good.
And this time is no exception.
Okay.
Because Chef Ramsay has an important announcement.
I want to officially guarantee that we will complete the opening night dinner service at Hell's Kitchen.
"Oh, man."
Has he lost his damn mind?
Why would he promise that?
"I'm, like, thinking to myself, like,"
I don't know how we're going to do that.
It's never been done before.
Is that clear?
"Yes, Chef."
I can't hear you;
is that clear?
"Yes, Chef!"
"And with that, Hell's Kitchen begins."
Get in there and cook me a signature dish.
Off you go!
Let's not let Gordon down.
That's Leslie Davison.
You guys go around back.
Make sure everything's all right there.
Looking for Officer Crowe.
They can't hear you.
You're dead.
You wanted to be Leslie.
"Well, you weren't good enough."
Somebody shoot that fucking car alarm.
"Say goodbye to the light, Emma."
I'm taking back the eyes you stole.
"Goddamn it, no!"
Over here!
Hold your fire!
You all right?
You all right?
"Sir, it's Crowe!"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Ms. Brody, come with me."
Come on.
"Johnson, take the back."
Watch your head.
"Look, I know all of this has been hard on you... and again, I just want to thank you for everything."
I think we got enough now.
Sure you don't need to go to the hospital?
"No, think I've had enough of hospitals... for a while anyway."
Let me get somebody to take you home.
"I'll drop her off, lieutenant."
Why don't you take this.
Thank you.
It's the gray one.
I think I've got a ride home.
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
Mm.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
Father?
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
-Come in.
-Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
-He's here already.
-Father?
-Father Karras.
"-It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and, um your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case first?
Why?
This is yours to do with as you please.
"You can choose to escape, if you want, but you may never be able to return."
Don't let anyone decide for you.
"Hail Mary, full of grace...."
Lou was 61 when I was born.
"All three families lived within several miles of each other, but we never crossed paths until Lou's funeral."
[bell tolling] [siren blaring]
Do you remember this guy?
(man #1) Hell of a man.
"Sure,I remember him."
Did he ever ride in your cab?
"[chuckles] 20, 40 times."
Who knows?
"He was a cab rider, strictly cab rider."
"Yeah, he didn't drive?"
Never.
He used to sit in front.
He sat in front?
"Oh, yeah."
Really?
Yeah.
"That was your dad, world-famous architect."
"Yeah, that was your father."
Do you remember him at all?
"(man #2) A little bit, vaguely."
Did he ever ride in your cab?
Vaguely.
He loved the women.
"Not the young ones, but he loved the women."
-- Do you remember what he looked like or
(man #1) His face was pointed.
"Yeah, and his hair was-- his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond."
Like a what?
(man #1) Like it was blond.
h.
"Oh, blond, uh-hu"
OK.
Nice.
That feels good.
Are you gonna fuck me now?
Yup.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Can I stay up late watching movies?
-Yep.
You're not gonna make me go to bed?
Do whatever the fuck you want.
What's wrong?
"It's... you know my friend you met here tonight, Bender?"
Yeah.
"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but she was here before you got here and she kissed me."
She kissed you?
"Yeah, she was tying my tie and she pulled me in and kissed me."
Did you kiss her back?
No. [LAUGHING] Of course not.
"But it was- you know, it was peculiar."
"Well, girls do funny things sometimes."
Yeah.
"There was this once, a long time ago, actually when we first met, she and I made out."
Nothing really came of it... [SIGH]
She and I - we don't make sense as a couple.
Do we make sense as a couple?
-Yes.
-Yeah?
Water!
"Please, let me get water."
I'm so not done with you yet.
"What, what?"
Claire's...
Claire's dead.
"Now, will you take that soup and get out of here."
I can't take anymore today.
"Look, all I meant was you..."
Will you just get out of here!
Sir...
And stay out!
"Sir, he didn't mean any harm, if you'll forgive me for saying so, sir."
"I sometimes have a silly effect on people, you know what I mean?"
"Just being a police lieutenant, you know."
"At least, I hope that's why."
"Yes, I'm sure it is."
"Your friend, sir."
He was just trying to be nice.
(SIGHS)
What?
Oh.
Him.
"No, no."
He wasrt trying to be nice.
He was trying to fix me up with an alibi.
Then it wasrt true?
"What, Lieutenant?"
I...
Excuse me.
I keep swimming in and out of myself.
"Well, you know, that's what happens, sir."
It's kind of like being in shock.
"Maybe you ought to sit down for a minute, sir."
I am not in shock.
I don't need to sit down.
-El Paso.
-Where are you from?
-Philadelphia.
See we got the whole country representative.
-Right.
-It's the melting pot.
And this chicken is Miss America of the eighties.
"No Jimmy, you are."
No.
I think Margaret is Miss America.
I think it's Jimmy.
You just say that because you're gay.
Oh he's not gay all the time.
I seriously think Jimmy is the new Miss America.
He has all the mannerisms of a sex symbol.
That's what we should call this make it a series.
The two miss Americas.
Great idea.
And we could end it with the two of them fucking.
He can't fuck.
I can too fuck.
I just can't fuck you.
You two are just too chicken to be photographed fucking.
Chicken woman.
He's the chicken not I.
"That sounds like a challenge to me, Jimmy."
You're just a chicken.
You're just a chicken.
Please don't start on me now.
You look tired.
You look old and ugly and washed up.
Stop it!
"Theywere, you know, conservative bible folk, butthey had a powerful sense of rightand wrong."

Looking foranswers.

"In fact, we agree on a lot ofthings, don'twe?"
"[Girl] No, we don't."
"You say you wantto end the war, so why don'tyou?"
Change always comes slowly.
[Sighs] I pulled out more than halfthe troops.
I'm trying to cutthe military budget forthe firsttime in 30 years.
I wanta volunteer army.
But it's also a question of American credibility.
- Our... our position in the world.
"- Come on, Mr. Nixon."
It's a civil war between Vietnamese.
You don'twantthe war.
We don'twantthe war.
The Vietnamese don'twantthe war.
- So why does it go on?
- [Faint Voice On Radio]
"- You should be going, Mr. President."
- Okay.
Please.
"You can'tstop it, can you?"
Even ifyou wanted to.
- Yup.
I love this.
"- Ari, you look sexual."
- You were right there the whole time.
- We were so close.
- You really do.
- We were so close.
- You really do.
You look drunk but great.
"Pete, you can really tell how much you love New York with these shots."
And it's sexy.
Sexy at the same time.
- NY.
- Sexy NY.
I do love New York.
"I think it's part of what makes the film, you know, special."
- Absolutely.
- Or specialer.
"But look at these shots, you can tell you're a New Yorker and you love it."
Does anyone remember this reference?
- No.
- It's the fifth lady.
- What?
- What is that?
Wanna know what that's a reference to?
"Sex and the City, when it was over all the girls, they were always talking backstage about the show."
"And they were like, ""New York, it's the fifth lady."""
Didn't Kim Cattrall play New York?
But it is.
It's like in this.
"New York is, like, the biggest character."
That's true.
My mouth.
"My hands on the piano, on his face..."
It's all his.
Whether I am alive or not.
"Aro, I love you so much. """
He looked strangely happy.
He didn't go to the funeral.
But he thought only of her.
He locked himself away in selma's room.
He sang and played the piano.
His voice became very beautiful.
When did she realize Aro had left?
I didn't see him for days.
I started looking for him.
in the house...
In his room...
I couldn't find him.
I asked around the village.
I checked with those who knew him.
But nobody had seen him.
He disappeared with the Revolution.
"In 1956, the Russians invaded the country..."
I never saw him again.
I remember...
Once he was very sick.
He took my hand.
He looked at me as if he was begging for something...
"He called me ""SeIma""."
I didn't understand.
"But now, that I know more about his life..."
I realize that he never saw who I really was.
Something like that...
"No, we're not!"
This is totally legit.
"For all this guy knows, we could be mega-minted poshos in disguise."
It would be a superb disguise.
Cheers.
"Take us to the bed section, my good man."
I want to try one of them.
Mm-hm.
Security!
Agh.
This chair is like a torture device.
I've asked Flavia for one with back support so many times.
At least you get a chair.
I have to stand still all day.
Think you could stand a bit stiller?
Hard to score if you're jiggling.
I don't want you to score!
Come on!
Getting balls in your jug is the only fun part of my day.
Stop it!
Calm down.
I don't want them in my jug.
"Open your mouth, then."
Give him something to aim at.
I don't want your balls in my mouth!
"It might shut you up for once, water boy."
Sorry.
He's been trying to get balls in my jug all day.
I don't care.
Paper balls.
Stop talking.
Water man.
"Hogarth, we've been through this before."
No pets.
"But he's not a pet, Mom."
He's a friend.
We've got to rent a room if we're gonna make ends meet...
... andnoonewants shredded upholstery.
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.
until you feel sorry for him and set him free in the house!
"Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?"
I remember the raccoon.
"please, Mom, at Ieast look at him."
AII right.
Where is this guy?
I can't read this handwriting.
"That one should have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo."
"I will go get him, okay?"
So he wants us to hold the mayo and the mustard.
How about just hold the flavor altogether?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir?
Excuse me--!
-What's that?
-please don't move.
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!
"If you make a scene, my mom won't let me keep him."
"-What kind of pet, kid?"
-A squirrel.
He's friendly.
"I'm telling the truth, dang it!"
- It's the'80s.
The'70s.
"By the way, I'm sorry"
I came down on you a little hard at Leena's.
It's whatever.
"It's just 'cause I owe you, for helping me and saving Joshua."
"I mean, the guy hurt you."
It pisses me off.
If finding MacPherson...
Yeah.
"Just help me lift this thing, would you, on three."
"Well, can Mrs. Frederic find him?"
I don't know.
On three.
"One, two, three."
"The guy used to work here though, right?"
"And, what, the place drove him nuts?"
Something lured him to the dark side?
"He is the dark side and things are lured to him, people especially, which is why you're never gonna mention his name ever again."
- Just to you.
"- To anyone, promise me."
Is that Myka?
Whatever it is...
It's not good.
Red five.
- You're pushing our luck.
- And it's pushing right back.
- Take a break.
- I'm okay.
We've got enough.
Nobody's legs are getting broken.
Everybody's paid off.
Come show me.
Why are you wearing these glasses?
What if he recognize me?
"Bhai, really you have..."
what?
Glasses.
"Mr. Daver, Laxmi Narayan speaking, i need 900000/- fix 900000/- or the work will not done."
And you know my nature right?
"Understand, 900000/-"
900000/- killing money.
Isn't that too much Papa?
Your other Laxmi Narayan is there.
Now i can leave Sir?
"Where you would go, the climax is still behind, see Bhai that's Yadev."
Where is he going?
Where is he going?
Lets see.
What a Dearing best shooter.
I have never seen before.
I will kill him like the death will say wow what a kill.
Before the Laxmi Narayan kill me.
How...
Bhai should i shoot him right here.
You will not kill him.
We have serpent ways right?
Bhai listen Bhai.
"Leave my hand, i am cheep Bhai right?"
No... no... i think like the egg of lizard.
My thinking is like lizard egg.
"Not only thinking, i am egg of lizard."
You have big heart.
Give me one more chance.
So why didn't they--
Why didn't they use Dave?
Because Dave was late to get in makeup.
"But by the time we did the scene, he was ready."
They just said no.
"I don't know, really."
Hi.
"I got you, man."
I got you.
We had people standing by.
We had no idea what we could do without Toxie.
And nobody could call.
But let's just-- can we get past this?
All we did was this long shot with a fucking
Shitload of smoke.
"Yeah, can we do it again with me?"
All right.
Let's see what I can do.
DAVE:
Tell me what you want me to do.
All right.
Trent give me some blocking here.
TRENT HAAGA:
Do you want to pick this one up from that point?
Just have him get up--
Can we just fill him up with smoke
And have him bring the kids on again?
Why?
I don't want to do it again.
-All right.
-Absolutely not.
"In fact, if it happens again, there's gonna"
"Jenny, can't talk now."
I'm in trouble with your dad and it is a lot worse than all of the other times.
I'm going to have to be off the grid for a little while.
"Nick, Nick, I've got some big news!"
"He's not done something stupid, has he?"
"Oh, god!"
I'll never be able to forgive myself.
"Nick, Nick, I'm having a baby!"
Nick?
"Jenny, that's brilliant!"
I'm so pleased for you!
"It is mine, yeah?"
"Yeah, of course."
Icing on the cake.
That is fantastic.
I'm going to come straight home.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
Where are you?
"Where are we, lad?"
Half an hour now.
We'll be getting into *** in about two hours.

- Guilty.
- And Vikram Kapoor?
I made him confess to the police.
That's all?
"Yeah, that's all."
"In fact, I wasn't even with him when he killed himself."
"Well, then how do you know he is no more?"
Only the police know about this.

"Good evening, Mr. Ravenscar."

I had no choice.

"You've been bought, haven't you?"
For God's sake!
"Look, it's not what you think, Sia."
This horrible creature you have in front of you is...
"Major Arjun Singhania, International Vigilance Squad."
Deep undercover in the Turkish drug cartel.
Major Arjun Singhania?
"And he outranks you, so please be nice."
"And now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my work."
You're a police officer?
Even I hate surprises.
Okay.
"So, what do I call you?"
"Oh, yeah."
No.
My boyfriend.
He hurt you?
"Uh, you want me to call the cops?"
No.
No.
That'll only make things worse.
"I just want to go to his place, pick up my stuff."

"Hey, what the fuck, man?"
Why'd you park me in?
"Forget about the drive-bys, how are you supposed to meet anybody ?"
"Um, well, I did actually meet somebody, I think."
"I met this guy, and he's really cool."
-They got white guys at your school?
"-Um... no, actually they don't."
Shut up !

I want my money.

Good reason.

- With Malakai ?

I don't get you two.
Sorry.
I don't know the lady.
"Oh, well, it doesn't matter."
I'm trying to locate a Mr. Pierce.
I don't suppose you know him.
"Not intimately, but I do know of him."

Bet there's nobody sober enough to even notice.
Keep the change.
Much obliged.
Good night.
"Uh, all right, Robert."
"Hey, stop this!"
"Granddad, stop!"
Listen to me!
We don't have to make the same mistakes!
We can learn!
"We're not niggas, granddad!"
"If I let you live, you are going to leave me alone, and if I see you again, I'm gonna..."
I'm gonna call the police and file for a restraining order!
But what about the fight tour?
!
"Yeah, you know, this didn't really go as expected."
"When you were the one getting beaten, Robert, it was fun!"
Deal's off!
Will you please go fuck with somebody else?
!
"Sure, Robert."
All you had to was ask.
I don't even know you.
I'm just the clone.
That's it.
I think it's finally over.
Let's go home.
"Hey, hey!"
One of you niggas call me an ambulance!
"Hey, Robert!"
"What y'all eating, Robert?"

"How come you never invite ya boy Stinkmeaner over for dinner, Robert?"

"That's fucked up, you selfish-ass, hungry-ass nigga!"
"Yo, so, you mean, like,"
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"You were after money, the same as i was."
You would've cornered gold if you could've done it.
"I'm broke, too."
I'm right back where i started 10 years ago- right down to my last dollar.
"But i'll get on top, and you'll stay right where you are!"
You belong in the streets!
Get back into the streets!
Get a doctor.
"Yes, sir."
"Take it easy, jim."
The doctor's coming.
You're going to be all right.
Jim!
Jim.
"I'm all right, josie."
"Lie still, jim."
Don't move.
I'll go.
"No, no, no."
"Don't go, luke."
We can't split partners now.
"We're not going to split partners, jim."
"We never have, and we never will."
"Take it easy, boss."
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna pull through.
"Sure, i will."
"You know, it's a great life."
I wouldn't sell this next minute for... for a million dollars.
Nick... i owe you a bet.
He's good luck.
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.
"You know, I feel bad."
I didn't give you something.
"I bring something, but I forgot it when I left that morning."
"Balsamic vinegar, 35 years."
From my sister's husband's family.
Live in Modena.
"So, aside from your Dad..."
-was it wonderful being back in Italy?
"-It was wonderful, yeah."
"Go home and see your friends, your family."
I gotta be honest... it was not so nice.
-I don't belong there no more.
-No?
Something change.
-Maybe me.
-What do you mean?
I'm like a visitor in my own town.
Life went on without me.
There is nothing there for me now.
-No special someone?
-I feel strange to live here also.
Maybe I should never have come to America.
"You've made such a nice life for yourself, though."
You've got a wonderful home.
-A girlfriend.
-No.
"What do you mean, no?"
Jessica?
I try to talk to her... but there is no communication.
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it.
I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is it?
Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
Why do you always do this?
Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00 and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to go.
I was ordering dessert when they were eating dinner.
I was asking for the check.
What time is it?
It's almost fucking 10 o'clock.
How's it going?
"Well, we haven't got a shot off yet."
This is exciting.
The script is exciting.
I loved it.
"-Oh, I'm glad you liked it."
I loved it.
I thought it was so funny.
It's so funny.
So you liked the script?
"You think it's as good as ""Shakespeare in Love""?"
"Oh, much better."
"When you're not busy, could me and him talk to you?"
Sure.
Because he has something pretty big going on.
"-Oh, yeah?"
-Yeah.
Pretty big?
"Well, I ought to hear about it right now."
He wants to make a movie?
Yeah?
He's making a book right now.
Uh-huh.
And he has his own characters and everything.
And he wanted to know if he could make a movie out of it.
Why not?
"Just keep-- you have to have, like, a script or something."
You got to get some money.
You have to raise money.
You need money to make a movie.
Boy:
Shake it!
Shake it!
Shake it!
But Jules and Laurie are!
What?
How?
We're going in!
"Laurie, this is why I love you!"
I can do anything when I'm with--
Laurie?

Look at this!
I think I found Thomas Riffauta.
Let's see.
I think this is it.
"No permanent residence. 1.72 m, few sentences, but nothing serious..."
That's him.
He was with Sophie Mazerat and Hugo Rozier.
They were there when the bomb Rozierovim exploded in his hands.
I just saw him in that neighborhood with a black guy.
-Kidding.
I saw him in the squat!
Maybe just buy drugs.
Where did you get his name?
From Joséphine Karlsson.
Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
Let me take your coat.
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
- Can I fix you a drink?
"- No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ."
Is it true that you might go to Portland?
"Well, I've received the offer."
"It's a larger school, and naturally, much more money."
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
- Michael?
- Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
- About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
- And what were they?
"- Well, Michael, I've lied so long."
"I was everything you said, especially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you wanted me.
- I had no right to say those things.
- That's not really a good idea today.
- Abby.
Triage needs extra bodies.
They got 20 kids from Kelton Elementary with vomiting and diarrhea.
I'll be there in five minutes.
Abby.
"Abby, it's okay."
I can get to the bus station by myself.
"No, I'll take you."
I'll take you.
"Mr. Levine, what's your problem?"
I just got drunk at a Valentine's Day party.
- Five days ago.
"- Yeah, it was a blowout."
- I wanted to tell you-
- Hey.
No.
Why did you take that out?
It was itchy.
- Altered mental status.
"- Abby, send up admit labs two sets of blood cultures, and grab an LP tray."
- Meningitis?
- Let's find out.
- I'm sorry.
"- It's okay, I'll call you when I get home."
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Nurses shortage, you know."
Working in the ER can be a very inconvenient job sometimes.
"I'm sorry, John."
I just wanted Eric to come home so bad so that I could be with my family just for a second.
Tomorrow?
"Tomorrow, can I sleep in your basement?"
Can you drop me at the office?
All my stuff is there.
Because that's where you're sleeping?
Yeah.
And I've got some business that I have to take care of in the morning.
"You know, he's right."
Wasserman.
"About you and I, this connection."
Yeah.
Hi.
"Oh, is Sophie asleep?"
-It's like 12:30.
Yeah.
"- Dr. Storper was right,"
- I don't have a fear of flying.
- Ok?
"He thought it was a symptom, but not the cause."
"He didn't know what the cause was, but I know now."
- Ok?
- I have a fear of losing you...
I have a fear of losing you.
Here.
Thanks.
"See, the flying triggered a panic reaction because it was taking me away from you."
The real life stuff has been taking me away from you.
We talked about this.
We did that on purpose.
I wanna be with you and Sophie.
I wanna help you with her.
"I wanna live here, marry you even, if you're into that."
You intend to go to your brother with that?
"Not only go there, but also find out what he has against you."
The number you dialled is not in service.
Come in.
Hello.

Is Judge Roban here?
Not yet.
Can I take a message?
Tell him it's all in here.
Very well.
Goodbye.
"Hello, is... is Julie here, please?"
"No, there's no Julie here."
"Yes, Julie... a girl with dark hair."
I don't know.
You must have the wrong floor.
"I'm sorry, but I have been here before."
I can even tell you that the glasses are behind...
"Listen, it's not here, OK?"
"Marianne, did Mrs Courcelles get in touch?"
"Not that I know of, Your Honour."
I should have let her leave in her bra and panties.
Prepare a summons for indictment.
- I'm leaving.
- I am sorry.
She...
"She stopped by earlier, she left... an envelope for you."
- An envelope?
An envelope.
I can't recall where I put it.
Are you doing this on purpose?
All right. ls... er...
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
"Lena, sit down."
Is someone after Saul?
"Lena, you can trust me."
You wouldn't believe me.
Of course I'll believe you.
- You'll think I'm crazy.
"- Just try me, OK?"
Nazis.
Nazis are after my Saul.
"You see, I told you you wouldn't believe it."
Wait. it's not that. it's just...
- Nazis?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
"I mean, how do you know?"
"Lena, of course I believe you, but... you just don't hear this kind of stuff in Hawaii."
Why would Nazis be after Saul?
Saul was a member of something called the Masada Team.
- Saul was an Israeli agent?
"- Tom, you know of the Masada Team?"
Yeah. it's a secret Israeli unit that locates and captures war criminals.
They got Eichmann and only they know how many others.
- I was in naval intelligence.
"- Oh, yes."
I forgot.
"If the Nazis were gonna murder Saul, why would they bother..."
- I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
You're right.
You're right.

"It's so far, it takes time for the pigeon to find him."
It'll come flying in soon.
I've waited for so long.
It could have lost its way.
Maybe it can't find Henry.
"I told you umpteen times that with my kerchief on, he can't have anything bad happen to him!"
"Henry, d'you hear me?"
- Jacob!
- I brought you some food.
- Have you seen the pigeon?
-No.
Could all my loved ones have forgotten me?
Henry!
What's happening?
Good gracious!
"Jacob, what's going on?"
Jacob?

Let me out!
"Oh God, a bad omen."
"Judy, honey, come on over here and untie Jack, and you get a great big banana."

I promise.

"All right, Judy."
You've had your fun.
Now untie us before those soldiers get back.

"Oh, now where's she going?"
She's making like an astro-chimp.
What else?
What else.
"Oh, here they come."
We couldn't find her.
Did she come back?
- Yes.
She came back.
- She went that-a-way.
"Oh, wise guy, huh?"
"Hey, fella, are you and American citizen?"
Of course I'm an American citizen.
"Well, I'm gonna see that your passport's revoked and that you're shipped back to the States."
"Captain, she really is our chimp."
"Look, I don't know what your game is."
Are you trying to get publicity for your compound?
Is that why you scared Sally away?

"And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing!"
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Okay!
"Well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?"
"-Don't even think about it, cowboy."
"-Oh, yeah, tough guy?"
The air isn't... toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!

You actually think you're the Buzz Lightyear?
"Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!"
"Hey, guys, look!"
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
"You're mocking me, aren't you?"
"Oh, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Buzz, look, an alien!"
Where?
Yes!
It's Sid!
Don't move!
I thought he was at summer camp.
They must've kicked him out early this year.
"Oh, no, not Sid!"
Incoming!
-Who is it this time?
-I...
I can't...
It's me.
"I'm going, and I'm not gonna fail."
- You're new here.
- It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
Anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
A hook.
Hey.
Come with me.
This...
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.

I was hoping it'd be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
"You know, if I was a Cajun man, I'd say, ""Orange and dorange""."
(Stephen) What would they mean by dorange?
- Door hinge.
- Door hinge!
(laughter)
(applause)
Definitely two points for you.
"Now, young girls and the expanding universe are also famous obsessions of Allen Stewart Konigsberg."
- Or better known as Woody Allen.
- Woody Allen.
"Yes, Woody Allen."
Well done.
Half a point for knowing Woody Allen's real name.
- (Alan) A tiny fragment of a point.
"- (Stephen) Yeah, a fragment."
A pebble.
A little pebble.
An Alan of a point.
But Woody Allen is by no means the Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"Who is, Rich, would you say?"
The Alan with the worst reputation in Hollywood.
"It's Alan ""Big Al"" Allinson, who was so taken by his Celtic Breton background that he killed a lot of people with rocks."
No.
Would it help if I told you his name?
- (Peter) I think I know what it is.
- Yeah?
- Is it Alan Smithee?
- Yes!
Oh!
Ten points to you.
- Well done.
Absolutely right.
- Mary?
Mary who?
"Mary, the Mother of God."
"She, in person she helped me."
The woman in blue.
Mary helped you.
"It all checks, it does."
"She was on the train, with the blood on that picture."
She wanted to warn me.
And later in the Beauty Salon she was lying beside me.
"""When you're warned, you must listen..."""
And she was at the cemetery this morning.
Mary is with me.
Mary is among us.
Mary is among us... in Vlissingen?
"I'm a Catholic myself, Mr. Reve."
"I've got six kids and my third name is Maria but that Mary would be among us in Vlissingen to help you against Christine, beauty specialist and witoh!"
Lie down!
There she is!
The Godforsaken witoh!
Godforsaken witoh!
I'll kill you!
Nurse!
Injection!

Mary...
"Easy, it'll be alright."
Easy...
"This one to the morgue, the other to neurology for now, Ria."
"And your prognosis, doctor?"
"No alcohol, then prolonged psychiatric treatment."
I'll take him some time to collect his wits.
Would you rather I'd lied?
Maybe.
"Well, I'm sorry."
I didn't think you'd want to sleep in the same bed...
"Oh, believe me... we are not sleeping in this bed."
Yaah!
Ugh!
So where are we gonna sleep?
Don't know.
Maybe I should just go home.
No.
You are home.
And we're not spending our first night back together apart.
"Look, I'm hating this as much as you are..."
Uh-huh.
...but we've got to move forward.
What's done is done.
You slept with morning.
I slept with rob.
And Matt.
We're still counting that?
"Oh, it counts."
You were with two people.
I was only with one.
"True, but I slept with two people only once."
"You were with one person twice, so, in effect..."
apples to apples...
I think we're even.
And I think your maths only works if you're fucking the apples.
"Look, I'm just trying to help us get through this."
How?
How can I get through this?
And then you tripled them.
"Well, yeah, I guess I was overdoing it a bit."
I wanna do something fun.
I'm gonna take Quinn out of school tomorrow.
Douglas Park.
We ain't been there in years.
Uh...
"Yeah, about tomorrow..."
Um...
My man died.
Leonard died.
- This past Monday we lost him.
- What are you talking about?
You were in transit.
I had no way of contacting you.
"- When I left, he was in the hospital."
- I know.
Leonard died?
His funeral is tomorrow.
I thought he was gonna make it.
Come on.
"Yeah, I don't feel right."
I can't.
"You're getting out of this car, and you're gonna pay your respects to his family."
- I can't.
I'm gonna stay here.
- He was your commanding officer.
He was our country's hero.
He was like a son to me.
You owe it to all of us.
You got five minutes to get your act together and get out of this car.
"You hear me, sergeant?"
Haven't we all?
"After he died, I"
- I found a change in myself.
My body changed.
Everything changed.
I know if any
- I don't know if anyone has ever told you that before.
And this is the first time I'm talking about it.
[Laughing]
He was one wonderful guy.
But I had a wonderful life.
And that's the thing.
I was one of the luckiest women.
And then he left me.
God took him away... and left me with three small kids.
[Laughing]
And now when I look back at it...
I can't understand how I did it.
I can't.
I went to work.
I had three kids.
I put them
- I took them to a nursing school in the morning.
I picked them up after 5:00.
We came home and we had dinner.
Sometimes I cheated.
I used to go and buy dinner and then pick them up.
[Laughing]
"Ah, dear."
But they liked me to go to the store with them.
Ah.
Where did the years go?

"Can I help you, ma'am?"
"well, they told me to take a streetcar named Desire and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at EIysian fields."
There's your car now.
Thank you.
"When he got home, she was waiting."
"Boy, you never heard nothing like that."
"What's the matter, honey?"
You lost?
I'm looking for EIysian fields.
This is EIysian fields.
What number you looking for?
Six forty-two.
You don't need to look no further.
"I'm looking for my sister, stella DuBois."
"I mean, Mrs. stanley KowaIski."
"Yeah, that's the party, all right."
"You just did miss her, though."
Yes?
-Can this be her home?
-She got the downstairs here.
I got the up.
"Oh, she's out?"
You notice that bowling alley up the street?
-I'm not sure I did.
"-well, that's where she's at, honey."
She's watching her husband bowl.
BIanche!
"BIanche, honey!"
Off to meet girls.
I've got a 30-foot range.
"- (girl) Is that you, Shawn?"
- Get out.
Fine.
No girls for me.
"I'll just study and get good grades and get smart and become a famous scientist, and then I'll build a wife."
I'm bored.

- What's that?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you home?
"- Cory, we're studying."
- So am I.
"Don't go, Rebecca."
Sorry.
I really don't feel like being here anymore.
You haven't seen the whole house.
Let me take you up to the roof.
"Actually, Eric, I think it's nice we didn't go any further than we did."
- Thank you.
- No prob.
Why don't we just study together like we planned?
- I need to study alone.
- So I'll see you Friday?
No.
"OK, then!"
"So, what's new?"
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I have you.
"I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bring you back to life, and I'm gonna kill you again."
Dismiss.
"I See Captain Murry gave you his sword, sir."
The Captain always said a sword like that put the fear of God in the French.
"We're going south, sir."
We'd like you to come with us.
And suppose I don't?
And I get to Lisbon and report you?
"They shoot mutineers, Harper."
"Best if you come with us, sir."
I go south or you kill me?
That's it?
Very well.

"I am Major Blas Vivar, Count of Matamoro,"
"Major General in the Royal Army of His Most Catholic Majesty, Ferdinand VII, King of Spain."
And you sir?
Lieutenant Sharpe.
These objects were taken from him and these are the personal belongings found in his cell.

"Benigno, it's me."
Alicia is alive.
You woke her up.
"When I heard your message,"
"I raced back to the jail to tell you, but Iwas too late."
I put Alicia's hairclip in your pocket.
"And I also put in a photo of her and one of your mother,"
so that they'll be with you for all eternity.
Waves.
Cruel waves.
"The male below, the female above."
I find water.
You sit down.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I don't know.
I'm much better now.
What?
"Come along, let's go inside."
"OK, you are shaking."
OCR failed!
What is the matter?
What did you say to her?
Nothing.
I saw you talking.
Alicia asked me if I felt all right and I thanked her.
"If you see me in your neighborhood, don't worry."
I live across from your Academy.
- Ok.
- What?
Nothing.
"It's just, you're so bossy sometimes, it's kind of a turn-off."
Bossy?
Wow.
"Well, I only said that because..."
"No, that's cool, you know."
"I'll just, like, turn my brain off whenever we're together."
- That's not what I meant.
- So what?
"Did I, like, trick you into this or something?"
Did I pretend to be someone else that you... ?
No.
"I mean, I like how independent you are."
I just feel like sometimes it's kinda like you're dating yourself.
Like it doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.
"Well, congrats."
It doesn't anymore.
Emma.
Emma!
Your secret admirer's outside.
"It's all about the Benjamins, baby."
Just what do you think $100 is gonna buy you?
'Cause you know what?
I don't want your guilt money.
"Yeah, I know who you are."
You're Robert Quinn.
"I Googled you, when you didn't show."
"Ok, look."
I'm sorry.
I took your DNA test.
'Cause that's loaded.
Yeah.
Michael's father had a Winchester single-shot.
I think I may still have it.
So you want a beer?
You kiddin'?
Doug is sleeping peacefully.
- You gave him something.
- Maybe.
"Well, half of somethin'."
Sam got in touch with his buddy at the U.S. Attorney's.
Bringing Doug in tomorrow mornin'.
Great.
We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You think you can let the job be who you are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think that you can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been-
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."
Don't deny it.
Fine.
"Isn't it interesting that she turned out to be... well, who she turned out to be?"
I like her.
"Okay, so good."
You could use a friend.
Especially one who cleans.
"Hey, maybe you could make a second friend who cooks."
"I haven't had a homemade meal in, like, a year and a half."
I'm gonna go change for dinner.
"Wait a minute, why are you here?"
I took Ritchie and Matthew to the batting cages.
He's been feeling neglected since the divorce.
- Ritchie?
"- No, surprisingly, Matthew."
"- He almost hit the ball, though."
- Matthew?
"No, surprisingly, Ritchie."
"Well, I just have to finish this ironing, and then we can take off."
"Okay, well, take your time."
This is nice.
I love a basement bedroom.
This is where you wanna be during a tornado.

"Belinda, I..."
Oh.

"- Hello, Christine."
- Hello.
"Uh, the book club is here, so if you could set the food out, that'd be great."
"And, uh, you girls can help yourselves to a couple of sandwiches."
Just a couple.
Heh.
"- Oh, thank you."
Thank you.
"And, like, after he hurt his knee, he won all 24 again?"
- Yeah.
"- He's like an American hero, you know?"
"I mean, who doesn't respect that guy?"

"- I'm gonna make it right, okay?"
- Okay.

- Jacob.
"- All right, kid, come on."
"- You know, Ricky just has the drive to win."
He wasn't afraid of the work.
He always trained harder than anyone else.
- He's a role model to young ones.
"He shows them that, you know, you get out of life whatever you put into it."
"- I mean, ten titles in a motocross class... that's crazy."
"- Every time he goes out there, he's thinking about nothing else but crossing that finish line first, and he does."
- The big difference between Ricky and all...
"- Yeah, Jacob!"
- Awesome!
"- Whoa, nice little jump."
- Yeah.

When was the last time you saw your roommate?

- She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.

"Hey, it's okay to look."
"It may not be polite to stare, but looking's nothing be embarrassed at."

What I feel for your son is very sincere.
Great.
"So, mate, I've got your favourite here - burgers and chips."
"Is that OK with you, Fiona?"
"Oh, you're not staying?"
"Finnegan, would you mind grabbing my purse?"
I think I left it in the car.
How is that different from what I was doing?
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
I'm sure you will.
I just...
I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
"All right, tell him I'll be up in half an hour."
"No, they said now."
"If they've got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my samovar."
Of course.
I assume that's what we're meeting about.
What about Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?
"[lmitating Ray Romano] Hey, aah, ho, Debra."
There you go.
My brother's tall!
[Normal voice] Right?
Are we in trouble or something?
No way.
Gary loves the show.
Pleased with the ratings.
"Right, of course."
They love us.
Where's Gary?
Gary's dead.
"Well, that sounds like an offer I can't refuse."
"Uh...where and when, Mr Adams?"
"Uh...where and when, Mr Adams?"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Be my pleasure.
Be my pleasure.
No.
Thank YOU.
No.
Thank YOU.

How hard is it to shoot a bloke?
He said Friday night.
He said Friday night.
He said he'd do it yesterday!
I've been in a lot of scrapes.
What about that one?
That was teenage experiment.
Wanted to see if I could take the pain.
And could you?
Comfortably.
We're gonna do some balloons.
I've got a better idea.
Truth or Dare?
Dare.
Any suggestions?
I think we need to sex this party up a bit.
"- What do you think, boys?"
- Yes.
I can do sexy.
Eleanor...
"I dare you... to give Gemma... a long... hot, wet kiss on the mouth."
- Tongues?
- Absolutely.
"Excuse me, do I get a say in this?"
"- No, no, no, no, no..."
"- Rules of the game, babe."
"Oh, yeah, I've still got it."
And I hope you're not expecting me and Chris to do that.
We don't need any of that queer shit.
"Yeah, that-that-that's what I'm saying."
I get enough of that in the army.
"Okay, stop being weird and spin the bloody bottle."
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Um...
"I don't know, truth."
Will you take me back?
Can you not read Korean?
My name probably appeared on the phone.
It only said 'dog' and 'bird' (wordplay for son of a b*itch).
'Dog' and 'bird'?
Son of a b*tch?
"Anyways, Eul cannot take the call right now, so call later."
"If the person calling right now happens to be Sin Joon Young,"
I don't think there will be a need for you to call back.
"- Not too long ago, she got fired from your documentary project."
- Who are you?
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Ah
- Haha...
Do you happen to be her husband?
Oh!
My phone.
Are you Eul's husband?
Hello?
Why aren't you replying?
Are you Eul's husband?
Why are you picking up my calls?
Hello?
Hello?
HEY CRAZY BASTARD!
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
!
Husband
Am i your husband?
Yes.
"Whenever I get in a fight with someone, you always take their ('nam') side('pyun)."
"So that's why you're not my('nae') side, but others side ('nampyun' - same word as husband)."
I'll be going now.
"- Wow, is that a--"
Everlasting Cobb-gobbler.
Bobby's fridge-raiding masterpiece.
"Oh, by the way, you're out of turkey, cheese, mustard, bread--"
Basically everything that goes in a sandwich.
"You're really going all in on this new resourceful,"
"""slightly bordering on hobo"" thing."
All part of the plan.
I'm trying to save for the future.
"- Oh, Trav, that's great."
"- Well, yeah."
I got a family now.
"What did you think I was doing, freeloading?"
You know what?
I'm really impressed.
I'm going to pitch in to your savings and help you with your future.
Mom.
"Oh, my God!"
This is amazing!
[ Gasps ] This puts me over the top.
- The top of what?
- The thing I've been saving for!
What is this?
- My future!
- Huh?
Not so--
"Man, it just sat in the parking lot with a for-sale sign all month."
I'm so lucky no one grabbed it before me.
Super lucky.
You don't usually break out Big Chuck this early in the day.
- Are you okay?
- Great.
- Shut up.
"And what's ""Oschwitz""?"
The word is Auschwitz.
"Oschwitz, Auschwitz, it's the same crap."
Stop it.
- Where to?
- To sleep.
- Dad's inspection.
- What?
I cracked the case.
I spent all night with this garbage.
"The delightful record of an obsessive cheapskate, but it's also the entire history of this family,"
"- before I was born, of course."
- Where did you find Dad's whistle?
Don't interrupt.
"Okay, as we all know, Mom and Dad got married in 1965."
"Morn was 19, and that's when Dad started keeping records, right?"
"You, Natanel, were born in 1976 and Dad bought a stroller."
So?
It took them 11 years to have their first child.
So what?
We know that.
Look.
"Exactly 9 months before Natanel was born it says: ""June 23, 1975, plane tickets to Paris for Yonah,"
"""1,400 liras"""
What's your point?
- She visited Aunt Rosa every year.
- Right.
"9 months before you were born,"
"9 months before Dorona was born,"
and 9 months before I was born.
What does it mean?
I swear.
- All right.
I'm looking forward to it.
"All right, I got news."
You ready?
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
"- Oh, yeah, I knew."
- You knew?
How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?
- So is he okay?
"- Oh, yeah, he's fine."
"He was in bad shape for a while, though."
Really?
How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?
"No, he was on his regular bed."
So why didn't you tell me?
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?
It's not like you're my wife.
I still think you should've told me.
You were better off not knowing.
It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this.
I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I'm gonna talk to him about this.
That's right.
You let him have it.
Who is he not to tell you about his life- threatening illness?
"- I mean, you got your ass kicked."
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked.
"Mac, it had to look real."
Were you gonna tell me eventually?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- I was going to tell you eventually.
- Yeah?
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.
"Oh, wait a second."
"Oh, come on, Mac."
"Don't be like that, man."
You would have done the same thing.
"Come on, don't act like a baby."
Please don't stab me.
"Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy."
- Your last chance to chicken out.
"- That ain't gonna happen, Bobby."
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
"- All right, Frankie."
Seeing that we're a couple of old men here...
I think we should lay down some ground rules.
Now.
Number one.
Holy shit!
"Since I was currently homeless,"
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
"J.D., you have to get out."
I say we go after it now!
No-one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this!
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not gonna make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
You have to understand.
"When I found her, I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever."
She was just lying there helpless.
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning she survived on food and water, like any young girl."
Then the hunger came.
It's alright.
Take what you need.
I can't!
Yes you can.
"She took what she needed from me to survive, until I perfected the serum."
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry!
"She never fed on anyone, after that?"
No!
Alright!
"Teyla, Ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here!"
Colonel!
(WHISPERING) Okay.
"Help, help, save me!"
(GRUNTING)
"Hey, there!"
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

Nancy.
Nancy?
What are you doing here?
I saw someone crawl through this window.
You're mistaken.
You mustn't let them find you here.
Men aren't allowed in this building.
"I know, I didn't want anything to happen to you, but I saw a white thing crawl through here, and it looked like Wilbur."
NANCY:
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Wilbur wouldn't do a thing like that.
"You're very fond of him, aren't you?"
Very.
I wish he belonged to me.
"You could do with a little of Wilbur's manners, you know."
"I'm sure they must be very charming, but he certainly didn't have any trouble worming his way in."
"Well, no, he didn't."
"And he doesn't come climbing into people's rooms in the middle of the night, either."
What was that?
NANCY:
I don't know.
BOB:
Let's go find out.
(MEOWING)
"Oh, a cat."
- Do you remember at all?
Just over there where the lounge is.
- Do you remember anything about a rabbi?
- I don't remember anything.
Do you remember talking to a rabbi?
Or do you remember a rabbi... giving a talk about Max?
I guess I was in too much of a shock.
You don't recall any of this?
- I was in too much of a shock.
- Mm-hmm.
Must have been that.
Because he was my best friend.
I know.
We all know that.
We were very close friends.
"That wasn't when my daughter put me in here, was it?"
- When did it happen?
- Nine days ago.
Oh.
So I was here some time already.
"Oh, you"
- I think you've been here for a few years.
- Pardon?
- I think you've been here at Baycrest for a few years.
- Was I here a few years?
- I think so.
I think so.
"Yeah, my daughter never had time for me."
"- Why do you say that, Claire?"
- [Mutters]
Because she went to business.
And I was home.
Jesse Viljanen.
Your turn to give a speech.
The kingdom of flames is powerless against my super strength.
"Die, you flames!"
Are you alright?
Sure.
"After some strange turns, I've become The Flame Man."
Right...
"First, sick leave, then office duty with the girls."
"But first, firefighter of the year""."
Jesse Viljanen.
Marjukka!
Bring me another beer!
Your old friend Jesse Viljanen is in the news!
"What next, firefighter of the year, Flame Man Jesse Viljanen?"
Home to Puotinharju.
I need to rest.
See my friends.
They must be proud of you.
I guess.
The flame performance we saw...
What an earth is he wearing?
-Mom knows all the idiots...
"At home, I thought..."
My friends gave me the costume and I thought...
Is it your inner flame that makes you do these things we just saw?
I don't know about flames but I have dreams.
Jesse's nothing but dogshit from the garbage can!
He saved your life.
"Ostrich farmer Einu Palunen, your farm's been vandalized again."
What's all that noise?
Look!
I'm not sure I should send Neil to the garage.
Those men sound like brutes.
I think it was just hijinks.
"What, three dirty men throwing a naked young boy into water?"
- The mind boggles.
- I never said Will was naked.
I thought you did...
Not quite the outcome I'd hoped for.
Neil's dad imagining me naked.
"When it comes to love, they say a gentleman never tells."
But I wasn't a gentleman.
I was a twat.
Guess who got a date with Charlotte Hinchcliffe?
- Donovan?
- No.
I bet it is - he's probably balls deep in her right now.
The answer... is me.
- No way.
"- Yes, way."
Of sorts.
- Of sorts way.
- How?
I've no idea.
"Honestly, and I'm not going to stop and ask her."
I don't know why she likes me but I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
Sounds like a good plan.
- When is it then?
- What?
- Date.
- Friday.
- What we up to Friday?
- Same as every Friday.
"I was just, you know..."
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, I guess."
"Actually, no, I'm not fine."
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
(EX CLAIMING)
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
"- No, it's..."
- Do you want to hang out tonight?
- Sure.
- It was so fun.
You guys liked it.
- It was the most...
- Please tell me you got in the window.
- I got in the window.
(ALL CHEERING)
What is going on?
What is the window?
"You know how everyone has that guy or girl who, no matter what happens, you always remember them being the perfect one for you?"
- Mike Scharz.
- Lily.
That girl right over there.
"Well, that girl for me was and still is Maggie Wilks."
We all went to college together.
She was awesome.
Everybody loved her.
I think I know what we're dealing with here.
Tell me when to stop.
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.
She was...
She was the ultimate girl next door.
She was the ultimate girl next door.
We're allowed to have a bit of a difference of opinion.
Tell me we're not rushing Dallas.
We're not rushing Dallas.
"You know what I'm talking about, right?"
"No, not really."
"Mel, Dallas is happening."
"I have job and it looks like you have a job too,"
- if you want it.
- Maybe I don't want it.
You said you did.
Things change.
People change.
- So you're not coming?
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that I'm nervous.
- I'm getting scared.
- Doc?
Sorry...
Just hang on a sec.
- Mel...
- I have to get back to Nicole.
"Doc, the nurse says we got a green light."
He's all yours.
- Thanks.
- And Officer?
I've taken a strict inventory of Mr. Pike's injuries.
"There are detailed notes on every bruise, scratch, and cut."
OK...
"So if he ends up back here with a new injury, I'll know where it came from."
Get him out of here.
I don't see her.
At least I got the one.
Right?
Yeah.
"Get out, get out, get out."
We got a lot of work to do.
"Good, good."
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.
What are we doing?
"Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know."
- Yeah?
"- So nobody can kick your ass, right?"
- Practically invincible.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what's your point though?"
Well...
"So here's what's gonna happen, pal."
Dennis and I are gonna train you... to be an underground street fighter.
What?
That is brilliant.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- Okay, what's the first step?"
- First step is getting that shirt off.
"- Yeah, let's get that shirt off."
- Why would I do that?
- That shirt's just gonna weigh you down.
"Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains... so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off."
I think I'm gonna wear it.
That's ridiculous.
"You can't train and wear a shirt, dude."
Now it's becoming this whole big thing.
It feels a little gay.
"Whatever, Mama."
"Santana, I brought you something."
"You know, when Jesus was crucified on the cross, there was a thief named Dismas on the cross next to him."
He believed in Jesus and asked him not to forget him when he died.
"When Jesus died, he took Dismas to heaven and Dismas became a saint."
I want you to wear it.
"Let me see it, Mama."
"Mi hijo, let's put it on your brother."
Okay.
Santana.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
You're not supposed to pass items to convicts.
But you see what it is.
Sorry.
That's policy.
He can pick this up with the rest of his property you brought for him.
"You'll wear it, huh?"
SANTANA:
I'll wear it.
Don't worry.
They'll give it to me later.
(SANTANA SPEAKS spanish) I'm okay.
(SLIPPIN' INTO DARKNESS playing)
SIippin' into darkness
Takes my mind beyond the trees
(LOCK buzzing)
I was slippin' into darkness
Yeah
Takes my mind
Beyond the trees
Where I talk to my brothers
Oh-oh-oh-oh
This highlight needle pen has the perfect mix of science and art.
"First, place the box in the center of the paper."
This activity is so 6th grade.
But it's actually kind of fun.
January.
Number 133.
Sawasdee Pee Mai (Happy New Year in Thai)
Happy New...
Sawasdee Pee Mai is better.
"Hello doc, Sawasdee Pee Mai."
"Umm doc, last month I'm..."
Number 134.
Sorry...
Damn your hands are freaking cold.
"Just like when you rode that roller coaster, right before it flipped upside down."
I'm Assanai.
Am I in the wrong room?
"No, you are not."
Doctor Chonnikarn is doing rounds in the ward.
Today let me check on your progress.
That's okay.
I can come back next month.
Why?
So I can be examined by Doctor Imm.
She's handling my case.
I'm following her treatment plan.
She wrote down all your history.
So your treatment plan is the same.
C'mon.
I studied the same specialty as Doctor Imm.
I won't kill you.
Let me see your arm.
It appeared to me he was dead.
So I went in pursuit of the suspect and called it in.
He got into a dark four-door sedan.
Late model.
Headed east on Malpassat Road.
"I got a partial on the plate, George-Robert-Victor."
George-Robert-Victor...
George-Robert-Victor- Zebra-9-0-3?
That's Officer Pritchard's car.
- Was it a black Chrysler 300?
- Uh...
Was it Pritchard you saw?
I only saw him for a second.
"It was dark, but... but who else could it be?"
Okay.
Have you photoed the body yet?
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
And it's self conscious.
Conscious of self.
Right.
"I mean, yeah, yeah."
I'm self conscious.
"Which is a good thing, I think."
What do you think?
"Well, I mean, I think it's really good."
I'm all about my work.
And my body is my work.
"So... one might say that... yeah, I'm all about my body."
"But in some respects, that is true, but you're completely missing the point."
And the point is...
I completely missed my point.
"Ok, rewind, reset."
"Uh, look."
I've... got a great vibe between you and me.
Great energy there.
"So, yeah."
Ok.
I get it.
So let's lay the facts down.
"You want to be with me, and vice versa."
That much is clear.
But my work always comes first.
I need to lay that...
down right off the bat.
"Basically, my body comes before you."
He seems perfect.
"Good looking, somewhat single minded, somewhat vain... and not too bright."
No promise of a great romance.
No chance of falling...
I'm sorry.
I can't right now.
"Hey, Meredith."
Petty Officer Brian Smith?
Yeah.
There's a whole ship full of people looking for you.
May want to put a shirt on.
You're coming with us.
Stay with her.
Stop!
- Look out!
- Whoa!
I said stop!
Hey!
I know a dead guy with bruises just like yours.
Look at it.
"Oh, is that a little tough to look at?"
"Here, how about this one?"
Maybe a closer shot.
I didn't do that.
It wasn't me.
Says the guy who just ran two blocks to get away.
"I can explain everything, all right?"
"Oh, you can?"
!
"Well, thank goodness for that."
'Cause finding you in the dead guy's girlfriend's apartment with your pants around your ankles doesn't exactly scream innocent.
"In my business, it's called motive."
Think I killed him for Meredith?
People kill for a lot less.
"I woke up around 6:00, and Brian was pounding on my door."
Said he and Caleb got into a fight.
"- Of course, who else?"
- You must be making a lot of money.
But your dad could've paid for it.
"Come on, I fend for myself now."
"By the way, how did you two meet?"
"Well, I worked on a student film way back."
I built a set for them.
And she did the music.
"Oh, so that's how you met."
"Like me, she's an avid fan of yours."
Really?
Have you lost your mind?
Are you nuts?
"By the way, I'm Kim Moonsook."
Nice to meet you.
- So you do music?
"- Yes, it's nothing really."
Her music is great!
How do you like this music?
I brought this CD for you.
What?
Is this her music?
"Yes, isn't it nice?"
She's mainly a composer.
She made this to use as a demo for her singing debut.
Very nice.
This is a bit mainstream.
I also have some weird stuff.
Want to hear it?
"No, it's nice."
Let's listen to this first.
I really like this one.
Yes.
I tracked you down.
I bumped into you in front of your apartment in Paris.
"Pretended it was just, uh, by chance."
We had a really good time in St. Tropez.
You stole my life.
"Look, if it's any consolation, it really wasn't much of a life."
You didn't seem very happy.
Oh.
Blame yourself.
"I mean, I tried to cut you in, but you wouldn't give me your pass code, so I mean, I had to use the drug."
How did I get away from you?
I guess I'm getting old.
Sloppy.
I forgot how physical you could be.
You ran off to tell Jacob.
(speaking German)
Please.
"Oh yeah, I'd be afraid too."
Why are you helping him?
Call it instinct.
You couldn't take that away from me.
"Uh, do you wanna see the girl or not?"
This way.
Stay.
What happened?
"It's under control, thank you."
"Julia, I'm Marta."
I'm a friend of your father's.
Where is he?
He's waiting for you.
Where?
I don't know why you let him move in.
He's me brother.
You never know when you'll need bone marrow.
"He's rude, he's ignorant, he's lazy."
Yeah.
How could two brothers be so different?
"Anyway, he's gone."
Moved back in with Donna.
"That's the last we'll see of ""The Troyminator""."
"I had to tell you, at that party the other night in the bathroom, I saw..."
- What?
- What?
You was in the bathroom at the party the other night and you saw...
Saw... that it needed a makeover.
So paint it magnolia.
Put some decking' down.
Sort your taps out.
- Eh?
- Just a fuckin' thought!
Gotta go.
See ya.
What's up with you?
Looks like death row in here.
"Er... yeah, well, better get back in the saddle."
That horse'll be on bricks by now.
I'd best bust a move.
I've got to meet Amanda.
- Who?
- Amanda.
"You know, with weird eyes."
See ya!
"Gonna pop out, get some fags."
-Have you got any cigs?
"-Oh, sure."
"Oh, what a-"
- What a pretty case.
-silver?
-Yes.
"Yes, read the inscription."
"Oh, there is an inscription."
"Why, I can't make it out."
"""And if God choose I shall but love thee better after death."""
"Why, that's from my favorite sonnet by Mrs. Browning."
"-Why, you know it."
"-certainly, I do."
"well, there's a story connected with this inscription."
It sounds like a romance.
"No, no, it's a pretty sad one."
The girl's dead now.
She knew she was dying when she give me this.
"A very strange girl, very sweet."
-Very....
-She must have been very fond of you.
"Sick people have such deep, sincere attachments."
-That's right.
They certainly do.
"-Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think."
It sure brings it out in people.
The little there is belongs to people who have known some sorrow.
-I believe you're right about that.
"-Oh, I'm positive I am."
"-Hey, Mitch!"
-deal me out.
I'm talking to Miss--?
Your date's here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good seeing you again.
"- You, too."
You didn't tell me you have a kid.
Huh?
Did you tell her you were my kid?
I am.
"What, did you have her when you were five?"
No!
"She's just, you know, a minor residing in my home."
"Hey, I know you."
"No, you don't."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
"I don't know where from, but uh... why are you shaking your head?"
You know I
- I don't think we've met before.
"No, I'm pretty sure we're well-acquainted."
"You know, I think I would remember you."
You're pretty memorable.
Are you the babysitter?
Me?
"No, no I totally tried to fuck Ling before I found out she was seventeen."
"That doesn't sound right, taken out of context."
"Yeah, that doesn't sound right in any context."
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
"Nice meeting you Ling, Bender."
"Hey, how the fuck you know my name?"
Let's go!
The night is young!
Then we go to a used car lot and get another car.
"Then we're gonna pass the motherfuckers, don't you understand that?"
Yeah.
"Shut up, Ray."
We're gonna pass the cops.
They're gonna see us.
"Ray, we got no fucking choice!"
"We head out of town, they gonna catch us."
Just shut the fuck up.
Morning.
BOTH:
Morning.
How are you boys?
DUD:
I got a hangover...
JOHN:
What do we got?
Nothing.
Quiet as a Sunday morning.
What time did you get here?
"Oh, hell, I came in and relieved Charlie around 4:00."
Y'all want some coffee?
No thanks.
No.
"Hey, Dud."
"Listen, I was thinking about what you was talking about last night."
"And, well, I can understand now why you're pissed off."
"I wasn't pissed off, exactly."
"No, no, no, it's okay, you're right, I mean, hell."
"If that old man hadn't been as deaf as a post,"
I could have blown the whole case.
"Well, I don't know."
"alcohol, again?"
It's the perfume you gave me.
You're drinking perfume now?
From the train I saw a beautiful beach nearby.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
There's something I haven't told you.
An informer said they're gonna kidnap you to get access to the safe.
We have to escort you to yourhome.
Let me introduce my wife.
- A pleasure.
- Mattia.
Does he want money?
We'II include yourwife in the protection program.
- What's this guy want?
- High-five him.
- Y'aII ain't neverbeen South?
"- Who's ""y'aII""?"
"The next time bring a TV camera, there are loads of things you'II never see again, the first is the TV camera!"
What road's this?
"Different, we were afraid of an ambush."
Let's get out.
Hang on.
AII clear.
"Maria FIageIIo, at the ready, it's all okay, high-five."
follow us.
That would be yourugIy neighborMaria?
"Maria, my neighbor."
- YOU ASKED FOR IT -
"Now, Scapece."
They're coming!
Action!
"Don't worry, we'II soon be home."
"Murat, what happened?"
Don't tell her anything.
She doesn't know...
What the hell happened?
"Don't panic, he is OK."
I fucking fell down.
Tell me the truth.
Was it that little bastard?
"No, I just fell."
God.
Don't embarrass him.
Go back to bed.
OK.
I really am OK.
"Just leave, I got to pee."
"Don't worry, he's all right."
He is not my boyfriend.
He is my shadow.
Where I walk... he walks with me.
He knows what I eat... where I sleep... whom I am with.
Why is he following you?
Because here in Istanbul I have a different life.
"Yo wimp, do you think I didn't spot you the other day, mamma's boy."
That's not fair.
How are you bro?
Are you OK?
Just want you to know that I took care of your money.
It's all settled.
Do you need anything further?
"Off course, he would come back... every time I enjoyed freedom."
Why would he do that?
You should have gone to the police.
Oh!
Wow.
Are...
Are these... from the street?
You know what?
You're lucky I'm here.
I'm gonna let you use my fall tablescape.
"There's nothing wrong with my table, Viv."
You are so funny!
Greg!
Hi.
I'm Viv.
It's so nice to meet you.
You're too bony for me.
"I didn't think that you could do anything worse than making out with my mom, but congratulations."
You topped it!
"Well, she was desperately peering through the window."
What was I supposed to do?
The same thing that you do if someone asks if you have a minute to save the environment...
You look at your shoes and you keep moving.
"Darling, you are stunning."
"Oh, those stems!"
Tell me...
Were you ever a stewardess?
"Why, no, but thank you."
I'm Viv!
"I'm Kathryn, Katie's mother."
"Kathryn, forgive me."
"I'm sure you've been talking about this all day, but I have to ask..."
What happened to you?
No-o-o-o-o!
"Pay up, girl!"
- They're my roommates.
"- Cece, hi."
"I'm gonna go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess."
"Wait, let's just talk about this, okay?"
"You know, rap it out."
We can't rap it out.
We're not together.
It's not the same.
- Doesn't mean we can't talk.
- Nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.
"No, you gave this to me."
I wanna keep it.
"- Give her her T-shirt, man."
"- No, I don't want to."
And I gave her this hat.
I'm gonna take this back.
- This one?
You want that?
- Yeah.
"Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal."
I dare you.
- You guys look ridiculous.
"- Look, give her the shirt back."
- I bet she worked hard on that jamboree.
"- Yeah, play on words."
- Jamboree.
Jam.
- Jam.
"Girl made a lot of jam, Spence."
You know how time-consuming that can be?
"You need ajar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe..."
That's her.
I'm suddenly nervous.
You're going to be great.
I'm having the strangest craving for a corn dog.
There may be one left.
Seat?
How about that?
"Fourth quarter, Team Frank comes through in the clutch."
"Oh, yeah."
True love on Valentine's Day.
What more could you ask for?
Yeah...
"Hey, uh, so, you know, we reserved the limo for another two hours."
What do you say we drive down the beach?
"Uh, that sounds suspiciously like a Valentine's Day date to me."
"I don't know, that might make us break up."
What if I said I had newfound faith?
I would say I agree.
I have newfound faith.
I agree.
Okay.
"Onward, Jeeves."
"Yes, yes, yes, to the beach."
-=The Last Fantasy=- Proudly Presents
I'm pregnant.
What ?
Previously on The O.C.:
"Sandy, we're having a baby."
I just want you to find something that you really care about.
I could be a critic.
You mean spending your whole life watching movies and telling people how terrible they are ?
Let's go.
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
"The ocean-going Blue Sea Turtle, ...is one of nature's mysteries."
It wanders far across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans...
"Excuse me, but I'm closing up now."
It's the end of the road for him.
Yoghurt Processing Plant
He's got no immunity ...to our bacteria.
They won't be back to Earth in a hurry.
Thanks to the bacteria in yoghurt...
Ouch.
That hurt.
Very hurt.
There's a part I still need.
Five a.m. Welcome to the day.
What the hell are you doing?
Why's it open?
Say something!
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
"Spill the beans, we know you did it!"
See you next week.
Let's go to our reporter live at the scene...
"He's got no immunity, ...to our bacteria."
What's she talking about?
"Quiet, the old guy'll be furious."
Don't worry.
How about this?
Looks good.
Wanna keep this?
For now.
Check this out!
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr.Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr.Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
- Want to come?
- I'm meeting my editor.
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"- Benigno, please."
- You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
"Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we went from Trey to a lengthy Volchok period."
"Hey, thanks for this."
Yeah.
"Now, unless you hit that Chili guy... or Johnny..."
I know a lot of people were rooting for that.
"Well, I did punch Johnny's dad."
Or a bounty hunter who worked for him.
Johnny's dad was a bounty hunter ?
"Oh, yeah."
I never told you that ?
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife needs to see someone right away.
What happened ?
I fell down some stairs.
You break anything ?
"I don't think so, but..."
She needs help.
"Everyone here needs help, sir."
You can fill out this form and wait your turn.
She's pregnant.
Any bleeding ?
"No, but something isn't..."
isn't right.
I'm sorry.
Try to make yourself comfortable.
Hang on a second.
Sandy...
"Hang on one second, all right ?"
I'll be right back.
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife would never complain.
She would never put her needs in front of anybody else's.
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Oh, hey, come in."
This is Dr. Black.
Tracy and Jacob Myers.
They're very good friends.
- Hello.
Lovely to meet you.
- Hello.
Dr. Black is our star brainiac here at the Cube.
Oh.
"""May the source of strength who blessed the ones before us help us find the courage to make our lives a blessing."""
"So, Jacob's experienced a sudden spiritual conversion."
He's bonkers.
We've always been bad Jews.
I can count on one hand the times we've gone to temple.
All of a sudden...
I'm enlightened.
Beautiful office.
I think we need a full neurological work-up.
I'm happy to help.
Would you like to come to my office?
You can tell me all about it.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- It's okay.
- Oh.
- What are you doing?
- The Myers are philanthropists...
- I'm just standing here.
- You're standing in the hallway.
"- And they've just recently joined the board at the Cube,"
- so make sure they get VIP treatment.
"Oh, the poor thing."
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
I'll just-
- I'll just get this washed foryou.
"Well, you must have at least heard about this girl."
- No'
- Gertrude says--
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
"- I mean, really."
"- Madam, please--"
This girl shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea ofa princess.
"If Eric's looking for a girl, I know a couple of... highly available ones right here."
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
"Nice young ladiesjust don't swim around rescuing people... in the middle ofthe ocean, and then flitter off into oblivion like some--"
"I'm tellin' ya, Grim."
She was real.
"I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her."
"Come on, honey."
Don't be shy.
"Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?"
"Uh, you look wonderful."
"Come, come, come."
You must be famished.
"Let me help you, my dear."
There-
"- Oh, there we go."
"Eh, that's better."
"Now, quite comfy, hmm?"
"Ha, ha."
Good.
"It's, uh--"
"-Oh shit, we gotta go."
-Wow!
The mother lode.
- I think you're right.
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Go back.
Jaelen.
Is this her?
-It is.
-Who is she?
- A young woman Jaelen had the good taste to fall in love with.
"- You do have a good taste, my friend."
-She's being held at the Dulce Base.
I'm quite sure her friends and family would be interested to know that.
- How soon would you be able to upload?
-Right now.
-Where are the files going into?
-To an old compadre of mine.
- They'll upload to sixty [ indistinct] globally.
The initial launch should reach about 6 million people.
What's ETA?
-Just under four hours.
- By morning the flood gates will be open.
35.39 degrees north.
And 106 .54 degrees west.
- Southwest corner of the Haines Canyon Reservoir.
-Remember.
Sun fall.
You'll give them the Purean.
"And Robert, you can go with them."
"- Like you, Jaelen, there are people that I can't leave behind."
Not with what's coming.
I'm already dead.
I got nothing else to live for.
"[Hotch] Tracy, you need to tell him."
Tell me what?
What the hell's going on here?
He needs to know.
"Kaman, while you were in a coma,"
I found out I was pregnant.
Oh...
I didn't know what to do.
I thought you were gonna die.
"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry."
You're telling me... that's my son?
"[Hotch] Kaman, you don't want to do this in front of your son."
Put it down.
"Baby, if you don't do it for me, do it for him."
Don't you want to know his name?
What's your name?
Daniel Kaman Anderson.
"[Hotch] Thomas Kemp wrote,"
"""Love feels no burden,"
"""thinks nothing of its trouble,"
"""attempts what is above its strength,"
"""pleads no excuse for impossibility,"
"""for it thinks all things are lawful for itself and all things are possible. """
"[Jack] Dad, don't look at me."
I'm not looking.
Are you almost ready?
- Yes.
- You need any help?
- No.
- Okay.
Did you send Gallow for Dr. Mead?
[Ursula]:
"Yes, I suggested he came straight to the house."
Good.
Good heavens!
What's going on here?
"Dorcas, we have a visitor."
Is the spare room ready?
"- I'll do it, Miss Janet."
"- This way, Mr. Pendered."
We have to go straight up the stairs.
[Bird chirping]
You can get out for a start.
I was talking to the magpie.
- You should've been more polite.
"- Oh, get on with it."
He's decent.
You can come in now.
He's obviously exhausted.
That ankle's gonna take some time.
"Doesn't have much to say for himself, does he?"
Perhaps he doesn't understand.
He doesn't look English.
"Yes, well, leave him to sleep."
I'll take a look in the morning.
I'll see myself out.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
Don't keep building up that fire.
"If he doesn't have a fever now, he soon will have."
We'd better leave him.
There's nothing we can do for the moment.
[Door opening]
You should have pubic hair.
"Oh,please."
The head of the English department has a Prince Albert.
So we says.
"You know,you should try this."
It's actually making me kind of randy.
"It's like all out there,you know?"
"I know,I saw."
Augie is going to lose his mind.
That's great.
Why can't you come with me?
I can't put pants on.
I'm all tender.
- So wear a skirt.
- I'm going to be cold.
Wrap a scarf around it.
I think tonight I'm going to consist of S'mores and marathon sex with a grateful boyfriend.
"Fine,whatever."
You suck.
Have fun.
"You,too."
So why didn't I ever meet this guy?
Because we spent most of the relationship sitting in his van talking about feelings.
"You know,sometimes I'm out and I look around at all the men and it makes me want to go home and,like,knit Marty blanket or something."
"Go,Johnny!"
"Whoa,crybaby's a little badass."
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Teach school.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What were you going to ask me?
- That.
- What?
- What you do.
I teach school.
School teacher?
What was it like out in Indian territory?
Lonely as hell.
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.
What do you do for Mr. Coble?
Cowboy.
"Joe, I think we've found our man."
Not anything in Brown's Hole I couldn't take care of.
"Well, I think Horn's reputation... might be as effective as his Winchester is here."
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.
"I know that, Joe, but... your political ambitions are gonna fit right in with our future plans."
"Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?"
"And, besides... there won't be no chocolate cake for Horn up there at Brown's Hole."
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.
Hawaii?
"Yeah, Hawaii."
Did you live in one of those grass huts?
In a hotel.
- They have those there?
- Sure they do.
Sure come a long way to teach school in Wyoming.
- It was like a blow to me when he passed away.
"- Yeah, it was sudden."
It was
- It was terrible.
I never felt that way before.
He always used to say to me...
"""You know, Claire... if it won't be you, it'll never be anybody else."""
- What does that mean?
- He wanted me to marry him.
- Did he ask you?
- Sure.
- So why didn't you?
- So I said I wasn't ready to -
- I wasn't ready to get married.
- What are you waiting for?
I wasn't ready
- It is a lot of things you have to do when you get married.
Like what?
What did you have to do?
Inviting the people.
There's a lot of work involved.
Yeah.
Sure.
I would have helped you.
Max was a wonderful man.
"- He was never married, was he?"
- No.
- I know that.
- No.
- So you would have been his first wife -
- And again he said to me -
"He always said to me, ""Claire, if it won't be you... it'll never be anybody else."""
She ran away.
There is nothing I can do.
She left all her stuff behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Ah whatever.
She's right.
I'm not good enough for her.
- Suddenly.
- Yes.
- I know who she ran away with.
- Who?
Some guy she's known for a while.
They met on the street.
He even gave her a fur.
- A fur?
- Yes.
Yu-lu
Heroes do not shed tears easily...
Only if they are not heart-broken
Who might you be?
Your eyes must be bad
"We met at Kaifeng 3 years ago, Knight Fan!"
May I ask your revered name?
Chang Wu-ch-l've sought you two months
Something I can do for you?
Teach me the 18 falls of the lmmortals
We've been friends-why be enemies?
Come-let's get a drink!
"No, now that I've found you... I want to see which of us is the best"
"Please give me the honor, Knight Fan!"
Come on-let's have a drink first
Your drinking days are about over
It took some time.
Will she be OK?
I don't know.
Her heart's gonna be weak for a while.
"Maybe forever,"
I don't know.
You know Dr. Jerry Gordon is the guy for you.
You do know that?
Thanks for your help.
- I couldn't get in.
- It happens.
And Dallas.
Exciting.
Big trauma centre...
Congrats.
That's great.
"You don't mean that, do you Jerry?"
Sure I do.
I'm thrilled you're gonna be thousands of miles away.
Doc?
- I didn't touch the guy.
"- No, that bruising around his neck just appeared like magic."
"What was it, a choke hold before you put him in the car, or after?"
"I wouldn't make accusations like that, Doc."
I'll do whatever I want.
He almost died.
Which would have been a real tragedy.
We still need to talk to Mr. Pike.
"He's going to be a little busy, what with the CT scans and the trip to ICU."
"Well, we'll just wait."
There it is.
Casa Natasha.
They're paying plenty for it.
Company... attention!
Nick!
What are you doing over here?
Why aren't you with josie?
She got as sick of me as i got of the job.
She's all right.
Right wheel!
March!
There's plenty happening over there.
"Well, let's go in and tell uncle daniel about it."
He's awful homesick for news.
He's gonna get some.
"Captain, you take over the company."
"I ain't up on that army lingo, boss."
That's all right.
They'll do anything you say.
Right wheel!
March!
See?
Fours right in front!
March!
Fours wrong in back!
March!
"Uncle daniel... you'll be interested in knowing that some wall street fellas have posted a $50,000 reward for your capture and delivery to new york."
Oh... and beef dooley is out to get the reward.
Beef dooley?
Yes.
He's organizing a gang around cherry hill to come over here and get you.
"Salvation, salvation!"
Cornele's back of this.
Give the devil his due.
"It's like-  ""The Square Root Of Three""?"
"- No, no, I'm sorry-  ""A poem of love by Kumar Patel."""
- I need this.
"- Hey, let me read it."
"- No, no."
- Why?
- Because it's lame.
Then read it to me.
There's no way I'm letting you see me in that light.
Good luck with your calculus.
"Come on, don't be embarrassed."
"You know, a lot of girls find intelligence sexy."
"Look, I'm not even gonna be showing this to my professor, all right?"
That's why I'm so stressed out right now.
"Stressed out, huh?"
Come with me.
- ...going?
- Come on.
What?
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?
Don't worry.
It'll help you relax.
"Oh, boy."
It's illegal.
I want your fish right by me
That's how it has to be
Here.

And keep the downstream down and the upstream up

"My stoney, my baby"
Monica Howard.
You're the first one who's given me a full name.
"Well, the 12 steps are anonymous and talking to the police is not part of the program."
"Yeah, right, right."
"So, uh..."
How well did you know Skip Holling?
I was his sponsor.
"He was, um..."
a really nice guy.
"You know, he was doing really well with his recovery."
"Did he have any, uh... friends, enemies, any relationships?"
Probably all three.
"You know, I don't think I'm much help."
"We just talked about booze, that's it."
Right.
"Thanks, thanks, uh..."
If I have any more questions?
"Yeah, you can--you can reach me here, Detective..."
"Schanke, Don Schanke."
Hi.
Thanks.
"Monica, if you don't mind me asking, what was your..."
Addiction?
Yeah.
I do mind.
"I was hoping she'd say ""balding married men."""

"Yeah, Nick Knight."
"I'm either in bed or incommunicado, so if you want to leave your name and number, go ahead."
SCHANKE:
"Hey, Nick, got any bad habits?"
Do you know who is in the car?
I heard you.
But I can't do anything.
OK?
It's not far to the terminal.
You can walk there.

"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight?"
!
A bunch of kids from school are gonna go see it again!
What's High School Musical 3?
"You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2."
What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
There's not even condiments on his bologna sandwich!
- Just leave me alone!
You little shi...
"Are you okay, Felix?"
"I mean, fucking crying, the big fucking girl!"
"You fucking crybaby doll, get off my fucking fanny!"
That was intense.
- You are such a bastard.
- And your point is?
"Yeah, walk away like a little girl."
"Cheers, geeze."
Yeah.
So how was Christmas?
Pretty boring.
It's good to be out and about again.
- You didn't come to McGinty's.
"- No, I couldn't make it."
- Okay.
- How was it?
Gemma was there.
So?
- I'm just saying is all.
"- You know she chucked me, right?"
"Yeah, I heard."
I am kinda kicking myself.
She was one sweet shag.
And they said romance was dead.
But it was all that bloody Felix's fault
"Right, but that was months ago."
- You sure it's such a big deal?
"- Yeah, it was to her."
"Said she'd seen the real me, blah-fucking-blah."
"I tell you what, I wouldn't mind landing another couple of punches on that twitchy little face of his."
Have you had a nice day?
"Oh, what's this ***"
"Thank you, Nana."
It's so good to be here with you.
This place is so so acceptable.
Aha!
I got it.
I got the job!
We can definitely move out.
"Yeah, I know."
"I know, I was pretty speechless myself at first, but then I thought ""Hey, come on!"
"You know this was just a matter of time."""
I am...
a manager.
Right.
"Well, this is calls for a celebration."
Let's see.
"Would you like a go, Samuel?"
"No, ma-maybe not go too mad."
So we're going to have to throw ourselves into the house hunting.
"You'll be good at that, eh, Becky?"
"Well, not too far away I hope."
"We'll still be seeing you, won't we?"
Yeah.
"I mean yeah, of course."
You'll come to Sunday lunch?
Yeah.
"Yeah, when we can."
Alright.
I've not been on Facebook for four and a half months.
It is time for a status update methinks.
"Won't be strange, dear?"
-I remember that.
There was a serious conversation about kicking Zayn out of the band.
"Oh, my God."
Imagine.
NiaII would have to be the mysterious one.
I don't know.
I think if I wasn't in One Direction right now I would be working in a factory or being a fireman.
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.
Why did you wanna be a fireman?
I don't know.
I liked the idea of saving someone.
What about the factory?
"well, that's just because me dad worked there."
would you have not considered opening your own bakery?
I was a great baker.
Fish!
Yes!
-Yeah!
-bloody hell!
Fish!
Fish!
Fish!
"The little sprinter, face on the floor."
hen we're on tour  they're still normal boys that lik e playing games.
That's the wrong way!
"Won't stop me, eh?"
am their dad on the road.
e have a very good working relationship.
he only issue have is they're all a pain in the ass.
"Nothing to see here, sir!"
hey're pranksters.
I am a parrot of the sea.
A puffin that is no longer the sea.
Do not.
"-Bravo, Loving brought us a strange bird, and told us it was a penguin."
Bravo.
"Thanks, I deserved."
"Sorry people, I'm sorry."
But when I lost my hometown.
I was very lonely and very scared.
"Then I met you, and you believed in me."
Sven ...
It was so good have a family.
Thank you.
And that goes up to heaven.
"Folks, let's try this."
"Come on, everybody together."
Fuck you!
[screams] [groans in pain]
You know now?
"Dad, listen to me."
"Dad, give me a second, would you?"
Please!
I'm doing it all now because you're not focused.
My guys have Angel.
There's nothing to worry about there.
You got to focus.
You have to focus!
He cut my face.
What the fuck you want me to do?
"You're standing in front of a mirror, aren't ya?"
"You didn't have to come here, Dad."
I can take care of this.
-Take them.
"Wunderbar, heh."
"Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife but, heh, there is a piano teacher in the village--"
And how about 200 cigarettes for yourself?
Two hundred cigarettes!
What is it you want from me?
- Who's the guy?
-What guy?
The one you work with.
- How do you do it?
-I don't want those.
"- Oh, yes, you do."
I'll make it 400.
-No!
No!
No!
"Listen, Schulz, you'd better talk because"
I'm gonna find out with you or without you.
I won't let go for a second.
They'll have to kill me to stop me!
So talk!
Talk what?
"No, I don't know anything."
"How many do you want, 1000?"
- Here.
Take them!
Take them!
"-No, no, no!"
When the Geneva man comes through the barracks I do not want you to complain to him because I have orders from the kommandant to report everyone who complains.
Look at him.
Dunbar's being crucified and he's trading again.
Didn't you get enough?
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.
- Ha.!
- Five hundred.
Nope.
Not interested.
"I'll give you $1,000!"
That's a fabulous price to pay for a dog.
I could get a team of six for that.
What do you expect you'd do with him if I let you have him?
Give myself the exquisite pleasure of putting a bullet through his head.
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
"No, thanks."
"I'm sorry I can't contribute to your fun, mister."
Boo!
"What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?"
"Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?"
"Hello, Sam!"
How are you?
Glad to see you.
"Sam, this is Shorty."
- Hello.
"- Ah, yes!"
Just seen the argument you had with that fellow back there.
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
"- No, no."
The dog doesn't like him either.
"Look, Sam, how you fixed?"
"Uh, pretty nearly flat."
"But anyhow, I got enough to ask you gentlemens to join me in a drink."
"- Bourbon, straight!"
- Ditto!
You look delightful as you are.
At least let me change my hat.
And I'll just put these in water.
Of course.
Thank you.
I can't remember the last time I was in such a fancy place.
"Neither can I, Mrs McCarthy."
"Bridget, please."
Thank you.
I'm very glad you changed your mind.
"Now, I hear the Dover sole is particularly nice."
"Ah, Sid."
Father.
Bon appetit.
"Well, I wouldn't want Mrs M's flan going to waste, what with her being otherwise engaged, you know."
Oh!
How lovely.
"""If I had a flower for every time I thought of you,"
"""I could walk through my garden forever."""
"Quite the poet, old George."
No.
That's Tennyson.
"Oh, dear."
What?
I fear Mrs McCarthy is having lunch with a murderer.
You're kidding.
Let's just pray she's careful what she says.
"All I know is, a man named Max murdered a girl called Vera."
"Well, anyway, that's what this Iris woman told Henry."
George?
Are you all right?
Yes.
This is not an internet cafe.
I must get some rest and relax.
Doctor's orders.
No turning back.
Are these all the patterns you have?
"Whatever the pattern, they all float the same."
But they aren't pretty.
Fun.
Yoon!
Hella entertaining.
"What's next, doc?"
I didn't bring a computer with me.
I'm sorry.
"The next time you call, I'll definitely do it for you."
Please give me a call.
Okay.
How do people just lie around and do nothing?
Doing nothing is totally useless.
"Dear Goddess Tubtim, even though I'm picky about my jobs lately,"
I still want some jobs to come in.
Holy shit!
I didn't even finish yet.
Je give it to me.
"Hello Yoon, please come in to get the brief."
Sure!
The photo looks too cheap.
"Wedding photos are supposed to look more fancy, right?"
"I want more classic, and hi class."
I'm not doing it.
Say what?
You get back from the beach and you're indie now?
Why now?
Get some sleep.
Then you'll feel better.
"- Asger, can't you stay a while?"
- It's Saturday.
"Business, you know."
Just for a while.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
The burn goes from my forehead down across the cheek.
I had three operations in Holland.
"It won't get any better, they say."
They took skin from my leg and put it on my face.
But my looks are of no importance.
"They are to others, but not to me."
I don't care if people stare at me.
"I'm not the same anymore, and I never will be."
It happened in the Pacific.
There was an explosion and a fire.
Many were killed.
My best friend was a ship's cook.
He died.
The Filipinos couldn't swim.
They died.
I didn't die.
I don't like to talk about it.
"I dived for as long as I could, but finally I had to get some air."
The half you don't need.
What's the matter?
You look like you haven't slept in a month.
I'm alright!
"I just found it easy when it was every night, at least you know what's coming."
"Well, never having known the joys of married love myself."
The bombing!
Ah!
I thought perhaps it was the long treks with the husband in the provinces.
Not really...it's difficult you know.
The trains.
Oh!
What is...?
What's that?
"It's France, uncle Frank!"
It's Hitler!
Bloody what!
?
Meeting now with Mr.Swain.
We were about to issue this shooting script.
They want all of you.
"Oh, no!"
Oh!
Don't worry.
With all that studded buried.
It will be some Rear Admiral than lather with the wind speed.
Wrong for the day in question.
Ah...when did I mention.
It's at Whitehall.
The Ministry of War.
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."
"For he today that sheds his blood with me, shall be my brother."
"Actually, I'm not sure what they do."
They just sort of gormegan from sale to sale.
"- Excuse me, Antoinette?"
- Bob.
No.
I'm Jocelyn.
"- No, you need a bob."
"- Everybody, there's been a tragedy."
Chi Chi Chemise's fainted.
- Messages?
"- No, let's go take at that."
"- ""C'est quis pas""?"
"- Perspective, Vogue just came out."
There's an article on it just like we'll have on our next issue.
- Of course there's been a leak.
- Another leak?
Can you believe it?
It's the third issue in a row this's happened.
That is no coincidence.
There must be Yuri.
"- What's a ""Yuri""?"
"- A spy, you idiot... like Mata Hari, James Bond..."
When was the last time she ate?
"She had an apple 2 days ago, she should be fine."
Just the trauma from the article?
Maybe we should take her shoes off or something.
"Oh, my God!"
- Where are my shoes?
- Here.
We should get out of here.
"Many years of pointing, you know... ballet."
"- Oh, my God!"
Just a thought.
I think it's time you take this to a higher power.
You got nothing to say?
Nope.
All good.
Father Bardini says he hasn't seen you in months.
So much for the seal of confession.
That's only inside the box.
Good to know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
You had your reasons.
I didn't want you in the middle.
"Oh, honey, when it comes to you kids and your father,"
I'm always in the middle.
How bad is it gonna be?
Do you remember the time you and Stevie painted Richie purple?
"Oh, damn it!"
You didn't ask his advice.
You joined Internal Affairs.
And don't swear in the Lord's house.
I didn't think I had to ask his permission.
How long have you known your father?
It was my decision.
Do you want him to forgive you or not?
For becoming a detective?
For living my life?
Sorry.
What do I do?
Bake him a cake.
Chocolate.
A cake?
Seriously?
So you are.
Okay.
But I'm going to talk to her then.
"Danny, I could run away."
"After my party, I mean."
Maybe to San Francisco.
If you want to.
If I want to?
"Oh, little one, I'd run off to Anywhereland with you."
But I don't have any money.
That's easy.
I can't really have any of my money until they say I'm ready for it or something.
But I can get tickets on a plane.
I can charge them.
"After we're gone, she'll never know where to look for us."
"All right, Danny?"
"""All right, Danny?"""
"All right, Merle."
Who needs money?
"Anywhereland, here we come."
"No, silly."
I meant San Francisco.
I knew what you meant.
[chattering]
"Wait here for me, Corbett."
I'll only be a minute.
"Whatever you say, Miss."
[no audible dialogue]
Your conduct is absolutely disgraceful.
"If there is one thing I can't stand, it's a sneak."
Who told you?
"That's quite beside the point, Merle."
"Or did your father send you to detain us, while he flees to Russia?"
- Ha ha!
It was a joke!
Put that thing away!
Where is my father?
I could go take a look.
It's best if we all go together.
"No, we're all staying here!"
I've been preparing this evening for weeks.
"- I won't allow you to ruin my event, just because you've gone crazy."
- What do you want?
Just tell me exactly what it is!
What?
Yes!
What!
?
To go to Sweden.
To Sweden?
He wants to go to Sweden.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
Give Bulle a call.
He drives up there tonight.
He could pick him up.
"And get Angie, she can take over from here."
You will allow me to let someone take over.
I have to take care of my bar.
Tell me...
Couldn't we break off the pieces and move them?
We can't.
That's how the world champions would do it.
Fine then.
The knight goes from G5 to E6.
Where?
"Bakunin, vitamins comrades."
"Che Guevara, The Bolivian Diary. """
"Works by Maurice Thorez, imperishable ..."
"""The young Marx, the miseries of the philosophy"" ..."
I only know this.
Fred Astaire!
"Woody Allen, I do not know."
"""Gone-with-wind,"" Mickey, ce l'ho!"
"Come on, it burns."
"Come on, come on!"
"I was there, the tree."
"I was 11 years,"
I stewed over the tribunal.
"I needed to see her,"
Sunday in a much me in you not enough!
You have not even had his bags and that the unfortunate My father did not want more!
He even.
This was his misfortune!
"And she was wrapped with those hogs to live their money, of coca, their shit!"
"Mamma, mamma!"
I did the same.
Their they gave me to eat;
"I was clothed, beaten, but I have not soiled."
"I am like you, as you are!"
"Mamma, mamma!"
Now that I'm re ... and that the queen is the queen ...
Regina!
"Impossible, you know, is French!"
I do not ever marry you!
The finish is mine.
I need this money!
Chris makes me happy.
That's it.
I'm not taking it.
Okay.
All right.
"Nice, y'all!"
That's the way!
That's the way!
Good teamwork!
You all need to call it!
"Watch that hole in the center, okay?"
You all need to pick that up.
"Hey, time out!"
Time out.
"It's looking great, girls."
They're double blocking me every time.
That's okay.
"No, they've figured out our move."
"No, they did not."
"Now, don't you act like this is luck."
This is not luck.
You all are doing a great job.
We are kind of lucky 'cause their star hitter's out sick.
TAMl:
"No, you all are playing a great game."
You're playing a great game.
I want you to keep it up.
"I want you to keep it simple and remember, you are playing this game and you are winning this game because of your teamwork."
You are a team.
You work together.
"And you, you just focus on that Riggins."
You slam it down his throat.
- Here.
"- God, that stinks."
"Yeah, but it's gonna keep your face from swelling up like a pumpkin."
Hold it.
Here.
Hold it on there.
"So, whatcha gonna do ?"
It's payback time.
Either you down or you not.
Either you my boy or you ain't.
Simple as that.
"Oh, ha !"
"Hey, baby, we lit it up out there."
I am serious.
"Did you see us, ""D"" man ?"
Do you see us ?
We're talking.
Anyway.
"Hey, baby, we lit it up."
"- Oh, man, come on, man !"
"- That shit ain't funny, man."
- You damn right it ain't funny.
- l thought you liked it down there.
"That's your specialty, ain't it ?"
Crawling on the floor like a bitch.
That was a reflex action in the heat ofthe moment.
You're just plain rude and wrong to bring that shit up in mixed company.
- l'm gonna go home.
Are you ready ?
"- No, he's not ready."
He's talking to me.
"It's an ""A"" and ""B"" conversation."
Two suns... no seasons.
It's a constant temperature.
-Are there any oceans?
-There is one.
"Our water's of a different consistency, different color, it contains all the nutrients that we require."
There is no need for food.
"Though we're at war, we will live in a safe zone."
Our child will be shielded from the dangers coming near.
Time is different there.
your lifespan will be three times what it is here on Earth.
-Really?
-We're free of all diseases and all the illnesses.
-It's starting to sound like paradise.
"-With you there, it will be."
-Get out of the vehicle now!
"Cross your legs, put your hands on your head."
Cross your legs!
-Chayton!
Chayton!
Robert...
"Robert, can you hear me?"
"Robert, are you there?"
-Jaelen.
-I'm speaking to you with my thoughts.
-Where are you?
-They have me in captivity.
And Robert... they killed Chayton.
There was nothing I could do.
I'm inside the base.
I'm where I need to be.
-Yeah.
"Yeah, it's me."
"You go to Sanchun with Jaesa, Mugol and Mukguh."
(Sanchun)
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
(Magok)
See what's going on.
"Yes, sir."
Commander.
Oi.
What's going on?
Okjuh soldiers are gathering young men to wipe out the pirates.
Then the pirates will be well-hidden.
We've got our work cut out.
Let's go into town for now.
OK.
Stop there!
Let's go.
Aren't they Sachooldo's Jega?
They wouldn't be here unless it's something important.
I heard Prince Daeso summoned them.
Prime Minister.
Do you have any idea what it's about?
How have you been?
I heard you're doing a good job in place of the late Maga.
Thank you.
I trust you will all help Puyo overcome this crisis.
We will serve you with all our heart.
Thank you.
I'll give you a chance to do just that.
I've summoned you all here to tell you to prepare for a war.
A war?
What war?
- Ah!
Treat this with care.
It's loaded with live crabs.
Shh.
I told 'em I was taking 'em to the circus.
Why'd you take your footlocker?
What's a beach party without beach?
[ Chuckling ]
- ?
[ Lively ] - [ All Chattering ]
What a terrific idea!
These crabs are delicious.
Sure are.
And the best part's right here... inside the little first baseman's mitt.
You two are lucky Klinger came through... or you'd be skinny-dipping in that kettle.
"Oh, you're right."
Underestimating Klinger's become a national pastime.
"Thank you, sirs."
Hate to eat and run.
But I've got to pack for three days... and a fun-filled trip in Seoul.
"Okay, I've had some fresh air."
Can we go back now?
"No, not quite yet."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"What are we doing here, Doctor?"
I don't want a drink.
Good.
Because you're not gonna get one.
What the hell is this all about?
"Please, David."
- I'm sure you've heard of these.
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
It's like Jake with Chinatown.
Anybody named Beers would be sick to death of a joke like that.
That guy acted like he never heard it before.
"In strictly legal terms, Tony, someone having no sense of humor won't get you probable cause."
"Until we hear back from McGee, that's cause enough for me."
Mind if I get Abby in the loop?
Do it.
Beers.
Beers.
"Hey, Beers."
"Hey, come here, Beers."
Beers Palmer.
Huh?
That's different.
Do you want your kid to like you?
Anything on the air marshal?
Whoa.
You know about this guy?
"McGee's got the name, you got the picture-- what's the big secret?"
I think that Bishop and Tony didn't want you to know that they blew his cover.
And why did I just tell you that?
- And why do you know that?
"- Because he's very, very nosy."
"So far, no hits on facial recognition."
"Abby, hey..."
Whoa.
Boss.
McGee?
"He knows, Tim."
I talk too much.
That your guy's info?
Come here.
- What's going on?
A meeting to appoint a new principal.
- How do you know it'll be Ms. Thornton?
- Nobody else deserves it.
I'll drop by the store after school.
"Goodbye, Dad."
I wish you'd stop that ridiculous performance every day.
What?
Saying goodbye or hello to my father?
Saying it to a photograph.
"I suppose it's silly, but it makes me feel that he's here."
You scarcely knew him.
It's not my fault he died when I was two.
"I can't remember him, I admit, but I miss him."
"You mean, you miss a father."
"Yes, Mother."
"Wouldn't it be nice if you had men friends, or dates, or even marry again?"
"Stop talking about fathers, husbands and marriage."
You miss him more than I ever realized.
"I'm sorry, Mother."
I'll be late.
Forgot the speech.
"- Goodbye, Mom."
- Bye.
"- Good morning, Ms. Lancie."
"- Good Morning, Allison."
"Hi, David."
"- Good morning, Mr. Herman."
"- Morning, Miss Allison."
"Go on home, Buffy."
"- Hi, Dr. Swain."
"- Morning, Allison."
"[Carlos] Oh, Federico."
You're not Buffy La Caza Vampiros!
[loud pounding]
You're the Tlacamelli Teplani.
The Peacekeeper.
"Yeah, that's what people keep tellin' me."
[grunting]
[Carlos] Gonzalez...
- ... you are a man of justice.
- [groans]
"[Carlos] Yeah, a man like you understands."
"Oh, you understand that this santa sangre could keep culebras from preying on innocents."
You understand what that means?
"Less exposure for us, and more peace for you."
I'm starting to think peace is overrated.
I'm starving.
Why couldn't we stop to feed?
Because we are here for a higher purpose!
[shouting]
[Richie] What the hell is he up to?
I still don't feel right about this.
"You will, once you have the plans."
"Okay, remember, you just need to distract him while I switch out the cases."
I've got it.
"Okay, Richard?"
Relax.
[Eddie] So what is all this?
"I told you, I got about a hundred VHS tapes in here."
From Fellini to Capra.
- You want some or not?
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put 'em over there somewhere.
LEE:
"This is about the cartel case, I hope?"
Gotta go.
Bye.
Whoa.
I hope we didn't get her in trouble.
"Uh, not ""we,"" you."
It was just an e-mail.
"Anyway, it got us a lead, didn't it?"
"Yeah, and possibly Gregorio fired."
"I know how we all feel about Gregorio, but we gotta learn to work without her again, okay?"
Okay.
"Starting with figuring out how, exactly, Jared's connected to the bank robbery."
"Well, it may be what his father and girlfriend were hiding."
"I mean, Dana seemed really nervous."
Let's have another chat with them.
Only separately this time.
Looks like Sebastian's found something on the car.
I'll check it out.
Is he okay?
Don't know.
SEBASTIAN (grunts):
"Little help, please?"
"Ah, thank you."
"Man, I am sore."
"It's gotta be all that ab work I've been doing prepping for NCIS training, you know?"
Whoa.
"You care to turn that off, please?"
What?
"Oh, right."
Sorry.
So what about this beauty?
"That's not the point, Cookie."
"The point is, what do you do with him?"
"You tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him in some place else, like Stalag 16 or 15."
Or you kill him off and the Krauts kill off the whole barracks.
Every one of us.
"So, what do you do?"
Who is it?
"If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy or Security?"
Yeah.
Security.
What's keeping Hoffy?
- Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
-He'll be back.
They got no proof.
"Come on, boys."
Soft and sweet.
Beguile me.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.
"May I have this dance, miss?"
"Why, sure."
"Pinch me, darling."
"Pinch me, so I'll know I'm not dreaming."
"Thank you, darling."
I love you
I love you
Three words that are divine
"And now, my dear I'm waiting to hear"
The words that make you mine
Did anyone ever tell you you had the most beautiful legs in the world?
"Whatever you do, they will take him away."
"No, he won't go to the army."
He will go like the rest of us.
"No, he won't!"
Yourprecious son...
You're precious too.
How many letters in your name?
Five.
S
- E-V-G-I (LOVE)
"Come, rest now."
I thought I was getting a boy and he turned out to be a girl...
"Mom, pass me a beer."
Pick seven cards please.
"For you sweety, I'll pick 14."
What the hell are you doing here?
Ahhh!
I just came to have my fortune told.
Also to apologize forthat night...
Whatever.
Take your ass downstairs and get yourfortune told there.
"Once the cup is lifted, it has to be read."
"Yourfortune is dark, complicated."
Some guy is after you.
And also a foreign guy.
What's this constant money talk?
You end up dancing at a bar.
C'mon really?
I don't like dancing.
What exactly do you see?
"I see your mom's pussy, right here."
"Sorry, here is someone to see you."
Let me know when it is.
"- Bye, Parfitt."
- Mrs. Cole.
Shall we find the lady who'll do our makeup?
I suppose so.
It's coming over.
Mind your heads.
Cigarette?
That's it.
"Okay, line it up, please."
Line it up and keep it straight.
That's it.
I've never much seen the point in men.
"Still, I do hate to see you pining."
"Oh, I'm not pining."
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
It's just that...
"When we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm just in a sentimental mood.
My landlady was killed yesterday.
I could hear her husband crying through the wall all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
I was wondering.
"On page 76, I say..."
They're getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Could I...
Okay.
"Here... you can hold me if you want, mama."
"Oh, hell, no."
Try not to move.
"Can you pass me that, please?"
This?
Thank you.
What the fuck?
It is the fastest way.
Does it look good?
"You gonna look hot, mamita."
"Yo, wait till you see this place, E."
It's like an amusement park.
They got like a butcher shop in there.
They got a club in there.
"Yo, they got these like plush brand new seats, kid."
I don't even know how they play baseball in there.
It's like a hangout.
"What's up, bro?"

"Justin, you don't have to say or do anything you don't want to."
This is just going to take time for us all.
So what?
Dad made Holly a beneficiary of the land because of Rebecca?
I don't know.
But I suspect that's part of it.
- Did he know that he was her father?
It opens up the room.
It can breathe.
Does it get you money?
You want it?
"Here, I'll give you the fucking money."
"If you want more, you can go down and tear some off the wall."
No.
I don't want your money.
I don't need it.
But I do need a door.
So I could close it behind me.
I thought you'd like it.
I do like it.
In some way I do like it.
It's dreary.
Of course.
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you prisoners of starvation!"
"Forjustice thunders condemnation,"
It is the eruption of the end!
Is this what you were thinking?
"- Okay, that's enough!"
You'll sing for me.
I'm not finished yet.
You're still singing for me.
- I have to ask Franz first.
You need written permission?
I'll think about it.
Don't take so long.
He found some chicks that aren't too bad either.
They're taller than you too.
You done?
Go home.
Did I mention my development will double your property value?
"Nice try, kiddo."
- Hey.
- Hey.
Dad told me about the home.
That woman gives me the creeps.
She's like Darth Vader with lipstick.
She is with the dark side.
Clever we must be to defeat her.
"Oh, God."
Okay.
"So as was just clearly evidenced, your relative maturity level is about half mine most days."
"But seriously, if I have to say, ""No, we're just friends,"" one more time,"
I'm gonna totally drug you and dry shave your entire body.
- Wow!
"- Okay, maybe just your arms and legs."
Did you just ask me out?
"Okay, look, my dad is going to a Flyers game on Saturday."
"So, you know, he'll be gone most of the night."
You should come over.
Okay.
But I'm bringing Band-Aids and aloe vera just in case.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Later.
- Not sure we'll be able to stop the...
- Pass the sugar.
I know women.
- You already have too many shirts.
- Serious?
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
"Sorry, I was making a video for my son."
"You know, in case I never see him again."
Do you not do that for your kids?
Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
"You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now."
"Hey... hey, girls."
"It's me, Daddy."
"If you're seeing this, I'm dead."
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
"Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian."
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
"Yeah, yeah, lullaby time."
Look.
"Go to sleep, Daddy's dead"
But his ghost's always watching
What the hell are you guys doing?
Good call.
Blocking the door.
"Keep it up, smorty-pants."
- Oh...
- Uh...
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
What?
No.
Don't ask that.
Please.
Henry.
Keeping our business alive...
..that will be... keeping us alive.
Thank you.
You are the best thing... that ever happened... ..in my life.
"Oh, Henry."
Edie.
"""The stream will cease to flow."
"""The wind will cease to blow."
"""The clouds will cease to fleet."
"""The heart will cease to beat."
"""For all things must die."""
Henry chose hemlock.
He wanted to say a proper goodbye to Edie.
"Come on, Sid, we've got a competition to win for Edie."
The flower show!
I forgot all about that.
Lady Felicia?
"Yes, Mrs M?"
I was wondering if you might like one or two suggestions from me as to which flowers might catch Father Brown's eye?
I thought you wanted to win the trophy for yourself?
"Yes, well, I've had a change of heart."
Thank you.
The winner!
For Edie Lee.
The grower of the best flowers in the whole of the Cotswolds!
"And next Monday,"
I will be hiring Edie as the florist for the Websters' wedding.
I'm here to give a contract to a gangster.
This is...
This is the picture of my son.
His life's in danger.
You've to save me.
I am so unfortunate and helpless.
I had to see this day.
I had to request a goon to save my son.
But I didn't come empty-handed.
That's not all.
This is just the advance.
Satyakant Acharya Shashtri... will sell his home his land everything.
But he'll pay you your price.
Father.
Please come in.
I'm a simple decent and self-respecting man.
Visiting a gangster's house is... a sin for me.
"""What's the value of a father?"""
"""I could never know when I was close."""
"""Love your father."""
"""But could never say."""
"""Your father... means everything..."""
Father you dwell in my heart my mind my soul.
Every inch of my body except for one place.
My destiny.
"""All the Gods..."""
"""...dwell in you."""
What's this?
Just one bundle.
Trilok.
That's worth millions for your Boss.
Boss.
Mikhail.
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you thinking coming in here?
The key wasn't in the mailbox 'cause Darlene didn't show up tonight... so I don't get a break for another 20 minutes.
Here.
You might as well take it now.
You shouldn't have come!
You should've looked for the key later.
What's the matter?
You all right?
- Excuse me.
- Alex.
You probably gave half of those bent- nose guys up there a heart attack.
I'm surprised we weren't trampled on the way to the phone.
You better get outta here.
I'll see you soon as I get off.
Don't even think about going to sleep.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Just tell me.
Is everything going to be okay?
Get outta here!
You need to go back inside.
Lvan wants to talk to you.
We were family!
You betrayed us.
Enough.
Enough!
This is your lucky day.
Get in!
That was dynamite.
Any of those guys Alex Bohemia?
Good.
"You're like me, it's all in front."
Be thankful you don't have to struggle into a roll-on.
I am!
Have you given up answering that intercom?
I didn't hear it.
It didn't buzz.
"My wife says can you get this stitched for Hilary, she says it's the band on the inside."
Who's this?
My name's Baker.
Blackfriars Assurance.
"We're insured, so sayonara."
"No, I just popped in to see Miss Sutcliffe."
"Well, you can pop out."
She's busy.
Goodbye.
"Bye, Pauline."
These need doing.
"Give me a knock in ten, and we'll make a move."
So...
What?
Mr Tubby Baker.
Very nice.
Very gentlemanly.
He's a gentleman caller
Like in that play where she had the gammy leg and the glass animals.
Why did you give him the brush-off?
We have our site visits on a Tuesday.
I've heard that something very exciting is happening the day after Tuesday.
What?
Wednesday.
Get a bit of a romance going.
I'd have him.
As soon as his partner will lead to leave bags of money
Artie door opens and closes in a his colleague until he returns.

"Collect money every day Wednesday and Friday, promptly at 8:12 pm."
"Earns $ 110 per day GIS and wearing a pistol, caliber 9 mm."
"And soon, will be robbed."
"If you see any helicopter Swat or troops, put it."
"If you see any cross-timer, stop, pull the engine block and move on."
- Nobody should be hurt.
"- Yes, but the guards like to check."
"If you do not want to be injured for $ 10 per hour, not to stand in my way."
Let's go.
Do not move that one!
Everybody face the wall!
"Come on, move the up!"
Everybody face the wall!
-Give you the way!
You get away from your computer.
- You're dead!
"- No, no!"
"- Go, go!"
Come on!
- Down!
- No!
Wait a little!
- Down!
Down!
Now!
Face to the floor!
- Move that up!
B) Uluc's messenger will be on and I'll communicate with him through... a mobile device.
"Uluc will be like a telephone switchboard, giving me news about all of you."
C) Gamze and I don't have a phone with messenger.
How will we communicate?
By farting?
"Planning needs money, and we don't have that much."
What can we do?
"No, that can't be."
"If we're going to do this, let's do it right."
I'll take care of the phone business.
Super!
The operation will take 60 minutes.
Good luck everyone.
Everything is okay.
We can start.
"Guys, it's your turn."
What's going on?
- Hello?
Kaan?
"- Where are you, man?"
- I got cut off and can't connect.
"- Great, and I can't get in."
What happened?
What do you mean by what happened?
Yours is here.
I am talking about Professor Candan.
She is here.
What's she up to?
What's she doing?
I don't know.
She's playing the violin.
"Hold on, Mert is calling."
Executive decision.
Horses can eat a bunch of pudding.
My cousin from Chernobyl had a dog this size.
He had three legs.
"My cousin, not the dog."
Something good did come out of Chernobyl.
Excuse me?
How much do you charge for pictures with him?
"Oh, it depends."
How nude do you want him?
Ew.
We mean for our kids... with the horse.
"I don't think the ""ew"" was necessary."
You don't know what you're missing.
"I mean, we're just walking him for our friend."
We'll give you $10 each.
Sold to the woman who...
"""Doesn't"" wanna see me naked."
"Come on, 18!"
Which is also the title of my adult film debut.
"Mine would have been called,"
"""Might As Well, I'm 24."""
"Excuse me, Mr. Moustache?"
Could you stop feeling my ankle with your toes?
I guess that's a no.
"Oh, 18 winner."
We won!
I'm rich!
Now you have no shot with me.
"Stay close, sweet cakes."
You're good luck.
"Here, buddy."
Ayushman you're doing the wrong thing.
What are you doing?
I am doing my duty... and now I'm going to sc***wyou.
- Ayushman you...
- Hold on.
What?
What?
You...
You think Dimple's apart of my plan.
Is that what you think?
You are right.
She is part of my plan.
She sleeps with me every night.
So she can at least do this much Boss.
That reminds me...
Look... let's forget what you think.
Think about what your brother's dilemma... when he finds out.
Kurukshetra.
The Boss' land of destiny.
He's honored and respected here.
I'll get areal kick out of this.
When I'll defame your brother using you.
I'll humiliate you but he'll feel ashamed.
That's why they say...
People defame death.
Life... makes you suffer.
This is the second time I hit anyone.
And both the times it was you only you.
I was scared since the moment I learnt...
Shiv's going outwith you.
Now he's paying forit.
Behind bars.
It's past 7:00.
"Thanks for trying, guys, but there's no point anymore."
"Sorry, Steven."
"Sorry, Steven."
It wasn't meant to be.

It was too meant to be.

"My first day back, and it's already ruined."
I wonder who'll get my donut instead of me?
Probably peedee.
He'll be up for his morning jog.
Mr. Smiley will have the second donut.
Lars will embezzle one.
Ronaldo will buy one that he thinks is a mutant.
Onion'll buy one and take it for granted.
"And then mayor Dewey will order a dozen, and then a dozen-dozen for the whole town!"
And then a dozen-dozen-dozen for all the starving children in the world!
[ Cheering ]
But not for Steven.
"They'll say, ""where's Steven?"
"We saved a donut for him."""
But they won't see me because I'm in the sky.
"And then, they'll feed my donut to a dog."
And then I'll die.

"Alas, poor Steven!"
I knew him well.
Noooo!
Good friend of mine and I are going to India for a few months.
We're going on a yoga retreat.
ALEX:
I really genuinely love this person...
He had asked me to co-host this party  and I stayed after.
I was trying to help you out because there was this girl who would not leave...
- ... that tall girl.
- Right.
She was gross.
I was trying to...
She was...

- Who is it?
- It's Lily!
"- What do you want, Lily?"
"- Scarlet told me to tell you, three o'clock canceled."
"- Oh, fuck."
Does that mean I have an hour to myself now?
"- Yeah, I guess, but"
I've also got your mail.
"- Slide it under the door, Lily."
"- Hello, Cindy, just a minute."
"Honey, I know Paris Hilton is in the habit of carting around a dog, but what did I tell you about bringing that baby here?"
"- I'm sorry, sorry Scarlet, but I have to work..."
- This better be the last time.
M.
M.
"M, M, M, M, M."
Hi!
- Hi.
"Can you tell him, again, that I am trying to reach him?"
Of course.
Goodbye.
"Hey, thanks for meeting me here."
"Well, I thought we better speak face to face."
"Why, what is it?"
I checked the Brandeis account.
And?
"The Manovich money, the 30 million..."
It was in the account until a few days ago.
What do you mean?
It's gone.
Gone!
But that means that someone had to take it.
After Constantine died.
All of it?
Yes.
"If Constantine didn't take it, then..."
Christos!
He's the only one who had access to it.
What do you want to do?
I'm going to get some answers.
"Ok, cash or card?"
Cash.
Wouldn't want my husband to find out.
"No, those are going in the back."
You take all of those in the back.
"This is good, good, good."
I like all this.
"You know bushes, it's here is the important part."
"It's like, here,we want them, this is what they see, the rest is..."
Who looks back here?
Please follow me.
I swear with my sincerity.
"Sir, do you know the accused Ho Foon?"
No.
But he is like my concubine Yu-fa.
What?
You have had a son with your concubine?
"Yes, we have a son named Nim-sai."
But he is dead.
Why?
I don't know.
Why don't you know that?
We've lost each other for over 20 years.
Why did you say he's dead?
I saw his dead body.
How could you confirm that was your son?
From his ass.
Ass?
"Right,"
I saw a triangular birthmark on the body's ass.
That makes me believe that was my son's dead body.
"Sir, there are so many unexpected things happened on earth."
"For many things, you may not believe it."
"Foon, do you want me to teach you?"
Take off your pants!
Now!
Yes!
How about the one I saw?
"You just saw his ass, but not the face."
The birthmark may be drawn by someone.
It may be drawn by someone.
So you are my son?
"'Kay, come back soon."
Okay.
What's up ?
Don't you think the boys were acting weird ?
"The shifty looks, finishing each other's sentences like they're composing a lie on the spot ?"
Yes.
Totally normal for them.
"I don't know, I feel like they're hiding something."
"If it's not the location of Pancakes, I'm not interested."
"Oh, no."
He was in his cage.
He's gone !
"Oh, no."
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
"Okay, I didn't want to worry Taylor."
"She's pretty upset, and she's got this thing about blood."
Blood ?
Yeah.
"Don't freak, okay ?"
I-I-I need you to not freak.
Okay.
Why would I freak out ?
"It's not that bad, is it ?"
"Dude, it's bad."
"Seth, the hospital is, like, a mile away."
"I know, which is why I'm taking the secret back roads way that's only a half mile."
That was sarcasm.
I'm pretty sure my shortcut got us lost.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
"That was sarcasm, too."
Sorry.
Why can't you just accept that?
Shut up!
[Siren wailing]
[Garner] I'm calling backup.
"If anybody moves, we're in trouble."
We need a shooter.
We're here.
Your man wants everyone to hold their position.
We need a single rifle.
"I say again, all units, hold your position."
[Morgan] Copy that.
This is the street.
Hotch is going inside.
And he's on his own.
[Reid] Hotch won't do anything to spin him.
It's not Kaman I'm worried about.
This isn't his first time at the dance.
We gotta trust him on this.
"Kaman, why are you doing this?"
We never did anything to you.
You kept Tracy away from me.
"Look what you've done, what you're about to do now."
I wasn't always like this.
"People don't change, Kaman."
No.
This is all your fault.
"Baby, you can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you."
"[Gasps, whimpers]"
"Baby, look at me."
Look at me.
[Whimpering continues]
[Woman] Kaman.
Take care.
Paul.
"Thank you, Lester."
"J, London's great, but I'm missing the New York skyline."
I hope you're well.
Paul.
Fax this to Galliano's buttmaker's boyfriend stylist... in Monaco.
You freak!
- What are those for?
- We're doing a strain... on say gal shalls and Roxanne gave it 6 pages.
Come in.
- I have to talk to you.
- You want another raise?
"I don't get paid, I'm an intern."
I think I might know who the Yuri is.
Let's continue with the pedicure later.
Privacy.
Let's talk.
Delicious!
Good morning!
"Good morning, boys!"
"Good morning, good morning, good morning."
"Wow, are we silent!"
- Did somebody die here?
- Yeah.
Every dog has his day...
"It's obvious that, the way you two are dressed, you're not here..."
- to talk to me about fashion.
- I'm afraid we're not.
"Lieutenant Pathmark, you're under arrest for the insider trading... code 327B, for industrial espionage."
I always knew you were the Yuri.
You have the right to remain silent...
"No, no."
No way.
I'm not gonna be a factor in that decision.
You know that there's no way for us to have a normal relationship.
"- You can forget about it, right?"
- OK.
There is a personal cost when you run for president.
"But as far as we're concerned, there's no reason why you and I can't be a normal couple."
How?
"Well, uh, for starters, we could try and sleep in a little bit."
- Is that what normal couples do?
- Mm-hmm.
What about this?
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's normal."
- That cannot be good thing.
"- No, no."
It's gearing up.
- Just give it a few minutes.
"- Wow, Holly."
It sounds like it's in its final death throes.
"No, no."
That's impossible.
It's brand new.
No.
My condolences.
Maybe we better read the manual.
- OK.
- How's your Italian?
L.A. Sucks.
I spent one hour on the 110 and I missed breakfast with Caitlin.
"Sorry, I didn't realize you had a guest."
"please, sir."
I've got a feeling about this one.
"That's lovely, Kent."
But let me try to explain how this works.
"If you told me you'd found, say, a giant footprint..."
... I'dsendan expert to make a plaster cast of it.
Get me a photograph and I couId get some troops over there!
But you tell me you've got a feeling... ?
"AII right, fine."
You want evidence?
I'II get you evidence.
"And when I do, I'm gonna want a memo distributed."
That sounds swell.
I'll want that memo carbon-copied and redistributed--
Hi.
Thanks for the use of your phone.
"Thank you for the use of your phone, Mrs... ?"
Hughes.
Annie Hughes.
"And this is my son, Hogarth."
"Thank you, Annie."
Hobart.
That's Hogarth!
What an embarrassing name.
Might as well call him Zeppo.
What kind of a sick person would name a kid Hogar--?
Hog Hug.
Hogarth Hughes!
Kent MansIey.
You work for the government.
I wasn't gonna say that.
"I have something for you, Hogarth."
Edgar.
Heard you got deported.
"Yeah, did Mexico stick its finger down its throat and send you back?"
That's very funny.
It's a shame
Mitch isn't around to hear how witty you two are.
"Man, I know you're still pissed."
I should've told you that--
"Told me what, Edgar?"
That you're a selfish asshole with no regard for anyone or anything but your sorry-ass self?
No.
You shouldn't have told me.
I should've already fucking known.
"Hey, man."
"We don't all feel that way, Edgar."
"As a matter of fact, I got you new headshots-- a little welcome home present."
[crowd laughing in the theater]
What do you think?
"- [laughing] Oh, man."
- Fuck you!
"Come on, man, we're just fucking with you."
Man!
Prison has changed you.
Yeah.
Baby.
Eat.
They seemed so nice.
"Yeah, get used to it."
We're gonna be fine without him.
Even you said they were pretty big.
"Yeah, I say all kinds of things."
Why do some people get so much?
"It's a chicken, they're female."
Silly me.
What's that?
It's your surprise.
- We're having a party.
- What's the occasion?
"It's my son's birthday, and I want to celebrate it."
"OK, Naj, do the honours."
"Three, two, one..."
You'd better come.
There's a problem with the vaccine test.
"For God's sake, be careful."
- How long has he been like this?
- A few hours.
- I should have been told!
- BP is going through the roof.
Oedema presence.
"At first we thought the vaccine was working, but then he started showing symptoms of the virus."
His immune system has collapsed.
This is my fault.
We're losing him.
"Hold him, for God's sake."
"The risk of contamination is too great, there's nothing you can do."
"Come on, get out, all of you."
"You too, Sami."
I'm so sorry.
You do what you like.
I'm not leaving him to die on his own.
Cut my throat!
Drive!
Samantha Willis live here?
Abby Grant sent us.
All right.
If it's the truth.
It's all right.
She said... she had a dream she was pregnant.
I know this.
"Have you, um, have you seen the original?"
No.
It's in the National Galley.
"It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
"But, ah, I'm drawn to these images."
Why?
"Looking for reassurance, I suppose."
Have you found it?
No.
But I keep going back to look.
Just in case.
"So, um, what am I supposed to do about this Paul Fordyce?"
I'll let the police know and you should talk to them.
I can get them to pick you up from here if you like?
"Oh, no."
I'll be OK.
Silly boy.
I had a chat with the pathologist.
They're doing quite well.
What do you mean?
They're connecting you with three murders.
Don't get all hu_.
"It's the truth, isn't it?"
"We, or rather you, left a messier trail than I hoped we would."
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
"See, Karl takes care of all that."
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's...."
It's very remote.
"No, never mind."
Yeah.
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"Incidentally, um you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night."
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"Oh, I know, I realize but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"Well, when she's better, I'll ask her."
"-Yeah, couldn't hurt."
-Okay.
"Uh, in the meantime...."
That's okay.
"-I really hate to ask you this, but--"
-What?
"For my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
"Uh, where's a pencil?"
Right here.
- No.
"Well, how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female.
Ellia?
Get out of the way.
"No, please."
Don't shoot.
She's not what you think.
"She is my daughter,"
she means you no harm.
She's a wraith.
"Maybe so, but she's different."
I swear to you.
Let me guess-- wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
"Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you."
It's all right.
Father...
"No, I won't let them hurt you."
I raised her as my own.
"You live here, together?"
This was part of a mine before the last culling.
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
"Gee, I wonder why."
The villagers told us there was a wraith in the forest.
It came here in a crashed ship 10 years ago.
10 years ago?
- Got it.
"- Thanks, Mama."
I love it.
"- You""re welcome."
"- I told her it""s from both of us."
"- Oh, my."
- You need some scissors?
"No, I""ll get them."
You hate all men!
"- Cassie, honey."
"- Did you find anything, Mama?"
Did you find a tiny scrap of garbage to help make you feel better?
"Cassie, honey, I was gonna tell you that he checked out."
- You know your mama.
- Are you sure about that?
"I mean, maybe she missed something."
"Maybe she didn""t dig deep enough."
"Because there""s no way that Tim could love me for the rest of my life."
"- Cassie, honey, listen..."
- No.
"There""s no way that being married... could be the best thing that ever happens to me."
"And you know what, Mama, I""m going to be happy... even if it kills you."
Papa dead!
"Papa""s broken."
"Okay, here we go."
"Ladies and gentlemen, here we go."
No.
"J.T. Harris, ladies and gentlemen."
"The pressure""s on, sir, for you to be defending champion."
- Do you have any comment whatsoever?
- No.
"No, he doesn""t have any comment!"
Thank you so much for the hook-up.
"Hey, I ran into Todd, at Whitaker's, of course."
He told me you got a job working for the government.
Yeah!
"Yeah, President Bush and my dad were in the same fraternity."
"- Oh, that's right."
"- Oh, Jesus."
"Yeah, yeah, when he gave my dad that appointment at the Defense Department..."
- I became his right-hand man.
- Douche.
The President's supposed to be at our wedding...
- but you know how busy he is.
- Yeah.
"Sounds like an incredible job, man."
"Hey, you really got some major connections to the top."
"If you ever need anything, I'm your man."
"- Thank you so much, buddy."
- Anytime.
This guy's the best.
"- So, sweetheart, we should get going."
- Yes.
- Good to see you guys again.
- Congratulations again.
- Thank you.
"Take care, thank you."
- It's so nice.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Dude, I can't believe they're getting married."
We've only been broken up two years.
"I'm sorry, bro."
But we are going to Amsterdam.
"Come to think of it, that made me gag, too."
Okay.
Done.
[woman crying]
"Listen, crying in a women's dressing room?"
"Whoever it is, girl, big butts are in."
[crying continues]
That's Sophie's cry.
"I know, 'cause I hear it through the vent when she watches Nashville."
Sophie?
(Sophie) No.
Are you okay?
"(Sophie) It's not me, but I'm okay."
[sobbing continues]
"Sophie, why are you crying?"
When I heard what you said about the dresses...
It's just--
"It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something."
No.
Caroline thinks you have great taste.
She does?
"Well, then she should say so."
Now.
"Well, Sophie, I think you have your own unique style."
"And I think... that I didn't hear the words ""great"" or ""taste."""
"Sophie, what do you even care what I think?"
Just say it!
"Sophie, I think you have great taste."
You do?
[Sophie laughs]
"Then, what are we doing sitting here?"
Let's go and get those dresses back!
"Look,if I could provide you with the me from sevenrs ago,"
"I would say ""egg away,"" but it's been a while."
I'm a very different person.
Really?
"Dude,I was 26."
26-year-old women think they're the center of the universe.
I'm not...
I'm not like that anymore.
"I'm very,very different."
I'm more thougful and open and concerned about what's going on in other people's lives.
And you still have great timing.
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday to you #
"# Happy birthday,dear Johnny... #"
# Happy birthday to you #
# And many more. #
"Hey,that was fantastic."
It's Bella.
Um...
I'm at the shop.
I hope you're having a really nice party and a great birthday.
Okay.
Happy birthday.
Why aren't you at your party?
"Um,you sounded like you were choking when you called."
Thought I should come over and make sure you were all right.
You seem fine.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Happy birthday.
"So,you,uh... need some help?"
What are these?
Good idea.
"May we search your room, sir?"
But of course.
I trust my map to the street you asked for was satisfactory?
It was.
Thank you.
- Did I get any messages?
"- Oh, yes."
A telephone message.
Alex Bohemia.
Did he leave a number?
Thank you.
You heard that woman.
This Suverov must have been looking for me.
"A stranger with your exact face... and according to the passport, your exact birth date... comes here and asks for directions to the very street where you live."
"A mystery, yes?"
An airline ticket from Nice to New York... and a New York driver's license.
Some U.S. cash.
He was born five minutes after you.
I kept both of you for three months.
But I was sick.
I couldn't nurse.
There wasn't even enough for one of you.
I needed the money.
I had to do It.
Tell me now.
Why did you choose me?
I didn't!
I didn't have the courage.
Somebody else did it for me.
- Somebody else?
- A lawyer from Paris.
It's what marriage is all about.
I know.
I read it on the back of a matchbox.
"Basil, sometimes..."
"Seriously, Sybil, do you remember when we were first... manacled together?"
We used to laugh quite a lot.
"Yes, but not at the same time, Basil."
That's true.
"That was a warning, I guess."
"Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?"
"Zoom! ""What was that?"" ""That was your life, mate."""
"""Oh."
That was quick.
"Do I get another?"""
"""Sorry, mate, that's your lot."""
Basil.
Back to the world of dreams.
"Yes, dear?"
What are we going to do?
Give it another 15 years?
- About the money.
Do you...
"- Aw, she's left it in her room, or eaten it or something."
We'll get Manuel to go through the room.
Polly can check the lounge...
- I saw Polly with money just now.
"- Well, there you are."
"Quite a bit, too."
She was counting it in here.
"Well, it's probably hers."
"No, she's been very short lately."
I'll ask her...
Read me what I said yesterday.
"That's not exactly the idea, Mrs. Slocum."
It's a cross-examination.
That's where they catch you if you're lying.
Shh.
Fire away.
I'll answer your questions.
"Thank you, ma'am."
Let's start with de Mario.
De Mario?
Yes.
He says that he brought Mrs. Nash home at approximately 1:45 a.m.
"Now, does that check with you?"
Check.
Do you have anything further to say about this?
No.
"And he left immediately after with you in the car, right?"
Right.
What did he talk about on the way home?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
"Well, didn't he say anything when he dropped you off?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing!
"Well, he must've said something when he dropped you off, Mrs. Slocum."
"He said, ""Good night."""
"Now, look."
"De Mario has been unable to account for his time... from then until 4:00 a.m. Now, exactly what time did you get home?"
"They can't prove it, Lottie."
"Now, don't say another word until you see a lawyer."
Oh.
Me neither.
I like to keep off the grid.
(Door opens and closes)
(Crow cawing in distance)
Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it.
Does this really seem like a good idea?
"I mean, mom won't even let me make toast."
"Oh, come on now."
Put her in drive.
There you go.
Now give it a little gas.
I'm so nervous.
"Well, there's nothing to be nervous about."
"Worst-case scenario, we both die, and that's gonna happen at some point anyway."
(Engine rumbling)
(Tires screech)
Okay.
(Chuckles) I'm driving!
(Tires screech) (Whispers) Driving.
"Okay, now keep your eye on the road!"
"Jeez, I learned that lesson the hard way."
"Hey, this is kind of embarrassing, but, uh, could you give me your name one more time?"
Is it... (Vehicle approaches)
(Brakes squeal)
"Hey, dad."
We had the best day.
"Uncle Rusty took me out of school, and we ate ribs, and I bowled a 39."
"I learned that I do not like beer, though."
Oh. (Laughs) He did pretty well.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You don't mind do you?
-Recording your doing.
-Turn it off...now.
"If she doesn't want, she doesn't want."
Why?
nasty things this morning?
you know where they have the drugs?
How should I know?
Ask Jack.
Drugs?
"Don't be impatient, be cool."
"Brian was right, your roof is perfect."
This fucking city is really something.
What have you done to yourself now.
She can't hide it.
A chicken is a chicken.
Come on Jimmy.
You're both so beautiful and you look alike.
Be nice.
I'm not a chicken.
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry Jimmy!
I didn't know your scalp was so sensitive.
"Now don't get anything dirty, and tape the tags on the inside"
It's not necessary to cut them.
Where's the cocaine?
Dwayne?
"Would you fix us a few lines, darling?"
"Here, I've got some blow too, baby."
I'd like to ask you a few questions over your childhood.
"Come here, legs."
You've created a life for yourself and a totally new path.
It's wonderful.
"I wish you good luck, Michael, and hope you visit us soon."
- I will.
"- Goodbye, Michael."
"Boy, you really knocked it out of the park in there."
I quit.
Seriously?
- Oh!
How'd it go?
- Great.
I quit.
Can you give me a ride to the airport?
Sure.
- You quit?
- I'll get my things.
"I didn't get what you meant at first, about me being afraid of something else, but I get it now and I know what it is."
Did you plan all this?
involved...
"Well, there was a certain amount of planning"
"No, it was instinct."
He's good.
- He's like a brain detective.
- What was the epiphany?
I don't wanna say it till I know I'm right.
I guess this is the end.
Of?
Therapy.
"I mean, you got me where I needed to be."
You literally drove me there.
"Well, therapy's never really over, remember?"
"Well, not for me, maybe, but..."
-How you doing?
You all right?
"-Yeah, okay."
I....
I wanted to apologize.
"Oh, no, we finished with that sorry business already."
Sorry for getting you into this situation.
"No, you didn't get me into anything."
I got myself into whatever we got into.
-I was just curious about you.
"-And I, you."
You're the least likely person in the world for me.
-Are you insulting me now?
-No.
"No, not at all."
A compliment.
I think you helped me.
"Okay, a little positivity."
"Yeah, you helped open me up."
"Yeah, and I would've opened you up further if I had my way."
-That's disgusting.
"-No, not really."
It's honest.
-You should work on your manners.
-I know.
"I'm trying, believe me."
I wanna tell you something.
All right.
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
"I made mistakes, a lot of them, I know that."
I live with them every day.
The hardest thing I live with is knowing how much I've disappointed you.
- Philip!
"- Stay away from me, you murderous..."
"- Philip, no!"
- Tell him you did it for him.
I did it for you.
She was going to destroy you.
Have you fired.
"Your own daughter, that's how much you loved him."
My daughter.
"I killed her for, for you."
My savior.
My Siegfried.
Please don't leave me.
What would I want you for?
Look at you.
A mad cow.
Philip!
Phil...
Philip.
What's gonna happen to me?
"- Come on, Gillian."
- Who's gonna look after me?
It'll be the taxpayers of the state of New York who'll be taking care of her.
She's only got three years left to live.
"You're not gonna throw the book at her, are you?"
I'm sure she'll be receptive to a plea that lands her in the Bedford prison hospital.
You think any of those tears are for her daughter?
"Yeah, me neither."
"Um, did I not mention to you my new philosophy?"
Of saying yes.
Does that mean you want me to...
Love you but I got to go.
I know pizza-boyfriend beats omelet-daddy every time.
Thank you.
Yes!
[Singing to the tune of William Tell Overture]
-She's got her guy
"-Her best friend, too."
-Her life seems great
-That can't be true.
We've still got lots more show to do.
Wash your hands to prevent the flu.
[Horse neighing]
What?
It rhymes.
And it's a good message for the kids.
[Continues singing] You'll never guess what happens next.
It twists and turns and gets complex.
"It's fun, it's sad, it's something new."
-My legs are sore
"-My butt is, too."
[Groans in pain]
Stop bouncing so much.
[Humming]
[Singing] My Barefoot Cinderella.
"Got my Jesse and a pizza yeah, life's a breeze."
Gonna get a deep dish with extra cheese.
Oh. [Chuckles]
Twelve-hundred miles and you still look like you just drove off the lot.
How do you do it?
"Pretty much getting everything you want, aren't you?"
Yes I...
"-Pretty freaky, isn't it?"
"So, Elliott tells me you never saw the bullet coming, and that you were getting ready to paint."
"So, let's just say you were involved in a plot to blackmail the Secretary of the Navy."
"You with me, Larr?"
Is brightening up the den really the top of your priority list?
I'm pretty sure that Larr-bear here wasn't involved.
I think he just knew something that someone didn't want him telling us.
(whispers):
She's phenomenal.
But can she make assumptions like this?
"She just did, Duck."
(phone rings)
"Yeah, Abbs."
In my lab.
I'm on my way.

Impressive.

That's an Unidentified Submerged Object.
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Samantha...
Ryan.
I know.
"So, what am I thinking?"
You're thinking I can't possibly know what you're thinking.
You're good.
Abby.
I order you!
I order you!
You broke it!
You broke my sword!
"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane."
You dare to defy me!
You've got a lot to learn about everything.
I'll fix you!
You cheated!
You haven't played the game right.
I'll show you!
[ Woman's Voice ] Trelane!
No!
No!
You said I could have this planet.
[ Man's Voice ] This has gone far enough.
But you always stop me when I'm having fun.
You're disobedient and cruel.
We've told you before.
"Time to come in now, Trelane."
"I don't want to come in, and I won't."
"I'm a general, and I won't listen to you."
"Enough, Trelane."
Come along.
But why?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just playing.
We said come along.
But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.
This is not studying them.
"If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them."
"Aw, but I was winning."
- [sighs] wayne.
you take care.
[engine turns over]
"- see, you could wear that to the sizzler or the prom."
that is gorgeous.
- it's growing on me.
- [sighs] okay.
- i wanted to thank you for what you did for tim.
"it pains to say this, but i've never seen him look happier."
- so is this some sort of an apology?
"- well, look, i'm sorry, too."
so...
"- uh, uh. baby steps."
- [chuckling] i agree.
[spits]
- [spits]
"- is everything okay, ladies?"
- yes.
- ah!
i knew it!
[all chuckling]
"- so, bob, i was thinking about a christmas gift for you."
"- oh, no."
this is all the gift i need.
"- since mama handed me this store, and she's your mama, too, why don't we become partners?"
- oh.
i-i don't think that would be such a good idea.
"- um... you know, it might not be a bad idea."
"look, there is -- there's a line outside the door."
"- but we can talk about that, but not today."
today is christmas.
"- well, merry christmas, you two."
Stop.
Stop!
Why did you save me?
You're like my father.
But such obsession.
You forced me to sit in the car.
Otherwise I would've shown you more.
Here's an advice.
Listen carefully and follow it.
Live larger than life.
Laugh more than you can cry.
Forgo your anger.
And finish your enemies with a smile.
Get it?
There's a rage in my heart too.
They killed 10 of my men.
I'll kill 20.
But... look at the boiling point of my mind.
It's still zero!
- Name.
- I want to forget mine.
Who I am where from everything.
Still I would like to know.
You can have a little faith in the Big Boss.
What do you say Boss?
And this way Big Boss made that boy... heir to his world and his heart.
And gave that nameless boy name... that fitted his stature.
BOSS!

You're still reading 15 year old news about your son.
You know very well Raghunath.
Let's welcome up to the...
She needs no introduction.
Vanessa from the Boogie Down!
(Cheers and applause)
Show 'em how it's done.
I'm trying something a little bit different.
I am standing right here.
Tucked in the mess of my own fear.
Far from fine.
In your eyes I seem to fall farther and faster
Than you have time to catch me.
From a boy balanced on his shoulders
Who can take on the stars.
Where were you from bedtime to dawn?
"Tucking me in, instead of ducking out."
Where are your arms when I just need them
To wrap around and hold me?
"I am standing right here, just as you left me."
I am begging right here for you to see me.
I will try and I will try.
I'll try to be whoever you need me.
See me.
(Cheering and applauding)
"Right there in front of your fucking boy,"
I don't give a shit.
Papa!
Vente.
Ven aca.
Vamanos.
Where we going?
We're going for a little ride.
(Woman) Entra.
- You have pain anywhere else?
"- Scale of 1-10, how's your pain?"
- Forty.
- How you feel?
- Talk to the elephant on my chest.
- It could-
- Excuse me.
You mind?
- What are your names?
- I'm Pete and he's Derek.
Can you take Pete and Derek to the TV room.
"One, Pratt!"
"Okay, here."
Come on.
Is there any way that we can wait in the doctors' lounge?
As soon as you' re a doctor.
"- Tombstones in two, three and F."
- Better with the spray under your tongue?
No.
"What do you mean by ""tombstones? """
It's a non-medical way of describing the line tracings on an EKG.
"It's not good news, Mr. Royston."
It looks like you' re having a heart attack.
- Aspirin?
- Already gave him 80.
"Push five of Metoprolol, titrate morphine, start heparin and nitro drips."
- Call Cards and cath lab.
- What's going on?
What's he gonna do?
There's a blocked vessel.
We open it with a balloon to stop your attack.
We need your permission.
Ritzy.
- I really don't want to wear a corsage.
- They're all paid for.
- Really.
It's too much.
- Your mother wants you to pick one.
"- Really, it's okay."
She'll just come back here herself.
"- This one, thanks."
- Good choice.
The cameraman said that would look best on film.
- So you're the rich girl.
- Maybe.
I'm not rich... but my parents have money.
But I'm totally self-sufficient.
I take nothing from them except this corsage and my daughter's tuition.
"So, are you gonna stone me?"
I should've guessed.
Look at her friends.
They're wearing suits that drip money.
"Hey, pal, this was 30% off."
That's why you didn't want to get pizza 'cause it's below you?
"No, Liza."
Pizza is not below me.
I love pizza.
I eat tons of pizza.
It's one of my four major food groups.
"Candy, popcorn, and pizza."
See.
It's two of my food groups.
That's how much I love pizza.
I want to believe you.
"No, I'm fine."
I'm fine.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
"OK, but we could really use your help with the new mosque, and we were hoping that you'd changed your mind."
Yeah.
It's just that I can't do something I don't believe in.
"Well, you obviously haven't totally lost your faith,"
- You're eating turkey bacon.
- The thing is...
- Ah!
Spit it out!
Spit it out!
- What?
You have lots.
It's not turkey bacon.
Sorry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
[ sigh ]
That's wine.
Kidding!
[ sigh ]
Stupid answering machine!
"Where are you, Charles Thorne?"
"Guess who had bacon this morning, real bacon?"
- I did.
"- No, I did."
I've finally took that last step away from my old life.
"Sarah, I love you, but your religious crisis is getting in the way of my real crisis."
"Well, then I guess you don't want half my BLT."
"Hell, yeah!"
Less dork... more pork.
This one looks more like a prison than a mosque.
"[Cell Phone Ringing] There are more things in heaven and earth, Danny."

Uh-huh.
Okay.
"Uh, yeah, we'll be right up, sir."
"That was the Burkes, at the new Montecito residences."
The new owners of Monica's condo?
Yeah.
They say it's haunted.

Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Cleanliness, people."
You can never be too sure.
"Word on the street there's a new inspector at the health department, and he's wicked hard-core."
You won't impress my showbiz friends.
I'd be impressed if you had any friends.
"Right, that's it."
Your invitation's withdrawn.
Go away.
"Oh, go on, daughter, do me a favour."
Where's your sense of humour?
- Only a bijou jokette.
"- Oh, joke, oh."
Of course I'll impress your friends.
We'll make a bona little team.
The financial artiste.
The theatrical artiste.
And the piss artist.
It's going to be a truly magical evening.
"Blimey, those candles burned down fast."
"Oh, keep it to yourself, Eddie."
Much time has passed.
I'm swathed in melancholic pathos.
- Oo-er.
"- Shut up, Eddie."
"I think you've been stood up, Richie."
Oo-er.
"Oh, shut up, Eddie."
After all I've done.
"A show in a peepshow, robbed a supermarket, been to prison and the rotters haven't even turned up."

Oo-er.

Eight o'clock.
"Look, I've got 'em here."
"Tarby's, Brucie's, Lynchy's and..."

"High time, where've you been, Duke?"
"It didn't work, did it."
Elisa doesn't want me.
What did you think?
I told you so.
Save me!
"Help me, gracious witch!"
"Stop moaning, she's not the only Elisa around."
I said I'd choose a Lady for your palace myself.
Get up.
"My, you're heavy."
I wonder are you worthy of her?
"Call me Elisa, I don't mind."
What?
You?
Never!
No?
That's all right.
I can be the mistress here without you around.
You and your precious servant'll clean the place all day and every day for 100 years.
And I want everything to shine and sparkle!
That's what I get for my my tragic love!
"I know everything, move and fast or I'll turn you into six ugly green dwarfs."
No.
"Your Grace, you too?"
You're as heavy as a sack of grouts!
Come quickly!
"They'll haunt the castle at nights, they don't know yet!"
- But this is our...

They locked it up!
B.N.:
May 15.
May 15.
It's the date of the train robbery.
The gold bars.
B.N. is for is Barbey Nanteuil.
Mr F?
There is no date.
That I do not see.
Thomery: during May.
During May...
"It is rather late May, because he was assassinated on the 30th."
Farewell!
Mr F.
"For god's sake, Fantômas wants to murder me?"
"Yes, but there is no date after your initials, then Fantomas has perhaps considered that your death was not essential."
It's still frightens me.
I thought you loved the danger?
"The danger, yes, but executions, no!"
"And finally, Bank:"
May 31.
And we are at May 31.
Of course it's the Barbey-Nanteuil bank.
Their deposit safes are in danger and also their lives.
He will act before midnight.
How do we play?
"I stay behind the scenes, you come into the scene."
Fantomas?
Please...
"The people need dreams or nightmares, but not us."
It is nonetheless true we are in danger.
"Gentlemen, would you offer me hospitality until tomorrow?"
- but i wouldn't have asked him to fix it.
- you didn't need to ask.
- and tim -- [sighs]
- tim looked up to harley and couldn't say no.

"tim dropped the gun, and it went off."
"- well, what happened?"
- tim died the first night in the county jail.
they cooked his food in peanut oil.
- ohh.
"- [chuckling] well, hey."
aren't you gonna make a crack about that?
"i mean, typical, right?"
he's such a little wussy.
"he couldn't even make it through one night at the clink, and it wasn't 'cause he was shanked, either."
it's 'cause of a peanut allergy.
"[chuckling] i mean, what a lame-ass, right?"
- it's not funny!

"I'm calling you Matthew Perry, you Matthew Perry-Iooking bitch!"
"No, there's nobody here who is Matthew Perry."
No one!
What is going on here?
"Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks that I have illegal narcotics on me... because I'm a minority."
This is textbook racial profiling... and I'd be more than happy to call the ACLU or the government--
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Sorry for the inconvenience, sir."
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it.
"Thanks, Matt Perry."
"Why does everything have to become a huge argument with you, man?"
"'Cause this is America, dude... and as long as I have my freedom of speech, no one's gonna shut me up."

Roldy?
- Vanessa.
"- Oh, my God!"
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you. l--
- Hi.
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
"God, it's been forever."
What are you guys doing?
We're actually on our way to Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.
"Well, you guys haven't changed."
You have.
You look amazing.
That's all right.
Please stop this.
Please just come home.
"I have to do this, honey."
"No, you don't."
They have to pay for what they did to Kevin.
And when it's over..
I promise..
I promise you'll understand.
You're doing this for Kevin?
I swear to God.
Then you do whatever it takes.
You make them pay for what they did to our boy.
What the hell are you doing?
"Walker, you stop this.."
or I'll make sure she spends the rest of her life in a federal prison.
You have 19 minutes.
You're done.
General.
Your boss took the White House..
and your man inside got the president killed.
"Carol, calm down."
You're free to go.
Thank God for Gerald Ford.
Why?
He built this because he didn't want the press to see him in his swim trunks.
Any chance this leads out of here?
No.
"Listen, I gotta stop for a second."
What?
You all right?
"That's not good, is it?"
I'm gonna miss that happy fat.
But you are a lot sexier this way.
"You know, I lost 10 pounds."
"Bob, you weigh exactly what you weighed on our wedding night."
- Right.
- Ah.
Where are you going?
"Oh, I'll be back... in 45 minutes."
- [Rings]
- Hello?
- 120 over 80.
"- Okay, Bob."
That oughta do it.
Good.
How's everything look?
"Everything seems fine: solids, liquids, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, E.K.G."
"Actually, it is one of the most boring physicals I have ever given."
"Now, you might be a couple of pounds overweight... but at least... we know where it is."
- [Giggles]
"- Are you, uh"
- Are you saying I'm fat?
Fat?
No.
Let's just say you're a little short for your weight.
"I mean, I think you're in pretty good shape for a 49-year-old man."
"I'm, uh-I'm 41."
"Bob, your chart says... 49."
"Well, I'm"
"- I'm definitely 41, at least I will be this Thursday."
Then why does your chart say 49?
"Oh, that's"
"Oh, gosh."
"- You""re not having a good week."
- Try a good year.
"- You don""t have to get that."
"- That""s all right."
- That was my lunch.
"- L""ll buy you lunch."
"You must think I""m always this pathetic."
"Looks like you""re trying to do everything by yourself."
You could use help.
"Yeah, mental help."
Does our medical cover that:
Commitment to a psych ward?
"Lt""s okay to ask for help, Lisa."
"It just means you""re human, that""s all."
"You""re human."
"Morning, Dr. Harris."
- Those things will kill you.
- So they say.
Smile.
Big smile.
"Oh, my goodness, you are so clean."
You smell good.

"David, I need you."
Come here.
Come here and hold me.
"He's a genius, right?"
And you're his partner.

- What's your name?
- Natalie Teeger.
"Ms. Teeger,"
"I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
- No!
"- Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night, and"
"I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on Tv?
I think you're a natural.
"- No, I don't think so."
- Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
Felt like felt like fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
He just asked me to be the new Lotto girl.
Only for one night.
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
- I think it sounds like fun.
"- I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is... wednesday.
- We already made plans.
- What plans?
"You know, a car is like a man."
It needs to rest and restore itself.
It's given up the ghost.
It's overheating.
Can it be mended?
"Yes, it will work again."
Don't ask so many questions or I'll give up the ghost too... at this altitude.
I've forgotten my book.
- What?
- l've forgotten my book.
"Don't worry, the others will bring it."
I have exams.
They'll be coming up to join us soon.
I have to study.
I'll tell them to bring it.
I have to study to have a good grade.
What a pest...
"Ali, bring him up the book."
Where is it?
On top of the dashboard.
People always come this way?
"No, there are several different paths."
It's a tough one.
This isn't the main path.
Where is it?
It's a long way off.
This path is shorter.
- ls that why we've taken it?
- Yes.
"Wait, why are you going so fast?"
It was the best way!
That's what you want.
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"All right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
(VEHICLES APPROACHING) Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.

- The battery runs down.
"Now, what sort of a reduction are you going to give me on this room?"
- 60% if you turn it on.
- What?
My wife handles all such matters.
I'm sure she will be delighted to discuss it with you.
I shall speak to her after lunch.
"You heard that all right, didn't you?"
- What?
- Thank you so much.
Lunch will be served at half past 12:00.
Manuel!
Manuel!
Are you going to the betting shop today?
- What?
"- Oh, don't you start!"
You go betting shop today?
"Oh, sí!"
"Betting shop, sí!"
"Now, I want you to put this on this little horse,"
"Dragonfly, but... big secret."
Sybil no know.
"No, no, it's lovely."
It's just a bit buttery with my skin.
"I think I need something more... more... topazy, for my coloring, you know, more tonal."
Have you got...
have you got Cosmopolitan there?
"Page 42, you see Burt Reynolds?"
"Well, there's a girl standing behind him looking at James Caan."
That sort of color.
Mm.
Lovely.
"Now you form up here, put fire down on them."
They're coming and I'm going to meet them.
Captain Goree.
Come on!
"General, what are your orders, sir?"
What do you want me to do?
Where do you want me to go?
"You've got to pull back, General."
"Pull back, sir."
Place the guns.
Bring up the guns!
God!
"How are you, T.J.?"
"I'm tolerable, sir."
They aren't coming.
Too bad.
"Yes, sir."
General.
I'll tell you plain.
There are times when you worry me.
No good trying to get yourself killed.
The Lord will come for you in his own good time.
"What are the orders, sir?"
"Prepare for defense, but the Yankees aren't coming."
"Come on, boys."
I have the figures from Pickett's command.
General Armistead is missing.
"General Garnett, missing and figured to be dead, sir."
"General Kemper is down, seriously wounded."
"Sir, of the 13 colonels in Pickett's division, seven are dead and six are wounded."
No more.
You tell me the rest later.
There's no one else here.
You must be talking to me.
"Well, that was an antique."
Crap!
"Oh, yeah."
So good.
"Oh, that explains his mysterious trip to Holland."
And I had the greatest time.
"Mr. Burns's house has everything-- a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors and a bottomless pit."
"a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors and a bottomless pit."
- It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
- For all intents and purposes.
Hey!
"Mom, Bart's throwing peas!"
"Bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
Ow!
That was a big one!
"- Homer, say something."
- Okay.
"Lisa, quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas."

Meat loaf.
My most hated of all loafs.
[ Gasps ] That was the end piece!
That's it!
Being abusive to your family is one thing... but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog!
- Go to your room!
- No!
This family stinks!
Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side.
It's just a riot!
"And what's that, Nina?"
Do you smoke?
!
- Drop it now!
"- Come on, mama!"
- Give it to me!
"- Stop it, mama!"
I know what I'm doing!
"Here, you may have it!"
Did I give birth to you for you to smoke that filth?
"Will you shut up, please?"
"- Nina, hurry, the telephone!"
- What do you care?
- Maybe it's for me?
- Who can call you?
Perhaps there's someone.
"Stop it, you've just arrived."
Hello?
- Do you have a rag?
"- I'll do it later, mom."
I'm listening.
Are you going to play the silent game?
"Well, as you wish."
He wouldn't answer?
"No, he wouldn't answer."
"Nina, I see Stasik is still into his snags, making sculptures."
Good for him.
"- Remember Kolia, the Pioneer leader?"
"- Yes, I do."
"I just finished packing, was about to go to the station, and here he comes carrying all kinds of roots and knolls and some weird stumps."
"Here, Aunt Marusya, take them to your son-in-law."
"If you don't understand, I'm not going to explain."
- More?
- Why not?
Your father said to give you a big sendoff.
"Rodney, will I ever see you again?"
Can I compete with those Boston girls?
What are your qualifications?
- Can't you guess?
- Seeing is believing.
I think you're 10 percent man and 90 percent talk.
You're 100 percent woman.
Two hundred and fifty percent woman.
Maybe 500.
Going to take more than money to keep me.
Know what you're doing to my temperature?
- Let's cool it off and go for a swim.
- But we didn't bring any bathing suits.
"- You all ready, Norman?"
- Yeah.
Forgot my cap.
What did you say?
"Norman, you're making me blush all over."
I'm sorry.
Let's go in swimming.
What did you whistle for?
"I saw a fellow and a girl swimming, without a stitch on."
- Where?
- They're gone now.
They got out of the water and ran into the woods.
- Naked?
- Naked.
It was Allison MacKenzie and Norman Page.
Got a head start out of the territory.
I guess he knew you were coming.
[YATES GRUNTlNG ]
"I'm gonna find him, wherever he is."
I think you'll find this room delightful.
"It has a lovely view down Main Street, just as you requested."
I call it the presidential suite.
The very best appointments.
I'm expecting new linens from the capital soon.
ELl JOE:
"Oh, this is gonna do just fine."
"Well, you enjoy your stay, now."
ELl JOE:
Mm.

Take him inside.
MAN:
Don't push.
-l hear you're going after Eli Joe.
"-Yes, we are, ma'am."
-How long will you be gone?
-However long it takes.
"Way we figure, Eli Joe is just a day ahead of us."
Where to first?
-What's this all about?
-Thought you could use some help.
I'm much obliged.
But my business with this man is mine and mine alone.
"Got no argument there. lt's just, it's awful big country out there, is all."
"He's on 6 grams a day, and he has a crazy idea of becoming a tattooist."

"Go away, for fuck's sake!"
Get off!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Strange dogs.
The police was there!
You told me there'd be no police.
No police at all.
"- How should I know, honey?"
"- You don't know shit, man."
Asger?
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
- Do you love me?
- Why the fuck do you ask me that?
It can't be that difficult.
"Do you love me, or..."
Shut up!
Right...
"No, she made it."
"No, she brought the CDs home."
And the washing machine.
They got Lars' stuff.
That's good for our business.
- We'll need some more soon.
- I don't feel well...
- Probably just your nerves.
"- No, I'm really..."
I really feel bad.
There...
Then do.
I'd like that.
Maybe we can catch a movie some time.
"Audrey, it's Pacey. lf you're there, could you please pick up the phone?"
Audrey?
Please?
"Audrey, come on."
-Hey.
-Hey.
How long have you--?
How long have you been here?
A while.
How was the movie?
Fun. inspiring.
-Completely unexpected.
-Lucky you.
How's studying?
Not good.
I only have a couple of hours left.
Here.
Maybe this will help.
Do you mind if I just sit here a little while?
"You know, if you need anything, I can--"
Sure.
Thank you.
Very sweet.
Much needed.
"I gotta tell you, Dawson it's like the entire world has been coming at me tonight."
"Like, completely distracting me from what I've spent my entire life preparing for. I mean it's like this night has been a metaphor for the whole semester."
One big left turn.
"Not that it's been bad because it hasn't, but it's just if I don't get myself back on track, I could--"
Dawson?
"My company keeps a suite here all year round, in case of emergency."
Keeps a suite here?
"Pretty big outfit, huh?"
TUBBY:
"Yeah, it's his outfit-- Rutlege Cotton Mills."
-Cotton mills?
-Yeah.
"Well, hey, Tubb, you can shack up with me here."
You don't have to rent a room.
"Well, I got my own apartment right around the corner on Park Avenue."
-Park Avenue?
-Yeah.
Where else would a Park Avenue doctor live?
-Doctor?
-Yeah.
"Why, this poor soul couldn't open a can of rations without cutting his finger."
"Doctor, huh?"
Good boy.

"You know, Bilk, it takes a lot of angling and finagling to make a success of yourself in the world today."

How'd you find out I was a master?
You can't just sit here.
Hello.

Yeah.

Chayton.
This is Otto Bernhardt.
Listen...
"Well, there's a fellow here in my office, and he refuses to leave."
"In fact, he refuses to even talk."
I suspect that he's here on your behalf.
"Actually, he's there for you, to help you make sure nothing happens to my money."
"Yeah, but that's... that's... that's really not necessary."
"I'll see you in the morning after my case is dropped, when I come to get what's mine."
Whew.
That's better.
Good to get out of those church clothes.
"I tried cleaning this up, but he about bit my head off."
"That's what marriage is, mostly... putting up with each other's shit."

You expecting anyone?
I am.
- [knocking] - [door opens]
- I'm sorry to interrupt...
- Hi.
"... but, uh, this gentleman says he's here to see you."
Ah.
Dr. Barrett.
You met my grandson?
Just now.
"Yeah, if you need me,"
- I'll be in my room.
"Listen to me, there's no cash with me."
They took the bag with them when they¡ª
"Asshole, I saw them leave."
No bag.
Get it.Now.
Ok.
"We have security cameras in here, you know."
You don't got shit.
"You're running an illegal joint under the table and off the books, asshole."
- Nice and easy.
- Ok.
"Ok, take the money out of the bag."
Put it down so I can see it.
And you're gonna put it back in.
Very slowly.
"If you play your cards right,"
"I'm going to leave quietly, and you're not going to tell anybody about this, because reporting a robbery of unreported income would be insane."
As would doing anything other than what I just told you.
Right.
- How much of this should--
- Just keep it coming.
Putting it right here.
Nice.
Shit.
Just take the money.
Can you hear me?
Hey.
Hey.

"You want to be a hero, asshole?"
You want to be a goddamn hero?

- Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.

"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.

Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity and prove everybody wrong.
- What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"- The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said your eye is weird."
This eye?
"It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
Where is Liz?
Liz!
Get down!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
- Is Liz back yet?
- No.
Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
- I'm sorry?
- Which cat?
"Oh, well, you know."
"Hey, if, uh, the mountain won't come to Muhammad-"
"Hey, Danny, look."
"As your accountant and as your friend,"
I sort of feel I have some kind of fiduciary obligation to advise you-
I know.
You want me to sell my dad's house.
I will.
"Hey, every month you don't,"
- you're incurring a wholly unnecessary tax liability.
- I get it.
- You like that?
"- Yeah, I get it."
Yeah?
What about this?
What if I put you in touch with a broker?
"I'd love to chat, Stan, but I gotta go home and get some sleep."
Good.
"Then you can be fresh for my poker game tonight, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
Hey.
Hey.
An accountant that works out of a topless pool.
Nice.
He's bugging me about selling my dad's house.
How much you say he bought the place for?
"He bought the land for 16,000 and built the house himself."
"16,000?"
Yeah.
You know how much it's worth?
A million and a half.
Excuse me.
Come on.
We got to catch those three.
They might make trouble.
"You're not going, commodore."
For $10 million?
Don't be a jackass.
Headed toward the ferry.
"Boys, you grab a horsecar, cab, anything."
Get over to the ferry!
I'll take bessie.
Giddap!
Heaven preserve us!
There you are.
"Stay there, now."
Yah!
"Hey, move!"
Clear the road!
The colonel's in there!
"Come on, boys!"
Take it away!
You scoundrels!
I'll run you down if i have to crawl in every rat hole in jersey!
"Good-bye, commodore!"
The colonel is sorry he couldn't wait to receive you.
"And you take good care of bessie, cornele."
I'll pay you for the oats when i get back.
I thought you were going to jersey city with jim.
So did i.
Is he all right?
I hope so.
Would you think me rude if i wondered why you've come here?
Jim got a fool idea somebody was going to try to annoy you- look at you sideways or something.
"Oh, my books, they're coming loose."
"Say, that ain't a bad-looking doll, that one in the middle."
- The one with the pretzel legs.
"- He means you, Laury."
"- Why, the fresh..."
"- Don't be so smart-alecky, Rocky Sullivan."
- Go on.
"Beat it, pigtails."
"- Trying to show off, ain't you?"
"- Scram, before I wipe the street with you."
- You better wipe your nose first.
- Is that so?
I'll fix you.
- You better scram.
You know the Rocky.
- Come on.
"- Leave me alone, I can handle him."
Wait till I get down there.
I'll fix you.
- I'll slap you down.
- Oh!
"Why, you, you..."
Shut up.
Come on.
"Let's get out of here, dig up some corn."
"You won't get away with that, Rocky."
I'll get even someday.
You just wait.
"Say, maybe this winter we can hop a freight to Florida."
"They say you can go swimming there, even in January."
"Sure, we can even hop one to California if we wanted to."
"Look here, ""Rubelin Coal Company, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."""
I survived 37 hours of Gestapo interrogation.
That wasn't luck.
- Don't make the same mistake twice.
- What mistake?
Treating me differently.
Compromising our objective because of what you feel.
- Feel?
- For me?
You have no idea.
"Sister Miri, thank you"
- for all your help.
- I want to come with you.
I'm not a nun.
Mother's been sheltering me here for a month while those pigs are out there.
My father taught me to hunt.
To be proud.
He'd be ashamed to see me now... hiding.
"Please, let me hunt with you."
You've got two more bottles of whisky to get through before midnight.
- That is an order.
"- Yes, sir!"
Nice work.
"You got him, Tom."
He's not on board with the Fuhrer's policies.
But he is a patriot.
"Loves Germany, loyal to his brothers-in-arms."
Dreams of victory.
I'm surprised you're considering him.
He's a good kid.
You never know.
- We could get him working for us.
"- He's about your son's age, isn't he?"
We work in this store.
"Yeah, I've been working in this mall since '97."
- Yeah.
- Back when the big and the tall stores
- were still segregated.
- Pre-merger.
- Yeah.
- I'm Jen... and I'm the store manager.
"Anyway, do you have a girlfriend, Irving?"
How do you know my name?
"Well, there's a... a reason I'm the manager."
You know what I'm saying?
"Anyway, girlfriend?"
Yes?
No?
"If you do have a girlfriend, everything in the store is half off."
I thought I had a girlfriend.
- Ah.
"- She didn't ""like"""
his Instagram of him surfing.
My boy got dropped!
- Ball tap!
- Oh... (whispers):
Ball tap...
"Hey, well, did you ever think of maybe just, like, talking to her?"
"Like, asking her why she didn't ""like"" the photo?"
"All right, who are you guys?"
Do you even work here?
"Three-time manager of the year, right here."
"Yeah, I've won a lot of awards."
"Okay, then how come every guy who works here has his shirt off but you?"
What's up?
"I'd rather not, to be honest."
Give it to me.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Thank you.
"Now, you, my palm, your arse, now."
Move it!
"I'll eat you alive, I'm telling you."
"Oh, bull's-eye."
Me tooth!
He's knocked out me hurty tooth!
"Well, I couldn't say no."
Ptolemy made me an absurdly generous offer.
What about that puppy you were carrying around?
"Oh, I put him down - in every sense."
That little dirt dispenser shat all over my mosaic.
"And Rambo, was he put down?"
Sadly not.
"He's now managing the family vineyard, which sounds like a monumentally stupid idea to me, but there you go."
Hm...and how about us?
Are there still jobs for us here?
"Oh, yes."
I've got some 'big jobs' for you.
Quick game of spongebucket?
"Yeah, go on, then."

"You're the first to journey all the way back, to get another chance."
I know you.
- I'll untie him myself.
"- Yes, that's right."
"Only one hand, that's all I need at you."
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
"- I'll take all day, if you order me around."
"I owe you one, anyway."
"Mate, look at your back."
- Never mind that.
Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
"I'm sorry, mate."
The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him.
It's our only chance.
"He's sacred, so they won't shoot us."
"Why, you hairless dog."
"Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy..."
"A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant."
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
"- Why don't you enlist, mate?"
Lash.
"For a beginning, this is not bad."
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
Both of you.
We don't want anyone injured.
Put down your weapons.
"Until the captain says otherwise, I give the orders on this bridge."
Go back to the ship.
You have to come with us.
Captain!
"Shh, it's all right."
Contact the captain.
Belay that.
"I gave you a direct order, Ensign."
"I'm sorry, Major."
"It's over, Major!"
Take him to his quarters.
"Aye, sir."
It's Commander Tucker.
Put him through.
Go ahead.
We've got the captain.
What's going on up there?
The bridge is secure.
Tell Phlox to get the Imaging Chamber ready.
We've got a patient for him.
"Acting Captain's Starlog, We've resumed our course for Azati Prime."
Major Hayes and his men have been temporarily relieved of duty.
Dr. Phlox believes he's found an explanation for the captain's behavior.
Where is he?
"In his quarters, resting."
Do you recall when the captain was attacked by one of the eggs?
It sprayed something in his face.
Mmm.
I thought it was a defense reflex.
"Would Elisa roast it, just for me?"
If you catch one.
"Come, come here..."
Got you at last!
I caught it!
Help!
I'll show him yet!
"I'm only little, but I'm nifty, see."
"Jean, I discovered something awful!"
We'll write to daddy about your new tooth!
He'll be amazed at you.
When he comes back.
"My little turtle-dove, if it weren't for you..."
So that's the way it is!
That pigeon must be done away with!
Where am I?
What is this?
What have I done to deserve this?
A sword!
"You ugly bird, there..."
I'll get you yet!
Damned bird!
"We'll wring your neck, no more love-notes!"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Hello, my little devil, have you seen my pigeon?"
"No, let's hope a fox didn't get it!"
Beast!
"I was frightened, where've you been?"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Did you sleep well, Johann?"
"How else, under one roof with a lovely woman!"
For you I'd sleep on a bare rock!
"I'm telling you, Joe pulled a gun on Patsy."
"A guy like him, self-defense?"
Not a chance.
"- If you killed him, you're out of luck."
- But I didn't kill him.
You're okay.
Better dive in somewhere till you find out for sure.
You gotta get out of the state.
"Mike, find a hideout."
Quick.
For what?
You've got that much head start.
Keep in touch with the hospital.
"When he goes, you start going."
Laying down on me?
You gonna cover me?
Not if he passes out.
"He's living, I can cover you."
Newspapers won't print a word.
They won't look for you.
If he goes-
"- Patsy, I don't have to kid you."
"--you're all washed up, you're through."
"Listen, get across the state line."
Get in touch with Nasetti.
He'll help you find a safe place.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Take your hats off.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
Doesn't seem like Sunday without Patsy around.
"Head to the south, See what I can find."
"Yeah, copy that."
Didn't see once piece of gold In that hole.
Am I headed In the right direction?
You need to turn right.
Turn right.
Look where he is.
He's way out there.
He's on his own.
I don't know.
It's looking like.
"All the right materials, Nice heavy material,"
But there ain't Anything here.
Now I'm starting to get Worried.
I can't see over here.
100 miles East of nome.
At the bluff...
Shawn pomrenke's Pump motor has run out of gas.
"And within seconds, mr."
Gold Will be out of air.
Here he comes.
We ran out of gas.
Umbilical's All twisted up.
Oof.
Out of breath.
That was a lot Of hard work that time.
When Just doesn't go right.
"When things are breaking And there's no gold,"
It gets stressful.
"As soon as that pump died, I could tell the air pressure."
Was dropping And I was losing air.
It was off.
"For the traditional, parents flanking their graduate child."
- Don't they look proud?
- They do.
Very proud.
What is that?
It's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation.
What was your high school graduation like?
"It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are."
"Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed."
Drank Boone's Farm out of a bota bag and knocked a beach ball around?
I don't understand half of what you say.
That's why we work.
- Hello.
"- Hey, Lor, how you doing?"
Christopher.
I'm good.
I'm excited.
You should be.
It's a big day.
Did you get my present?
- What present?
- A basket.
You should've gotten it by now.
- Did a basket come for me?
- It came.
It was heavy.
"I felt a twinge, so I dropped it for health reasons."
It's probably still intact.
My cracked staff has just informed me of its arrival.
I'm going to find it.
I put it together myself.
- And it's all for me?
[baby babbling on speaker]
[Betty muttering on speaker]
"When Cassie shows up, remember, all you have to do is believe."
And don't limit yourself to what you can see.
You know?
"I mean, we can't see the air."
- Hmm.
- Does that make the air less fucking real?
No.
- What page?
- 16.
"Jesus Christ, you're a slow reader."
Yeah.
"Oh, here we go."
"[Cassie] Oh, hey, ""kiss and run."""
"P.S., uh, I lied, those were my balls."
You're welcome.
Hello.
- [groans] - [chuckles]
"Uh, look um, fuck it."
I'm not gonna apologize for kissing you.
"I did what I did, and..."
that's that.
So.
[inhales] Yep.
- [sighs] - [chuckles]
"Ahh, well, that's way too long of a pause."
"I've overplayed my hand, haven't I?"
"Look, despite almost losing a tooth on impact, the kiss was nice."
You running away was fucking weird.
"Yeah, I think I used up, uh, all my adrenaline on the kiss, and I...had to hide in the men's room until closing to recharge."
[both laughing]
The sooner the better.
Oh.
I'll have him sent down here.
SKEETS:
"Yes, Mrs. Brendan?"
"Skeets, would you have Wilbur Hoolick sent to my office, please?"
Wilbur will be delighted to see you.
He'll be surprised to see me.
Gee!
"""Majuba diamond murderer."
"Police baffled."""
(MAN WHISTLING)
Wilbur's the killer!
"Boy, these straight razors sure do the job, boy."
"You know somethin', Mike?"
I want to thank you.
"You've been very, very helpful to me, and believe me when I tell you, I ain't gonna forget you."
You won't?
No.
"(STUTTERING) Well, I mean, I'd just as soon you would."
"What do you mean, pal?"
"We've been buddies, we're friends."
What do you mean forget you?
"And the gang back home, they'll love you."
But I'm too young to be with a gang.
"Yeah, maybe you're right, kid."
"Yeah, well, maybe we'll give you a few years."
"Wait, Willy."
Wait just a minute!
I won't tell on you.
Please!
"Please, don't kill me!"
Whatever.
We're probably gonna get arrested.
What do you want me to put?
Like how I said it.
"""I'll poop in your butt hole... and then you will poop it back... into my butt... and we will keep doing it""-"
- Back-
- Back-
- And forth-
- And forth-
With the same poop.
Same poop.
Forever.
"Wow, look at these beds!"
You don't have to make the beds.
I'll make 'em when I get home from work.
Where'd you learn to make corners like that?
It's just the way we like it.
Really?
"I thought you preferred the rumpled, unkempt look."
- We like it this way now.
- Yeah.
"At Mom's house, we have a chore wheel."
- What?
- Nothing.
A chore wheel.
"You put chores on it, and then you can spin it."
There's this metal thing... and it helps it to spin.
It's spinning from the metal.
Okay.
"Well- So, it's just a half shift."
"I'll be back in four hours, and we'll go do something fun, okay?"
Okay.
And since when ?
"Well, here's the kicker."
She disappeared 5 years ago.
5 years ?
Jesus-Christ !
"My brother went missing, too."
When he was 5 years old and... we've never seen him again.
It's hard on those that left behind.
you know.
"You've been missing for a really long time, Gemma."
Where have you been ?
Were you with someone ?
Did someone take you?
Were you hold against your will ?
You can tell me.
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
Were you held?
Can you tell me where you've been?
Not just me.
I'm not the only one.
There are more.
More?
I mean how many?
What are we supposed to do about that?
Tread carefully.
The last thing we want to do is to freak her out.
We'll do just one piece of information at a time.
"No, this is massive."
You know maybe Pru was right.
Maybe we need to get the cops in on this.
"- Tell Danny, at least."
Like you give a fuck.
- You never even asked me why.
- Because I don't care.
Think you're the only one who's ever screwed up?
"Well, boo-hoo-hoo, Tommy."
"Life sometimes sucks and that's that, but not all of us have so much self-pity we need to kill ourselves."
How the fuck would you know?
With your head stuck up your arse all day!
How the fuck would I know?
"'Cause I'm standing on a bridge in the middle of fuck knows where, covered in cow shit, fighting a fat, old Irishman dressed in a kimono."
And all because his daughter hates him and seems to quite like me.
Come on.
Budge up.
"Come on, now."
Come on.
Here.
For fuck's sake.
Hey!
Where are you going?
"Eh, Paul, wait!"
"Wait, you fucker."
Wait for me.
- You can forget about tomorrow.
- Good.
- Find some other poor fucker.
I won't be there.
- So?
- Fuck you!
"- No, fuck you!"
"Tommy, you're an arsehole."
Tommy?
"That's so childish, mate."
"- We were on the roof it was freezing, there was a helicopter flying around, and he was kind of shouting it at me."
"It's every girl's dream, right?"
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.
"Really, because, you know, he didn't mean it."
It just
- It was just something that happened.
I don't know.
"Hi, it's Abby."
What?
"Oh, my God."
Was anybody there?
"No, from the ER."
Okay.
I'll be right in.
- What's the matter?
- I
- I have to go.
"But come by the hospital later, and I'll give you a ride to the bus station."
Okay.
Or you could stay a few more days.
"No, I"
- I have to get back to work.
Be here waiting in case he shows up.
What if he shows up in Minnesota?
You're right.
Nothing confirmed.
Looks like you got multiple shooters on the loose.
- She's dropping her sats.
- Keep those people away from the building.
Can we talk to her now in case she can't later?
Setting up for multiple traumas.
"We have had an éclaircissement, and all kissed and made up and become friends."
Far better understanding of each other.
And everything's better?
Yes.
"Yeah, absolutely."
I'm really pleased.
"Yeah, so am I."
It's time for the Battle of Trafalgar to commence.
"Fought off the coast of Spain in 1805, it was Britain's most decisive sea victory."
Can we have the British team on this side?
"British, British..."
British.
And the French... give us all a laugh.
The battle is drawn.
"Say you're there, you can do that and then you get a shot."
"Okay, now we're going for the kill."
The French have a shot.
"Higher. further, further back."
"Down, a little down..."
"What, there?"
"Down, like that."
"Left higher, right arm down."
"""Left higher, right arm down."""
Excellent.
Wicked.
Good work!
Vive la France!
The English have lost two ships.
They've lost two ships.
"So, um, it looks like we're going to win, which is a problem, as we didn't..."
Damn Frenchies.
"""Damn Frenchies,"" sir?"
Truckers take them so they can stay up all night.
Truckers are so cool!
"Breaker, breaker one-nine."
"I got a Smokey on my tail, ten-four?"
"Hey-hey, that's pretty good."
I don't have time for your nonsense!
Let me try one of those.
(gulp)
MAN (distorted):
"I'm disappointed in you, C-Cup."
MAN 2:
"Thanks for keeping it warm for me, doughboy."
MAN 3:
Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland Brown!
CLEVELAND:
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
(echoing boom)
Wow!
"I'll take an ass-load of those pills, please."
"Donna, I need a change of clothes and then..."
Robert?
What are you doing here?
Eating turkey bacon.
"You've been gone for two days, and these children need a father."
I've been working for two days!
Feels like two hours with these pills.
I'm talking 'bout installing some cable!
Everybody watching' now!
"(gulps, giggles)"
"All right, then."
"Hey, Junior, it was fun speaking to your class."
Thanks for teaching us how to light a cigarette on the stove top.
After all.
I always have to tell you twice.
Now you're so nicely raised by your balls.
- What's that?
Why did you flinch?
- Please forgive me.
You lie before me like a pig hoisted by its balls.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I know."
I'll just wash our glasses and then come.
Bye.
Miss Russo.
Mi...
"Miss Russo, it's Danny Ferman."
You ca...
So that's it?
You don't need anything else from me besides my statement?
There isn't much to do until we get toxicology.
But I can tell you now it's gonna say smack.
Okay.
She was a witness on the Malcolm Miller case.
Usually kill 'em before they testify.
She lied on the stand.
- I've seen it a thousand times.
"They finally think they're clean, then something stresses them out."
Like the trial.
And they just have a little too much.
I'll call you when I get the tox.
"But I promise you, she OD'd."
What about the juror assault?
Any leads on that?
If the best they could come up with is...
Me.
False humility-check.
I'll be there.
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Nate and Blair.
I really want them to get to know you.
Terrific.
I'd be honored.
"Well, Rufus and I would love to come."
"Uh, why don't you grab a plate?"
Help yourself.
What?
He left when I was 2.
The man's a total stranger to me.
You have to at least give him a chance.
"No, I don't."
"Okay, everyone."
Let's sit down and enjoy this wonderful food.
"Dad, here."
Sit here.
"Rufus, scoot over, please."
Please.
Thank you.
"Hey, Blair, what's up?"
I thought I'd come and watch your lacrosse game.
"So if you could make sure that there's a seat for me in v.I.P.,"
"Preferably next to an injured cute player,"
But not one on scholarship.
Since when do you care about lacrosse?
Since I desperately needed to get away from N.Y.U.
Everyone's planning their living arrangements for next year.
Because you have access to the files.
"And as soon as you smell something, you're close."
"Oh well, at Pierre's to solve."
He was responsible for the dossier.
Do not tell him!
Why would not I?
Because it does not make sense.
Say 'll tell you whom I gave the pictures.
Who?
Thomas Riffautu.
Deek one for his client.
Sophie Mazerat?
He was with her in the car when they H. Rozier left the body in the woods?
"I gave you his name, It's already a great deal, right?"
Search Riffauta with two and one F.
Mighty police mind!

And i will maybe come visit.

Good luck.

"Its a great thrill, on behalf of Hydro."
- To be able to give the homefront four million krones (500k $)
"Norwegian Hydro kept producing and selling ""heavy water"" until 1988"
The company has today 13000 employees.
and a turnover of roughly 65 billion krones (8.5billion usd)
"Tronstad never returned to his wife and child.But got killed during operation ""Sunshine"""
"This Tv-series is based on a true story, but has been slightly alterated for simplifaction/drama The Hydro chief and his wife was fictional."
"- Hey, Pop."
"- Hey, kid."
I got news.
Coco left me.
Turns out she was banging her yogi.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Pop."
Sorry?
I set the whole thing up.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Paid for her yoga retreat to Nicaragua.
That makes 12.75.
An elastic band around it?
Here's 13.
-And 25 cents change.
5 nickels is ok too.
-Or 2 dimes and a nickel.
"Or 25 cents, right Auntie Cor?"
-I could barely carry that.
"What can I do for you, sir?"
The working man isn't interested in the revolution.
Must be too expensive.
Beautiful books about the revolution that nobody wants to buy.
What can I do for you?
"Hey, a first edition."
This is an antiquarian book.
It's been here for years.
No one will buy it like this.
Let alone follow its example.
"No, they'd rather buy this junk."
Rather than Marx and his revolution.
Ab.
Ab from the assault group.
-I thought you'd never recognize me.
"Yes, I've changed."
Hair doesn't grow on brains.
It also doesn't grow on sandy soils.
Did you want to buy all these books?
You could give them to your capitalist friends.
They've already got them all.
Or else their children.
I've come to get you.
I found him.
"She's, um-- she's doing all right."
Thanks for asking.
"Now, who's gonna bring me back some candy?"
- I will!
- Yeah!
"Hey, tell your mom you get to eat as much as you can fit in your mouth."
- [Laughs]
- Right.
You guys have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
See you when you get back.
- Look at you.
- Restaurant tricks.
Impressive.
[Marching band music] 25 members...
Look at these chumps.
"Are you kidding, man?"
Parade detail is great.
"Peter Mills, hold your arm up."
Now keep it there for five hours.
That's what being in the parade is.
"Mills, the shriners-- they throw out candy-- you clean up, man."
"Now, listen, I know you guys are gonna give me crap for this."
Go on.
[Sighs]
I want to start a podcast.
What the hell's that?
"Well, when I record myself being equal parts charming and brilliant, and then I put it up on iTunes, and people subscribe, and they follow me."
A mute would be better at that than you.
[Laughter]
My agent's.
"You and me, given opportunities only because young men are gone."
Or dying.
"But to turn our back on those opportunities, even when one has suffered such great loss, wouldn't that be giving death dominion over life?"
Have you seen it yet?
Our film?
You should.
It's very good.
I'm awfully good.
And so are you.
Calling all small boats.
All seaworthy vessels to report to your local harbor master immediately.
"Dunkirk. on, Lily!"
I think they're gonna get 'em out.
"Then they're going to need all the boats they can get, aren't they?"
The Nancy.
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper up there.
I don't care if he's got a bleedin' cannon.
I'm not gonna sit by and watch him shoot a dog.
Aww!
What in the-
- What is that?
"It's France, Uncle Frank."
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never get us all out.
Hitler?
Hitler?
It just came to me.
"Gee, I'm awful glad you could stay, Wilbur."
"Oh, I am, too."
Except I can only stay over the weekend.
Oh.
Would you like to sit down for a while?
Okay.
"No, sit over here."
No.
Close your eyes.
Real tight.
(GASPS) Why do you want...
"Oh, you scared me."
I was going to ask you why you wanted me to close my eyes.
"Well, Wilbur seems to know his way around a campus, doesn't he?"
I can't understand that.
"I could have sworn he was the shy, studious type."
I'll say.
"Man, dig that crazy homework."
I better have a little talk with him.
I don't think he understands girls.
Neither do I. I wish you'd have a little talk with me.
I got to get out of here.
Hey.
Kiss me!
Kiss me!
"Oh, no!"
"Get away, you!"
"Remember, girls, tomorrow we're having a test on the alloyed group."
I want a list of all our enzyme experiments.
Are there any questions?
Class dismissed.
Shh.
You mustn't exert yourself.
"No, no, I must say this to you."
We were meant to be together.
"My people would have adored you, as I adore you."

Don't waste your time thinking about the way things might have been.
"The surgery is dangerous, I know, but I am determined."
- I will walk again.
- You will.
I will get my country back.
And I will make you the most powerful woman
in the world.
What do you mean?
Galen.
What do you mean?
His Majesty has ordered this...
Hello...?
"I'm Dagaioh pilot candidate, Kasumi Yamagata."
I'll do my best to become a great pilot like Kuya.
"I'm fortune-reading elementary student, Kaori Tsukishiro."
Here's the preview...
You'll see some traditional arts in this funny story!
"Next, on Great Dangaioh..."
"Tune in for ""Costume Confusion!"
"The Shipwreck at Sea""!"
Um... oh...
"What's wrong, Kasumi?"
You've got to be strong!
I know...
"So, you've finally come to."
"But, you're not the one, either."
But she was still there.
"""I took a bus from Uncle Malcolm's,"
"I got the jacket, and I waited."""
Eva?
"After that, I waited in my cubby."
"When I got back home, dad wasn't there."
Dad?
"You know, you should have listened to dad when he said he didn't do it."
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
I'm sorry..
None of this would have happened if I just got thom to the river.
"Mrs gundelach, this is your copy for you to sign, as guardian."
"It's alright, mum."
Everything's gonna be alright.
"No, it's not."
It's not...
"Eva abigail gundelach,"
I'm arresting you for the murder of thom murnane.
"You'll be taken to the watch house, charged, and arrangements will be made immediately."
You'll report before the children's court.
I'm not sure what the magistrate will decide for eva.

- MAN:
Dude!
(POUNDING CONTINUES)
"Yeah, don't get up."
"I got it, bro."
Get in and out as quickly as you can.
That's all.
"Well, good luck, everybody, if all else fails just tread on their blank blank fingers."
"Where you go, I go."
Dawes.
Corporal Dawes?
My legs.
My legs!
"Quick as you can, Sergeant Box."
"Well, why don't you kiss it?"
"Get a ruddy move on yourself, man."
Engelander!
"Sergeant Box, how much longer are you going to be?"
It's nearly five to six.
It'll be dawn soon.
Hurry up.
Don't you know there's a war on?
"And you, Sergeant Box."
"Quick, we don't want to keep the Navy waiting."
"All right, Sir, just coming."
"You two stick close to Sergeant Box, don't let him out of you sight."
"Yes, Sir."
"Hurry up, will you?"
Hurry down those ropes!
Fire!
"Come on, get this fellow out of here, into the cave."
Any luck with this machine?
Not a whisper.
If the Navy find us in this soup...
What's happening to the Navy?
Looks like a long swim home.
Do you swim?
Yesterday's fireworks are still echoing.
"So, no thanks."
Brilliant.
"And now, if you're done with your story... please get out of my house!"
Your house?
Wow!
"But, I believe this house isn't yours, it belongs to Tisha."
"And, I believe Tisha is no more."
Do you think you're the only one who can create an illusion?
Tisha is alive.
I'm very happy to hear that.
"Anyway, if you had any kind of proof then..."
We do have proof.
Your fingerprints.
What?
You heard me.
Your fingerprints.
They are on the key.
When we were banging on the door...
Mr. Malhotra?
Mr. Malhotra?
You said the key was in the keyhole.
"The key is in the keyhole, but he never locks the door."
And we believed you.
And when you realised I would break the door down... you made your move.
"Hammer... quick, come on."
This is your proof?
!
Of course my fingerprints were on the key.
"I turned the key to open the door, remember?"
"Yes, I remember."
"Then, explain this."
"Oh, great."
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
"Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's."
I'll keep an eye on him.
"Well, thanks, Doc."
I've been feelin' a quart low.
"This ain't asphalt, son."
This is dirt.
"Oh, great."

Okay.

- Hi.
"- You like me, don't you?"
- Yeah.
- You want me to be your girlfriend?
- Yes?
I'm not gonna kiss you until I get my braces off.

I didn't realize I was being so absent.
What did you wanna tell me this morning?
Something was on your mind?
I wanna quit my job.
- What?

I started a clinic outside the wall.

No.

You're facing down your biggest fear and telling it to go to hell.
I think it's brave.
You have entered military academy.
Little Xiamu is having business in the high school.
"And I, finally graduated dan started looking for my first job!"
Wish me luck!

Your sister has got a job today!

- Just sit properly!

New job!
New clothes!
New job!
New clothes!
I'll be wearing this to work.
"Nice, isn't it?"
"- Mother, does it look nice?"
- It really is!
- Very good!
"Xiamu, eat some apples."
"Look at her, how happy she is!"
"But the time run so fast,"
I have to start prepare for her marriage.
"She even don't think about it yet, is the building close?"
Consider also!
"Mr. Lin, the General Manajer."
"Mr. Lin, how are you?"
I'm the new staff Shu Yawang.

"Sure, no problem!"

Besides...
Get out of my house!

But I still feel awful.
Okay.
I'll get you some ginger ale.
It'll settle your stomach.
I don't know how I got here.
"I mean, how did I become,"
"God, such a giant fuck-up."
Hey.
You were a...
pretty good doctor and a really good diet-pill salesman.
That was all bullshit-- the opposite of when I'm with my kids.

"Well, you are..."
on their level.
That is for sure.
"I always figured having kids would force me to grow up, but... it was the total opposite."
I knew who I was with my kids.
It's the only thing I was good at.
That is not true.
"You know it's true, Betty."
Let's get her on the phone.
I'll tell her myself.
You leave my wife out of this.
You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss.
"You pay, she pays."
Hmm.
He's about to fold.
And admit what?
"If I had my way, damn near everything."
This guy washes stark's underwear.
He knows.
"Hey, it's just getting good."
I should get back to my station.
I'm sure the last thing you want is to put anna on a plane
And have to explain why.
"All right, I'll let you take my shift."
"It's a one-time offer, carter."
Carter!
"Excuse me, chief dooley."

I'm afraid the codes are ready for analysis.

"Mr. Stinkmeaner, do you understand what I've just told you?"
I'm a clone!
"Yes, created at this secret and highly illegal underground human cloning facility."
Why am I so old?
!
"Eh, what?"
"If you cloned me when you say you did, shouldn't I still be a little kid?"
!
The man who you are a clone of is Colonel H. Stinkmeaner.
He answered our volunteer recruitment ad on Blackpeoplemeet.
"A few days later, he died in a street fight."
Fuck him!
He dead!
I'm alive!
Motherfucker!
"He left you those clothes, that cane, and the glasses."
"He asked that if the cloning was successful, we relay this message."
"""Dear me, please go fuck with Robert J. Freeman."
"I'm fucking with you, Cooper."
I told you to come up here to see if we've broken you enough to obey instructions without question.
- And we have.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
"Katie, come on."
"Katie, come on, let me out!"
"Katie, let me out, come on!"
What the fuck!
"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
"Oh, what are you doing to me?"
- Why are you doing this?
- You thought you'd see your mother.
"- Oh, fuck!"
- What does she look like?
"Your mother, can you describe her face?"
Her hair colour?
She...
"Is she tall, short, fat, thin?"
- Where did you grow up?
- She...
What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?
The name of the girl who stabbed you?
"You don't know any of these things, do you?"
Don't you think that's odd?
It's fucking taking my memories!
"Overwriting them, technically."
Fuck.
Look in the mirror behind you.
Do you recognize yourself?
Do you even know who you're looking at?
Soon you won't be anything.
"This is DS Gray, SSU, requesting urgent armed response to Egmont Terrace, E1."
And send an ambulance.

Did something happen?
"DS Gray DS Ripley, please escort Miss Calvert home."
"This way, please."
"Right, this way, please."
How are you feeling?
I'm angry.
Too angry?
Just angry enough.
"Because I can't have the wheels coming off this thing, John."
"They won't, Martin."
I fought tooth and nail to get you back into the fold.
I fought hard and I fought dirty.
Don't squander it now.
- I was just wondering...
- Yeah?
Would you mind just coming up with me?
"Just to check under the bed, that sort of thing."
- I just keep thinking...

"Say, uh, why don't you take a load off, and I'll put that projector away for you."
Sure.
Thanks.
That's our block?
On a map of the power grid.
There's our house..

And how does that help?
I need to know how the neighborhood is wired.

I'll call you when we can talk at length.
Anselmo just killed himself.
And this is the original probation report.
The one we were looking for.
They found it in Anselmo's car.
The police commissioner gave it to me.
He didn't want it ending up as tomorrow's headline.
"""""Tino Zapatti."

"1 0 to 20 years. """""
-Check this one out?
-This one's kosher.
The story ends where it began.

Walter Stern and Frank Anselmo.
Don't see them in the same room.
"Something's still wrong, you know?"
I know.
Before we nail up the house for the season...

"Afternoon, Mr. Calhoun."
"-Sorry, the judge left for the day."
Why would he do that?
- Objection.
Speculation.
- Sustained.
"Mr. McBride, do you have any other questions for the witness?"
"Yes, sir."
"I have plenty more-- about Karl Stoltz, but you won't let me ask them."
That line of questioning has been shut down.
"Please move on, sir."
Gabriel... um...
"Well, Your Honor, I'm a little stuck here."
Ms. Senate.
"You have no idea what made that boat blow up, do you, Mr. Marquez?"
Not really.
Thank you.
"Officer, Mr. Marquez is done."
"Mr. McBride, call your next witness."
Mr. McBride.
Mr. McBride!
I-
- Do you have another witness?
"Yes, your Honor."
The plaintiff would like to call Wendell Corey to the stand.
He's not on the witness list.
He's not even here.
He doesn't have to be on the list.
He's a party to the action.
Mr. Corey has no information about what transpired on that boat.
"Oh, that's great."
Let him testify to that.
"Your Honor, this is unfair surprise."
We have the right to call him.
Just fucking hit me!
"- Get out of here, you pussy!"
"- Yes, ma'am."
Here.
"Yes, ""yes, ma'am."""
"Now, get out of here... pussy."
Here you go.
"You want to sing something, Adam?"
- [Sobs] No.
- No.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
- It's okay.
"- Adam, come on."
- I feel stupid.
"No, we're gonna ge- we'll dry you off."
"- I know, he's very dumb."
- I feel stupid!
Let's go to the bathroom.
Come on.
"I would have DDT'd that dude, but I pulled my back this morning... farting."
I farted really hard.
"I don't know about fighting anymore, you know?"
"If you hit somebody, and you kill them by accident, you're flying con air."
You couldn't have fought that dude.
You're guarding all the Molsons.
I had to guard the Molsons.
"If Jillian wouldn't have been such a fight hog, we would have scared that dude something no-nonsense."
He was intimidated.
- What was that?
- He was intimidated at first.
"Guys, come on."
We got punked.
You've had your wishes.
"Now, it's my turn."
And now I'll know when they're coming for me.
"And if I can see them,"
I can kill them.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I had to use the Tesla.
He's dead.
You killed him.
"- Pete, what's going on?"
- Change of plans.
"What do you think, I'm an idiot?"
Don't answer that.
"Look, just stop, okay?"
Just put down the gun and let's think this through.
- I'm still taking the artifact.
- I can't let you do that.
"Die trying to stop me, Alice."
"Oh, clever boy."
What tipped you?
The real Myka... would never kiss me.
Never!
Not if her life depended on it.
- Which is...
- A shame.
You're a good kisser.
- So Artie hasn't figured this out yet.
"- Well, not yet."
"But when he does, he'll set the real Myka free, and you will... poof... disappear."
"It doesn't work that way, Pete."

"When you're hungover, it's like a car alarm."

I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.

"I don't mean you, but it's fun that you're right there."
"I, uh, left them at school."
I'll run over there.
"Mama, I have a stomachache."
And my ankle is broken.
(gasps) And you can walk with your broken ankle?
I had a cousin got out of Vietnam that way.

"Call me back, Dad!"
It's an emergency!
What's wrong?
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.
Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.
Shh!
How did you know?
- It's all over your face.
"Well, it ain't my fault, is it?"
"If you're worrying about that dame, I'll call her up."
No cracks.
I don't want her to know anything about this or me.
"Yeah, I see."
- Get back to that hospital and find out--
"- Jeez, I've been sleeping in the halls."
Get out of here.
Get back to that hospital.
Stay with him.
Get in bed with him.
- Back.
Move it on those two sides.
- Stay in line.
Move it faster.
Come on.
"Come on, get in here."
Come on.
"Come on, boys, hurry up."
"- Mr. Thompson, look at that."
"- Well, what's the matter with it?"
- Can you eat it?
Those boys can't.
"- Well, they don't have to."
It's worse now than it ever was.
"Miss Griffith, kindly understand that I want no more interference in things that don't concern you."
This does concern me.
We started something.
It was successful.
"Every day, bit by bit, you're tearing it down."
- That will do.
"- No, it won't."
Why should I tell them about her?
Don't know why they had come without even knowing her name?
"Hey, please listen to me..."
I will not.
I don't want to hear flashbacks of split ups.
I like as I'm now.
I feel something fishy.
Why isn't he listening to me?
I suspect him...
Why are you silent?
Do something.
What is your plan?
Why are you staring?
Do something.
What can I do?
I suspect him...
Say something please...
"Check, where is Kalyan?"
Can't you do it yourself?
"What happened, Halwa?"
Was I here only?
"You're here only, right?"
"Though I'm here, I'm not and though I'm not here, I feel I'm here."
Do something.
Something is happening without my knowledge.
Hey!
If you've guts remove the veil and beat me.
"Whether you're in veil or me, I'm getting the stick, right?"
"If you've guts, remove the veil."
"How can I be afraid of you, Halwa?"
I'll tell her everything.
Go ahead.
"What, are they getting engaged?"
I don't know.
I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!
What astronaut story?
You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.
"I texted ""architect."" That's amusing."
Auto-correct must've changed it.
"Yeah, it's hysterical."
"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
Architect.
Where would you have met an astronaut?
"Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India."
I don't want to do this anymore!
Don't you quit on us!
"Bernie, you okay?"
It was an architect!
"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon."
You're a good friend.
I'm glad you think so.
That's what I strive to emulate.
"Okay, let's see if this drug works."
Can I help you?
"Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful."
Thank you.
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?
India.
"Oh, cool."
I've always wanted to go there.
It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.
May I join you?
We could launch a drone off of any carrier in the gulf and hit any target we want.
"Excuse me, miss."
"Sir, you can't leave that there."
"Hey, buddy!"
"Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda."
I got a maintenance--
"Eli, you all right?"
"Keep moving, let's go, push."
Get your security teams up.
Mr. Speaker?
Mr. Speaker?
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.
Tell him we need to institute Continuity of Government.
- I tried.
He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.
"Don't panic, take your time."
There's been an explosion at the Capitol building.
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.
I want all nonessentials evac'd.
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
"Sergeant, bolt these doors."
I need Marine 1 here as fast as possible.
"Sir, I need you to move away from the window, sir."
Anselmo called me.
"I knew the Mafioso had called him, but in this business, you don't trade names."
And I called Walter.
That's all there was to it.
I was doing Anselmo a favor.
Run caution lights all my life.
"This time you ran a red, and someone cut across the intersection."
A cop and a 6-year-old child.
That's with me forever.
That's not good enough.
Not good enough?
You think I don't know that?
"I hope so, John."
Scares me when you call me John.
Why's that?
Because I...
... Ithoughtaminuteago we were off to the White House.
I thought I could feel you come aboard.

Aren't you hungry?
I want to eat something yummy.
Will you treat me?
"Sure, what do you want?"
Something really tasty.
Like spicy rice cakes.
Spicy rice cakes?
Spicy rice cakes?
Don't know if they have it here.
Don't think so.
Do they sell rice cakes here?
"If they do, I can cook it myself."
I'm really good at it.
Really?
Let's check out the grocery store.
Don't go out of your way.
"Don't worry, stupid."
Let's go down to that sand dune.
There's something real neat.
What is it?
I'll show you.
What is it?
"You see, I got the splinter out."
"I didn't get it out myself, and didn't know when it happened."
But I think it was when I bowed on my knees.
You went down on your knees?
"Yeah, I think that's when the splinter got out."
Why did you bow?
Come on and see.
"You'll feel like doing it, too."
Why are you laughing?
"Alright, let's go."
"Fine, okay."
"Sia, you won't believe it."
There was a call from the local police station.
Vikram Kapoor called the police to confess that he killed Maya.
What?
!
Just 70 rupees.
The latest from Bollywood.
August 22nd.
- He is dead.
Vikram didn't confess voluntarily.
He was forced to.
How does Neil figure in this?
"Sunil, who is the only one to have skipped surveillance?"
"Yes, sir."
"Where are you, Sia?"
"Mumbai, sir."
Vikram Kapoor is dead.
He was found in his house with slashed wrists... but his body has severe signs of violence.
"Sir, Neil Menon is on a killing spree."
Eliminating all the witnesses from that weekend.
Did I not give you a direct order to drop that case?
And to drop Neil Menon.
"Sir, if you could just listen to me."
"No, you listen to me."
I want you off that case.
Right now.
I will see you in my office tomorrow.
Sir...
"Sir, if someone in our department... is protecting Neil Menon..."
"That will be enough, Ms. Agnihotri."
What?
Who is receiving it?
- You might be knowing him.
Balwant.
See you tomorrow evening.
Come in.
The door is open.
"Balwant's briefcase contained 500,OOO worth of gold."
100/o is your share.
"That is 50,OOO."
Here...
- Keep it there.
Won't you count it?
-You must have counted it.
Any news of Balwant?
He's hiding in East View lodge in Kalina.
"Tony, where do you get this information from?"
"He'll vanish from Bombay for good ifyou don't arrest him today,"
Halt!
There's nothing to panic.
Bombay's highly reputed criminal lawyer will fight Balwant's case.
"I got it, Mr Daaga."
Tomorrow is Sunday.
He will be bailed out on Monday.
Fine.
But I think it's difficult to free Balwant from this case.
What's the use of my fees if I don't free your man?
Rest assured.
I'll be prepared for the case.
"I hear, you and Inspector Vijay are vey good friends."
Absolutely true.
Our friendship dates back to our childhood.
We studied together.
Yeah?
What'd you learn in class today?
I don't know...
the usual.
Yeah?
You weren't learning how to cut class
With your little faggoty little friends?
Enrique!
"It ain't like I never cut class before,"
But don't lie to me.
Enrique!
"You can't follow me around, Papi."
Sit down.
I don't go following you around.
"What's up with your hands, man?"
Put your hands down and talk to me like a man.
I didn't raise you to be like that.
You didn't raise me!
"You can't just come in here and try to be ""Papi"" now."
"Well, I am your papi, I am!"
"Dejalo, Kike."

I'm sorry it was such short notice.
Don't give it a second thought.
"Slaughtering vampires, arranging lunch with the queen, just name it."
Welcome aboard the Queen Victoria II.
The name's Captain MacRae.
One thing.
"While you're here on my boat, you'll abide by my rules, got it?"
And rule number one.
No women allowed on board.
They're bad luck.
Noah.
Did you remember to bring what I asked?
Yes.
It's stowed below.
Hold on!
Honey... (GROANS)
Amateur!
Does anyone else want a go?
"Well, if you're offering, sure."
Why not?
I'm game if you are.
(GRUNTS)
"Believe me, my dear, I'm just as disappointed as you are."
I've never seen Razor take to someone so quickly.
I suppose you can't be all bad.
"My name is Noah Van Helsing, from along line of vampire hunters."
"Now, what do you want with Blade?"
"The rule still stands, old man."
No woman on board my boat.
Young lady...
Oh my God.
"You covered ""how will I know"""
And you dedicated it to me
And I sat there trying not to laugh.
Oh God.
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were so much easier when we were younger.
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that"
Just figure it out as we go along?
Maybe this didn't turn out to be
The romance we thought it would be when we first met.
Well.
It's more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it?
I don't want to miss out.
Well...
Neither do I.
I don't have a ring
So this will have to do.
Rufus.
What are you doing?
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your... uh your fifth husband.
So?
Yes.
Give me your hand.
I don't know where it is.
"Well, maybe you could find it."
"3,000 bucks."
"Well, that will get me back, but not in style."
I can get you another two when we get to the States.
"It's important, Marion."
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
"See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones."
"Good evening, Fraulein."
The bar's closed.
We...
We are... not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
Must've slipped his mind.
The man is... nefarious.
"I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it."
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
"Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?"
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
(ALL SCREAMING)
Lady.
"Hey, lady, you okay?"
(SOBBING)
"Yeah, they're gone, it's okay."
How can I ever thank...
You're one of them!
(SCREAMING)
"Not her type, I guess."
Maybe it's the eyes.
Or the fangs.
Well?
I'm feeling so...
NOAH:
I see.
Sunlight has no effect on you.
Extraordinary.
So you're a Daywalker. I never really thought they existed.
I'm a human being.
BLADE:
Why did you help me?
"Well, it's not every vampire that would apologize to his victims."
You were there?
"Well, after all, lam a vampire hunter."
I know their feeding grounds.
I hate this.
Every day I have to live with these cravings is a day too long.
But I've got a score to settle before I can leave this world behind.
Must be important for you to prolong a life you so detest.
Have you ever come across or heard of a vampire known as the Man with Four Fangs?
"No, I can't say that I have."
He killed my mother.
"Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual."
"Yes, Markham sahib."
"I don't like it, Mitchell."
I don't like it.
Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
"Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air."
"- Telegraph just got through, sir."
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
"Emergency signal, sir."
Why doesn't he go on?
"Wire's gone dead, sir."
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts.
"MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here."
"That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave."
"On some mysterious mission, they said."
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
Driven.
So let's meet up tonight.
9PM.
Alright.
I am really in a hurry.
See you bro.
Okay.
"This work is from my friend, Lisa."
She's having a gallery exhibition in New York.
Extremely urgent.
And this is part of her exhibition.
It's installation art.
And it needs some retouching.
Everything needs to be done quickly.
It's so urgent that I thought of you first.
"On this planet, no one but you could finish it in time."
Day 1
You have 2 weeks.
But you must send an update every day.
And Lisa will give you her feedback right the way.
No problem.
Kai.
"But this job, you must do solo."
Because she is very paranoid about her work leaking.
"If you can do this job, the Shibuya job Jerd did will pale in comparison."
"When you're done, let's go to New York together."
Day 2
"Yes, Peng?"
I sent you the feedback for the previous lot already.
Is this lot done?
Not yet.
Why are you so slow?
Is the bar open?
I mean can I get a decent cup of coffee?
Now that's a classic portrait.
What do you think Angie?
I'm not a fan of black and white photos.
I had a black and white photo taken of me as well.
I looked really great.
"Just fabulous, like a film star."
But I don't look like that at all.
Exactly.
That's why I like black and white photos.
So you lie to yourself quite a bit.
Right?
I think you are beautiful.
- Hi.
"Angie, clean up back there!"
"One thing after another, boss."
"This one is good too, by the way."
"Right, quite good."
"Okay, I'll take that."
You want to buy me a drink?
Why not?
Thank you for the sign.
Now go to your brother and pull the money off the wall.
Go fuck yourself Toni.
"You could stay outside as well, or sit in the lobby and drink tap water."
- Can we get a coffee here?
Sure.
Two coffees?
- Black.
Me too.
Thank you.
The wounded go before the dead.
We thought we'd better not move him.
They zapped me good.
You're not gone yet.
"Would you do me a favor, sir?"
Would you take a touch with me?
I sure will.
"Thank you, sir."
"Another favor, sir?"
What is it?
"You remember the decision I was trying to make, about my name?"
KIRBY:
The signs?
I remember.
That's it.
"There it is, sir."
You're sure that's what he wanted?
Affirmative.
That's what he wanted and that's what he's going to get!
Maybe he liked the idea of having so many men think about him every day.
Besides it sings.
It sings?
That's what he said.
It sings.
ROBIN:
Provo's Privy.
It does sing!
"Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were going to tell you about a plan we had and ""A"" camp 107 got hit."
This can't wait till you take over.
I want you briefed.
- Why way out here?
- This is top secret.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop.
Jeffrey's a professional killer.
He murdered somebody.
I've been after him for months.
- I don't believe you!
-Jenny!
"- Listen to me,Jenny!"
- No!
"-Jenny, it's true."
- Chang!
"Jenny, calm down."
"Listen, please!"
Sit down.
Six months ago...
Jeffrey shot your face up by accident.
Now his employer wants him dead.
I don't believe it!
"I'd like to help, but I can't, in my position."
I hope you'll cooperate with us.
"Jenny, we're using you as bait."
It can bringJeffrey in this time.
I'll save his life foryou.
"Otherwise, the guy who hired him will kill him."
Name your price.
I want him dead.
He was recognized doing thejob.
"I want him wasted, the sooner the better."
"Deposit $1 00,000 into my account now... and $200,000 more upon completion."
"No money, no action, Mr. Weng."
Not even if I see his finger on the trigger ready to blow your head off.
- Put the hundred grand in his account.
I'm really embarrassed.
Grandma puts her hands together to worship what I cooked.
-And it was really delicious.
-That's true!
We're all counting on you from now on.
Look at this.
What is this?
"To convince her to agree to go to Hawaii, I talked about Suzujiro today."
Then Grandma started to remember the names of her brothers.
"""Tetsutaro."
"""Dozaburo."
"""Jushiro."
"""Shogoro."
"""Kuginosuke."
"""Natakichi."
"""Kuwata."
"""Suzukichi."
"""Nabe."
"""Kane."
"Kyoko."""
These names have the Chinese symbol for metal.
"Grandma's father, our great-grandfather, seems to have been a real weirdo."
"""Kane."" So this is our Grandma, right?"
-eleven!
-eleven?
"And she says there must have been two or three more, but she can't remember them."
And Suzujiro is among the ones she can't remember?
"But you know, Tetsutaro, Dozaburo, there, is number two."
I think the brother between those two is Suzujiro.
I'm pretty sure of it.
"First, the Chinese character for Suzu has the symbol for metal."
"Even if she could remember, Grandma won't go to Hawaii."
"But with some sound advice and the proper introduction, who knows?"
I'll tell you one thing.
You've got the right product.
"Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big of bunch, you are on to something special."
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Full for thought, yeah?"
"So, if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make,"
Better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
"That's yours, right?"
What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
"Yeah, another one right over there."
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on.
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just wanna get high."
What's left of it.
This is the place that you're trying to save?
Mm-hmm.
It's so beautiful.
You think so?
Yeah.
Why would anybody want to ruin this?
Well...
Look...
A glossy ibis.
I watch a lot of documentaries on TV.
"You know, maybe I don't have to leave."
"I mean, it's so safe here and nobody knows about this place."
Except you and me.
Just you and me.
And the 20 of us.
What makes for good television?
"The story as it breaks, live, coming to you from the bad guy himself?"
"I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers to change the fucking channel, would we?"
What the hell's this world coming to?
- Nice.
- I'm sorry.
I'll buy you a new one.
Subject has just passed Flowerbowl.
I'm about 30 yards back.
- Stay with him.
I'm coming on your right.
- I can't see him.
Where is he?
- He's in front of the Pier One truck!
- All right.
We just passed the Flowerbowl.
Is that what I'm doing with Erica?
Making her decisions for her?
What do you think?
You can't deny the fact that Kai...
He has become a distraction.
Maybe he has.
But why does that preclude him from being a necessary part of Erica's journey?
Especially if she wants him to be?
How did you know when--when I was ready?
You knew.
And you let me know.
Thank you.
Fred?
Hey.
Cheers.
"So, what do they do to doctors who crash and burn?"
Same thing they do to doctors who quit.
I heard about that.
Yeah.
"Uh, not my finest moment."
Mmm.
"You know, this thing that we do, it's not easy."
No kidding.
I can't reach him.
I've tried everything I can think of.
Sometimes you need a little help.
I did.
"Yeah, well, no one's offered."
"Well, consider this an offer."
"Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna change anything,"
"But if you wanted me to,"
I'd be happy to give it a try.
Don't get sore.
"Oh, I'm not sore."
I suppose it's natural for a chap to be a bit edgy before his first jump.
Is it?
Everybody is.
"It's nothing to do with, well, being frightened, you know?"
That's interesting.
"There, now you can stop worrying and relax."
It's a special I keep on one side.
It's the best chute I ever packed.
Good.
I wouldn't like to have to repack it on the way down.
"Hey, what's your name?"
Gardner.
What Gardner?
Just Gardner.
Working girls don't have Christian names.
I haven't seen you around.
I don't get around.
"Oh, officer material?"
I said we work here.
"On your way, Mr Maple Leaf."
"Left, right, left, right..."
Squad halt!
"One, two."
Fall out.
"Take the ropes, Corporal Dawes."
"All right, who's going to have the first go?"
No ugly rush now.
All right.
We'll have to pick out volunteers for the first stick.
"Canada, suppose you show us how it's done?"
[chuckles] i knew the future looked bright.
i knew it.
- yeah.
"[clicks tongue] they didn't get along so well after, you know, the incident with... little tim."
- what happened with tim?
- [sighs]
"- hey, hey!"
what happened to tim?
- oh. oh. oh.
"so suddenly you care about tim, huh?"
- i've always cared about peepers!
- [sighs]
- what happened to my harley?
"- remember the phrase,"
"""i'd rather push a harley than ride a honda""?"
- yeah.
- that's for people who could afford them.
"you were too good to ride a honda, but too lazy to work to make the money to keep a harley."
"now, come on."
this is hurting me just as much as it hurts you.
- [sighs]
- makes me realize i was a bad mama.
"you never did learn how to cook, and wayne took to eating the pimento loaf at the dollar king all day long."
- dang.
wayne!
"[scoffs] wake up, you lard."
it's time for work!
- [sighs] it's christmas.
- so?
the dollar king ain't never closing!
- i quit.
- quit?
The official report says as a private jet has collapsed Norwegian coast.
It seems that the plane flew very low when it lost cabin pressure.
It seems that the accident occurred off the coast.
More bodies found in the trunk.
It remains to be confirmed If a company on ...
Search is stopped.
Alleged killer crocodile remains a mystery.

- Have a good day.
"- Hey, if you need a place to stay there's an old couch in my basement."
My mom will never know.
Was there a second watch?
Was anyone keeping time?
"It was a tie, Paige."
You and Emily tied.
Judge Goni?
In the High Court.
Here.
A play.
Here.
First act.
First act.
Well?
- Well what?
First act.
"Plays usually start with the first act, yes."
Then there's a description of what's on the stage.
It says here...
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
I want to talk about what happened before.
- I don't.
Why is it so important to you that I direct there?
Because you're a wonderful director.
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
"I'm not so sure anymore, Goni."
You could still direct so many beautiful plays.
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
"""The walls are covered with diplomas..."
"""and with anatomic sketches of the human body."
"""Anatomic drawings."""
"Anatomic drawings, not sketches."
"""When the curtain rises,"
"""Dr. Laroire is straightening the certificates on the wall."
"""Laroire is about 30 years old..."
"""His collar is stiff and high."""
Give him his pills and make sure he rests at home.
He shouldn't be going out now.
Oh.
"He's very handsome, isn't he?"
I don't know.
He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.
The one playing the snarfblatt.
"Silence, silence."
"It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present."
"Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have."
- [Applause]
- I know.
"[Grimsby] Happy birthday, Eric."
[Gasping]
[Growls]
"Uh, gee, Grim..."
Ha!
[clears throat]
"It's, uh..."
It's really somethin'.
"Yes, I commissioned it myself."
"Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present."
"Come on, Grim."
Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
"Oh, my!"
"Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone."
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
"Oh, she's out there somewhere."
I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
[Grimsby] Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
"Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know."
STEVE:
Wow.
"Yeah, that's impressive."
Cuz is a straight-up wizard when it comes to branding.
"All right, all right, let's make this official."
"McGarrett, want to do the honors?"
Really?
"What, you couldn't spring for a bigger bottle?"
It's a ceremonial gesture.
"Ceremonial, okay."
(clears throat)
"To the sea, to the sailors of old, and to the SS Thong Magnet."
(phone ringing) MAX:
Mazel tov.
McGarrett.
"Oh, no."
(sirens wailing)
(tires screech)
"Chin, what do you got?"
Joel and Susan Hiller.
Housekeeper arrived this morning and found them tied up on the floor.
"Their infant daughter, however, was left untouched in her crib."
I thought this was a kidnapping.
"If the parents are accounted for and so is the kid, who's the victim?"
KONO:
Addison Wells.
"22 years old, originally from Minnesota."
She's currently a senior at Oahu State.
She started babysitting for the Hillers six months ago.
CHIN:
Parents are getting on a flight to Hawaii.
"Minneapolis PD is up on the phones, but so far no ransom call."
Same reason I never wear mine.
-What?
"-Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
You mean like a rave?
Is it still a rave if you don't roll?
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
-Want me to get you one?
-Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"It's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
(JACKSON groaning)
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says, ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"""
"is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
-Why do you wanna know?
-I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that you could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
"Well, tell me if this feels like an answer."
No.
Jackson?
In here.
-ls something wrong?
"-What's she got, anyway?"
"She's afflicted with a complaint, you know, a female-dog type of thing."
What's the full-court press on Santini about?
They got mail service now.
-What did you get off toxicology?
-This girl was a suicide.
"Trace amounts of narcotics in her system, not enough to stupefy anyone..."
... letaloneajunkie.
She pulled the bag over her head.
"Otherwise, we'd have found signs of struggle, resistance."
-The mutt from her apartment?
-Yeah.
-She's as much of a mess as that girl.
"-Hey, you ain't exactly Clark Gable."
"-John, what did the M.E. say?"
"-Suicide, Mike."
"-l told you I was clean, right?"
"-Yeah, you did."
"That's right, I did."
"Yeah, squeaky clean, Roberts."
LAURA:
"Yeah, thanks, I'll see you upstairs."
"Hey, congratulations on that Garcia homicide."
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
I was flat wrong about that.
-l didn't have my crystal ball.
-You were dead right.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad it worked out."
Nice job.
Thank you.
-Think that got you out of the woods?
One must be careful.
I check everyone who get into my car.
But with you there's no doubt.
Married?
-Yes.
Is your wife waiting there?
No.
Well...
We're going to my friend's place.
That's good.
It has a great ambience.
It's separated.
In the middle of the field.
I congratulate you.
You're a lucky man.
And why isn't your wife coming?
"Actually, we've been living separated for a long time."
Now that's a coincidence.
Give me five!
I'm separated too.
Watch out!
Don't be afraid.
I know these roads by heart.
How long has it been from your separation?
I'm free since 3 years ago.
Excuse me for talking like this but to me it was like freedom.
My wife thought I'd discuss who keeps the children.
I told her she could keep them forever.
I've never seen any of them since then.
Good God!
"What an ease, what a beautiful life!"
There was a moment... in which I thought of killing her.
Ms. Nevins has been linked with several Washington power brokers.
Investigators are eager to locate her.
"Meanwhile, Sara's parents have provided WCN with a copy of the panicked voicemail that has raised so many questions about the Collins' marriage."
"Mom, it's Sara."
I need to talk to you.
About Jeffrey.
"It's important, so call as soon as you can."
Senator Collins has yet to comment.
"On Day Two of Sara Collins' disappearance, this is Judy Nash."
Ten bucks says the senator finally grants an interview.
"Yeah, with anyone but me."
"Good news is, they talk about the tape, they have to talk about you."
It's not good enough.
Never is.
Look out!
Are you insane?
!
Judy Nash?
"Hey, hey, hey."
"Back up, man."
Yeah?
You want an exclusive?
"Sara Collins isn't who she says she is, and I got proof."
Yes.
All right.
I'll only have a few minutes.
All right.
That shouldn't be a problem.
"Okay,it won't be a problem."
jeffrey's home.
Please never call here again.
"Just get off of him the best you can, but don't let him roll in that saddle."
I think that...
I need that horse!
Shit.
Stop that horse!
I need that horse.
Get that horse.
I can understand you smaller children... but you older children have no excuses.
"So, we're going to stay until you get it right."
"Now, I don't want any erasures, so turn the page and start fresh."
Put that mouse in your pocket.
I brung you a horse.
Class dismissed.
"Lord, it's like a stampede."
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.
Go on home.
Go on.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
"- Why, sure you are."
"Why, women ride all the time dressed like that."
I busted that horse for you.
"Come on, I'll boot you up on him."
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.
"Come on, I'll put you up there."
Okay.
Done.
You all right?
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.
"Grab his reins, grab a little handful of his mane."
honesty is all we ask from those who work for us.
There is no honor in deceit.
Death doesn't frighten you?
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
My business requires a handy man.
Oh yeah?
What are you offering?
What you gave me.
A life.
Do I have to drink that shit?
When do I start?
There you go.
That is dino campanela.
The head of the campanela family.
We believe he was behind the attack.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure about that?
I will be.
What do you want me to do?
You will find what you need under the seat.
"If there is trouble, use it."
There you are.
How are you doing shuji?
"Listen, I heard what happened."
I'm sorry.
If there is anything I can do.
Thank you.
I'm glad you can make this meeting.
"Like I said, anything I can do."
Let's sit.
I want to know why you have ignored our agreement.
Egate Mcleod Higaki.
- Hyotei.
- Hyotei.
Leave at once.
I will not tolerate this.
Are you troubled?
Sensei.
"Ryoma's going back to America, right?"
Is that alright?
"Whether he wants to leave or not, is not up to us."
"If it depends on him, I guess there's nothing we can do."
Will the participating schools please report to the court now.
It's starting soon.
"Momoshiro that idiot, didn't come in the end."
And so is the chibi.
- Let's go.
- Oh!
Kanto District Meet is about to begin.
Seishun Gakuen and Hyotei Gakuen match is officially begun.
Please exchange your lineup.
"I've waited for a long time, Tezuka."
"Sorry, but we will be the champions."
"I've waited for a long time, Tezuka."
"Sorry, but we will be the champions."
The rules of the matches are one set match and a tie-breaker.
That is all.
"Heard you guys are the ""Golden Pair"" who has some invincible acrobatic double play."
- What double play?
Can Seigaku really do it.
- One set match.
Seigaku's serve.
Play.
Jeremy won't be coming.
I cancelled him.
"Neil, it's just a night out, and we need to try new things."
"Yes, but you deserve a better escort than Jeremy."
You deserve the very best.
You were right.
We need to start over.
Like we're meeting for the very first time.
Get out.
Sorry?
I said get out.
"If this is a date, then you shouldn't be in my bedroom when I'm getting dressed."
"Oh, hello."
You must be Grace.
- And you must be?
- Neil.
Neil Truman.
"You're a little early, Neil Truman."
Come on in.
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.
My husband and I bought it a long time ago.
You're married?
Does that shock you?
That a married woman would want to have sex with a stranger?
"Oh, I'm not here to judge."
Only to give you a night of pleasure that you'll never forget.
"Well, we better get started then."
Ahem.
Typically I receive the envelope before we begin the evening.
- The envelope?
Nothing is hidden in here.
And neither can one drink too much.
Sparkle as if you were in our house.
"Enough, what are you doing?"
What they all do.
"We are going, just relax."
-Let it all come out.
-Are you crazy.
"Enough, I feel so ashamed."
"No way, Francesca."
I know that you'll like it.
Can't you feel how wet you are?
"Let yourself go, Francesca."
This is an opportunity to play it for real.
Don't be afraid my love.
I am here.
Where are we going?
Get up Francesca.
Swap places.
We are going to another room.
But as in a mirror it all returned to be seen.
"Apparently... reserved and adaptable, but in reality the whoring of it all."
But seeing Paolo being possessed by another woman made me crazy with jealousy.
But this jealousy also made me cazy with lust and desire.
Yes Paolo!
I am enjoying it!
I like it!
"Me too, Francesca. me too!"
Yes my love
- I do too.
And it was so shameful.
-You were once?
- This is amazing.
- This is the greatest van in the world.
- A lot of good times went down there.
- A lot of mold.
- Yeah.
Lot of memories.
- Joseph Middleton.
"Here's a tidbit nobody knows, including you guys."
Joseph Middleton was my first casting director audition in Los Angeles.
- Really?
- Probably my last.
- Was it for this?
- Because it's offer only after that.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Good one.
- Good one.
- And Aaron Yoo was deathly ill here...
"Oh, my God, yeah."
He could hardly stand up.
"Yeah, poor Aaron showed up for this, just out of the hospital."
He flew into town that morning with stitches in his side.
- He had surgery on his abdomen.
- He looks healthy as a horse but it's just good acting.
- He's doing an amazing job.
"He's in agony right there, right?"
"Like, he can hardly stand."
"- Yeah, we set up, like, a cot for him."
- The deck chair.
"I use the ""we"" term liberally, because it wasn't any of us here."
- Right.
Yeah.
- I brought him Jell-O.
Your answer?
Echidna?
"Echidna, show me your first letter."
Let's see if you're right.
"Yes, indeed, in the nick of time."
What is an echidna?
It sort of scuttles a bit.
It scuttles a bit?
!
It's a spiny anteater.
That's what I was going to say...
Of course you were!
Of course you were.
It's on the five cent coin.
It's a monotreme isn't it?
"It's a monotreme, an egg-laying mammal."
"Geniuses, I'm surrounded by geniuses."
"OK, where are we so far?"
"Araucarians, you're on one, welcome to the game."
"Lutrophiles, you're racing ahead at the moment with seven."
"You know what's going to happen now, it's going to get a bit harder."
"Because now I'm looking for two answers, and you must spot both to score the point."
"Lutrophiles, are you ready?"
Reveal the hive.
Picasso...
"Picasso's there, is Spain there?"
It might not be.
No.
I don't think it is.
It's not.
Brack?
No.
"I've met someone else, Thomas."
Someone else has visited me in hospital.
Who is it?
Does it matter?
"You can stay here, until you find somewhere else."
Who is it?
- Michael.
- Michael?
Whose dad has a factory?
That's neat.
His father has a factory   and then he goes to the asylum and exploits proletarian women.
Neat.
Don't say it's difficult.
We had a deal.
- You promised me that...
"- Honey, go back in."
There's a man in my room.
He has a black slug on his upper lip.
What's he doing here?
"Asger, your woman is shell-shocked."
"No, she's just upset..."
"Honey, Hossein will go with you next time."
I'm not going back to Christiania again.
I'm through with that.
- And I need to smoke less.
- First you show Hossein the routine.
Get dressed.
You are not well.
Are you in pain?
"Are you scared, maybe?"
Hossein has something that will ease the pain.
In Persia they say that opium is good for anything.
Do you really love him?
"He""s my family."
I just want my family back.
Then go home.
Go home and close your eyes.
This will all play itself out.
"But, Bobbi..."
"There""s nothing I can find out that""s gonna make you feel better."
Knowing the truth will only hurt.
And hurt and hurt some more.
"You""ll end up back where you are... which is still in love with the man you married."
Go home.
"I can""t."
"Get some rest now, Clara, okay?"
"L""ll call you first thing in the morning with my report."
"- Can""t you call me tonight?"
"- Okay, tonight after the dinner."
"Amy, you take her home."
Stay there until you hear from me.
"- No, I""ll call you."
"- No, Clara, you won""t."
"No communication with me when I""m on the job."
"No interference of any kind, or we back off the investigation entirely."
"It""s for our own protection."
Catching somebody in the act of cheating...
"- Well, things can get complicated."
- We understand.
- Thank you.
- Go home.
- Thank you so much.
"- You""re welcome."
"It""s not that simple, Jesse."
It's over!
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Let him in.
Thank you.
"No, wait."
Let me talk to her again.
Jenna.
Open up.
Michael's not here.
He's outside with your dad.
Jenna.
Have you got something to say for yourself?
"I don't know, I'm..."
I panicked.
I got scared.
"Well, that's a very compelling argument."
You won't have any trouble convincing her of that.
What the fuck were you thinking?
Did you just get bored?
"- No, I'm just an idiot."
"- On that much, we're agreed."
"I love her, Stephen."
I realize now I love her more than I will ever love anybody else.
Stop talking about love.
Every asshole in the world says he loves somebody.
- It means nothing.
- But it's true.
It still doesn't mean anything.
What you feel only matters to you.
"It's what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters."
It's the only thing that counts.
"And you did do this thing, right?"
How can I drink?
"Want me to attend to you, eh?"
"No, I didn't mean that"
"Never mind, let me do it!"
How's that?
T aste good?
"Well, the taste is a bit strange"
That's the water I've just used to wash my feet
T ake some more!
No!
It's good for your body!
Gao Jian!
Big Brother!
Go!
Master wants to dispose you of your vital energy
What?
Dispose my vital energy?
We've today all the heroes from close and afar
I appreciate all your bravery and uprightness
It's our honor to attend to your call
We are more than willing to obey!
Thank you!
Thank you!
As long as we can get rid of the Three Devils
Please use us as you see fit!
"Y es, yes!"
May we have your good advice?
I won't dare!
Please take your seat
"Everybody knows that Y an Qingwang, Zhou Sanzhao"
Fan San are the parasites of our martial arts field
They are here to mess up!
"Well, hello."
I didn't think you'd be here.
I thought your husband--
"Oh, yes, he's off on another one of those trips."
But why should that stop me from traveling?
"See you later, maybe?"
We had the pleasure of meeting him last summer in Lausanne.
I'd taken Merle to Switzerland.
"The trip was very beneficial, I thought."
Poor Olivia.
What was he like?
"Oh, it was indeed a rare privilege."
He is such a quaint old gentleman.
"He speaks perfect English, but I am sure he learned it from reading the classics."
[laughter]
He always referred to me as Mistress Langley.
It sounded terribly elegant but a little bit naughty.
[chatter]
[doorbell rings]
- [door opens]
"- Good evening, sir."
"[Paul] Oh, good evening, Corbett."
"Oh, uh, Mr. Drake,"
I would like for you to mix around and have fun.
"I understand, Mrs. Langley."
- But keep an eye on Merle.
- All right.
I have a terrible headache.
I've got to lie down.
[knocking]
"I say, old man, have you seen Margo around?"
Margo Stevens?
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
"Whatever the case, she... fell in love with someone else."
Who?
A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.
I only saw him once.
From a distance.
They died in a car accident.
How does your daughter figured that it's your fault?
"Well, my daughter didn't know about the affair."
She blamed me for the breakup.
And consequently the... car accident.
Well... did you ever tell her the whole story?
- No.
- Why not?
Because I want her to remember her mother the way she does now.
That's stupid!
You're stupid!
- Thank you.
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
- What?
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
Very much.
"Well, at least she did somethin' right."
"Now, I'm gonna get some bullets and we've done with all these."
Tell Violet.
"You like my partner, don't you?"
What's not to like?
She's....a sweet girl.
Do you like her better than me?
I don't know you as well.
That's okay.
I like her better than me too.
- Here.
Then divide it up!
I'll make piles!
It doesn't work out this time either.
"Ah, here!"
No big green ones?
"- None, really?"
"- No, really."
It's just that green is good for the eyes.
"Wait, I can't count it."
... eighty... ninety and two fifties.
- Two fifties and ninety is...
- Two fifties for each...
Wait!
"You must do something with this, it's torn//falling to pieces, soon we won't have anything to play from."
"Look, there's something here!"
I knew it.
Good to see.
That's super.
It'll save us.
It's the first time that's happened!
Such a good job!
Yes!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- A terrible thing's happened to us.
- And what's that?
We were sewing a dress for Mi?
"ka for a party on Saturday, we wanted to hurry it up, so we thought we'd do it ourselves."
"Put it on, so that we can see..."
"She cut it out, got it ready, and now we need to be rescued."
This for a party?
"Jeeves, you don't mean you're leaving me still."
How are we gonna manage?
"The young lady may have some idea, sir."
I hear they generally have.
That's right.
I hadn't thought of that.
- Shall I have a go at it till the blacksmith arrives?
"- Yes, please."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Thank you, Jeeves."
"Go on, take a card, any card at all."
Now look at it.
Put it back.
Ace of spades.
"- When did you change the act, Pop?"
- I didn't.
He did.
He did?
"Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned."
"Wait a minute, take a bow."
"No, you take it."
I got to get married.
"Come here, they're applauding you."
They like it.
Lucky.
Now what?
"- I want to reason with you, if I can."
- But you already did.
Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know?
"It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it?"
I hate to see you leave show business.
You know we wanted to be pregnant by now.
I can't take that kind of time off work right now.
"Besides, we need my income."
That's not an issue.
Come on.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if we lose us?
Jess.
You will never lose me.
So what was it like in prison?
It's actually not so cracked out to be.
"If you could start your life over, what would you do different?"
Be someone else.
"That's sad, Roman."
Anyone can change.
"Change is a choice, you know?"
Change is a choice?
Where'd you read that?
Just made it up.
So when will I see you again?
Hard to say.
You're not going to do anything stupid are you?
"See, right there!"
That's what it's like being me!
Everyone always thinks I'm up to something.
I wonder why.
You're sexy when you work.
Norman.
"Right, hang on."
Lucky coin.
Damn it.
"You know, no one ever died from taking a day off."
- You said this was gonna scare 'em.
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume.
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that would scare the pants off of you.
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes.
Stories to make your blood run cold.
- Yeah.
- Stories to terrify you.
Yeah.
"And whoever shall last through the night, shall be named the King of Halloween."
I accept.
We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wunderbar!"
Huzzah!
OK.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick-or-treaters.
Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
- Trick or treat.
I shall begin.
So many dogs!
- I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
- All right.
This is gonna hurt.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"- Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
- Okay.
"- Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
- The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
- Talking about what?
"- Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"- Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
- I don't know.
Because I liked you.
Do you think I'm still attractive for women?
"To me, yes."
Of course you are.
You knew who I was.
I've heard about you.
Great piece for your collection.
I don't know if you're mean or just pathetic!
"That night, the only thing that had your interest was the name."
Be honest.
But what does the first night matter?
There have been other nights I think.
I just wanted to be sure.
Are you calm now?
Yes.
Then I'm leaving.
Nobody stops here.
I have an idea.
Maybe if I wait here alone somebody stops.
Why don't you hide behind there?
-I won't.
It's easier for a lonely girl.
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not going to stay here alone.
-But you're gonna be right there!
No way.
"Please, let me do it."
Don't think that I like picking up people in the road.
Did you have breakdown?
No.
We don't have a car.
We're spending the weekend in the countryside.
Bye-bye.
And we're out.
"Eddie, you did it again."
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving goodbye.
Sorry.
It's not rocket science.
"Stan, there you are."
Did you get my email?
About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought I could read a few of them on the air.
"Well, I don't really think we have time."
"Oh, sure, we have time."
I'll just pick the lotto numbers faster.
"Well, you see, Natalie, the show is about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you Monday.
Okay.
Jesus.
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they carry your voice from this microphone to that sound board.
"Well, can't you put them someplace else?"
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
"Really, really bad mistake!"
My lawyer just flew in.
Vogel will get me off.
"Oh, and there's super cop."
"God, you're so good, huh?"
You're really good.
Come around and watch a movie sometime.
"Where was the missing cuff link found,"
That it couldn't be recovered two years ago?
I'm unable to comment on that at this time.
Suffice it to say that mr.
Cardoza's name
And reputation has been cleared.
"Well, that door's not going to open itself."
Thank you.
Lieutenant.
"You know, uh,"
Tony enright is never going to see
The inside of a prison cell.
"Don't be too sure, mr."
Vogel.
"Actually, I'm dead sure."
I want you out of miami.
Have you come to wish me bon voyage?
"By the way, if you're ever in the emirates,"
Don't bother to call.
"Don't worry, I'll get the door."
Thank you.
"You would have done the same for me, jesse."
"Zeltzer, did you fix the lighting in scene 4?"
"Okay, people, please concentrate."
Lieutenant caine.
The beatles played on this stage.
I know that.
I was here.
You come alone?
Just like I said I would.
Why here?
I like my privacy.
"What's this all about, caine?"
Where'd you get this photo?
You let jesse cardoza take the fall for something you did.
"What exactly do you want, caine?"
I want you to come clean.
All right.
We knew enright had murdered his wife.
"And we had him, too."
Dead to rights.
"When I saw that cuff link,"
"I knew that his slick lawyers would get him off,"
So I pocketed it.
"No harm, no foul."
The right guy goes down.
And that's the way it should be.
But I had no idea
Cardoza had already taken a photograph of it.
So you allowed it to look like he tampered with evidence.
I figured he was young.
Get a couple weeks
"Desk duty, slap on the wrist."
"Yes, but it didn't turn out that way, did it?"
No.
His wife was murdered- probably by enright.
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving good-bye.
- Sorry.
- It's not rocket science.
- There you are.
Did you get my email?
- About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought
- I could read a few of them on the air.
- I don't really think we have time.
Sure we have time.
I'll just pick the Lotto numbers faster.
"You see, Natalie, the show's about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you really.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you monday.
Jeez!
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they Carry your voice from this microphone to that soundboard.
Can't you put them someplace else?
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
"Fine, I'll do it."
"Okay, what are you doing?"
Are you mental?
"By the end of this, one out of four people in this country will know who you are."
The monkey too.
How does that sound?
What's that going to get me?
That would be great for you!
There's no file.
What do you mean there is no file?
There never was a file.
Then make a file.
"Sure, then tell me where to start."
I will.
Now.
Soon.
Stamps?
- Stamps?
What should I do with those?
I don't write letters.
I don't have anything else.
"I know, I know."
How long can you get by with this here?
"Franz, are you still there?"
Yes!
How long can you get by with this here?
I won't be here for a while you know.
Where will you be?
"Yeah, up north in Scandinavia."
Scandinavia?
That should be nice.
That's what I'm saying.
You have to make sure that you and your comrades here are taken care of.
I gave that poetry book of yours to Roswitha for her birthday.
She was quite delighted.
"I've to say as far as the home front goes, we can't let it look as if she rather have the American."
Oh!
That will be the teat.
"Teat or no teat, what all parties need... is a morally clean, romantically satisfying resolution."
Well perhaps if Mrs.Cole could carry on her good work with Hilliard on set.
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent!
Excellent!
Stick to the side...slowly forward.
Two steps.
Look to the side.
No.
Left side's the camera.
The good side.
"Mr.Ducard. Thank you, please...if you don't mind Ducard."
And...
Johnnie is hit!
Keep it in rear view please.
Thank you.
Could you move please?
Trying to get big boy up there.
Sorry.
Tea.
Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I played it rather convincing, don't you think?"
Yeah!
You did!
"Say, are...are those walkcakes?"
Like to know when it's ready.
It's very much on it's way.
"I heard a noise, just checking..."
"It's getting colder, wear an undershirt."
There are no cleaning materials left...
Dad?
Tie up yourhair.
Take care of yoursister.
"No, I still have things to take care of here."
"Kezban, enough!"
"Watch out, this could be the end of us."
"Don't worry, Dad."
This is yourfinal year anyway.
"Just finish school, do your military service, and come back home."
"Business is bad, I need help."
There is a teaching position in college here.
See?
He is lusting aftersinful gains.
"Don't keep us waiting, son."
Business is really bad.
"You don't say, dad."
Do you want me to go bankrupt?
"I can't breath without you, son."
I could've driven you.
No need.
You take care of yourhomework.
May God protect you from the evil eye.
"Finally, the nightmare is over."
They wouldn't even leave your corpse behind in Istanbul...
Damn.
My hands stink of bleach.
C'mon I'll drop you off at school.
And where you off to?
"- Misty, moisty, morning, full of birds..."
Do you want to see a miracle?
It is your law.
The puppet who made you jump in the air.
You do not jump and do not jump no more!
None!
None!
You can not understand.
I come!
I promise.
- Do you want systems too?
- No!
I have no shame.
It's not my fault.
The fault is mine.
Idiot.
Where have you hunted?
"Fear not, the police will be here in 3 minutes."
"First, let me speak."
"I, the massacrer of the evening, I was not there."
I don't know this gentlemen at all
"If you do this for me, there has never was a girl in the courtyard ..."
Silence!
What the hell on earth are you looking for?
I don't know.
We are not going to play a tambourine together.
She certainly has a motto princely.
"Wherever I walk, the rogue disappears."
"""The countess scal ..."" ie ""the barefoot princess,"" so to speak ..."
Mankiewicz ...
You have seen death the mother at the hands of Venini.
The 4 brothers Venini ...
The 4 fingers of Mickey ...
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
"Two in the neck, four in the back."
Or was stabbed three times.
Look at the pattern.
"Two, two, and two."
Three times...
With a pair of scissors.
"Yes, that's possible."
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
"- Spur of the moment, not planned."
- Plus...
The mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would've seen that."
So she was running when she left the building.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
"I guess you can say that there were 12 million people with a motive, myself included."
This was the Lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What's what?
On her fingertips.
Kaya gave me a voice message to translate to you.
It's in this thumb drive.
"I'm going to begin, ok?"
Are you mixed?
Hi Gym.
I'm sorry about keeping my interview at the factory a secret.
I love you
But we hardly have anything in common.
"For example, our interests culture attitude religion and how to live life."
I think we won't make it together.
We can't really communicate and understand each other.
Communicate my ass!
We slept together every night!
Umm I don't know.
I'm here just to translate.
"I'm going to continue, ok?"
I hope you will meet the right person one day.
You are right for me.
I don't want to listen anymore!
Ok.
That's fine.
If you don't want to listen anymore.
Wait.
You're the one who taught her English?
Yes
This is your fault!
Damn it!
What the hell are you looking at?
Is that a bomb?
"Excuse me, what is that?"
Chicken soup I think.
Chicken soup?
Taking advantage of me.
Safer to go down on the stairs!
Where're you off to?
To catch the burglar.
You look in the safe.
Don't run!
You think only you know Chinese Kung Fu?
Bet you're out of breath after the chase.
Do you know who I am?
Don't bother asking. I'll tell you.
"When I was a kid, they called me Super Kid Robin!"
Now they call me Super Sleuth Robin!
Also known as Super Shot Robin!
"You quite finished, Super Silly Sop?"
Are you ready to shoot?
You want to see me shoot?
Don't blink!
You've set 2 records in my books:
the slowest draw.
And the shortest time I've disarmed anybody.
You've got a surprise coming!
Freeze!
You got anything else to say?
- Sure!
- Go right ahead!
You haven't buttoned your pants.
You made a fool of me!
Confidential?
You want to screw my head off?
Ain't got much use anyway!
Couldn't even fix a woman.
Just wonder how you become an inspector.
You're not going in.
So what?
"What, we're just gonna stand out here all night?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
I don't even wanna go this is war.
This is war.
Programs!
Programs!
So let me get this straight.
You fell in love with his fiancée?
Before he proposed.
"Seriously, it's fine."
That makes no difference.
My guy should be the one going to the game.
Exactly.
My guy got invited first.
Your guy kissed my guy's girl.
I'm not gonna explain this again.
"Well, don't worry about it."
You don't have to.
I'm outta here.
Fine.
"So am I. You don't want to be friends, consider it done."
You know what you could use right now?
Ice cold ice cream.
Had to find some higher ground
Had some fear to get around
"Adam, it's Marjorie."
"I know that you probably hate me right now, but could you please call me?"
Please?
Last time through I hid my tracks
"So well, I could not get back."
Last number to call and last number dialled.
- How was she?
- What does that mean?
- Did she seem suspicious or anything?
- All right.
A bit trusting.
I wouldn't let anybody into my house like that.
- That's cos you're a hard-faced bitch.
- Sorry!
"Well, you steal credit cards from vulnerable women."
- Just a moment of madness?
- No.
I fell for a cheap whore in a bar.
"Well, it had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
I'd advise you two to get a room but you already have.
"Shut up, Calum."
"Now, sit nice and try not to lick the windows."
"Hello, is that the Longbay Hotel?"
"Could you put me through to lain Risdale, please."
- Yeah.
That's him.
"- John, check the words to this."
Yo!
And I ain't chatting no black talk.
"- ""Yo"" means ""I"" in Spanish."
- Very impressive.
"There's more. ""Yo no soy marinero. "" ""I ain't no sailor. """
"""Soy Capitan. "" ""I'm Captain. """
- I've found Risdale.
"- To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
And photo session is going on...
Model or their skeleton!
Look like they got sick by wearing out undergarments.
Who will buy our undergarments?
We'll have to wear them all.
"Underwear is okay, but who's going to wear the bra?"
Your father.
Dad please don't use your words.
What is happening?
"Uncle Shakespeare said, What is in the name?"
But he forgot...
What if three people share the same name?
Laxminarayan One.
Laxminarayan Two.
Laxminarayan Three.
Diamond is worth 20 crores and route is by road.
Go easily and come back with the diamond.
"Here, 2 bucks."
You'll get the diamond when you'll give him this half bill.
This diamond will bring that diamond from Pondi.
"Stop, I know you have the diamond."
We are dangerous people.
He's running.

"Sound so sweet, Keep saying it."

I mean let me show it also.
I didn't even touch.
I did nothing.
"Chandu, There's someone at the window."
"What you think we're, stupid?"
Yes !
Same me to you!
"Oh, can you believe him?"
"Look at here , Daze."
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.
Be your best in my new signature dress.
"Let them know you mean business at the disco or in the boardroom , with the amazing versatility of the premier piece in my high-end line of super stylish couture ."
"Who is better than you, girl ?"
Oh man !
How much is it ?
About 300 bucks.
How do you know ?
"I know, because Stacy Cold Pepper has got one and everybody was talking about it."
Let's get us ours'.
We can't.
Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe ..."
What?
"Again , Vi ?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
We got it.
But...
He said it was an easy gig.
right?
Yea.
"Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me , Daisy."
"we got ourselves an ""X-Men"" fan."

To the cemetary.
Your brother's grave.
My dead brother is not the problem.
Your mother is.
She might be dropping by just to say hello.
Mothers are like that.
So we're gonna go stake out a cemetary?
Until you come over with something better.
A.D.E.
What?
- After Death Experience...
- I know what it is.
My mom had one when I turned her.
Which means she saw you being turned.
By Marcus.
At the House of Chthon.
She's probably looking for me there.
"Please, please help me!"
I need to see my daughter.
I...
"Sorry, sir."
She came out of nowhere.
Not a problem.
Happens from time to time.
Is she?
Infected...
"Lane, this is Leon."
I've got a stray in the lobby who needs an immediate transportation to disposal.
"Ma'am, if you'd like to accompany these gentlemen through that door,"
I'll see to it that you receive all the attention you deserve.
"I want my daughter, where is my daughter?"
"Ma'am, we're gonna take care of you."
OK.
Bye.
Is that my phone?
Is it Charles?
"It was Charles, wasn't it?"
Yes!
Yes.
Oh!
What?
I was...
Really looking forward to that call.
Aren't you going to Amaar's press conference?
No.
Like they're waiting for me.
"Ah, how long do you think we have to wait for the mayor?"
We should just go ahead and get this thing started.
Oh!
"Remember, you are doing something amazing for the community, and you're going to be great!"
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Don't bring up the chicken.
"Good evening, residents of Mercy."
"Tonight, I stand before you, a man of faith, a man with a vision!"
A man with a purpose.
A man who is going to build a mosque in Mercy!
"It'll be our own mosque,"
No different than the mosque that we have in the church.
"If it's no different, then why do you need to build it?"
"Well, I had a vision."
That's how it all started.
"Well, not really a vision, more like a sign!"
Me too.
"I think we're ready for business, Dennis."
- Sir.
- You must be very proud of your mom.
"Yeah, being the vice president is better than being the president."
"Oh, I'm sure you're right."
'Cause nobody wants to shoot the vice president.
"So, you must be feeling pretty excited about now."
Please sit.
- Hmm?
"- Well, I think I'm a little nervous."
"Well, good!"
Good.
Night before a confirmation hearing.
"Anything else, I would've withdrawn your name."
"- What about this Webster, sir?"
"- Ah, one second."
Anybody here hungry?
"- No, thanks."
"- No, sir, I'm not."
Thanks.
"Otto, could you whip up some Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?"
"No problem, sir."
"Ah, the kid."
Met him.
"You know this young congressman, Webster?"
"No, sir, I don't."
No matter.
He reminds me of me when I was his age.
That's bad.
"K, you need to put out word that no matter what this kid does... nobody's to give him a hard time."
"He's misguided, but he's got something."
I'm suffocating here.
"- Bart, you listen!"
"- Oh, go eat some flowers!"
[ Screams ] My secret shame.
"Smithers, my plan worked perfectly."
Bart Simpson will live here as my son... and I will mold him in my own graven image.
Who knows?
I may even grow to...
love him.
Bartholomew!
Ugh!
"Smithers, get it off me!"
"- Bart, you're coming home."
- I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
I suggest you leave immediately.
Or what?
"You'll release the dogs or the bees... or dogs with bees in their mouth, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you?"
"Well, go ahead."
Do your worst.
[ Lock Slides Shut ]
He locked the door!
I'll show him!
[ Rings ]
I'm very concerned.
"Mr. Burns has stolen our son, and he won't give him back."
"Oh, for gosh-"

Damn clogs.
You good folks can rest easy because you've come to the very best in legal representation.
- How long will you be gone?
- At least till nighttime.
Nice.
Hello Miss.
I just wanted to deliver you a message from our friend Biberkopf:
He'll be home late.
Did he order you to do that?
Not exactly.
But I thought I might as well just see you and settle over what happened last night.
- Just what do you want?
- I already told you.
And there is nothing wrong visiting a beautiful young lady.
Nothing wrong with that?
It's a nice day and we will drive a bit around.
- Franz will join us!
- Franz?
Yes!
He'll meet us in the evening.
You know that we are friends.
Allright.
"It's an opportunity to have a talk with you, about Franz."
- Fine.
- Where is he?
"Freienwalde, Plumber-Karl is helping us out."
You wanted to tell me about Franz.
You've known him for quite a while.
I could talk for hours.
Great guy.
- A little weak but...
- Last night he cried in the hallway.
- What?
- He doesn't wanna go on like this.
Who did you say?
"The new arc welder, I don't know his last name."
- What new arc welder?
"- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift."
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant.
This guy took his place.
"What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?"
"Reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual, busting his ass."
"There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik."
What is this?
"Mr. Reznik, have you recently suffered any head injuries?"
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?
No.
- Trevor.
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Why do you go out of your way to come here every night?
Is it out of the way?
An airport?
For coffee and pie?
Suppose I went to Danni's...
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.
Could I do that just in any diner?
Is someone chasing you?
Not yet.
But they will when they find out who I am.
Oh really!
Who are you?
Can you keep a secret?
To the grave.
I'm Elvis Presley.
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, doctor."
"Your medication, miss Porter."
"Thank you, Gunther."
"What book are you reading, miss?"
"Uh, it's Edgar Allan poe."
Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"The tales may be dark, i know what you're saying, but through them he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he holds up a mirror to our own lives."
You're a very thoughtful woman.
"Thank you, Gunther."
"If you ever need anything ever, you just let me know."
Isabel.
"Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
Calm yourself.
"Oh, thank god."
There's a man in there.
There's blood everywhere.
I...
I just...
Dr. lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
No.
All right?
Get in the car.
What?
We're taking a little ride.
Senator.
"All right, gentlemen."
"Ah, thank you."
How are you?
Thank you for coming.
How are you?
Hi.
"We should, uh, talk to the staff about Rebecca not being able to come."
We should all be on the same page.
"- I'll get right on it, senator."
"- Hey, good to see you, senator."
"- Joe, I'm glad you could make it."
- Hey.
Yeah.
"We got those CEOs to blink, but trust me, in November, we're going to have 'em on the run."
- Senator.
"- Hey, Cathy."
- Hello.
"- Don't you worry, I promise I am going to push that through, even if I have to haul that committee into chambers myself."
Appreciate it.
Quite a turnout here.
"Thanks for hosting this, dad."
"Hey, my son, least I could do."
"You know, I would still be picking out his ties"
If he would just let me.
"Somebody needs to dress this boy, you know what I mean?"
- What's going on?
- What?
I wouldn't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex.
Just like him!
Don't say things about my father.
He was wonderful.
- Wonderful!
- And good to you.
"- You told me that, so don't blame him."
- Wonderful and good.
That's what I told you?
"Well, I lied."
I lied because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
- Then why did you marry him?
- I didn't!
He didn't marry me because he had a wife.
"- You don't mean that, Mother."
- I do mean it.
- Don't you understand?
- No.
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison.
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
"She looks so, so... ."
Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
"A few days' care, and she'll be out of it."
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And Connie just because it happened in your house, don't think any of it was your fault."
Somehow I do.
Somebody shine a light down there.
He just hit the water and... he went down.
- Davis?
Where's Davis?
- Oh!
"- [ Leo ] I want aviation, harbor."
I want some illumination now!
"- Stupid, fucking kid!"

[ Radio ] Our top story on 1 0 1 0 WINS;-
A fatal shootout on the G. W.b. and a cop's suicide.
Highway Patrol continues searching the Hudson River for the body of Officer...
"Murray ""Superboy""babitch."
- babitch leaped off the George Washington bridge last night...
"- Hey, hey, put it out."
"- an apparent suicide, after engaging in a high-speed chase."
"- Fuck you, asshole."
"There's no way that guy jumped, man."
- There's no fucking way!
- Controversy swirls around events on the bridge.
"No, I really think that it would be good for me to know why you cannot live without this other woman."
"Well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum."
"She said, ""Either we get married or we break up."""
So we got married.
Wow.
You caved.
It's complicated.
Really?
What?
You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
You marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
"I mean, shit, I don't know."
[SIGHS]
You're really hot.
And I am obviously attracted to you.
So I think the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper and call you and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
Hi.
Hi.

City Supper.
"Hi, this is Gigi."
Is Alex there?
Hold on.
- Alex?
- Yo.
- Drinks are good?
MAN:
"Yeah, one more."
"It was awful and it was terrible and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back.
"Although the Charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
"No, I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I woke up.
"Yeah, that's right."
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy.
Mercy?
Please.
"Said Puss, with his last dying breath."
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower."
"Oh, my goodness."
Why would I do that?
"And right behind you, there was danger."
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed.
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
It was packing heat and it wanted revenge!
I want revenge!
The donkey... ran.
I was giving the matter my serious consideration.
"Then when I saw him sulking, Jesus!"
"He was very good-looking, though."
Very handsome.
"Not really, Mary."
Not when you got up close to him.
Beauty's only skin deep.
"It wasn't even that deep, Mary."
He'd loads of little spots on his chin.
"Tiny, little ones, now."
Millions of them!
Only noticed 'em when you were right up against them... then you want to throw up.
He was thick as well.
"Come here, Jackie."
Was he passionate?
No!
But he thought he was.
You know what I mean?
"He was just a big, thick monkey."
"Looking for somewhere to stick his banana, what?"
Ha!
Yvonne Burgess!
He stuck his tongue in me ear once... and I'm not joking yous.
He was trying to get it out the other one.
Don't know what he thought I had in there.
"His sense of direction wasn't the best, either."
- Know what I mean?
- Jackie O'Keefe!
"You're bleedin' disgusting, you are!"
"Any news, Sharon?"
No.
Not really.
We are moving.
What do you mean?
The factory is cutting back.
There is no work for Rolf.
He got offered a position as a mechanic in Notodden.
And I got a job at the bag factory there.
What does Lise say to this?
Does she want to go?
- We need money.
"- Yes of course, I'm sorry."
We leave this Friday.
- Friday?
What about the concert?
"- No, it..."
We were supposed to go together.
"I'm going to see if we can postpone it, so that Lise can go to the concert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, I'm just being stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about Friday?
Do you know anyone who can postpone the shipment?
- Yes.
"Do it by tomorrow, then we'll postpone until Sunday."
"- Excuse me, Sir."
- Tronstad.
- Have you got a minute?
"- Yes, what can I do for you?"
How sure are we?
How far down the line are they with the bomb?
Any new information I haven't got?
"Well, we're never sure."
"Seigaku regular, second year student, Kaidou Kaoru."
You'd better not regret.
You will lose.
What did you say.
Well he looks quite cute.
He's really good!
"You alright, senpai?"
Such beautiful spinning ball...
It's my first time seeing something like that.
"Hey, hey, hey, ah Kaidou?"
Who's he playing with?
That must be the transfer student Ryuzaki-sensei was talking about.
"Heh, you can even spin the ball into such an angle."
Snake shot.
Game Kaidou.
One love.
Court change.
So it'll be like this.
"If it continues like this, he will..."
My reaction is getting slower.
I can't be losing to this chibi?
This is a match of perseverance.
I won't lose.
Heh...
This person even knows the Snake.
"That is a Buggy Whip shot, right."
It's quite difficult to use since this is my first time trying it.
First time?
"Senpai, you sure are sweating a lot."
You'll wet that uniform.
The weather's so hot yet you're dressed so weirdly.
It's not over.
The universe is cold and unfeeling.
The only constant is chaos.
Was that place out of chocolate-chip pancakes again?
We were all almost killed by a truck.
Ay!
Idios mío!
"Are you okay, papi?"
"This was all Phil's fault, wasn't it?"
He's always blaring that damn new wave music!
No.
He swerved to avoid it.
Saved my life.
But the game of life is rigged.
Death always win.
"Okay, I know what you need right now..."
A trip to the ice-cream shop.
He doesn't need ice cream.
He needs to talk about what just happened to him.
"Well, I could go for some ice cream."
I know how to fix my son.
"So, this is fixed."
Go around.
"Normally, I'd be avoiding these cracks out of respect of your back, mom, but after today, it seems pointless."
- That's it.
Get in.
"- No, no."
"No, Jay, he's afraid!"
It's only gonna get worse.
In.
Trust me.
"Five minutes in here, he'll be happy as a clam."
Aah!
Guys!
"We found the perfect spot for the mosque, but it's going to get torn down."
"Ann, you have to stop it!"
"I don't know, Amaar!"
It seems like an awful lot of work.
It's the old schoolhouse at the edge of town.
"Yeah, it's probably rubble by now."
"No, Rayyan's keeping it safe for now, but you have to save it."
Amaar!
"We are in big trouble, which actually proves my point, but that's not the issue right now."
- What are you talking about?
- Mayor.
"Baber, Amaar, you two responsible for that van outside, right?"
"Huh, yeah, I guess so."
Why?
Oh!
"Cuff me, I won't resist."
"Just don't tase me, bro!"
Why would I cuff you for parking in a handicap spot?
Illegal parking?
"Oh, good!"
Because I thought
You were here because of the bomb in the back of the van.
- Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
- Wha..
"- Well, now you're under arrest."
- You can't arrest him!
-
- I'm afraid the law says otherwise.
"- Oh, come on, Paul!"
-Look at the neutral strip in this direction.
-Why isn't he making any shots?
- He does not shoot because he is an ace.
"- OK, he will not hide from us."
We'll get him afterthe sun moves to the right position.
-There are about 20 minutes left.
-And what?
-The sun will get a little bit lower.
-And what?
-Have patience and you'll see.
"- Listen, let me get out with the cap on."
Wearing this cap?
Stay quiet.
He will not hit me.
"And if he makes a shot, you'll fire."
Remain seated.
He knows your cap.
-Why am I sweating in it?
- l dunno.
What are you doing?
Were you fond of playing with sun reflections in your childhood?
Surely.
So I recall my childhood.
At about one the reflection will get directly into his eyes.
And we'll see what he does.
"If he shoots,"
He'll think I'm dead.
Why did you become so silent?
Hey!
Go on talking.
I feel merrierthat way.
It is this buffoon again!
Adam!
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I was trying to save the Bank.
I was trying to fix it but Dad made so much mess.
I fucking hated him.
That's why I hated you.
"Ok, gents, let's go."
You coming?
Of course I'm coming.

Good evening!

Are you here with the token?
Token?
I'm here to show you your qualities.
Take look.
Take look how ACP Ayushman Thakur... is openly assaulting an injured man... in a quiet housing-society.
The people demand an answer from the police.
Because if the protector turns cruel... then whom will the people go to?
The police are often accused...
Mr. Pradhan those with name...
"Dad, you've already hung him up for one whole day"
Let me release him!
Stop!
Betraying one's school is a serious violation
"This bastard, I'll teach him a good lesson"
Dad!
You don't need to beg me on his behalf!
I've invited some leaders here... to discuss how to get rid of the Three Devils
I'll also take this chance to clear up our school!
Clear up our school?
"Master, you mean..."
I'll dispose him of all his vital energy
"In front of everybody, so as to show the world"
My sense of justice!
Dad!
Dad!
I'm so itchy
"3rd Brother, I need some water"
"I'm so dry, 3rd Brother!"
I need some water!
3rd Brother!
"Quick, I need a drink"
What?
Better say your last wish fast!
I'm so thirsty!
Give me some water!
"Water, sure!"
Let me give you the best soup in the world
It'll surely soothe you!
Come down!
I'm high up here.
If you don't let me down
Lunch.
"- So what do you got today, Mel?"
"Liverwurst and Swiss, I think."
"Oh, yeah."
There's liverwurst and Swiss.
Yeah.
"All three of 'em, liverwurst and Swiss."
You wanna swap?
I got a bacon and avocado... and a tuna fish and tomato on a kaiser roll
I'll give you the liverwurst and Swiss for the tuna fish and tomato... and I'll throw in a piece of chocolate cake.
"No, you keep the chocolate cake."
"Besides, I got a piece of, lemon meringue pie anyway."
"Well, I gotta get rid of one of these sandwiches."
Toss it down the shaft.
"Oh, we have a... wastepaper basket here."
I'll throw it out.
Ah.
"Thanks a lot, fella."
That's nice of you.
Thank you.
"- Hi, honey."
"- Hi, sweetheart."
Happy birthday.
"Well, how was your day?"
"Fine, fine."
No... surprises.
I just hope it stays that way.
"Well, honey, you're really gonna be surprised, because there's no surprise party."
"- Just five friends and a nice, quiet dinner."
- Good.
Come on.
Take off your coat.
She'd drink her children's blood from her lover's skull and not feel a stomachache.
"alfred, go home."
"Put it into verse, I'II publish it."
Then you'II get paid.
Thanks to you I can't go to the baroness's party.
"- In fact, I'II have to leave Paris."
- No more advances.
"I don't need your money, old sow."
I've had an invitation to the country.
"From a duchess, no less."
Good day.
(strains of piano music)
(coughs)
This summer dust is ruinous to my lungs.
I hope the air will be better in Angers.
The Duchess d'Antan has invited you too?
"- well, yes."
- How delightful.
"please continue, dear fellow."
"- Good day, Countess."
- (gasps) George!
- I'm sorry I frightened you.
- (baby cries)
I had the most fearful dream.
BIandine was a terrible creature with fly's wings that was draining my Iife from me.
They are deadly little charmers.
Chromatic gIissando.
The wings of a butterfly.
Or the wrath of God.
(baby cries)
"He wakes the baby, then complains about the crying."
- How is Franz?
- What's your problem?
- You think I have lost it?
Think about it.
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?
I mean why is Zak coming after a boring banker?
Hold on a second!
Who's boring?
"I'm a crowd puller, okay?"
- Everybody knows that.
It's nothing new.
"- Shiv, this is not funny!"
What is not funny?
I'm not being funny!
What are you saying?
All of this is connected.
Okay?
"In fact, even the comet..."
"All of this has happened before, Shiv."
You have to believe this.
I have to believe this!
"What...what...what are you saying, baby?"
"You are an educated, English speaking, modern girl who lives in Europe."
You make chocolates!
Why are you saying such strange things?
"What do I do, I don't have any proof."
"- Hey baby, what are you doing?"
- Just a second!
"Baby, you cannot use sex to make me believe."
I'm reminding you of your birthmark.
"Just think, why do you have it?"
This is where Zak had attacked you.
Talking menschkeit.
Stuff between men.
"The """"there"""" that's there."
The thousand telephone calls.
The bouquets and the brickbats.
The space between a handshake.
You know.
Stuff that goes with you to your grave.
There's space between a handshake for right and wrong?
Why are you pressing me?
I'm looking for an answer.
You want an answer?
"Okay, Pappy."
Think of it as colors.
There's black and there's white.
And in between is mostly gray.
That's us.
Gray's tough because it's not as simple as black and white.
"And for the media, certainly not as interesting."
But it's who we are.
What are you gonna do now?
"You mean """"we. """""
We'll fight the sons of bitches.
We're gonna come out swinging.
"We're gonna tell them, """"Hey!"
We're only human.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Frank Anselmo is dead.
He was a friend...
"... butthelast of the clubhouse bosses is gone. """""
We're gonna clean up the Augean stables.
We'll go to Miami...
They were tight for space.
"You see, we got about 210 cubic feet, so we can move around."
"If you ever go up there again, will you take me along?"
Ha-ha-ha.
What for?
First missionary on Mars.
"Tell me, was it public relations you did for the Gestapo or community relations?"
-I'm Swiss.
"-Yes, of course."
"And you never went bowling with Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh?"
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
-It's a red brick wing.
-Saint Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
He has black hair.
He's very intense looking.
Who's that?
-Damien Karras.
-Karras?
"That's his office, back of Saint Mike's."
He's our-
- Our psychiatric counselor.
"He had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Cunting Hun.
"Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig."
Stop it!
I got knocked up.
So my man proposed to me.
No.
Why did you have to quit too?
I'm pregnant.
He doesn't want me to work.
You can still work even if you're pregnant.
"If I was pregnant, I would still work."
You don't understand.
"I am having a baby, and it will affect the baby."
"If you play that card, there's nothing more to say."
Why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
You told me we would work side by side forever.
Yeah I did say that.
I'm sorry.
But you understand right?
I don't.
You can't do this to me.
Are you really mad?
You have no right to be mad!
Why can't I?
No.
Listen and stop worrying.
Your jobs won't disappear.
"I'll find a new person to take my place, okay?"
Why so mad?
Because nobody can replace you.
You can find someone better.
But I don't want it.
It's not you.
"For me, there is no Je 2."
"- Good morning, Miss."
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
"Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?"
Walk march!
Forward!
"Party, halt!"
"Sgt. Ballantine, take charge."
"Go inside, dear."
I'll be right with you.
"All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon."
"- Naik, what about this?"
"- He just came back, Sergeant sahib."
"Come here, you."
"Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this."
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
"- Please, sahib."
"You stole the elephant, didn't you?"
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
"Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?"
"- Yes, sahib."
- That's all!
Take him away!
"You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!"
"Wait a minute, Mac."
"Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?"
"All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too."
"As long as I'm alive, you live."
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
"He says to keep order, be confident, and wait."
"Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language."
That's enough.
Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on.
Get on back.
"Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?"
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down.
Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
"- Yes, sahib, gold!"
"Look at it, mates!"
Gold!
That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
"- Sit down, you fool!"
See that hand sticking out?
"I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!"
Who's a blinking idiot now?
"We're rich, mates."
Come on!
"All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer."
- There was a shipwreck.
And the captain thought he saw the ghosts.
Le Bosco was also acting strangely
- And at dawn
- What happened at dawn?
They were in the marshes near the haunted ruins at dawn.
And now -
There they are.
How do you know all of this?
I just know.
What if they're still alive?
"For God's sake, shut up"
The captain has shut himself in his house.
He's afraid.
You're all crazy!
You know what's hidden away in the ruins.
If they made it there
Two girls.
Wounded and exhausted!
I think they must have drowned!
I hope so
If they are hiding in the ruins and they free
Don't mention his name!
We don't really know what's hiding in the ruins.
Yeah.
But if they manage to get that far... what will happen?
All I know is that no one has been there for at least a century.
Shut up!
You don't know what you're talking about.
- Do you understand?
- Help!
Stop it!
- Where's the cook?
- Eating at Rosie's!
[ All Chanting ] Kill the cook.
Kill the cook!
Kill the cook!
See what you've done?
"Father, you'd better talk to them."
- Not without a whip and a chair.
- I don't blame you.
This place is a cat's whisker from loco.
- [ Chanting Continues ]
- I'll take care of this.
"Okay, hold it."
Hold it down!
"Hold it down, everybody!"
"I was hoping we could keep this a secret, but I guess now's the time to tell you."
[ Clamoring ]
My associate and I have been planning a big surprise dinner party for tomorrow night.
"Oh, yeah?"
What kind of a party?
That's the surprise.
But I guarantee you... it will be spectacularly unforgettable.
Well it better be!
It better be!
What kind of a lamebrain scheme are you two hatching?
"- Oh-ho, Colonel, that would spoil the surprise."
"- Let's go, Beej."
This I gotta see.
Don't forget-- unforgettable.
"- You don't have a thing in mind, do you?"
- Even less than that.
David?
- Who's staying with mcgee?
- I can.
If you want tony to check out the other real estate women.
Fine with me.
"Tony,stay with mcgee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smell like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dt,sweat... and sandalwood."
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant,so I used yours."
"No,you didn'T."
"Ye,we're partners."
What's the big al?
A hair!
"Come on,you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ound radar techs didn't show till dawn.
Mcgee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very brokeback mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."
""" How romantic."
I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well,I can show it to you on my new phone-- it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
Right?
Even that is a fanatic of arrangements.
"Well, O-wakama introduce yourself."
My name is Wakama.
"She's being taught to act normal in a general way, bur..."
"It's because she don't know the meaning of "" hard work """
O-Waka -chan!
Matsuki-chan!
Son of a bitch!
""" This body of mine have I received for my parents... ..And to keep it safe from harm is my first filial duty..."""
Don't you know?
Matsukichi!
You are not just some clerk sitting on a reception to have irezumi.
You are disinherited!
O-Waka-chan.
Matsuki-chan!
What happened?
I've just been said by my father that I'm disinherited.
But...
Matsuki-san...
You are his only son.
Aren't you?
It doesn't matter.
I was being forced to...
"From now on, finally I'll become a firefighter."
You were like this since you were a child.
Matsuki-san.
But... if that happens...
I...
I want to see you Matsuki-san.
I want to see you as soon as possible.
Don't worry.
I'm picking entire bloody structure either.
"Could you get from the high over there, please?"
Of course the irony is... they've given this to a bloody documentaries director.
He won't want any dialog anyway.
It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football.
You wait.
"What if, it's not what the American does that makes us put our work?"
It's what he doesn't do.
He falls for those.
He doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.
Self sacrifice.
That's noble.
Only if he stands a chance?
Maybe he does.
Maybe she likes him because he is the sort who let her fix the propeller.
"So give him a name ""Margenes""."
Joe.
Hard boiled types only have last names.
Buckley.
Taken.
Now what were you before you became Cole?
Catrin Pule.
Kathrine?
Catrin's the Welsh version.
It was his idea.
A beautiful Welsh girl deserves a beautiful Welsh name.
Where would you've drawn the line?
Cardiff Cole.
Caffeine Cole.
Coalmine Cole.
Hey!
?
I didn't know you smoke.
Me either.
"How many times have we risked our lives together, and I still don't know..."
What time period I'm from?
Yes.
It's so long ago I don't even remember it.
Are you Captain Pascual?
"-At your orders, Commander."
Come with me.
(Train whistle)
"At your orders, Your Excellence."
Where is Álvarez Estrada?
"Indisposed, Your Excellency."
And you are...?
"Captain Pascual at your orders, Your Excellency."
Where did you serve in the War?
"-With Generals Gil y Yuste, intelligence services in Álava, Your Excellency."
Good reference.
Do you understand the importance of these negotiations?
"Yes, Your Excellency."
"Well then, I am in your hands, because I get by with my English, but my German..."
Damn devil's language.
"You can be at ease, Your Excellency."
At ease?
With Hitler?
Impossible.
He's so high-strung.
How could a corporal have come so far?
20 SS?
"Well the plan is fucked, because we only have four more men here."
There's only 8 of you?
And the civil guard?
So what?
So what?
So what?
Non ce l'hai un po 'di roba?
"Your lovely brothers Simon and Edgar, for example?"
"Are too high, we do not reach."
"- Yes, at 5 am, Edgar is the white Rue Lénine a Charenteuil ..."
- It's on us.
None of the stuff?
"Company ""Avvenire and Health"", at 12th"
"Do not fear, not sanguinerà forever."
I am in the habit!
Stop!
"Company ""The future and health""."
The joke that we do that will put a new license plate:
"""Past and cancer."""
"Come on, parties, burn!"
Even you.
"My brother Leon, then Mickey Venini and Edgar ..."
It is doing this Venini?
It is a panzone Cosetta with or with the things?
I see no uniforms!
It is the director of the company buildings.
I am in business with him.
Your business shit!
Ti cages and you believe in the system?
"You saying, you do not have dignity!"
Affecting the family business?
Are you sick of paranoia!
I want the recipe.
"It's too complicated for you, will never understand."
What I can not understand?
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser, just hang on."
We're gonna get you off that thing.
"No, you're not."
Let me help you.
You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh, I know."
Just can't see from up there.
"So what I told you on the phone, that help you catch him?"
Windward Elementary.
So I was right.
Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb, ""Twin Tree"" clue, you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'll be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news, just give it to me straight."
He modified it.
I'm gonna have to improvise.
Modified it how?
- You should be afraid.
I can't allow you...
I don't care about the timeline.
You're taking me back now.
"Look, Sara, I'm sure there's a valid reason why Rip didn't..."
Stay out of this!
"What the hell, Rip?"
"Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance to sleep it off."
"Not to dismiss what just happened, but we do have to find Savage, assuming that Kendra and Carter are still on his timeship."
- He could...
- Be anywhere in time and space.
"Oh, well that narrows it down a lot."
Sorry.
Was this always over here?
"No, it lives over..."
- Did you put it there?
"- Nah, man."
- Did you?
"- Dude, it's just a helmet."
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?
"Temporal changes can, on occasion, reverberate through the timeline, physically moving an object from one place to another."
- Gideon?
"- Yes, Captain."
"Plot a course for Saint-Lô, France, 1944."
Why then?
Because that's where Kendra is.
How is that possible?
She sent us a message through time.
"Go ahead, say it."
Astonishing.
Oh.
Did he hang himself?
No... he goofed it up.
He...
The rain.
What's up with you?
Soft in the head?
Did you get lost?
Yes.
"Here, with you."
"It's not like in the movies or in books, where everything is precise, thought-out, organized... with a clear-cut goal."
"Everything's chaos, chance... pain... disorder..."
"Still, my way of putting things in order is to get them, one by one, my mother's lovers."
There's one left.
Do you want me to tell?
No.
What for?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There's only a war.
Listen.
I can't hear anything.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
"You're gliding too high, friend."
You're gonna crawl back.
I won't cushion your descent.
You're overdosing.
"If I were human, I'd waste you here and now."
I'm not going to be human.
I won't go back on my word.
"I wouldn't want to hurry you, but theaters run on precise timetables."
Go betweens too.
That's the reason why they hate me.
Petreius:
Why do you stay with me?
Why don't you simply leave me to my solitude?
"Because I love you, like my own son."
You love me?
Like your son?
"I love you, too!"
Where are you?
I can live with the election of Claudius Tiberius but he must restore all our privileges.
Don't worry.
Claudius will do anything we want.
But we still didn't solve one problem:...
Who is going to kill Caligula?
And how will it happen?
I'll take care of this problem.
I know who is going to kill Caligula.
Who will kill that monster!
Checkmate.
What news of marathon?
Will Greece be saved?
The Persian sun will pass.
my brave heart.
"Stop it, Daddy, stop it."
"Hey, Dad, come on upstairs and we can play my new electronic game I bought."
"Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy."
"Oh, come on."
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?
"- Well, I just don't."
mom could play with us.
Ha!
That's all from mini-golf right there.
No lessons.
Can you believe it?
"I don't know what you think you're doing here, but..."
I was just starting to count the number of your fingers
I'm gonna break.
Get it?
You know what?
"I'm not too good at math, so I might lose count here."
Wait.
Ah!
He paid me.
A lot of money.
- For what?
"- To make up test results, phony prescriptions, medical bills."
- Why?
- I don't know.
You know who your father is.
I didn't ask questions.
I did it as I was told to do.
He came to me with a lot of cash.
"He said he needed a terminal illness, so I gave him one."
Ah!
"Jesus, Victor."
We need to get something straight about this partnership.
I'm in charge here.
- You work for me.
- Okay.
"Every decision about this party has been made for a reason, so before you go unwinding my hard work,"
- you might want to get...
- What the hell are you
EZRA:
Josiah.
So you have any biblical parables on hand for unrepentant grifters?
No.
-Someone here to see you.
travis:
"Mrs. Standish, I presume."
-l'm Judge Travis.
-My goodness.
You are even more impressive than your reputation.
Yeah?
Well... .
My daughter-in-law believes that Mr. Wingo's charges may be false.
I wanna know why Mr. Wingo would cause...
... hisproperty to be discovered on you.
Well?
What will happen to me if I'm found guilty?
-Are you saying the charges are true?
-Definitely not.
travis:
"Madam, get yourself in hand."
Mr. Jackson's going on trial for murder.
I don't have any time for horseplay.
Mr. Wingo is adamant that you stole his property.
And you are equally adamant that you did not.
"I wanna know the truth, and I wanna know it quickly."
"Ezra, are you acting as my attorney or not?"
Not so long as you leave me in the dark.
"Ezra, take care of this."
I got a trial to convene.
Good day.
"My, my, my, judge."
- Okay.
Where you going?
- Subway.
- I thought we were gonna walk.
It's 15 blocks.
"Come on, I think you'll like it."
- Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
- You are so an out-of-towner.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm one of the graduates.
Wow.
You're hours early.
I just wanted to beat traffic... and have time to get ready and relax and also I've heard... the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains.
- This is true.
Take your pick.
- Thank you.
This is so exciting.
Isn't this exciting?
This is my eighth year of doing this.
So not so exciting for you.
Got it.
You're being so cryptic.
Do you need a power source or not?
My batteries are all fully charged.
It just depends on how fast they deplete.
- So we need one just in case.
- Mom.
"Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony."
What are you doing here?
"I'm sorry, what are you doing here?"
How do you even know about this?
Like John Garfield in Body and Soul.
Exactly.
John Garfield.
"People tell you that, Father?"
Do people tell you you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
"Well, you know this director who was doing the film here Burke Dennings?"
I've seen him.
You've seen him.
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
All of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
"Some rituals used in the black mass, maybe."
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"And please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M Street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
Didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
What's different about it?
There's nothing different about it.
You're just like your father.
So easy to trip up.
"- So, how was work?"
- Same as always.
Although I had one customer come in looking for a makeover.
She needed one.
"Dyed blonde hair, blue eye shadow, ash brown foundation."
Hideous.
"Anyway, she was shocked when she found out how old I was."
Oh.
How old were you?
Sorry.
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.
He wants to take me to some Alzheimer's benefit.
I said forget it.
I can't believe he still asks you after all these years.
Why don't you go with him sometime?
"Please, those days are over."
I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband.
That's my life.
I have no interest in starting another one.
"Besides, he knows my situation with you."
You're not seeing him because of me?
How would it look?
"The mother's dating, and the daughter stays home alone."
"Mom, who's looking?"
Hello.
Hi.
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
Hey!
How about a drink for you and your men?
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
"Listen, ""Herr Mac""."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
Freulein Ravenwood.
Let me show you what I am used to.
Nick!
Take your lousy hands off!
wait..
I.. can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that...wait..
I'll tell you everything.
Yes.
I know you will.
Let here go!
...Whiskey?
"Shoot them, Shoot them both."
My medallion!

"Boy, you're something!"
Yeah?
I'll tell you what.

I'm your goddamn partner!
He was starving...
Yoyo!
He has a fever and his stomach ached.
Yoyo!
Where was I just now?
You were getting nowhere.
Because I don't know what you're talking about.
You still remember the good old days?
"""l remembered the love song she used to sing."""
"""Even in my dreams I will always remember."""
"""Her tender love warms my heart."""
"""The good old days I will always remember."""

"""The calm water rippled as you left me!"""
"""Our love will never be forgotten."""
You know how I suffered these 3 years?
But I have my own difficulties.
Difficulties?
Why did you get engaged to Fat Pig?
It's all because of you.
Me?
You shouldn't marry Fat Pig.
You should marry me.
"Sooner or later, you'll know how much I love you."
Love?
Action speaks louder than words.
Can you wait?
Did you make it?
"If you didn't come, I would have made it."
What?
I meant the 'Beast'.
is that necessary?
Herman will see you've slept with me.
- ls he jealous?
- You better believe it.
- And where'll I sleep from now on?
- l'll show you.
He's staying all next week.
It'll give me lots of time for the treatment.
What'll you say about me?
That you're a writer in need of some peace.
He knows I'm a member of the Literature Club.
"Isn't it a bit perverse, Christine taking in two lovers at once?"
Perverse?
You're going to help me with Herman?
You care about as much for Herman as for me: not at all.
A great deal.
"Take the keys, so you can come and go as you like."
We'll be back late.
Bye...
Give Herman my regards.
"I will, and you start your novel!"
Drive carefully!
Chapter One
When I arrived at V. yesterday...
"Damn... I'm wearing your shirt, Johan!"
Home movies?
Johan.
Henk.
Gé?
"Snip, snip, snip..."
Do you take Christine to be your lawful wedded wife?
What is your reply?
ELl JOE:
You're thinking it's cowardly.
I think it's smart.
"See, I know all about your six amigos."
You all been making quite a name for yourselves around here.
"Real proud of yourself, ain't you?"
ELl JOE:
"Yeah, I suppose."
But it had to be done.
"See, I haven't been sleeping too well ever since I pinned that murder on you."
Your conscience bothering you?
[chuckling ] I ain't got a conscience.
How about Jess Kincaid?
You killed an innocent farmer just to frame me for murder.
"Got you off my trail, didn't it?"
This little voice inside keeps telling me...
... VinTanner'sgonnacome looking for me.
Settle out both scores.
So I figured I'd find you first.
I'm glad I did.
Let's do this.
Gotta get back on the trail.
MAN:
Take cover.
YATES:
Don't let him get away.
Get him.
What took you so long?
I thought you might need this.
Yah!

No need to rush in all at once.

You know the market.
We make millions!
Think!
Thanks for the shirt.
"It is still in a coma, but outside dition."
That's better.
But you should have just obiæi neighborhood and find out how much it is.
"I'm sorry it was, but I thought that crime police shoot so bad."
"Squat is closed, all in all good."
It is celebrated?
"Nothing, drink appetizer."
I'll tell you what we are celebrating.
Here I am in the lab.
They found 2 samples DNA on the bag and Cetin head.
When will the results?
Tomorrow.
I told you if you trust in me.
"–Yeah, man."
How's retirement?
–I'm shaving' a few strokes off my golf game.
–You look good.
–You I don't know.
–Ronnie Gardocki.
Joe Clarke.
Taught your boss everything he knows.
"Yeah, but you didn't teach me everything you know, right?"
That's right.
I'm saving some.
–We're gonna grab a bite.
Wanna go?
–They're busy.
"When I miss tee time at Riviera for this, you better be buying."
Riviera?
Since when do they let hacks like you play at Riviera?
You guys still here?
Come on!
"Hey, who was that with Vic?"
"–Joe Clarke, his old partner."
–They kicked him off the force.
–Why is that?
–Some punk took a swing at his last partner.
Joe knocked out like half of his teeth in front of this crowd.
Total railroad job.
Don't worry.
It's nothing like what you're going through.
So it's been a year since you called me up.
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?
Can't I buy you lunch?
"You are Erik Berg, right?"
Hello.
I know you.

What the hell was that about?
- Who is it?
- It's Niklas.
He's good.
"What I said earlier, it was ..."
Call it a gut feeling.
"Oh, that's still annoying, you know."
What is?
You talking in riddles and intuition.
You never change.
Yeah.
So has he?
"You know, contacted you?"
I haven't seen or heard from James in 15 years.
"And, uh, the irony's not lost on me"
That you're the one who's asking.
Carol.
Carol.
Look at me.
"No matter what you think,"
I'm not the one who drove him away.
You made things intolerable for all of us.
"Well, if it--if it makes you comfortable to blame me,"
Then you should go ahead and blame me.
I don't care.
But the truth is that you made choices.
And the choices you made--you chose badly.
I'm not the one who disappeared.
"Oh, there it is."
How did I not know?
What?
What--not know what?
"Oh, stop it, Artie."
You're in town for whatever reason and you decide to twist the knife
For old time's sake.
Rub it in that I chose the wrong guy.
Right.

Updates on Ridgeway's shooter.
Go.
Ridgeway was shot three days ago.
Ryan's had eyes on Wickes for the last week.
He wasn't the triggerman.
"Well, he could have ordered it earlier."
"McGee, e-mails?"
Wickes has contacted three people since we suggested the AUTEC connection to the SECNAV's shooting.
ZIVA:
"Bob ""Smitty"" Smith, Ronald Ostrowski, and Vice President Frank Satner."
TONY:
All haunt the Wickes Steel boardroom.
Whole lot of motive going on.
"Working to clear their backgrounds, but so far, all talks have been work-related and clean."
Look for codes.
Yeah.
And cross-reference keywords with recent e-mails.
Whoever shot Ridgeway wanted to keep him quiet for a reason.
Could be this.
Report detailing the project
Ridgeway worked on for AUTEC.
"Well, it's been redacted."
Yeah.
Can we get access?
Mm.
Won't be a cakewalk.
Leads on the AUTEC hacker?
"Whoever he is, he's good."
Hid his IP behind a wall of alternating secure servers.
We need to get in this report.
Okay.
RYAN:
Really.
Yeah.
it's...
Huh?
Tanaka... and his parents had to put in a missing person's report.
But he suddenly came back yesterday.
Tanaka?
You looked kind of pale.
what're you doing?
!
Help...me...!
STOP!
Yu!
are you alright?
what is Noah all about?
!
And what the hell is this supposed to be?
!
you are next.
an entire Arcam research party was killed on Mt.
Ararat in Turkey?
I did happen to hear that.
Noah's ark was later discovered in that place.
Noah's ark?
as it was written through the 7th and 9th chapters of the book of Genesis in the Old Testament.
The humans that God made had grown to become incredibly evil.
God regretted his creation and decided to destroy man.
a man who's heart was right with God to build an ark for his family and for two of every living animal on Earth.
What does any of that have to do with this?
!
Let me finish the entire story.
a different research party was attacked by someone at another location.
"No, thank you."
"You don't want to touch the consecrated objects, do you?"
"Step back, please."
The train is about to leave.
Come on.
- I've calculated ten minutes to the refinery.
- Excellent.
I hope the train won't be late.
"All right, my dear chaplain."
Let's go.
"Hey, Padre Julio!"
How long have you been back?
What a surprise!
Are you going to keep us company?
Tell us a funny story.
- Will this wagon blow up as well?
"- Well, the bomb is close to it."
"Come on, we're about to leave."
I'm really glad to see you again.
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, and you?"
"- Same old, same old."
- Take my hand.
- This is Padre Alonso.
- Pleased to meet you.
Why don't you sit down?
What happened to Padre Aginaldo?
The poor chap has appendicitis.
We had him taken to Puerto Silas.
That's why the bishop sent Padre Alonso.
- I'm going with him to show him the area.
- I'm sorry to hear about Padre Aginaldo.
ORWELL:
Trouble in the dream team?
(BANG)
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
Come on!
ANNA:
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
"That's a good thing, eh?"
"No, thin like you're not eating properly."
Oh.
"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we going to do this now?
- Good night for a date.
- Our tenth anniversary.
- How do you know it was a date?
I just wanted to see you.
"I haven't asked you anything about whether or not you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to, Harry, cos I just can't."
He's a friend.
- Oh...
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"That's very convenient for him, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
- What?
Aren't you?
- You're right!
"Letting your dad rot in jail, that's serious."
"Changing your name, that's Napoléonic!"
"What part are you going to play in your new family, shit-guzzler?"
"Shit, help me, Matalon!"
"How long have I been saying she's nuts, boss?"
"Start digging your grave, dickhead!"
Yours will only need a lid on top.
Music!
Roll end credits!
- I love you!
- My God.
Can you stomach this?
You should have gone to a posh deli in Neuilly.
- Does he love her or something?
- He hates her!
Who the hell asked you?
"And who's you, anyway?"
"Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you."
Idiot!
You'll regret that very much.
"So, Léo!"
What do you think of Parisian Nights?
"This is nothing, wait for the main course!"
Don't you miss the pigs?
"- You won't snout, will you?"
- No.
Why?
I don't judge anyone.
Who judges the judges here?
"Men who have women and friends, they're shelters from justice."
Can you keep on picking my dishes?
"I admit that I was worried at start how would I get used to another man's presence under my roof, but Fabian was so quiet and unnoticeable that I even felt unpleasant."
As if I asked this from him.
I haven't seen him for days.
Yes?
Good...
How do you do.
"A coffee, maybe?"
If you don't mind.
Ok.
Come on in.
"You're puzzled about all this, right?"
About my charts.
Yes.
What is it?
"I'm into statistics, you know."
Only as a hobby.
I classify all kinds of data.
"I may show you sometimes, if you want."
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Nice day.
And you already got up.
- I haven't even slept.
"Why, are you suffer from insomnia?"
I was working until a minute ago.
You know how it is.
It's better not to leave it for tomorrow.
"Tomorrow, one may get a toothache, or a headache..."
"The years are later, too."
And then it's late for ideas.
"You've been working with statistics, right?"
- Yes.
Oh!
Thank you for letting me come with you.
you are so good!
Where are you going?
To find some food.
Stay and rest;
I'll be back.
please bless her.
Lord.
she's very old.
There's no need to apologize.
I know Master Boaz would want to help you.
You see those women there?
They're gleaners.
Many of them are widows like yourself.
Follow them and you can gather up all the loose grain you see.
Daniel?

I think that's very kind.
May God bless you for it.
Thank you.

Let some extra grain fall for her.

Shannon is on the trail of a creature known locally as The Beast.
She's brought us to the exact spot where we stand the best chance of seeing it tonight.
The full moon is about to rise and the creatures of the night are coming out to play.
And cut.
Nice.
Very poetic.
Don't let me get too fancy.
I don't want to lose the audience.
"So, how do you want to do this?"
Steve!
What is that?
A secure container.
Harmless but inescapable.
We're going to catch The Beast.
Our first time as a family.
I feel like I should make a speech.
You'd better make it quick if you don't want to end it growling.
Come on.
The moon won't wait.
Maddy?
I'm sorry.
- Maddy!
- Open this door.
Don't you dare!
Maddy!
Open this door now!
I'll see you in the morning.
"- Maddy, I mean it!"
- You are in trouble...
Are you sure about this?
No.
So hurry before I lose my nerve.
I was always strongly attracted to you.
And you knew it.
So did Wilton.
That's why The Foundation saw so little of me.

"Well, then don't play with her."
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?
(LAUGHING MANICALLY)
Stop that.
What a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
-Hat it?
-Yes.
"I used to hat the White Queen, you know."
"Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear."
Her head is so small.
It's tiny.
It's a pimple of a head.

The trees seem sad.
-Have you been speaking with them?
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
Perhaps a bit more kindly.
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.
"-What news, Bayard?"
I rang you.
A lot of people ring me.
A lot of people ring me.

Maybe we were God's mistake.
What a disappointment you are.

Hooked on barbiturates.

May I know who's leaving?
I can't tell you yet.
It's not yet official.
Is that all?
Oh!
Wait!
There.
"You have a good team, it seems."
"- So, that's it?"
- Yes.
- Do you know who's going?
- They wouldn't say.
"It's not official, right?"
"Don't worry, we'll fight."
I'm not worried.
I must tell you...
"I couldn't say with Maillet there, but you're on the list."

"Excuse my tardiness, Baroness, please."
Mr Nanteuil is a French Canadian.
"With the capitals he brought, my bank, our bank, is now the first private bank in Paris."
"I am very happy for you, Mr Barbey."
You will therefore find it easier to give me the money I asked.
"Unfortunately, no."
It is no longer the same operation.

"No, Elias."
Don't!
"Elias, don't!"
"Elias, do you hear me?"
Help!
"Oh Lord, watch over them."
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
The Oracle's words stand as a warning.
A prophecy.
Sparta will fall.
All of Greece will fall.
And Persian fire will reduce Athens to cinder.
"For Athens is a pile of stone and wood... and cloth and dust and, as dust, will vanish into the wind."
Only the Athenians themselves exist.
And the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable.
Only the Athenians exist.
And only stout wooden ships can save them.
Wooden ships and a tidal wave of heroes' blood.
"Leonidas, my husband"
"Leonidas, your king"
Leonidas and the brave 300 are dead.
The free men and women of Greece are not bound by a beautiful Spartan death.
War is not their love.
Yet he lay down his life for them.
No!
"I need to stretch their wings, then, bye."
Interesting.
Do something because they will not stop.
"Relax, I know exactly how to get attention of our benefactors aliens."
"Relax, breathe deeply, take a deep breath."
-Loving.
-I am the mayor of the village!
"In this place, I say!"
-This is great.
Can you believe that.
"If you have a Will, has one output."
"Bill, are you?"
"I know not, Uncle Mano ... are noisy and are destroying our ice."
"Atticus, are building a way out of here."
All they thought never would leave here.
"Look, our road to freedom."
"It will not long, boys."
I will miss you here.
Where we live when everyone leaves?
"We'll find a new place dear, the world is big."
And just being together which is already a home.
It is.
Let children to hide.
"Carmen, you see ... even in the mystical should be a couple."
"No, no, no!"
-Are you still here.
-And you're still here.
-They were.
What?
A little while bad they disappear.
Who's missing?
Fine.
"But when we get the POWs from the Abbey, we'll take Miri too."
"- Miri, the pretend nun?"
- She's motivated.
She can shoot.
And she trailed me through the woods for a half hour before I heard her.
None of you can do that.
That's all we know about her?
Everything else you can learn while you train her.
Brilliant.
Three weeks till the invasion.
Lots of time.
"Speaking of which,"
I've been thinking.
"We're working on the attack, but without defense, it could all be for nothing."
What do you mean?
We need to know what they know.
"Which networks are blown, who we can trust."
We don't know how much René told them.
Counter-intelligence.
We need to protect ourselves.
Anticipate attacks.
- Track his movements.
Feed him lies.
"- And by ""him"" you mean..."
Franz Faber.
He knows a lot about us.
It's time we learned more about him.
- We can't get anywhere near the HQ.
- No.
But maybe we can hit him closer to home.
_
How much do we have to take from this crud?
There'll be no vigilante stuff.
Not while I'm barracks chief.
"Hey, look at them!"
- Those crazy jerks!
- They won't get away with it!
The Krauts'll shoot them!
It's Harry and the Animal!
They're trying to sneak into the Russian compound!
They're past the 50-yard line.
- It's a quarterback sneak.
-Look at them go!
Those idiots will paint themselves right into their graves.
Get a load of them
"Hello, bublichki."
How are you all?
Hey!
"Hey, the brick Kremlin!"
"Hey, Olga Volga, wait for me."
"Hey, Animal."
The window.
Hmm.
So life sort of drifted back to normal in Stalag 17.
It was a couple of days before Christmas and everything seemed quiet enough.
"But underneath it all, we knew we were sitting on a barrel of dynamite and that the stoolie, whoever he was, was ready to strike again at any second."
At ease.
At ease.
At ease.
"All right, at ease."
At ease.
Mail call!
"- All right, at ease."
Give me that.
Wait for me.
Miss Carrol!
"Hello, kids."
No wonder this school is losing money.
Everybody late every morning.
Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs.
"Yes, and that goes for you girls, too."
"Anybody would think I had nothing else to do, but nothing."
One would.
"Miss Anderson, good morning."
"If you're late again, you'll be fired, too."
That's final.
I have nothing more to say.
That's good.
"- Is that you, Mabel?"
- I don't know.
"Tell me, is it?"
- Kind of sounds like you.
- That's a load off my mind.
I'm never sure these days.
- Did you see a young...
- Visitors make the pupils self-conscious.
"Would you mind waiting a second, please?"
"- That's no if, Gus!"
- Supposed to be pretty good!
He won the intercollegiate a couple years ago?
I never seen a college Joe yet take a belt on the kisser!
!
without phoning his mother!
"He's a good man, but I'll take him!"
I can feel it!
Naina and I have seen a flat for ourselves.
We will go there.
"And what about me, sister-in-Iaw?"
I am like a guest in this house.
"If not with you, then III live with brother and sister-in-Iaw."
"But you dont worry, sister-in-Iaw."
"III search for a room for you, brother and Jyoti."
"Yes, III have to pay the rent."
III pay it.
youll pay the rent!
people sacrifice their lives in orderto..
..keep their dignity intact!
Our house is getting auctioned..
..and you have no shame at all!
Even though you all are the brothers of..
"..such a kind man, you have stooped so low."
Sister-in-Iaw!
"Vicky, I beg of you!"
Dont let this house get auctioned!
I beg of you!
Listen to me!
This.. this is our house!
Do something!
Do something!
Dont let this house get auctioned!
Vicky!
Vicky!
Ravi!
"gentlemen, before starting this auction, I would Iike to.."
..tell you that Mr. Chaudhry will bid..
..forthis luxurious mansion first.
50 lakhs.
Rely on it!
That's what my lawyer said.
- You too?
"- No, thanks."
The fine gentleman will pay.
There's still something called fatherhood.
Only the pleasure and no responsibility?
Ha!
"He's here, Mrs John!"
"Where I, in my condition, was made to sit at the bar's cash register..."
No percentages anymore!
"And then, not even the alimony!"
Mr Hassenreuter?
Did you go to the state library?
"Oh certainly, the books!"
"Yes, just a moment, Mrs John!"
- An extra lock?
- And a bolt on the inside!
"As if there was anything to steal from him, Mr Theater Director!"
Without a theater...
He still owes me the rent.
How does he make a living?
"Life, but my lips are sealed..."
"Morning, Mrs John!"
I have something for you.
"Gynecology, midwifery and infant care."
Whether this is the right one for you...
I've been a bachelor all my life.
It's all Greek to me...
"I'll find my way through, Mr Hassenreuter!"
Thank you very much...
What do you want with it?
Next Thursday.
- That's great.
You have to do it.
- I don't know.
- You have to do it.
- Really?
Yes.
You've never been a part of an actual graduation ceremony.
I know.
That's because my conservative high school... wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.
- Don't be gross.
- You think I should do it?
- You've worked hard.
You've earned it.
- I guess.
Come on.
You know that deep down you really want to do this.
I'll admit I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.
And the hat?
For the tassel.
You know my thing for fringe.
"They call out your name, and people clap, and you get your diploma."
Then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other.
"Very symbolic, very dramatic."
- That's it.
You're doing it.
- If you insist.
- Who do you want to invite?
- I don't know.
You.
- And?
- That's cool with me.
"Okay, if that means that Jackson could use a few thousand hours of therapy, I could've told you that myself."
What if...
It has something to do with his parents?
His real parents.
"Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?"
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Ah...
Ow!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
Great.
Ayushman.
Sometimes I can't decide... who the bigger rascal is.
Doesn't make a difference.
We're both serving the country.
If you're eager on taking a decision... then decide when I'm going to be CP.
I'll sign on your promotion letter... only when your sister and my son... sign on the marriage certificate.
Even I can't decide Mr. Pradhan... who the bigger rascal is.
What to do Ayushman?
My son's heart is set on your sister.
And my son's wish is my command.
On that note let's celebrate at your house today.
Okay.
- Sir.
- What is it?
The police thrashed Vishal.
They threw him down from the multiplex.
What?
What happened Mr. Pradhan.
That police officer whom you appointed... for Ankita's security thrashed Vishal.
Threw him down from the first floor of Galaxy Multiplex.
Zoravar.
Whoever he is.
That midget beat-up Vishal.
I'll look into it.
- Get the car.
- Yes sir.
- Jadhav.
- Yadav sir.
Whatever.
Get me Galaxy Multiplex CCTV footages now.
Yes sir.
"You know, I'm almost sad this negotiation is over."
Why?
I was just starting to enjoy your company.
Same here.
What do you say you and I bill our clients for another two hours?
Let's make it three.
"Oh, hi."
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
"Uh, I followed the flyers."
Well... you found me.
"So unless you're gonna help look for Gabriel,"
I'm kind of busy.
"Well, you know..."
"You know, I was serious the other night."
I mean...
I'd love to see you again.
If you're interested.
I am interested.
But that's the problem.
I don't understand.
How... how is that a problem?
"Look, first off..."
It feels a little like you and your wife haven't totally worked out the open marriage thing.
So that's a little more complicated than I'd like.
And second...
"if I have to be honest,"
I like you.
Which means...
I don't want to share you with anyone.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, Elliot."
Like the disappearance of the Lady Hampshire.
Like love.
Abbs...
"I don't have anything yet, Gibbs."
The computers just got here.
"Well, maybe this stuff will help.; it's all the files we've compiled on the case so far."
What are you doing?
(shutter clicks)
I'm taking a picture of you with my map.
"Trust me, you will thank me later."
"Oh, I know that look."
I like that look.
"The photo of Jarvis and Wickes, where is it?"
"Right here, why?"
What just happened?
Another unexplained phenomena.
"Sometimes, you just have to believe."
Who took the picture?
Haven't we already done this?
VANCE:
"Gibbs, be careful."
RYAN:
The tell.
"Wickes looked at the picture because of who was behind the camera, not in front of it."
"Who took the picture, sir?"
(sighs) Carl Dalton.
He used to go hunting with us.
Does he have a connection to the company?
He's Wickes' half-brother and in-house counsel for Wickes Steel.
DALTON:
"Phillip, what's going on?"
You said you were in trouble?
Fire!
Who's that out there?
What's happening?
Goss.
- Has Defiant been taken?
"- Why, no, sir."
Whose...
Whose voices?
"Mr. Scott-Padget, the captain."
Did Goss tell you?
- I took the Venetians.
- Did we lose many men?
- A dozen or so.
- And wounded:
About threescore.
"Excuse me, I'm needed."
"Before she went down, we took a great deal off her."
"Crates full, en route to France."
But there's a much bigger prize.
Bring in the Frenchman!
"You wouldn't believe it but this figure is Colonel Giraud, a political advisor to Napoleon."
"All right, take him away."
It's fortunate that Colonel Giraud omitted to destroy all his papers.
He knows of plans for the invasion of England.
- Does he know when?
"- Within the next few weeks, sir."
He must be sent to London.
Of course.
"After I make the necessary repairs, we shall make all speed."
- You've done extremely well.
"- Thank you, sir."
"And, Mr. Scott-Padget this crew serves well, if you don't drive them too hard."
She used to get so mad at me every time I'd talk about you.
She thought I had a secret crush on you.
Maybe she was right.
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- What?
"Well, I'm asking you if you want to have dinner with me."
I...
I have to...
I have to think about it.
I'll have to ask Claire.
- All right.
- Okay.
"""D""!"
Congratulations!
You're improving!
I still don't understand what you're saying about twin primes.
- I'm explaining it to you!
- But I still don't understand.
Don't you know that it's possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still HAVE an infinite number of elements left over?
We spent quite a bit of time on this already!
My... my wife understood this on our first date!
Class dismissed!
Get out of here!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Very enjoyable dinner.
- Did you cook it yourself?
"- Yes, I did."
- What a liar.
"- Yes, I am."
What?
Bring up their photos.
The left clavicle on this one is higher than the right.
That's an indication of handedness.
SAROYAN:
"Also, his left deltoid is slightly more developed."
And he parts his hair to the right.
"I mean, most lefties do that."
MONTENEGRO:
Jake Tompkins.
I'll call Booth and let him know.
AUBREY:
"So, this hood isn't exactly screaming ""drug dealer."""
You sure we got the right address?
"Well, Tompkins is not your, you know, usual drug dealer."
He runs a very efficient business.
"Well, I mean, he has to have slipped up somewhere."
Otherwise he wouldn't be in the database.
"Well, he was charged, but he was never convicted, you know?"
"Like I said, he's very careful."
(doorbell ringing)
Yo.
(doorbell rings) (whistles)
Jake Tompkins?
FBI.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Special Agent James Aubrey.
How can I help you?
Ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Aldo Clemens?
"Sorry, don't know him."
"Look at the photo, Jake, okay?"
Clemens was found dead this morning.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
$0?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
Suspected QVapor overdose and psychosis.
Welcome to the Pinky Amusement Park.
Here will be the wettest dream come true!
Get in!
"Commander Bishop, sir?"
- Commander?
"- It's full with Steam, sir!"
"Hey, idiot..."
General Trajano requests your report for the service!
Time to take you home!
Raise it up.
OMG!
"Commander Bishop, are you all right, sir?"
"Do not call me ""sir""!"
"Commercial sector 1, insured."
Prepare 51 for Spartan-7...
Bishop...
"It'll be good to see you again in your uniform, Bishop."
Who says I'm going to put it?
"Come on, we both know, you're not a deserter."
"Find another, for your murders."
You made an oath on Spartan-7.
"Take off your uniform, do not remove the promise."
"Come on, then, arrest me."
All my oaths were broken long ago.
Sorry for Mara.
She was a good woman.
It is difficult to deal with such a thing.
Especially today.
"That's why I brought you here, son."
It's time to get Mara closer.
We told you that your baby died.
You remember this place?
Of course.
I'm not brain-dead.
You used to bring me here every Sunday.
We'd get strawberry milkshakes.
Yeah.
With extra whipped cream.
"Yeah, and you'd always let me eat yours."
Yeah.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
"So, what did you wanna talk to me about?"
You.
"Uh, let me guess."
"Ok, you hate my hair,"
"My clothes, my friends..."
Sarah--
How I'm ruining my life.
"Sarah, I'm here because I wanna understand what happened."
I just wanna know how you and I ended up like this.
I don't know.
It just happened.
"Listen, I understand that the problems between your mom and I didn't or haven't helped the situation, but..."
Can we-- can we just order already?
All right.
I'm just trying to understand here.
"Well, you never do."
You just believe what you want.
"Well, maybe you do that, too."
What can I get ya?
"Uh, two eggs, over medium."
Multigrain toast.
"Uh, I'll do the mushroom and cheese omelet, please."
Buy passage far from Capua and the things that have been done to you.
- Where did you get this?
- Spirited from Gaia's things.
They will not be missed.
You fade with each day.
Do not make me bear witness to your passing.
- Come with me.
- I attend Domina.
My absence would be noticed.
"Go, before contest is ended."
"I will see you again, one day."
I swear to you.
Go.
A match for the ages.
I shall miss this.
Water.
"Crixus, victor."
Why did you drop your guard?
You are champion now.
That is all that matters.
I would not thought it possible.
To be said of many things this day.
"Quintus, it's not too late..."
Father?
Fetch the Medicus!
"Your father burns high fever, a worrisome condition for a man of his years."
"Well, is there nothing to be done?"
I have not the herbs.
And the hour is late for us to procure them.
Go.
I'll watch over him.
I'll pound on every door in Capua until we have what is needed.
Immediately?
I hate to trouble you... but there's something I want you to find out.
I heard there's someone who works different kind of jobs.
They say this person even works as a replacement driver at night.
Agent.
"Agent, chief, minister..."
Don't you have internet access?
Just go online and search.
What are you doing?
Why don't you drink more?
I know something more exciting than drinking.
Let's leave.
Do you still have a fever?
Yes.
"If your condition changes, just contact me at anytime."
Good.
Thanks for your hard work.
Get into the car first.
Are you the replacement driver?
Yes.
The call sounded really urgent.
Take us to the Ecstasy Hotel by Doosan intersection.
"Yes, sir."
Wait a second!
Miss Kim Mi Hee.
Let's have a little talk.
Do you know him?
"No, this is the first time I've met him."
How do you know my name?
I'm from the Seoul District...
I didn't bring it!
"Anyway, there's something we need to talk about."
- Shut up!
"- Right, shut up."
"I said if you don't pay me back, I'll cut off your thingy, right?"
I remember.
Mommy!
Morons.
"Put on your panty, honey!"
"Stop, you bastard!"
You're dead if I catch you!
This way!
Dumb bastards.
Hurry up and follow me!
"Bastards, I wish I had the money to pay you back."
I couldn't record anything this month.
This absolutely sucks.
What is it?
Why is here so dark?
# Sometimes I have this dream
# About someone holding me tightly
# A dream about a kiss
# But when I wake up I'm always alone
# Then I can't fall sleep again # because of loneliness
# After tumbling the whole night # I see the morning
"# Ah, how wonderful it would be"
# If it wasn't a dream
"# Instead, I wish"
# I could never wake up from my dream
# I miss a man's arms
# I miss a male's scent
Doctor?
Treating a sick heart is my specialty.
"Whenever I see a sick person, I can't just let it pass."
I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off.
"And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again..."
I'll break every bone in your body.
Do you understand that?
"- Red, is that call for me?"
"- No, it's my dame."
"Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you."
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my dough back.
- Give us a roll.
- Here it comes...
You ought to marry those dice.
Marry?
Holy cats!
What time is it?
"- Pop, my pants!"
- You've got them on.
"Oh, yeah."
Wait a minute!
You're not going with all our dough.
I got to get married.
I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married.
That's a bet.
No cuffs.
The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs.
What?
Nice fellows!
Hello.
Where's everybody?
"Why, the guests have all gone, sir."
Did you wish to be announced?
Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him!
"Okay madam, atleast you bless me!"
I understood.
I understood that all my ties with this house are severed
"Its very simple, sir."
But Krishna understood it today..
..that the poor persons destiny can get generous..
..for sometime but cannot improve forever.
"Excuse me, sir.."
-Get aside.
"Mister, listen to me.."
"- Hey go away, go away."
Its a strange city.
No one listens here.
"Mister, where can I get a place to stay here?"
What?
-A home?
Whats so funny?
"Hey fool, who gave you a ticket to Mumbai?"
I have come without a ticket.
I didnt have the money to buy the ticket.
"Then listen, when I came to Mumbai.."
..even I had asked the same question.
Can I get a place to stay somewhere?
Its been 20 years I still didnt get a reply.
I amjust standing like this on one leg.
"You didnt understand, right?"
Does this city belong to yourfather?
Why dont you think before taking..
..your bags and baggage and coming here?
Enough.
Enough.
Hey.. hey my..
Yet they always turn away when I meet them.
As should yours.
"Then I must tear them out, if they are to obey such a command."
You must stop this.
"I have vowed to, a thousand times a day."
"To return to drink and whores, forcing you from my mind."
Then I catch glimpse of you.
And my world ends.
I have never felt greater love than when I hold my husband in my arms.
Gannicus.
What seizes you?
"You drop guard, allowing Barca advantage."
The man almost had you.
I was lost in a moment.
Caught by a dream.
Then wake from it.
Leave us.
"You are a Gaul, are you not?"
"Yes, Domina."
Many believe the seed of a Gaul to rival that of Jupiter himself.
Tell me.
How many sons sprang from your father's cock?
"Five, Domina."
And from his father before him?
The same.
"Your subligaria, remove it."
You are never to speak of this.
"Do you understand, slave?"
"Yes, Domina."
"Well, I would not look at you."
The sight turns stomach.
Enter me.
"pay me. """
"pay me. """
Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.
Take deliveries at the front door and sell it out the back at a discount.
Take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
when there's nothing left whenyoucan'tborrow another buck from the bank youbustthejointout.
You light a match.
Do you need help reaching anything?
You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree.
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad.
Diane.
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.
what?
what?
Who asked you anything?
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.
what?
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What is this world coming to?
prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
- It's OK!
Say the same in smile madam
"I will slipper you, if you still follow me, idiot!"
Thank you.
Have I done what you said as it is?
You did improvising it.
- But why did I do it?
You till date have used brain for all the operations.
"Please just use the body for this, it would be enough."
"Hey Giri, send these photos immediately to P. R. O Venu."
"Madam, this wedding card is ₹ 5,000."
We get 20%.
Is it the commission Mr. Mutyam?
- Discount Mr. Rathnam.
"[₹5,000with20% discount=₹4,000]"
This is with dry fruits and almonds.
It would be very good.
"Just ₹ 10,000."
"I think a lot would come, as discount Mr Mutyam."
"This too is bit expensive, but..."
Jayaraj's dark biography revealed!
What idiot?
I read the published as it is sir
What is this Jayaraj?
- It is all Trash!
"I'm entering politics, right?"
Cheap tricks played by the opposition people.
Computer graphics!
Yes madam!
Sir is like fire.
Smoke has thus come out..
Mr. Ratnam
She died in my arms.
"She begged me to take the baby, but  it was very late."
Liar!
"I understand, why do not you believe me."
"It's hard to accept, that your world is breaking."
"When you are in it, pick up the pieces."
But maybe...
You believe her.
"Come Aluxia, let's play somewhere else."
"Bishop, I'm sorry, my love."
I wanted to tell you.
I feared for your life.
I knew the truth too late.
I was wrong.
We were all wrong.
"We have created them, but we do not control it."
We are not their gods.
Your destiny is yours.
"Like us, they can love..."
They can create offspring.
"They have souls, who long for freedom."
The humanoids must release them.
"Remember when we said, that we were going to this place?"
Yes.
"Across the country, up here."
"Can you remember, what's the name of this place?"
-Selegna Sol.
"""All right, Selegna Sol."
We can leave this cave cold.
The Selegna Sol.
There it is wonderfully hot.
- Are you waiting for it?
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
Uh...
No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Regulations are regulations.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
"I'm fine, Dad."
- Elle.
- Yeah?
Don't ever call me Dad again.
"How do you think he'd feel about ""Mom""?"
"Let me know when you're going to do that, so I can run."
"Reid, you probably saved my life in there."
Probably?
I totally saved your life.
And I'm pretty certain that it was caught on tape.
You know what you said in there?
To Bryar?
That you know what it's like...
The guy was a delusional psychotic.
I was playing into his fantasy.
Go to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
All right?
"Albert Einstein said,"
"""The question that sometimes drives me hazy,"
"""'Am I or the others crazy?""'"
Here it comes.
Thanks.
"This is a comparison of DNA taken from the body in the grave, and from a toothbrush that belonged to David Stubbs."
"It matches, it's him."
His mother's coming to hear the results.
How much does she know?
She knows he was found in his grandfather's grave.
Whoo.
What a dumbass!
"Well, probably not your finest hour, Stacey, but..."
"No, him."
I didn't want to.
Luke dared me.
"Your boyfriend dared you, so it's his fault?"
What was I supposed to do?
"Stacey, just because he asked you, doesn't mean you had to do it, you're the one who's responsible for you, and..."
We're in a relationship and you are not my guidance counselor.
OK.
Where's Luke right now?
At his mom's.
He thought I was funny.
"Well, Stacey, you now have aspiration pneumonia."
How funny is that?
Not.
You may have also done lasting damage to your respiratory system.
"- Wait, for reals?"
"- Yeah, for reals."
Stacey...
Luke sounds like a bad boyfriend.
I love him so much.
I just wanted to make him happy.
"Hmm, it's interesting."
"That's it, that's all you got?"
- The eggs are brown.
If you...
- They're supposed to be brown!
- Not really.
- It's a country omelette!
What would it take for you to reconsider your decision?
How do you feel?
"Still dopey, otherwise I'm in the pink."
What I came to say is...
"Leave off, will you?"
It could have happened to anybody.
How are the boys?
"Well, they're fine."
Can I get you something?
Not a thing.
Sure now?
"Sure, I'm fine."
"Except, my feet they're very cold."
Do you think you could tuck that blanket in for me?
I can't reach it from here.
Sure.
"Ooh, that's much better."
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master Delacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
Next!
"This is Choi Duk-soon, the wife of one Hwang Man-keun of Willowville."
What is her crime?
"Well, if I should explain..."
You slut!
"Your husband is alive and well, and you bump bellies with another man?"
How could you!
Don't just stand there!
Get her husband out of here!
Let go of me!
Let go!
"Hang them, Magistrate!"
They both deserve to be hanged!
"Sir, what should I do?"
Do whatever you want!
You can punish her according to the law or hang her like her husband said!
"Pardon, sir?"
Hustle!
You'll never catch up to the barbarians at this pace!
The Six Camps is no longer the front.
And the front is where warriors belong.
Why am I here like a pathetic fool?
Here you go.
Enjoy your food!
Rice cakes?
"Yes, it's a special treat for our grand opening!"
"Good luck with the business, Innkeeper."
Thank you!
"Wow, something smells good!"
When did this place open up?
I can go for a drink right now.
Why don't we stop in?
Everything's cold cold cold.
"...can only destroy itself, with bourgeoise means, bourgeoise sets, bourgeoise costumes, bourgeoise acting, the bourgeoise at the bidding of the Revolution, in the name of wrecked humanity."
Their souls melted into one...
"the universal soul, it's me."
In me human consciousness blends into the animal instinct.
And I can live each and every existence through me.
This stuff sounds decadent.
"Alone in the universe, my spirit remains..."
She's fresh.
Simon's ham... she'll get you.
"It's beautiful, what she says."
I want the book.
Let go!
Did she get you?
Who got me?
Who got you?
You did.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
"You, I love you."
Maybe it would be useful to remove your pantaloons if you want to see the light.
Do you want me to?
Why?
Because people normally do it for me.
I can also tie up your feet.
Why?
"Because, usually I'm the one they tie up."
And why that?
Because usually I'm the ridiculous one.
- Indeed.
Magnificent.
I've never liked the smell of books.
"The dust, perhaps."
I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.
I shall have it knocked down to make place for a Grecian temple.
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?
"Too expensive, and we do not need four bedrooms."
We can share.
This one.
Then.
We have only 500 a year.
I'll send out more inquiries today.
"Pardon my intrusion, but I think I have found what you're looking for."
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.
We'll have to enlarge it.
Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.
"Forgive me, do you by any chance have a reliable atlas?"
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.
My sister tells me it is in South America.
No!
"No, she's quite wrong."
I believe it is in Belgium.
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.
"- The Volga, which starts in..."
- In Vladivostok.
And ends in...
- Wimbledon.
News of
The queen's death...
And this.
News from the vatican.
"If this letter confirms sebastian's legitimization,"
It should take away any reservations
"You have about a bastard at your side instead of a king,"
As bash will be king one day.
"If it denies his legitimization,"
How could bash blame you for returning to francis?
I know you think you love them both.
"While that may be true,"
I argue that you love one more.
I am afraid.
Open it.
Now you're free
To go to the man you love.
I can't marry you.
"Yes, you can."
Don't let your mother put ideas in your head
"About my ability to protect you, because I will be king."
We can force the pope's hand.
I know that.
"With me,"
You are free and wild.
"You can be who you are,"
And I will always put you first.
"Please, don't."
Say that you love me.
"Say it to me once, because I know that you do."
"I love you, I do."
Say it.
Help!
- Gunther.
Where's Margaret?
"- Don't worry, ma'am."
I'll take care of you.
- You're home now.
- Roderick.
- So I looked into...
- The Aconite Society.
- Yeah.
- And?
- There are whispers of a secret order made up of society's wealthiest and most influential men.
- And?
- And whispers are about all anybody would say about it.
"- Thomas... if it's money you want, I'm in no short supply."
- I don't want your money.
- I'll make it worth your while.
"- Listen, I have some advice for you."
Leave this alone.
"Even if half of these stories are true, they run everything:"
"the courts, the papers, the banks."
- All Rosewood?
- I don't know.
- Is Dr. Cairn one of them?
- I don't know a Dr. Cairn.
- What about the girl Lucy that I saw?
Is Mr. Baxter involved with these people?
- Listen to me.
I don't want anything to do with this.
- There's gotta be something more you can give me.
Please.
- That's all I can tell you.
"Oh, um, okay."
"Uh, well, you'll do."
- Flattered.
- Sorry.
"Listen, Leena, you know that 800-year-old sword"
That we were swapping out?
"Uh, well, it turns out, a piece of it has come up missing."
"So if--if--if you were standing next to Artie, right,"
"And he was looking for this thing,"
Wh--what--what would he be doing?
Artie did say that the sword was from the Edo period.
So instead of trying to track it forward
"From the past, just find it in the present."
Identify any collectors that deal in that period
And then try and find as much information as you can
On any sales or transactions of those pieces.
- Right.
Right.
Right.
"Uh, since-- since you're right there,"
"Do--do you think that, uh, maybe you could, uh..."
"Give me a minute, Pete."
"One point, Lattimer."
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello!
"Oh, you should've kept your promises, Erik."
"The tsuba, did you find it?"
- Well--
"- Well, it wasn't easy."
"You know, it--it took some digging."
How's that for over?
"You let me find the body, Jenny."
- You pretended to be upset.
"- I'm sorry I lied, Bo."
But that was before I understood this thing we have between us.
But everything's different now.
I'll never be separated from the one I love.
"What did you do, Jenny?"
You can learn a lot from the Internet like how to turn ordinary fertilizer and paint into explosives.
When I push this button we'll be together forever.
- Okay.
"Okay, but if we're gonna go out with a bang I want it to be in your arms."
"Oh, I'd like that."
- Okay.
- Slowly.
How convenient.
They're together.
One-stop shopping.
Liar.
You're just like everyone else.
I didn't bring them.
Just calm down.
- Who are you?
- Our sister's dead because of you.
"And you took part, so you both pay."
Don't.
Don't.
She's got a bomb.
No.
This isn't supposed to go like this.
"Everybody, calm down."
We're gonna talk.
"Yeah, my way was hard to find"
Can't sell your soul for peace of mind
I hate these plates.
"Oh, look, honey."
We got a food processor.
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
A blender.
"Took a world of trouble,"
Took a world of tears
Took a long time to get back here
"Hey, it's me."
"I, uh..."
I thought we should talk.
"Well... actually, I..."
I don't know.
Always had more dogs than bones
I could never wear those clothes
It's a dark victory
Told us you were satisfied
But it never came across
"Square one, my slate is clear"
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
It took a world of trouble
It took a world of tears
It took a long time...
I brought my computer.
I thought I'd get some work done while she's napping.
"Oh, she's a big napper."
"You'll have plenty of time, but you have to get her down by 2:00 or else..."
Or else what?
She turns into a monster?
Kinda.
"Uncle, the work has not been done."
The work has not been done?
You didn't get the plates?
- We didn't.
"- What say, Pakia...?"
You said that your information is very accurate.
"Yes, Uncle."
The plates were in Kania's godown.
The thing is...
Kania got to know about our imminent arrival much before.
We were only 2.
And they were 50.
They surrounded us from all sides.
We forgot the plates and somehow saved our lives.
"What say, Baba?"
It doesn't matter if you didn't get the plates.
I can sacrifice thousands of plates in the names of tigers like you.
I will deal with Kania later.
"How could you, Baba?"
He's lying.
- Here are the plates.
- How wonderful!
Bravo!
- l knew.
- What do you mean?
I know both of you since the past 15 years.
"And in the 15 years, it has never happened that you didn't execute an assignment successfully."
- Uncle...about me...
- l remember...
I remember.
This idiot says that you should involve him in business.
- What do you feel?
Where you going?
To tell gibbs.
What do you think?
I'm glad the glass is bullet-proof.
"excuse me,uh,could I have a word?"
With you?
Workin it's related and important.
She's telling the truth.
God put the body there?
No.
Someone who was playing god.
She didn't bury him.
Your gut telling you this?
"I've been watching her.She feels guilt, empathy,remorse."
That doesn't fit the psychological profile.
"She's deceitful,conniving,an adulterous, which does."
I'm trying to give you my professional opinion.
Then tell me after I have finished interrogating the suspect.
"Timothy,do you have a moment?"
"Uh,actually,I'm watching jody carvell's husband."
"Yes,I know--"
I want to have a word with M.
Sure.
And for you to tape it with that new cell phone yours.
Tape you?
"No,no,no,no.Not me.Him."
"Surreptitiously,of course."
Of course.
"-Here you go,Mr. Carvell."
-Thank you.
"Uh,this is our medical examiner,Dr. Mallard."
"Uh,call me ducky."
And?
"Anselmo said, ""No subway stop no BankExchange."""
- And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner but we need BankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy it's politically expedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
"I'm talking about a 60-story building that will employ 3,000 people."
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George Frank Anselmo's in there.
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
- Yeah.
So...
"I mean, what do you think?"
"You think it's a myth, Nathaniel?"
What's your explanation?
"Is it hard being alone, Mom, so much in your life?"
Yes.
I always wondered why you didn't find someone else to share your life with you.
"Well, I'm kind of a romantic fatalist."
"Somebody comes along, you know, and I'm kind of a loner too."
- Nathaniel?
- Yeah.
Come in.
- What?
- Lightning.
I know.
I'll come in.
Do you miss him still?
Sometimes.
"But not a great, great deal."
You don't think about him as much as you used to?
No.
Is that shocking?
"Before taking off for India and Bangladesh,"
I finally went back into Lou's old office.
"As it turns out, one of the men who used to work for him has the place now."
It was exciting times.
"I must say, it was exciting being here."
I was...
I can't say there were ever times when I was...
I never quit because of anger.
I never quit because of frustration.
"Yes, we can."
Tell me about your children.
"My girl, Mariana, she's six."
She loves racing cars.
Anything to do with speed.
"And Lucas, he..."
He has dark masses of curly hair and his eyes are... like two bright shining stars.
Sorry.
So Karp packed up his Mexican operation?
We don't know where he is now.
He was moving lots of stuff.
"Supplies, heavy duty equipment."
"Crazy stunt, but no infection."
You are all good.
"Thanks, Doc."
"When I was at Karp's compound,"
I saw something being hauled in on a giant flatbed.
"It was long, metallic, cylindrical, like a submarine."
It was massive.
A missile?
Yes.
Full report on my desk by morning.
I want my dad released.
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain.
"However, I will allow continued access to your father."
He's been surprisingly cooperative since you two have been talking.
Dad?
You don't look so good.
What's happened?
I didn't think I'd see you again.
Finnerman keeps us guessing.
She came to see me.
Since when do they pass up Sunday brunch?
"Your grandfather's at the office, and Taylor's busy."
Too busy to save his immortal soul?
Funny.
But not the part where you burn in hell.
I liked the sermon this morning.
"Oh, nice pandering."
I'm serious.
"Okay, okay, first off, it was a homily."
Sermons are for Protestants.
Filthy heathens.
We're glad you came.
I was glad to be included.
"While you're here, would you mind looking at some paperwork for me?"
No such thing as a free brunch.
We have to pick up the kids from my folks.
On it.
Stay with Audrey.
Earn some Brownie points.
Can I get a ride?
"I mean, I can always hitch."
Maybe get picked up by some harmless-looking guy in a panel van.
Go get ready.
Wheels up in five minutes.
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the car.
Meaning you'll be having a cigarette.
I'll be having a cigarette.
Ohh now.
You smoke?
Only crack.
"Hey, I got to talk to you about something."
Bee sting in 1 is asking for you.
Have them start the orientation manuals.
I'll be with them soon.
"- Carter, MVA, two minutes."
- But not to hold their breath.
"Dr. Carter, so there's a trauma coming in."
Yeah.
"Why don't you take the bee sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4 and the burning rash in 2?"
Care to give me a hand?
- Help me!
- Why not?
- Help me!
- Hey!
"That's just been mopped, damn it!"
You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
- Remember that for next time.
"- Come on, man!"
- Think it's always this crazy here?
- Probably.
"They need to bring you back to the VA hospital, sir."
- I don't understand.
- Your driver will explain.
"You guys suck, you know that?"
- Don't bother.
We don't have any beds.
"- So, what else is new?"
"- No, I'm serious."
Try Mercy.
- They' re refusing patients too.
- Then try Rush.
We' re filled.
- I've been bounced all over town with this guy.
"No, I don't."
"- When we found Allison, she was on a direct course for self-destruction."
Poor kid would be dead by now if we hadn't intervened.
"We saved her life, Ted."
You might even say that I still have a hand in keeping her alive.
Should we have another listen?
Don't worry.
Your daughter's not going anywhere.
"Yeah, we can keep her as long as you like."
"I understand your timeline, Liana."
"No, we're arranging transportation now."
Tell Musa his delivery's on its way.
"Florida, seriously?"
Right.
"Well, we'll move somewhere colder, then."
- Canada?
- Maple syrup and mullets?
No thanks.
Did mom fight for me?
"You told her I wanted to live with you, right?"
"Yes, but..."
"She didn't put up a fight, did she?"
Liana was overwhelmed by the news.
She doesn't want us to leave.
- Screw her.
- Don't be like that.
Like what?
She's never home.
She treats you like shit.
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Hey.

[school bell rang]
"Okay class, we're done for today."
What do you think you're doing?
I...
I just want to take my notes back.
"Eonni, what are you doing?"
(Eonni - older sister)
Sorry.
Are you scared?
"If I only knew, I wouldn't lend it to you!"
Do I have to make it more obvious?
The President is my father!
It's not me!
Da Hye!
"Just now, sorry about it."
This is my first time as a security guard.
"When my father became President,"
I have expected these things to happen.
So I've never had any friends.
Take these.
They should be suitable for you.
"Now, I'm going to the nightclubs."
"You can't wear guard clothes when you go inside, right?"
I certainly don't want to show any surprising flaws.
We will be going to Jiaye Ban.
Ah.. noisy!
I'll fix that guy's wagon.
"I gotta go to town, but I'll be back tomorrow."
"- But, Patsy--"
- I gotta go change my clothes.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
"- Funny, right over--"
- It would've been nice--
- It's just a hair--
- See a beautiful life in this--
"- Hey, boss."
- What is it?
"Been doing all right for yourselves, haven't you?"
And Joe's been doing himself plenty of good.
"- Well, what do you say?"
- We thought you was through.
What gave you that idea?
"- You're a reformer now, ain't you?"
- Who's running this racket?
You was.
Who is now?
- Me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
You think I built this racket up for seven years to let you guys walk away with it?
I'm telling you all something.
You're through.
And as for you....
- Wait a minute.
- Dirty son of a--
Keep those gats in your pockets.
"- Come on, let's get out of here."
"- Yeah, go ahead."
Take care of that rat.
"- of course you can, baby."
"harley, make sure you get all the right ones, okay?"

"I was wrong, you will never understand, never."
You should all feel proud.
The Japanese have been strong and cunning people.
But tonight we proved that American drive and know how is still number one.
Tonight we drink from our enemies cup.
We eat from our enemies table.
And we celebrate in his most proud room.
Tonight the victory is complete.
Go clean these.
I'll do it right away.
So let's hear some fucking music.
Sit down.

A beer is fine.
Tonight you drink like a man.
Look who I found hiding here.

"Well, well the entertainment has finally arrived."

Have a drink with the new owners.
Come on you bitch.

Booze?
Take off your hand.

You look like my boyhood friend who ran away.
Get on to the bike dude.
"Hey dude, this place is so colorful."

These are bouncers.
Then what about him?

He looks like a baby lizard!
Let's run away before he spits.
Order please.
A light beer for me.
"Sir, what about you?"
"First, get me two large, one lime cordial and some ice cubes."
Quick.
- Will that fill you enough dude?
- I shall order more later.
"- Sir, side dish?"
"-Get me scrambled egg, salted green peas, 75 gm mixture, a pack of Ravi's pickle"
- Sorry sir.
Ravi's pickle is not available in such a big bar?
I can't believe it!
It's such a shame!
"- Grilled chicken, Tandoori chicken, Chilly chicken"
- OK sir.
-You shall order the rest later right?
"-You are absolutely right, dude."
You greedy monster!
And you do not like your mom.

"So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again and then I did, in a photo, in a briefing room and I was being sent to meet him with a gun."
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
What's he saying?
"This man's a young Ronan Murphy, a suspect shot by Daniel Waldron during Operation Damson."
"What, they knew each other?"
Did you fabricate the improper relations between you
- and Detective Sergeant Arnott?
- No.
- Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you?
To help you and Victor
He isn't safe here I know what happened to him.
"He's not the only one I don't know what you mean lf you stay, you're putting Victor at risk"
Soon people like him will be hunted lt's safer at the Helping Hand
Not a chance
Pack your things
The power could be down for a while
Do you want to go out?
No
Shall we play a game?
OK
Truth or dare?
OK
Truth
How old was I when Dad killed himself?
You weren't born
So he never saw me?
No
Did he want to die because of me?
No
Was it because of you?
It's complicated
You're too young to understand I'll ask Thomas.
At least he will tell me the truth
It's natural that you want to know
"But the truth is, I have no idea"
You don't know why he did it?
No
Was he unhappy?
"Sometimes, he was"
"Other times, he wasn't"
Why was he unhappy?
Appreciate it.
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
That's an arm.
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
–What'd he say?
–He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
–Pretty ugly stuff.
–That sounds like Armadillo's MO.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
–We got cut off.
–Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"–An ax, maybe a machete."
–How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
–Three to four hours.
–So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
–Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
Really?
- Haven't you exhausted the subject?
- No.
"No, I wanna go deeper, you know?"
I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires.
"I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires."
Just different from the way we always thought they were.
What do you mean?
"Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders, you know."
Um...
Misunderstood.
"You're kidding, right?"
Don't you think it could be possible?
You did give me all that info.
"Jeremy, I made it up, okay?"
"I mean, you were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression."
- Is there anything you're not good at?
- Double dating.
This is all kind of new to me.
I usually keep to myself.
I don't always fit in.
- That's because you're that guy.
- What guy?
The guy who seems like he has everything.
So the people that don't kind of run the other way.
- Is that what I seem like?
- Pretty much.
Hm.
- What a dick.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, um..."
Yuuki-kun?
!
I thought the Supporter eliminated you!
I destroyed my Noblesse phone and disappeared on purpose so I could get revenge on him.
I have an urgent request.
Yes?
Move the third trailer to the front.
Of course.
Thank you.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that tomorrow you continue to be a worthy savior.
Juiz.
Juiz...
You were the best employee I ever worked with.
No. 09.
I can no longer be your guardian angel.
No. 01 is making a bid to win the game.
But I'm betting on you.
Don't forget your promise.
Promise?
I pray that you'll be a compassionate king.
Go.
Help him in any way you can.
Kuroha-san...
I'm going back to Japan.
Ato-san's not happy about it either.
the political fallout will be huge.
That's exactly why we need Iinuma-sensei's son as our scapegoat.
I have faith that in the end you'll prevail.
you're the man who launched 60 missiles at his own country.
You have my word.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What'd you do that for?
I confronted Tyler about his bed-wetting.
[Laughs]
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, we're sorry, okay?"
It's far from okay.
We broke up.
"Well, we'll talk to him."
We'll work it out.
- Yeah.
"- No, I broke up with him."
"After he denied being a bed wetter, he admitted to having a fetish for..."
"Ooh, let's just say it was nasty."
"What do you mean, ""nasty""?"
"Yeah, what kind of nasty things was this dude into?"
Get out of my morgue!
Losers!
The competition has ended.
"Richard Castle, you have solved the murder of Phillip Harris."
[Applause]
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're too kind.
"You have proven yourself worthy, and we, the members of the Greatest Detective Society, offer you a place at our table."
"I'm humbled and flattered, but I'm afraid I must decline."
What?
What are you doing?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with the best of the best.
Not for me.
The Falcon was called by Dragan.
"I made a movie about him, titled ""Tycoon""."
He was a champion at the Sarajevo Olympics.
Then he became a sniper during the siege of Sarajevo.
That's where I met him while I was locked up with the Serbs.
Are you serious?
- One thing?
A sniper.
- A sniper?
Then...
What is the plan?
- We do not complicate things.
Do not we commit?
What does it mean to her 'not to complicate things'?
We do not reveal who we are.
A king's knee would go a long way to many of these parts.
I do not want to go.
- Quiet.
We eat and go.
I'm not hungry.
I do not want to go.
"And so, I found myself facing two of my worst nightmares:"
"Dragan the Falco and Rakia, the Balkan lubricant."
Cheers.
We have said more than once.
More than once.
A million times.
But do you know something?
Now...
Now you can do the second part of the documentary.
"Can you say something, please?"
Thank you.
"Hey, is somebody down there?"
I didn't see you sign in.
Hey?
Is this somebody in here?
You're beautiful.
You already have me in bed.
You can stop.
"No, please continue."
It's a hell of a show.
Marcus?
Get dressed.
We're leaving.
"Wow, no!"
Wait.
"You don't wait, you don't listen to him!"
You get up and you get dressed now or I will kill you before you take another breath.
"You were here to close a deal, not to whore yourself out to a degenerate Pure Blood."
"Wouldn't you rather just, cut the insults and rip my throat out."
"Oh that's right you can't, because I am a Pure Blood."
And what are you?
You're just... infected.
Which is all you'll ever be.
"Doing our biddings, serving our will."
Yeah.
Vampires like you it's... nothing but pieces of meat.
They got a reprieve.
Thank you of reminding me of that.
Chase?
Chase?
It's getting dark.
It's time to go.
Where?
Any physical details that may help to identify him?
There's nothing.
He's completely perfect.
"Freddie, now that you're here, I've been thinking..."
Yes?
"If Roland's parents were looking for him, surely they would have informed the Constabulary."
Maybe so.
Perhaps... they don't care.
You're having second thoughts.
You asked if I wanted to know the truth... perhaps not knowing is the best course.
You wouldn't be the first of my clients to change their mind.
No father could be better than William.
He loves the boy.
He truly is his son.
"And you, Julia?"
I can't bear the thought of not having Roland.
Well then it's settled.
"He couldn't have better parents, you must never question that."
(Julia sighs.)
- I'm gonna take this way!
"- Come on, over here!"
- I've got nothing!
- Help me!
Nothing that way!
Look.
Over there!
It won't get away this time!
"- Everyone, stay close."
- It's over here!
Come on!
Keep up with them!
Go!
...including Lora del Rio and other towns.
The situation is becoming very serious.
Similar incidents are taking place as they had in recent years in the Andalusian countryside.
Damn!
Are you okay?
These are Joaquin Varela's blood test results.
Quini.
His blood type doesn't match the one we're looking for.
I remind you this is a democracy.
"Next time you want to arrest someone, you ask me first."
This country isn't what it was.
The harvest is soon and people are nervous.
Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.
You're not going to school today?
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
I went to a movie.
With who?
- With some friends.
- What friends?
"One moment, I'll be right back."
Who were you with yesterday at the hunting lodge?
"Who was the man in the hat, Marina?"
What man?
Aren't you a little hot in that sweater?
I'm sick.
How did you hurt yourself?
- What?
- Your wrist.
My watch gives me a rash.
- Come on.
"No,it's disgusting."
It was like a little freckle a month ago and then it just ran amuck.
"All right,now you're gonna have to show me."
"Seriously,you might be,like,sick."
Let us help.
I'm very sensitive about this.
Do not make fun.
I'm serious.
Do not make fun.
Okay.
"Promis promise,promise."
Oh!
No!
"Oh,my God,you guys suck."
"So,if I had one of those on my back, you wouldn't lust after me anymore?"
"Um... no,no,I wouldn't."
"Seriously,you should never show that to a potential soul mate ex."
Maybe it's a sign.
You should see if psychic chick can read it.
"Hey,what's up,guys?"
"Hey,dude."
- Morning.
"- Hey,man."
Late night?
What are you doing here?
It's a beautiful day.
I thought I'd take Rufus for a hike.
I don't like that you just show up here whenever.
Yeah?
Like how you just show up at my house?
Those were extenuating circumstances.
Stop trying your Yiddish out on me.
You sound like a Shakespearean actor from a Savannah pogrom.
- But do you know him?
- Sure.
But the trial was 2 years ago.
I was long gone from the department.
"Hello, Larry."
Good to see you.
This is Deputy Mayor Calhoun.
The first deputy mayor to set foot on this floor.
"We had a commissioner once, but it was the wrong floor."
- May I have a seat?
"- Please, sit."
"Abe, you're already at home here."
I think I know why you're here.
I've logged 12 calls already.
Tino Zapatti.
- You want to know why I handled it.
- Exactly.
Because sometimes we get overloaded.
And you take on the extras?
The extra-specials.
Such as Zapatti family members?
Something like that.
- Mr. Deputy Mayor...
"- ""Kevin""'s good enough."
Any case that comes here that looks like it's connected I take a special interest in.
- Why's that?
- To avoid making mistakes.
You sure made one on this.
"I blew one, okay?"
I don't mind admitting it.
"Tonight, we bring you one of the dark pages of American history:"
the story of Benedict Arnold.
This once-respected American soldier who disgraced his uniform lived to regret it.
(turns TV off)

"Look, fellas, I..."
I'm just wearing it.
-(laughter)
-You remember when he tried to teach the natives how to play gin rummy?
He wound up with all the coconuts on that island.
-(laughter)
-Where is Bilko?
Almost time for chow.
"""Chow""-- get him."
"Yeah, how do you like that?"
-How G.I. can you get?
-Are you still in?
"Hey, fellas."
"Hey, hey, hey, look."
(laughter dies down)
"Hey, he's for real!"
"Oh, you son of a gun!"
"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
I'll bet I'd still be a private if I was in there.
Bilko in the Army-
- I'm going to sell my defense bonds.
(laughter)
"Bilko, are any of your men as dumb as we were?"
-That would be impossible.
-(laughter)
"Well, what are we standing around for?"
I've been waiting for ten years for this.
There's some pain involved.
"You know, this is the only place around here with bars on its windows."
- I wonder what Doug was so worried about.
"- Come on, baby."
There better be somethin' good in here.
There we go.
Got it.
Looks like he didn't leave much.
"- Well, I've worked with less."
- Check for bills.
Bunch of junk mail.
Magazines.
Hello.
Hey.
Here's a quiz.
Tells you how to pick your mate based on what you eat.
"Okay, Mike."
What's your favorite meat?
"- Pleasure reading later, Sam."
"- Oh, you're no fun."
"Mike, two guys with guns coming fast."
They must have been watching the house.
They got the back covered.
Nothin'.
Just because there are no windows or doors... doesn't mean there are no exits.
The thing to look for is the air-conditioner unit.
That's where the wall is weakest.
"Also, people watch doors."
They don't watch air conditioners.
"Ooh, the damsel in distress."
She said it was an emergency.
What do you want me to do?
I am a seagull.
"Since I'm here way, way and I think very intensely."
And I grow the forces of my soul.
"I know now, and understand, Kosta, that in our profession an actress or a writer,"
I'essenziale is not the glory or the splendor of which I dreamed.
But the main thing is knowing how to resist.
Learning to carry your cross and keep the faith.
Here the object is full.
So now we define the details.
"It is shocking, eh?"
They are conspiracy or what?
Our girlfriends ...
There is a doll ...
here is the head and feet here.
I put it upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes ..."
Fa 'see where his head.
And the walk?
And the sex?
"It's good, eh?"
Good one.
Give me a pleasure.
You can ask that illuminate the scene?
Desire a child ...
"Turn all the lights, quick!"
- Do as he says.
- Do not want to mica again?
You do not.
"You played, you have enjoyed."
I do what you had to ...
And you loved me?
I would bite.
That's all I know.
And you have mules.
And you're not kicking them hard enough.
It's ridiculous.
It throws the rest of us in a tailspin whenever
The first shot involves Toxie.
Toxie's late.
It takes two hours to get his makeup on.
"And even if he's supposed to be there at 5:00,"
"And all of a sudden it's 6:30 or something and there's no Toxie,"
"It's, like, major."
Because then we know the first I can't get off until like 8:30.
INTERVIEWER:
"Lloyd, do you have a word of the morning?"
"Uh, a lot of very, very bad production."
No actors.
INTERVIEWER:
"What are you doing, Sandy?"
I'm making this guy a Toxie double.
INTERVIEWER:
Why?
"Because supposedly Dave-- unfortunately,"
His costume takes a while to prepare.
"So they want to get this shot done, so--"
One just wasn't enough.
They're using--
INTERVIEWER:
Are you gonna be able to tell
That's a different guy?
We have a great editor.
[Laughs]
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
- you should be sobbing about the fact that she took off with all your money.
- [sobbing]
- all right.
get ahold of yourself!
it's christmas eve!
look.
"you put in some long hours here, and you do some overtime -- heck, by the time you're 40..."
- [cries]
- there you are!
[giggles] of course i'll marry you.
why don't you just say so?
- really?
- yeah.
what the heck else am i gonna do?
- do you love me?
"- if wink wasn't here, i'd show you just how much."
- don't mind me.
"- but since he is, i'm just gonna take the minivan and i'm gonna get used to it."
"i'll see you back at home, okay?"
"- wink, please don't make him work too late."
"- [mockingly] no, i won't."
- [chuckles]
- see?
she does love me!
- get off!
"for as bright as you are, you are as dumb as a bag of hammers -- dumb, dumb, dumb!"
- oh.
[sighs] dang it.
- [echoing] you looking for this?
"- oh, not now."
really?
[sighs]
"We have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily."
"Okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think..."
You automatically assume that they're mine.
"Oh, yeah."
"Honey, I'm not lying to you."
I think you are really freaking out.
This whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
Just say no.
Get it out.
Gonna take a shower.
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga would fix me up with such a good kisser?
"- Back at you, sister."
I can't wait to kiss you again.
But we're kissing right now.
"I know, next time."
The second-date kiss is way more intimate.
"Well, listen I'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit."
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.
Okay.
[PHONE RINGING]
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah?
"Hey, sorry to bug you again."
Quick question.
"Excuse me one minute, babe."
Sorry.
What's going on?
But that didn't mean that Claire was finished watching over Ward's career.
She stopped being a lover and she became a mother.
Sent him off to have his teeth capped.
Made him drop ten pounds.
Showed him how to comb his hair.
It sounds like she was proud of him.
It was ego.
Claire's ego.
You learn.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Lieutenant Columbo.
MAN:
No problem.
No problem.
COLUMBO:
Lieutenant Lucerne.
"I just wanted to fill you in, sir."
Right.
What have we got?
Nothing.
"We still think it was premeditated, don't we?"
"Oh, I don't know, sir."
What do you suppose?
"Well, I suppose if that's your instinct, then it must be right."
"My instinct about Claire, and I don't have any clues to go on, is that she was what they call,"
I believe the term is victim-prone.
"Some people are, you know?"
"And Claire, well,"
Claire was given to taunting people.
She was a born victim.
She was the kind who asks for it.
"In her marriage, in her life..."
Noah.
What happened?
You never told me.
Nothing.
"I, uh, did the right thing."
Good.
That's... that's good.
Okay.
Well...
I'll see you later.
"Because, Sam, it is time."
Time for what?
Cooper thinks we should hire a new doctor.
I think it's time we move on.
I just don't want to rush into anything.
"When we find... if we find someone,"
I want it to be the right person.
"Addison, explain to the man that married his college sweetheart that the best way to get over a breakup is to move fast, throw yourself into a relationship."
"I mean, drunken, impulsive rebound hiring."
"Naomi is gone, man."
You gotta let it go.
What is wrong with you two?
What?
We made a pact.
Addison and I are ignoring our problems.
We are not going to talk or think about our problems anymore.
Nothing even closethinking or talking about our problems.
We're gonna be strong.
Strong.
"In denial, but strong."
Strong.
"Yeah, well, that's, um, you know... stupid."
Mickey!
The Arabs have been gone!
I offer you a peace honorable!
Whether we are to make all alone in that hole?
- With me you have a chance.
- Crack all together for you!
This look is without me.
I should also see him.
- I do not see anything.
- But now you see.
"At the end of a normal film, I too would get a kill, become a hero."
There are no more heroes.
- There are only humiliated.
- Do not say cazzate.
Leave.
We go away on foot.
"Disappeared, lice, Moroccans."
Damn!
Léon!
It's the end of the world.
I do not have the lake.
There will be no more true revolution.
"Now do not you move more, understand?"
Sorveglialo.
Save me ... take me ... where you want ... where you want ... where you want ...
"THIS FILM WAS INSPIRED BY ""The Idiot"" by Fiodor Dostoyevsky."

LIMPET LOVE
"Dear asshole, have you unlocked the safe?"
How brave of you!
Don't you remember about going to the beach?
"Arrizaga, Alonso, Adbinu, Arza..."
I still know it!
"No, please, don't name the whole list."
-Arostegui...
Arostegui comes before Arza!
You're right.
I'm sure I couldn't recognize any of them.
"Arostegui, Arza, De Blas..."
I remember a lot of soccer team lineups.
The Italian one was beautiful.
"Lupo, Taviani, Becattini,.."
"Estébanez, Estremianas..."
Who were the next to Estremianas?
Alcón!
Maybe I know the class list better!
What time is it?
It's 12:15.
-I haven't called Laura yet.
Be right back.
Julian and I were close friends.
"When you're young, you meet friends everyday and then they vanish."
Don't you get bored with our silliness?
-No.
How long didn't you guys see each other?
We met by coincidence the other day.
Apart from that...
Maybe 10 years or more...
You also named that list back then?
I hope not.
The last thing I remember is we were really drunk.
At dawn we decided to look for an old mutual girlfriend.
WELCOME TO THE LABOR MARKET
Any idea where they may have gone?
Did you argue about anything?
Notice anything missing?
"A bankbook, for their savings account."
And clothing.
Do you know why your daughters wanted to leave?
My daughters didn't want to go anywhere.
Did anyone want to hurt them?
"- Any money, anything valuable?"
- Do you know why you're here?
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.
You're here because her cousin served with Judge Andrade.
So skip the song and dance and just find them.
- Lunch.
- I'm coming.
I found it in the brazier.
Please don't tell my husband.
If he finds out he'll kill them.
They've already brought him enough shame.
- Were they with anyone?
- They were alone.
- Did you talk to them?
- They were far away.
- We were with them after that.
- Where?
"At the bumper cars for a while, then we went home."
- What time was it?
- Midnight.
- I know because we had to go.
- Where did you leave them?
Why did you run away then?
In time for the promotion.
There were only two of us:
"I, with 30 years of experience in the field."
And this kid from the academy.
It was full of extensions.
Artificially intelligent implants and so on.
There could only be one of us.
We treat it the same way.
Or your way.
"I guess the manager was probably good, so..."
Trajan son of a bitch...
Trajan became the new commander.
And I...
I was thrown out of this garbage.
Trajan?
General Trajan?
General?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, that suits you."
I always knew that son of a bitch would come up easily.
"At that moment he was so deep in the ass of his superiors,"
"I could smell, what they had for breakfast."
Duty calls!
That's where I meet the Noids right there.
Make sure you go straight.
The 306 cartridges you have.
"I do not want to have lead poisoning,"
Before it's all over here.
Too small for a humanoid.
Who you are?
- Shit!
Kix!
I wanna be poor in other ways.
"We offer sanctuary, but it doesn't come without a price."
Work hard and you will see results.
Commit yourself and you may even find that you wish to stay.
Like a gym membership.
I can cancel at any time?
God in his wisdom has led you here.
Take refuge and hide your secret from the world.
"And once your baby is born, you can return to the outside world."
"Oh, whoa, hold that pregnant pause."
I'm not with child.
Unless it's immaculate conception or I wore a strange man's underwear.
"I just assumed, based on who brought you here."
This is where Lily came to have Chuck?
Ah.
Here come the poor.
"Come, help yourselves."
Help yourselves.
"No, I..."
- Look at this.
"No, I really..."
Look at that case.
- What a surprise that would be...
I'll take that.
...when you get home.
"Listen, poor kid."
You get...
My c...
My couch.
- Is Betty in?
- She's on a call.
Can I take a message?
I used to... act out.
Patrick was popular.
He'd ditch his girlfriend after games and we'd go down to the pier.
"Well, under it."
Did you and Patrick reunite for old times' sake ?
No.
"Michelle, Patrick incurred a suction bruise on his neck antemortem."
What's that mean ?
It means whoever gave him the hickey did so before his murder.
Perhaps during it.
Now we swabbed the area around his neck to check for DNA.
Would you care to give us a sample for comparison ?
Patrick was so cute.
I just wanted to experience that feeling again.
- Okay...
Okay !
- Come on.
Still like that ?
"Oh, you know it."
"But to him, I was still a skank."
Hear that ?
I requested our song.
We didn't have a song.
Come on.
Let's go out there and dance.
"What, in public ?"
Are you kidding me ?
I didn't take you out in public in high school.
Why would I start now ?
"If someone killed him, I can't say I'm sorry."
But it wasn't me.
Alexx...
No idea.
Is there any employee named Deepa?
No one here.
Any news of a suicide due to debts?
"Deepa, say hello to my father-in-law."
Lets go.
Varun.
"Varun, look at me."
I have never seen you so down.
Please don't be like this.
"You won't understand, Sadhana."
Forget it.
Don't say that!
I know you very well.
We have been friends for 7 years now.
I know how you'd feel even without you telling it to me.
And in the same way...
I hope you can understand how I'm feeling.
Varun.
Shall we lodge a police complaint?
"No, dad."
It will create more problems.
"Damodharan, from Chetpet, and his family, commits suicide owing to mounting pressure from debts."
"Damodharan, his wife Pushpa, and 14-year-old son Aravindh... committed suicide by consuming poison today."
The police are investigating the incident.
The locked house...
Mom.
Look at me.
Please.
Mom.
I don't like to see you being upset because of me.
Getting back your vision is a big thing.
You have many fine qualities.
"You are big and strong... full of life, mischief."
I have always feel positive towards you.
"You should see yourself now... in the shadows there, with the smoke all around you."
You're beautiful.
You remind me of that movie star....
-Irina is beautiful.
-Greta Garbo.
-May I help you?
-Yeah.
"Brad to reception, your 1:00 client is here."
You'll call me later?
No phone calls for the first two weeks.
House rules.
I'll write.
I was thinking of keeping a journal anyway.
"Get it published, maybe, under my pen name."
Congratulations.
"You got here, dude."
That's the hardest part.
I'm going to have to search your bag.
"-Cigarettes are Okay, right?"
-Cigarettes are fine.
They're encouraged for patients who smoke.
"But, Chris, no chocolate allowed."
No caffeine or substances containing caffeine.
All set?
"-I love you, baby."
"-I love you, too."
When's Bill coming back?
Next week.
I'll be busy for a few days... but I'll see you when I can.
Quite possibly in her death.
"That's fascinating, sir."
You've got quite a way of putting things.
Especially about Mrs. Daley.
"Let me ask you, sir."
Could you maybe tell me more about her?
Not much.
But you're right.
"About what, sir?"
What you're thinking.
I was lying before.
I didn't like Claire very much.
I haven't for years.
Which doesn't mean to say
"I wasrt shocked by the news of her death, I was."
"And I was still a little bit shook up when you first walked in, so I said whatever sounded right to a detective."
Some other detective.
Not you.
Please sit down.
"Properties, a glass for the Lieutenant, please."
MAN:
"Yes, sir."
"You had me absolutely fooled, sir."
Really?
Scout's honor.
Even after you asked a few questions around the set?
Thank you.
"Our fights, Claire's and mine, werert always discreet."
"And some of them were overheard, I believe."
You must have been told by the crew.
You know how people talk.
"Yes, I do."
Then we'll meet up and talk about it.
Otherwise we talk and talk and nothing ever happens.
That's why we have to take the initiative ourselves.
"Those who want to join, come with me to the entrance..."
The others can think about it.
"If a few came, I'd be happy."
Who here has a camera or a cell phone?
...
Stop...
Two steps to the right...
- Sit down!
Open your eyes!
They're for you.
They're pretty.
What do they eat... water?
You have to feed them.
I have to feed them?
We'll feed them.
They'll definitely die.
They'll last a little while.
So...
What's up?
How's it going with your marketing assistant?
What do you want?
Did you tell her your idea for a Christian community center?
Have a seat!
You know someone who can sing... female... pretty.
You mean Nora.
"You won't get Nora, she belongs to the hotel."
Make me a beer Angie!
"Well, that takes a while."
Then take your time!
I'm... not...?
Rest assured.
You won't have a thing to worry about.
"It is unfortunate but, another one of our students disappeared last night."
We have requested the help of the authorities who now are conducting a thorough investigation.
I'd like to ask all you students to be on the alert...
"All the ones who've disappeared were athletes, right?"
Yes.
"Yesterday, it was the captain of the tennis team."
You might be the next target of the kidnappers.
That's ridiculous!
"When you have that look in your eye, I know you're scheming."
Uh-uh.
Who's planning to capture the kidnappers?
See.
You are!
"Why, the shy little guy's waiting for her?"
Huh?
For who?
Do you plan to get her alone by saying...
"""It's a little dangerous, so shall I walk you home? """
"No, uh... but..."
"What, were you going to invite me along?"
"Sorry, but I have other plans."
See ya!
Go straight home!
Shall we go?
Uh-hmm...
Straight home...
Yeah.
Sure.
You kidnappers...!
They have lots of fun things.
Five.
Six.
It's turning pink.
I work for Caritas.
the Catholic charity.
I work with abused women.
There are cases where I have to think.
"""How can that happen?"
"How can we watch that?"""
But I went through it myself.
And I can only say.
If someone is violent.
Just leave.
Pack your things.
There's always help.
That's it.
When you can't sit for three days.
Maybe we should get you lederhosen.
Do you like it?
- No.
- No?
"In my experience, most men aren't interested if a women climaxes."
They only care if they get their money's worth.
Then there are those who are too tender.
They're not my type either.
"For me, the perfect combination in a man is:"
He's made a place for himself.
"He does his share of housework, and in terms of sex, he takes the lead."
That's just me.
I need a man like that.
"Someone I can do whatever I want with is, sexually, not for me."
You reek like too many frozen dinners.
You drank an entire bottle of cheap Merlot by yourself last night because you live alone and you're hooked on Xanax.
"So you tell me, who needs therapy here, huh?"
I'm just gonna top up my coffee before we get started.
"You do that, doc."
"You've always been strong but you feel your world is spinning out beyond your control and instead of dealing with suddenly feeling vulnerable you're compensating by swinging your big, manly nightstick."
Stab in the dark.
Samir?
Succubus whore!
Samir?
Kenzi?
Arm up.
People are really starting to lose their heads.
"Easy, killer. it's just me."
"Bo, what happened?"
- What's wrong?
What did Samir say?
- Not very much.
"Nothing, actually."
"I'm sorry, Jenny."
"When I got there, Samir was dead."
"Olivia, she's kind of insane."
She got there first.
I was too late.
No.
No.
No.
- No.
No.
- I don't deal well with hysterical.
"Bo, what are you doing?"
"I'm taking the edge off, I think."
"Terrans, Methuselah's, and all of the Empire follow her lead."
"Education isn't limited by birth or wealth, as it is in the Outer World."
Terrans and Methuselah's are all equal before Her Majesty.
Equal...
The two races coexist before Her Majesty's absoluteness.
That is why the Empire is so prosperous and peaceful.
But what if something ever happened to the empress?
If anything ever happened...
it would spell the end of everything.
Esther!
Are you hungry?
You haven't eaten for an entire day...
"Oh, now that you mention it..."
Let us go buy something to eat!
Where could that Seth girl have wandered off to?
!
Honestly!
Who's there?
!
"Looks like you've completely recovered, Ion."
R-Radu?
!
"Nice to see you again, Ion."
Impossible...
You're supposed to be dead!
Dead?
Don't be silly.
Then how could I possibly be standing here?
Have you set me up yet again?
!
You've already killed my grandmother and framed me for it...
Is that how much you hate me?
"No, I'd rather stay."
"The hair brush, please."
Brush her hair.
"Carmela, take the dress off."
Let's hear the news.
Turn on the radio.
"Yes, Prince."
The Duchess is calling.
"Sirs, please follow me."
We are being summoned.
Hare is the Armed Forces radio...
We interrupt our program for an important report.
Mount Vesuvius' sismograph has registered... a sudden rise in volcanic activity.
All commanding officers must report to their bases... for further instructions.
"I repeat, all commanding officers must... report to their bases."
"This night, seeing those unhappy people..."
I have a confession to make.
It isn't easy.
Another time?
"Don't be afraid, we're in Italy."
It was in Italy that confession was born.
"I haven't been honest, Captain."
I wasn't honest.
I'm not here to help the civilian population.
"No, in no way."
I'm here to help Senator Wyatt...
"The President of the USA, the WAC..."
"No, that's a lie too."
I'm here for myself.
"For me, myself, I!"
How?
I don't know.
- Please.
Don't Varun.
You are the only friend that I have left.
I don't want your name in the moneylender's list.
Forget this issue.
Also ask your dad not to borrow any money for your wedding.
Because I have no demands from my side.
Don't get me wrong that I'm... taking advantage of your situation.
I was actually waiting for you today...
To propose.
All these arrangements were meant for that.
Deepa.
I'm visually challenged.
If that's the reason for your silence...
You can tell me frankly.
We can drop this right now.
And remain friends.
Other than that...
There can be no reason for rejecting me.
Because...
I'm handsome...
Charming...
I know it myself.
Hey!
"You did laugh, didn't you?"
I didn't.
Don't you think that we have reached here a bit early today?
"Don't play around, Varun."
It's getting late.
It's not fair to leave me halfway.
I'm going to be with you throughout my life.
"Okay, bye."
"Hey, hey."
What the...?
And we needed to find us some shelter.
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles.
- We are equals.
"- Oh, man."
Of course we are.
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this.
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
What the...?
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
And Puss was never seen again.
The end.
No!
That is not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel!
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you.
"Oh, you're killing me."
It was Prince Charming.
He was packing heat and he wanted revenge!
- I want revenge!
- He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
"Yes, thank you."
(KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS)
Colonel Grant.
As-Salaam Aleikom.
(IN ARABIC) Wa alaikum assalaam.
"Sit, please."
It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
Okay.
Then let us work to resolve it.
"Indeed, yes."
"All along, I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return."
As your Major Sinclair can confirm.
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shoot-out."
The shoot-out.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
"Although, there is still a fatal traffic incident..."
About which we must question Mr. Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes, but complications do occur."
Hmm...
May I visit him?
"Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
As for Mr. Stonebridge and Mr. Crawford...
"Tomorrow, we will send troops into the desert."
"I only pray we find them, before the bandits who have his daughter."
It would be deeply regrettable...
If all my men brought back...
were their two corpses.
"Rest assured, Minister."
Don't worry.
There's no way they'll be expecting this.
I think they were expecting it.
Asami!
Get ready.
Fire!
There are spirits everywhere.
I don't see an opening.
Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side.
Hold on!
The spirits are weighing Oogi down.
We're losing altitude.
"Get off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!"
Whoa!
"If I go, you're coming with me."
Aah!
Bumi!
I wish Varrick was filming this.
We could call it Sky warrior.
Brace yourselves.
Dad.
"Korra, I'm so sorry."
I failed you.
Don't give up.
Harmonic convergence isn't here yet.
We still have a chance.
We tried.
"Congratulations, everyone."
You've all got front-row seats for the beginning of the new world order.
"You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq."
Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful.
"It will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened for the last 10,000 years."
Oh!
"Well, get yourself a drink."
You need a drink.
"Well, I shouldn't, probably."
"I've already taken, like, all kinds of strange things before coming over here, so I don't know."
"- Good, you'll be able..."
- You look very put together.
You handle your things well.
"I do handle them well, but..."
"I'm speaking of allergy medicine in this case, 'cause upstate really fucks with me."
"All right, have yourself..."
"All right, have yourself a merry little Christmas."
I'll be right back.
- Good to see you.
- It's an honour.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
What are you doing in here?
- They said they want you to come back.
- You fucked up.
- Huh?
- Get back in there.
I could have made that transaction in two minutes when I was your age.
Twice a week.
Fucking get back in there.
"Well, it's my understanding that was a different time."
"Women were, you know..."
looser then.
Also much more impressed by authors.
"Yeah, authors like me."
Get in!
"We didn't really play, I just listened to Big Sis and Miyu discuss BL"
Must have been awesome
"But a little while ago, 6 months to be exact..."
"No, 8 months ago?"
Miyu started dating someone
Why does having a boyfriend make her a sex slave?
Lin named her that.
He's darker than you think.
Beware
That's pretty scary...
Maybe with me too?
"No, don't worry."
I have absolutely no interest in you
"Oh, umm..."
I was just kidding.
Sorry
It was a joke?
Yes
The sex slave thing is a joke too
She did sexual things before us and became braggy
So we started competing who could be meaner to her
The way we would compete was...
These things happen because she fell for the wrath of pleasure
I don't really get it
And since when can't you get ahold of her?
About a month...
"No, 4 weeks"
"No, 29 days"
You can't get ahold of her at all?
Yep
That's worrisome isn't it?
Yep

You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.

You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
Doesn't help much with the guys waiting outside that door.
"Yeah, but there are three voices on the recording, right?"
"The one who attacked us, the one who was dead in the basement."
And one guy who will watch outside.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Lock yourself in.
It's the only secure room we got left.

"Yes, it's done."

"Oh, my God, these are them."
Leave me!
- Panju...
When is Manoj's birthday?
- September 12th.
He keeps annoying!
Don't move!
Won't you leave?
Sir...
Stay quiet!
Sadhana!
What are you doing here?
How did you come here?
Are you still after her?
I wonder why I came running for you!
"Your mom is worried about you, wondering where you are, what you are doing..."
"And here you are, roaming behind your lover."
Don't talk nonsense without knowing about the situation!
This is Ashwini.
Are you trying to act wise by changing her name?
I know that it's Deepa.
I can never forget that face.
You were all intimate with her at the restaurant!
If you knew Deepa all along...
Why didn't you mention it when I was searching for her?
"Yes, it's my mistake."
Big mistake!
"I should have found he, gotten her married to you, and blessed you both."
It's my mistake.
Please forgive me.
You will never change.
You will go completely mad roaming behind her!
Please don't blabber without knowing the situation.
It's just like an animal.
"Look, it's chewing it."
Don't be silly.
Get a condom for next time.
Is your wife alright?
She's alright.
- What if she finds out?
- Hum... yeah?
Are you going to tell her that it wasn't serious with me?
What!
?
I told you I was gone on you.
It should have been you.
I met you too late to be my wife.
Would you try to understand the feelings of a pervert?
What kind of question is that?
I've had a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
It's very eerie.
Yeah?
Ah!
How does a pervert who's obsessed with you feel?
I can understand that to a degree.
Then you're a slut!
I haven't worked for Dark Publishing for a long time.
But I'm going to do some work for them.
"Pleasurable work, remember?"
Do you wanna come with me?
"No, thank you!"
Everyone loves your nude pictures.
They've received so many enquiries about you from other magazines.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
"Yeah, well, let 'em rumble."
We're in the clear.
"You trust me, right?"
"As long as the circle stays tight, no one can break us."
"We're family, right?"
What?
- Company.

Who are you?

- I've been tracking you and your whole crew.
- How long?
- Six months... long enough for me to expose you and your circle of dirty cops.

"Those cops are a disgrace to the uniform, but you were top of your class."
Where'd you go wrong?
You'll never know.
What was it?
Get out of here.

Are you pulling my leg?
Feel your ribcage.
Do you feel any pain on the sixth rib?
- No.

It could be further down.
I felt the pain.
That's not all.
You have problems breathing as well.
You're right.
You've been training too hard.
These injuries are inevitable.

Not anymore.
You're the guy who doesn't like cops.

You can't?
Not a thing.
You've been blind a while.
The fact that you're aware of it now... it could be a sign of improvement.
It hurts so much.
Doesn't it?

It's gonna hurt.

Can I talk to him?
He can't actually talk... alright .
I think you had a druids dream.
I think you instinctively knew
You were going to meet da veiga.
"Sydney, nigel."
"(nigel:)doesn't look much like a map, does it?"
I don't understand.
How's that supposed to
Lead us to the astronomicons?
There are words written down
One side of the blade.
"It's latin, I think"
They may reference the map.
"First I nearly get us killed,"
Now I've stolen the wrong package.
"Yeah, well you should have"
Come to us honestly.
(andreas:)I could have proved to you
That I'm an academic in my own right.
Dedicated to the conservation of relics.
But I knew you'd never trust
Anyone named da veiga.
I don't expect you to understand.
Try me.
(andreas:)after my father got back
"From the jungle, he was badly burned..."
Doctors said he'd die.
He didn't.
He asked to see me.
I wouldn't at first.
He hadn't done more than
Send me a card at christmas
And birthdays since my mother died
"Oh, look at this."
There's no place to park around here.
I don't know why they even sell cars here.
Don't complain.
At least you have your health.
"George, watch out for that man!"
"Hey, hey, get back here."
Newman?
The white whale.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig?
- Would you do that?
"- No, definitely not."
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Know what else?
He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
- The one who sits by herself?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
- Really?
Debby told me she fell in love with him because he has perspective.
She thinks a guy who lies about an illness so he can get some phoney hair has perspective?
- He picked her up?
- Walked right over to her table.
Wow.
Jake.
"Jake, take a look."
See?
You're not the only one who has them.
I have them too.
- Where did you get those?
"- Sailing orders, Crawford."
"- Thank you, sir."
- I report to Jarvis in Corsica?
- Correct.
With all possible speed.
Try to avoid any side issues on the way.
How's your glass?
"Your first lieutenant, Mr. Scott-Padget what do you make of him?"
- He is both efficient and keen.
"So keen, he's out with the press gang."
I hate tattling.
"No cursing his efficiency and devotion to duty, but I should warn you..."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, I'd prefer to make up my own mind."
No.
Don't!
You mustn't resist the king's pressmen.
We've only been married three days.
- You don't want him!
He's not a sailor.
- We shall teach him.
Don't take him from me.
You can't!
- I beseech you.
Have pity on us.
- Bring him along.
These men are from the Defiant.
Press gang.
- From our ship.
"- We're Navy, they can't touch us."
We'd have some explaining to do.
- Come with us.
"- You can't, he's a gentleman."
No rush.
They're bringing the horses around.
No rush?
I feel awful we stopped at all.
You swear you didn't do it for me.
Because I'm a terrible rider.
We've gained time on horseback
We never would have achieved by carriage.
But we needed rest.
The horses were about to drop as well.
"And, in truth, it may not matter."
My mother might already be dead.
Don't say that.
You might think
She deserves it after all she's done.
To mary.
I think even mary would say that's in the past.
It will be soon
If I can convince my father to spare her life.
"It's unbelievable, really."
What?
"If all goes well,"
Bash begins his life with mary and I get exile.
And my mother.
Not for long.
"I'll set her up somewhere, far away, with my brothers"
And then...
I'll be on to the next.
Where will you go?
I was thinking morocco.
You don't think you'd stand out in morocco?
Sweden then.
Oh.
Would it be too much trouble if I could come... have a nice night.
Is the only evidence we found at the crime scene.
What can you tell us about him?
He was relatively clean.
He came and went without so much as a peep.

That'll be all.
Thank you.
"All right, welcome to amateur hour."
"I got cash, passports."
"Got a british passport for ""alfred lean,"""
"An american passport for an ""orson hawks,"""
"And an italian pass-a-port for ""federico rossellini."""
We got a film buff on our hands.
What you got?
You find something?
"Well, it sure isn't nothing."
Powdered eggs again.
What am I paying for?
"Still, better than the blitz, right, english?"
"Oh, just barely."
What are you doing?

Are you alright?
Let me go!

I'm saved.
Doc?
Yes.
number one Spriggan.
It can't be...
Is he really?
Oh man.
I heard about your life being targeted.
Chief Yamamoto in Tokyo has been worried about you.
How hasty of you to run away from the hospital and to use Arcam's private jet.
Here.
It's the latest in armored muscle suits.
It's made partly of fibers of a metal called Omihalcon.
That battle suit was created by mixing metal Omihalcon fibers with an artificial muscle structure that is resistant to both heat and pressure.
It enables the user to draw more than 30 times as much power as is normally used.
how long has it been since we've taken any vacation?
was about two years ago.
This is a fighting knife also made of Omihalcon.
With a knuckle guard!
What's this?
Arm pad with wire anchor.
with a strong climbing claw.
Wow.
I will die.
and your God is my God.
I love you!
Everything this woman has is here;
she has nothing else.
I will do my best to get her a good price.
Jabesh.
That's no surprise.
can we start the auction?
Some of us have work to do.
Very well.
When a man dies...
Not another lecture on the law. the brother of the dead man should marry her and care for her.
Such are the commandments of God.
(yawning)
Excuse me!
and now she is left with nothing.
She comes before you now to sell all that she owns.
be as generous as possible.
First up for sale is this poor widow's land.
Ten thousand shekels!
indeed.
I like to help where I can.
What he'd like is to buy up Bethlehem and put everyone else out of business.
ten thousand shekels going once!
I think I'll have a little fun.
and...
Twelve thousand shekels!
going once!
Twelve thousand going twice!
Twelve thousand and five shekels!
Fourteen thousand shekels!
My pleasures are...
Bathing and...
I also keep birds And I like to play Go
Kichiemon also enjoys Go Why not challenge each other?
"Yes, an excellent plan"
Over a game of Go...
Yes It was at a Go tournament
"""You've called halt four times"" ""No, it's only three,"" that's how it began"
"""You're just an idiot, how dare you call me a liar!"
"Draw!"""
I'm so sorry
He always longed to die at war
Dying over a silly dispute
Must have been a shame
At least...
If he had died in a manner more worthy of a warrior...
One moment
I've always been... handy this way
"That's all for today, Soza san"
"So I stand at 7 wins, 3 losses Do come back"
Welcome
Don't stare
Done yet?
Not yet
Tell me when you're done
I hope it's a lot
"A lot, a lot"
"A lot, a lot"
Revenge?
That's right It's just a play
A play?
This'll be your first
Lucy has remembered something else.
She's downstairs?
I thought you took her home last night?
She couldn't get in.
The bloke who attacked her took her keys.
So she crashed in the soft room.
What's wrong with a hotel?
She didn't feel safe on her own.
It was only for one night.
I hope so.
We're not running a BB.
There was one of those beaded cushions on the front seat of his cab and he wore a leather jacket as it squeaked against the beads.
That's great.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Thanks for letting me stay, Detective."
That's no problem.
And it's Sam.
First-name terms?
Eh?
What?
She's one of us.
One of us?
She works in pay roll.
For forensic services.
"She's a victim, Sam."
Even if she is blessed in the looks department.
Really?
I hadn't noticed.
Not much.
"I'll get the warrant for the taxi driver, shall I?"
Argh!
"Carl Lucas, I'm arresting you on suspicion of... murder, robbery and attempted rape."
- Okay.
"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here.
I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
- No fun.
- Company man.
Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good.
You should have seen your face back there.
What?
"When I didn't get off the train right away, you looked like you were about to have a heart attack."
- How was your weekend?
- Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
Spell-checks are usually pretty accurate.
Right.
I'm sure there's a whorehouse correspondents' dinner somewhere.
"Somewhere, yeah."
It's quicker
"--Keep going --Come now, Pavel Ivanovich, don't I know this city?"
Spending government money driving around in zig-zags
So you caught me now?
"Yes, we caught you"
--Wait here.
--It was supposed to be 20 minutes and it's been almost 2 hours now
You may go.
I no longer need you.
--Aren't you ashamed?
No?
--Pavel Ivanovich...!
"I called but couldn't reach you, try to understand me"
Knock it down!
--Young people why are you stealing the materials?
"--No, the guard let us take it"
--Hello --Howdy
"OK, guys, stand up, get closer, let's take the photo"
"--Hello --Hello, Comrade Vasin"
"Sasha, look who's here"
"Comrade, please move over to the left"
Cut in a little more
--Ready?
--One second.
Sasha!
"Comrades, I want to know what is happening here?"
A wedding
"In that case, I wish to congratulate the young couple"
--that's first of all.
And second...
--The young couple is us
"Then I congratulate you, but I request that you clear the premises."
What are you doing?
Really...
What are you trying to do?
I have something to discuss with her.
What would you want to talk to me about?
I'm unemployed!
It will just take a moment.
Have you gone crazy?
Ajussi!
"(Ajussi - older man, uncle)"
What are you trying to do?
You want to use force to deal with girls?
You...
Do you know me?
I don't know anyone who's like you.
"No, I am not the kind of person you think I am."
Don't interfere.
"Miss Kim Min Hee, please get out of the car."
What exactly are you trying to do?
This ajussi!
Really...
She's clearly in a car with another man.
"Whatever you want to do, shouldn't you consider the situation?"
It really is funny.
What's wrong?
Not leaving?
"Mr. Prosecutor, are you okay?"
Mr. Prosecutor.
These clothes will only cause people to misunderstand.
You mean they didn't know you are a prosecutor because of your clothes?
"There is enough evidence, right?"
We almost had them!
charles!
- (gunshot) - (gasps)
Grab it!
Grab it!
darling!
charles!
charles!
I've had the most extraordinary letter!
Madame George Sand is quite brazenly inviting herself to the fortnight!
You know the one.
She wears men's clothes and leads a most depraved life!
I'm dying to meet her.
charles?
"She writes that marriage is barbaric, darling."
They say no marriage is safe around her.
"Just think, she might take a fancy to your turkey wattIes."
Didier!
Don't touch that!
Come here!
I'm in a quandary because I've invited alfred de Musset.
Everybody knows he and Madame Sand practically tore each other to pieces.
I'm petrified that if they so much as clap eyes on each other... (howIs with rage)
Has anyone ever met this duchess?
No.
Must be one of those titled tarts stuck in the provinces with an uncouth husband.
She's probably famished for culture and determined to import it at any cost.
charles!
- Where are you going?
- Hunting.
- Goodbye.
I'II be back in a few days.
- But you can't!
- The colony collapsed.
Mites might've caused it.
"In fact, they did."
Took over every hive.
Not long after Woolsey took over Betty's Bees.
Might almost be poetic if it didn't suck so much.
Kentucky didn 't sabotage Betty's Bees with a lot of might.
- She sabotaged Betty's Bees with:
- A lot of mites.
- Take a lot of mites to cause a collapse.
- Sure does.
I grew up with generations of those bees.
The first hive was an infestation in the corner of my bedroom.
I was 5.
- I tried to kill it.
- Oh.
I was stopped.
"Mother was a Methodist and Daddy was a pragmatist, so:"
"""God put those bees there for a reason."""
- They were right.
- You lived with bees?
That sounds magical.
We called it the Honey House.
The Honey House is empty now.
"We left together, me and the bees."
Those bees built Betty's Bees.
What happened to those bees?
Could it be sabotage?
A conspiracy?
How dramatic.
You think someone intentionally murdered my bees?
- Just a thought.
You can barely hold your sword.
Then come get me.
What?
I...
Seeing that I'm a sportsman I'll give you a moment to recuperate.
They're after me.
After you?
They're after me!
Aku's got a price on my head!
Aku has a price on my head!
We are in no condition to fight.
Especially not with a pajama-wearing daisy strapped to my wrist!
- We must escape.
- Over the side!
Leave it to a lover of basket hats to jump left instead of right.
I'm having second thoughts now anyway.
We have no idea how far down...
"Great job, laddie."
- You have any idea where we are?
- No.
"So, what now, smarty-pants?"
"For the moment, we are safe from those bounty hunters."
We must find shelter before they find us.
We are defenseless in this lagoon.
Shut it!
There.
We'll be safer on land.
- Hear you!
- Blaster!
"What I do not understand is, why Aku is after you."
I have a huge price on my head.
"Oh, yeah."
"They sayyou are gathering a kamikaze company, arent' you?"
-You may go.
"-Yes, sir."
- Have you been in the regular armyfor a long time?
-Ayear and a half.
"As they say, three months oftraining and offwe went."
"- So, you are an incubated one."
- lt seems to look like that.
Ryakhin!
Ryakhin!
"Private Ryakhin, comrade commander!"
- Comrade lieutenant.
"-Yes, comrade lieutenant."
I was told you voluntarily applied forthis mission.
Right?
"Yes, I did."
We are going on a holy mission.
I'm tired ofwaiting.
I was released from prison not for shitheads with shoulder straps to peck me.
I'd rather serve the thug bosses in the camp!
"Come here, dear!"
"Follow me, please."
We are planning a big washing-up here with 20 or 30 baskets waiting.
And there are other people to protect our Motherland.
The next one is Avdeev.
Avdeev!
Sergeant Avdeev reporting to your orders.
You used to be a senior lieutenant in charge of a company...
-You were awarded the Order of Red Star.
Right?
"-Yes, sir."
Now I'm a sergeant.
"- Well, I hope and pray it's not her."
I have so few quality girls left.
"Oh, um..."
How long did Belshazzar last?
Till the end of the night.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"The prosecution have painted the defendant as a jealous ex-husband, as a cruel man with a vicious temper."
A ticking emotional time bomb just waiting to go off.
"I like paintings, but pretty as they are, they have absolutely no place in a court of law."
(SIGHS)
"It's been a very long trial, hasn't it?"
Let me give you the good news.
This is the last speech you will hear on this case.
I just want to focus on one word.
Doubt.
(CHEERING)
BARRISTER:
See you on Monday.
I'll catch up with you later.
Harry!
You...
I...
Were we supposed to meet today?
"- No, no."
I was just passing.
- Oh.
Um...
You were very impressive in there.
The faces on the cops said it all.
"Yeah, well, they've been an absolute joke."
"Shit, sorry."
They're probably your friends.
"Now, listen."
"That left of yours is coming along nice, mate."
Alright?
"That left of yours is coming along nice, mate."
Alright?
"Cheers, mate."
Just wish I could fucking hit something with it.
"Cheers, mate."
Just wish I could fucking hit something with it.
"You will, mate."
You will.
Don't worry about...
"You will, mate."
You will.
Don't worry about...
Brian.
How are they hangin'?
Brian.

I'm with ya!

Bob's got other things to worry about.
Bob's got other things to worry about.
"Hey, Brian, um...you got a sec?"
"Hey, Brian, um...you got a sec?"
"Eh, you haven't come to register a complaint, have you, Frankie?"
"Eh, you haven't come to register a complaint, have you, Frankie?"
- Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
_
(sportscaster speaking indistinctly)
"(chattering, shouting indistinctly)"
- Look at him.
- Just... behaving as if nothing ever happened.
"The best relationship he's ever had is over, and he's just sitting there eating hot wings."
And I'll bet you Colleen is just drowning in tequila right now.
That's not racist.
"No, no, Latinos can swim."
Do we know what happened?
"Yeah, it's the same thing that always happens."
"He meets somebody great, they want a commitment, he freaks out, and then he dumps them, like an idiot."
Yeah.
And he told you that?
"No, he told me to mind my own business."
Wow.
Rude.
Oh.
(Jen clears throat)
"Hey, honey, uh, what has Matt told you about the breakup?"
Oh.
"You know, I wish I could tell you, but can't... bro code."
"Yeah, you don't remember, do you?"
"Uh, maybe he said he was sad."
JEN:
Mm-hmm.
Or fine or maybe happy.
You're a good listener.
Thanks.
"(indistinct shouting, cheering)"
Did I tell her who I am?
Who you think you are.
Oh.
"Oh, we're back to this."
Good.
Who's Gracie?
Tell me what this means.
I...
I don't know.
I swear.
I...
I just wanted the headphones.
Cut me down!
That's the break that you wanted.
"Now, if we'd had that before I went and told you to let it go... you were right."
There was more to this.
"Now, you can give it to your cipher unit, or we can give it somebody who thinks in code."
Otto Goodwin.
You're gonna want him on this.
Just trust me on that.
Otto:
It's beautiful.
We thought it was some kind of...
Oh...
"Some kind of drug accounting book that the names would be suppliers, dealers."
"The numbers would be amounts, delivery dates, maybe payments."
It's chess.
It's what?
It's not drugs.
It's chess.
These names are grand masters.
"The owner of this notebook was playing them, anticipating moves, countering, often beating them."
- I don't think that's an actual thing.
- I don't care.
- Special occasion?
"- Yeah, it's girls' night out."
In a pub?
This pub?
"Safer if Bo's with her own kind so start us a tab, Trickster."
- One drink.
- Maybe two.
- Okay.
"That's right, champ."
Look at that.
"Not only is he dodging charges, he's gonna sue our ass."
- Never gonna happen.
Just talk.
- Yeah?
You can deduce that?
"Interesting, you haven't been deducing shit this past while."
"- Is there a problem, ma'am?"
- You.
You are a problem.
- This is your third complaint.
- Nothing new.
-It's just suspects stirring up shit.
"- No, you're losing control and it's getting in the way."
- I'll try harder.
Better than that.
"You'll report to the shrink and get shrunk, or I am chaining you to this desk."
Well done.
Now you gonna tell me what the hell's going on?
"Come on, this is lame you leaving me out."
"Man, I got the cops, and I got the Fae."
Shall we spring him from jail?
Takur wants to become CP.

# Just remember the poor parachutist
# Who is doing his job just for you
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
Are you going to give it to me?
Maybe.
I don't know where it is.
"Well maybe, you can find it."
Three thousand bucks.
Well that would get me back.
But not with style.

Good evening freulein.
The Bar is closed.
We... we are not thirsty.

The same thing your friend doctor Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties?
Must have slipped his mind.
The man is nefarious.

Guard!
"'I broke the speed record on the way to Robin's 'but even so, I was too late."
'And my fears were no longer just fears.'
Higgins.
Stop it!
Why can't you go after real intruders the way you go after me?
"Too showy, isnt it?"
"- No way, red is fine"
"Agreed, red"
"I have to learn how to drive - no problem, I will teach you"
We'll go wherever you want to
Where do you want to go?
I'd like to go to the sea
"- OK, we'll go to the sea"
What are you planning to do with your share?
Buy a flat
But that costs too much
"No, if you buy it on instalments"
What's wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me I just want a flat of our own
Is this one so bad?
"-No, not bad but..."
"But how far can you run when you are on a plate, covered in butter, wearing a pink tutu?"
- No!
- And a sombrero!
And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
No!
Please!
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes."
And the donkey was never seen again.
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't.
- I did.
No!
Anything but that!
No!
The end.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Who's next in our little contest?
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
OK.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
"Yeah, whatever."
You had your chance.
Now then.
"Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street, in this house."
"A man had come as a last resort, because... no one else would go near the place."
I hear you've been expecting me.
- Take yourself way back.
"Look who is here, Miss Sunshine."
"- Hello, Jocelyn."
- Hi.
How is everything at the mental ward downtown?
"You know, reigns, but always a learning experience."
You're a tripper!
That is lot 163.
"Jocelyn, where have you been?"
Kim Basinger needed to go up on that wall hours ago.
She's the cornerstone of this entire operation.
What could've...
- possibly hold you up?
"- Well, I guess you haven't heard?"
- Heard what?
"- Oh, nothing."
Just the revolutionary new nail color from Mac.
Everyone's freaking out.
Chi Chi fainted.
You should've said that right away.
I'm gonna have to have someone messenger me some.
- Where did you learn that from?
- You know...
- tricks and betrayals.
- But it can be tricky sometimes...
- to take yourself at him.
- I'll try not to.
You've been upstairs?
"If you get the chance, there's a fantastic photo exibition... up there, it is brilliant I think you'll really love it."
Reminded me of you.
I've wrapped it up downstairs.
Maybe we can...
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archaeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
This is history.
Do as you will.
"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...
It's beautiful!
Indy?
"Don't look, Marion!"
Keep your eyes shut!
Marion.
"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory."
"Oh, the money's fine."
"Pardon, my dear, I feel the need of a cigar."
[jazz music]
- The check.
"- Uh, yes, ma'am."
I'll take care of it.
[music continues]
- You may keep the change.
- Thank you.
"We must go now, my dear, pressing business engagement at the theater."
"Waiter, check if you please."
"Never mind, I paid."
"My dear duchess, why are you always paying the check?"
It's deuce and embarrassing.
Anybody think we were married.
"Oh, Commodore, what are you saying?"
"Oh, come, come, we must be dashing."
[engines revving]
Taxi.
[car honking]
"Drop you at the theater, Commodore?"
"No, my dear, just a bracer from here."
I shall call for you opening night and escort you to what no doubt will prove to be one of my greatest successes.
"Until then, au revoir, my dear."
"- Set right, cabbie."
"- Bye, goodbye, Commodore."
"- Ah, Chowsky."
"- Please, Mr. Commodore."
"Ah, what's the trouble, what's up?"
I'm going to drown myself in a sea of vodka.
"Pleasant death, any particular reason?"
Particular reason?
It is the end of Chowsky.
I'M GAY!
HOLLYWOOD HOOKUP!
"Hey, sweetie."
"Listen, Jessica wants you to print a retraction."
- She's really...
- Not now.
Ok.
So we'll talk about it...
"Yeah, that's good."
Celebulimia?
!
?
"Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
"What's that, Harvey?"
"No woman should leave their drink unattended in these troubled times, most of all you."
You ever heard of Jatropha Curcas?
- Your second wife?
- No.
It's a poisonous plant that grows in the tropics.
"Very difficult to detect, flavorless, and it kills in about 15 minutes."
Do you have any idea of how many of these people would like to see you laying on the ground begging for somebody to call 911?
"Damien Fields, less than 20 feet away."
You have pictures of him blowing some guy in Griffith Park.
At least we shot his good side.
Cara Valente.
Expose' on her and her nanny.
- Manny.
- Right.
Manny.
And that time-lapse series on the hooker parade on and off my yacht.
That was very clever.
And very funny.
"Actually, I'm 100% objective."
- Mmm.
"Do you have a dictionary, Mr. Webster?"
- Yeah.
"Take a Magic Marker, cross out the word ""objectivity."""
"Your constituents want you for your opinions, your philosophy... for your subjectivity."
Laver has to duck out of the way of that one.
One that Laver can't get.
He's still trying to recover.
And he zings another powerful forehand past Laver.
"See that, Tim-Tim?"
Know what we call that?
- We call that topspin.
You know how we get topspin?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?
Tell me.
- 'Cause Baby Jesus made topspin.
What?
- Baby Jesus gave it topspin.
- Jesus?
Ah!
Why do you say that?
- Because Baby Jesus made everything.
- Yeah?
Who told you that?
"Miss Moyer in kindergarten, and Mommy says..."
- I have to listen Miss Moyer.
"- Wow, this is news to me."
I gave up my career trying to strike that nonsense out of the public school system.
"Maybe I ought to put him in public school, then."
Remember what I told you about moving your grip down...
Transfer the title to your mega-centre
We will make you neither a dead man nor a convict then.
A few our favors against one of yours.
"-These are good terms, agree to them!"
- No.
"Nod your head, if you don't want to piss blood until the end of your life."
- All right!
Good.
Go to the cell and have a rest.
Call for Seryozha and me when you're ready to go to the notary.
Is it a deal?
Don't!
Don't!
Get in!
Sit down.
I'm Petrovskiy Viktor Appolinarievich.
What is your name?
Korob.
Your first name?
- Igor Alexandrovitch.
- Igor Alexandrovitch.
Nice to meet you on our territory.
Damn it!
I didn't know that I would surrender so quickly!
Did you sign everything that they demanded?
You were right to do so.
They could have killed you.
"Listen to me, old man."
Life is more valuable than the money.
You'll earn it again.
You're still young.
"If you lose something you'll earn it back, if you are healthy."
I want to know where you're building the weapon.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-The hell you don't.
There's a reference to a planet he visited recently.
Azati Prime.
The coordinates match the location of one of the red giants.
"Set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
[Grave instrumental music]
Magnify.
REED:
"It's definitely Xindi, sir."
The hull composition matches the other ships we've seen.
It doesn't look like a Reptilian or a Primate design.
Bio-signs?
None that I can detect.
There's no atmosphere aboard.
-Anyone else in the system?
"-No, sir."
ARCHER:
Put a team together.
REED:
"Aye, sir."
[Grave instrumental music intensifies]
[Theme music]
It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I will see my dream Come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And they're not gonna Hold me down no more
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"
Mmm.
Sorry.
Registration number?
Mmm.
Sorry.

A suit?
"Yeah, a suit."

"Jerilderie's a three-hour drive, mate."
You'd have to overnight it.
"Jerilderie's a three-hour drive, mate."
You'd have to overnight it.
I'm game.
Boss?
I'm game.
Boss?
Any time you like.
But if anyone abuses my father.
I won't endure that.
The teacher's reputation was maligned.
What happened today?
Why is he so timid today?
On one hand the father los this reputation... and the son his stubbornness.
Look Rajan.
I'm not saying anything because father's asked me to.
What a family?
The son can't speak the father can't walk.
Brother!
Teacher.
Surya and Rajan are fighting again.
Brother!
Surya!
Father.
Father.
It's not brother's fault...
Shut up!
Until you two don't patch up... you will stay locked in the same room.
Surya's returning to Dharampurafter3 years.
Won't you go bring him home Satyakant?
He hasn't achieved any act of bravery... that I should welcome him.
He's a murderer.
He's returning after serving his sentence.
Exactly Satyakant.
He's served his time.
Look Satyakant.
Every saint has a past... and every sinner has a future.
If you don't support him at this delicate moment... then you might lose him forever.
Father.
Please forgive brother.
How many ships did you lose?
Hmm.
About half the group.
Flying out of England?
Yes.
Waddington.
92nd bomber group.
"Hey, lieutenant, how'd you blow up that train with 50 guards around?"
"Well, I, heh..."
"Just lucky, I guess."
Don't let him kid you.
Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.
Here's what happened.
We're waiting at the depot at Frankfurt.
Understand?
When an ammunition train comes through the longest ammunition train you ever saw.
Understand?
"Oh, he's just giving it a big buildup."
"Actually, it was simple enough."
"I just drifted into the men's room, fixed myself up a little time bomb, broke open the window and when the train started pulling out, I just tossed the thing into an open car."
I guess there must have been some straw in there.
Yeah.
And about three minutes later you can hear it.
Boom!
Understand?
Broke every window in Frankfurt.
Understand?
It was gorgeous.
Wait a second.
I'm not through.
Understand?
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
I'm worried.
You're never there when I send someone.
I don't know what to do.
You could phone.
That would make things easier.
True.
I hadn't thought of that.
Did you get my check?
Yes.
It was for my cotton business.
I'm worried about that too.
Coming.
Balla has been on the job for three months... and he's been well received by the workers.
His salary has risen and his work rate has improved.
"Therefore, management has decided... to take special measures, though not for the first time."
The police have opened an investigation.
Nothing new!
We've heard this story before... with all its mysteries.
The crowd you see over there is here because of your brother.
All will be known today.
How many times have we taken the blow?
Enough!
"Balla, you'll see us do it."
- Hello!
"- Hello, Touré!"
"The house is quiet, where are the servants?"
Madame has...
Sent them all away?
After I left?
"Naré, what an embarrassment!"
Sissoko is at the door.
How will I explain?
Is that what we're doing?
"Grace, at this point,"
I don't have an answer to that question.
How does it even work?
Would we always pick each other's partners?
"Well, it's our marriage."
It'd be whatever we decide.
"And on that note,"
His name is Jeremy.
He seems like a decent guy.
And his only wish is to satisfy your every sexual desire.
You're really okay with this?
"Me sleeping with someone, and you knowing about it?"
Better than not knowing.
I think.
This is Denise.
"44, software consultant."
"Most important, not looking to fall in love."
She just wants sex.
"You can do that, right?"
All the equipment's in working order.
I feel a bit like we're stepping off a cliff.
Here's hoping there's a trampoline at the bottom.
Donnie?
Simon.
"Look, avoiding my calls isn't going to work."
I need to talk to you about my father.
Don't make me hunt you down.
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
I-I was just about to knock.
What's wrong with that?
"Master, the stance you taught us a few days ago"
Is it like this?
2nd Brother
"Oh, it hurts!"
You bloody fool
"Dad, 3rd Brother beats Gao Jian!"
What's the first rule of our school?
T roublemaker and treacherous fighters
Will be punished severely!
Someone has got a pig's foot to sell
Someone has got a ghost story to tell
Someone has no voice yet wants to yell
"Someone standing on a bench, shivering like hell"
Who over there could be so ecstatic?
I'll feed you to a dog if I get hold of ya
"Wow, don't be so cruel!"
It must be hard on you
T alking wastes energy!
Be careful!
You're out of breath
Mind you don't get a bad breath!
I'm now holding my breath
Save your breath.
I did that on purpose
So that Master will punish you
And I can release my long held breath!
Oh!
I'm sorry!
I've stepped on your injured foot!
Help!
"Quick, go practice after dinner"
- I expect Malaparte knows for sure...
Thank you.
- How much is it?
- Ten liras.
Thank you.
"Yes, understood."
Alright.
Thank you.
"Wow, a Renaissance banquet... in the middle of the Second World War."
"Thanks to my modest contribution, we should be able to avoid... those terrible meat rations and canned pineapple."
ldiot!
"What are you doing, Sergeant?"
"Excuse me Captain, but Private Prewitt... had a regrettable case of Mussolini's revenge."
And it was sudden!
"Right, continue, Sergeant."
But get out of there!
Damn it!
"Stop, there are landmines!"
They'll be killed!
"My god, Prewitt!"
Let me see.
- Are you a medic?
"- No, but I know what to do."
Then get your hands off him!
Give me something to cover him with.
"Why waste time on that, Captain?"
- We have to get him to the hospital!
- There have been many cases like this.
"If we move him, he'll have a cruel death before we get him to the hospital."
"If we make him comfortable, the pain will pass."
- He'll die in his sleep.
- Like a dog!
Thank you ...wonderful to be here.
Excuse me...
"Wow, you could have made an effort, Georgie."
Kill me now.
Hey!
"Oh, hey!"
Funny little dress.
"Such a little bitch, though."
"Ok, who wants to get high?"
"That's not very much for 3, is it?"
"Uh, we're gonna do blowbacks."
Blowbacks?
"What, what?"
Blowbacks.
What is that?
Who's got a light?
I've got a light.
"Thank you, thank you!"
Thank you for coming.
Everyone...
Thank you for supporting the Foundation.
"As you all know well, this auction is part of the Clios heritage."
And we are so glad to see the same familiar faces every year.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you and of course, we thank Georgina for the pleasure of this beautiful location, which is very dear to my heart."
Let's celebrate our beloved Constantine by having a good time tonight.
"Adele LeTissiet, leading light of the international opera scene."
Georgie?
Is everything...
Georgie?
What is this?
Is this live?
"Oh, my God, you are fucking hardcore!"
Turn around.
MacPherson is alive and he's loose somewhere in the world.
- Stopping MacPherson is not your job!
- My what?
Protecting the world happens to be my job!
And right now that is being threatened by an insane ex-Warehouse agent who is competing for artifacts that belong right out there.
Mrs. Frederic said that she will handle it.
I can do it.
He ran a sword through your chest.
- I'm all right.
- You could have died.
"Please just let Mrs. Frederic handle it, okay?"
This?
"This is your job, Artie."
And you're not doing it.
"You have Pete, Myka, and Claudia spread out through the Warehouse taking inventory for you day after day."
"- Meanwhile, all..."
"- Meanwhile, these things are piling up."
"Yes, they are."
I'm pretty hard to kill.
Really?
Really?
You want some of this?
Nice one.
Did not see that coming.
- Playing with yourself again?
- One game.
A quickie.
We got time.
"Besides, none of this stuff's going anywhere."
"Right, buddy?"
"Okay, this stuff is dangerous, all right?"
You do look handsome in your sou'wester.
Really?
Gin.
Mr. Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
"Oh, we'll blame war transport."
- The old ham can make do with me.
So...
Positions!
Positions!
Everybody please be quiet for a take.
Don't stand under any thousand-pounders.
The director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
"No, he didn't say what it was about."
Tell him you couldn't find me.
But-
- But I have found you.
"No, you haven't."
You are exhausted.
"You're leaning against the rail of the ship, the wounded Johnnie cradled-- cradled in your arms."
"Oh, uh, no, thank you."
"You look up, and you see, coming towards you across the deck, a vision of loveliness."
And you say...
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I guess that must be you.
"It's not so shocking, and at same time it's true."
Ha!
Where is my report?
Here.
Yansky!
We'll deal with this together.
What do you look like?
You are dismissed.
The representant of the ecological committee of the UN.
"Ah, so that's him."
Could you please tell us what your first impressions were of your visit to us?
There he is!
"Really, you're right."
Sometimes even in your case it's possible to talk about intelligence.
Doctor.
-I didn't suspect that you know it.
-We scientists are one family.
Doctor Yansky is my best co-worker.
The pillar of our institution.
-Have you seen Mr. Cimrman here?
-He's at yours.
Master Miller!
I have read in Scientist your essay about the curvature of space.
Your hypothesis is absolutely crazy.
But these days crazy hypotheses have the right to be applied.
Congratulations.
Professor Horowitz.
I'm telling you here on this grain of space dust they tap excellent beer.
Come.
"I suppose, space is curved like this."
-I agree.
But...
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"If you just tell me who your supplier is,"
I think this can end very well for you.
What are you doing talking to my client without me present?
You Sneaky Pete!
Which is which?
"What, did the Academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to Baby-Face?
Did you say anything stupid?
"By anything stupid, I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago!
Go on!
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read 'em to you?
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Now you will know when the lenders..
..will come and ask you forthe money!
You will realize when your houses will be auctioned!
You will realize when your mills will be locked up!
What are you waiting for?
Go!
Leave!
Get lost from here!
Leave before my watchman comes here..
..throws you out of my cabin!
Just leave from here!
"I say, get lost from here!"
"Forgive me, sir!"
Forgive me!
"congratulations, sir!"
Congrats!
Why are you so sad at this happy occasion?
Now you have already revenged your enemies!
You have got back yourSwarg!
But still you are..
"Airport, heaven cant be a heaven.."
..unless God dwells in there!
"You are right, Krishna."
We have looked for him everywhere.
But we couldnt find him!
I am afraid that he might have..
"No, Airport!"
It cant be!
As long as I am alive nothing can happen to him!
He is not meeting me because he is annoyed with me.
"But tomorrow, I will visit a temple where.."
..he had found me when I was an orphan!
- Get out.
- Okay.
- So many questions.
It was never boring working with you people.
Hmm.
Back and forth.
Back and forth.
"One day your government wants me,"
The next I'm a crackpot.
"Your own partner said to me, ""never again."""
Even then I knew
One day one of you would be back
To place an order.
Huh?
"Oh, it better be cash."
American credit ain't what it used to be.
What's that?
Another gadget for me to tinker with?
Wait.
I did what you asked.
Lots of eyes to make the switch here.
I guess night's our only option.
White house won't be any easier.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable doing it
Before it gets anywhere near the president.
"It's ridiculous that we don't know what we're protecting him from, but..."
Typical Artie.
"I mean, I understand grabbing the artifact"
Before it causes trouble.
But he couldn't spare two seconds
To warn us about what we're walking into?
"Look, I'm sure if it were really dangerous,"
Do we have to?
Why?
No reason.
Is that all you have to say on the matter?
What is this need to have a reason for everything?
"Oh, of course, I forget, you're a pathologist."
You tend to be very literal about things like reasons.
"When you killed them, when you looked into their eyes, what were you hoping to see?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Killers meet the same end as saints.
"There is no heaven, no hell no final judgment."
You hope'!
Aren't you gonna ask me if I had a troubled childhood?
try and unravel the meaning of it all?
I've got more meaningful things to do with my life.
Tom?
I'm still here.
I've been thinking.
"Not about work, I hope."
About you.
Really?
I've been thinking about you and your father.
You need to forgive him.
If you don't want to end up like me.
What do you mean?
Bitter.
Bitter about what?
Not marrying.
Not having children.
Buying my life in my work.
You have a father.
It's alright uncle.
How many people are so duty conscious like your son?
Feel proud of him.
"Sir, you're really great."
You will catch that thief.
"Looking at the fire in you, if you catch him, he will see his worst nightmare."
You are his perfect partner.
You will catch him for sure.
He won't.
He will catch him.
He won't.
"He will catch him, you shorty."
You won't catch him.
You stupid.
"I'm telling you, he will catch him."
Why are talking nonsense?
Why are you interfering in our matters?
I am talking to my brother-in-law.
You can't catch him even if he stands in front of you.
You won't catch him.
No way.
Day after tomorrow is very auspicious.
Lets fix the engagement on that day.
No.
I've an urgent meeting on that day.
Ministers are coming from India.
Actually...
Sorry.
Don't mistake me.
This meeting was fixed a month back.
Important business deal.
We will have it next week.
"Hey, Sefton, what's snarling up the traffic?"
"By the time we get to look, they'll be old hags."
"Simmer down, boys, simmer down."
There'll be a second show when they put the next batch through.
"Hey, Sefton."
What's the big idea?
Take that telescope out of here.
- Says who?
-Says me.
You take it out.
Only you're gonna have a riot on your hands.
"Every time the men get packages, you think up some angle to rob them."
"The Krauts find that, they'll throw us in the boob."
They know about that.
I'd worry about that radio.
They know about your distillery and the races.
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Ask Security.
Go on.
Tell him.
You've got me shadowed every minute.
- Haven't you found out?
-Not yet.
Answer.
How do you rate all these privileges?
I grease the guards.
I give them 10 percent.
And maybe a little something else.
- What?
-Maybe a little information.
Break it off!
Because blood relations never break.
Good bye!
Sheen!
Sheen!
- Shadab!
- Yes!
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.
"Son, I want to talk something important with you."
"Yes, tell me!"
I was having a talk with your father regarding your marriage.
What have you to tell?
"Mother, this is a matter of the house."
I shall accept whatever you and father decide.
This is your generosity!
Yet we feel we should know your views.
We wish to talk about your proposal with Sheen.
Do you like Sheen?
"Mother, you know that I don't like interference in my work.-Yes."
"So, how can I interfere in matters between you and father?"
I am okay with whatever your decision might be.
- Bye!
- Be happy!
"If we could ask sheen, just once."
Sheen likes India very much!
She tells people in Karachi that we are half Indians.
So let the marriage happen!
She will become a complete Indian.
"Brother, India and Pakistan's relations are so sensitive."
It can go bad anytime.
And...
Let the marriage happen in this country.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
And that's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
"Right after I got here, I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup."
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
What's up?
Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You piece of shit!
you motherfucker!
Look at me!
I always wanted to be a gangster.
To me beinga gangsterwasbetterthan  being president of the United States.
Even before I went to the cabstand for an after-school job
IknewIwantedtobe partofthem .
it meant being somebody ina neighborhoodfullofnobodies.
They weren't like anybody else.
[sighs]
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
[honking horn]
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
[sighs]
[car doors shut]
[woman] thank you.
"Thank you, sickle."
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic And low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape To the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
Uh-uh.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
Ishmael...
What happened brother?
You never came with me for help.
Ready for this?
"I do not know, Ish."
"Come on, Commander!"
Your team is waiting for you
All members of the UCF crew have arrived...
Ash-393 is considered to be the most sophisticated noid ever created by men.
A class one surface humanoid 300 Series.
It has full AI access.
He was the leader of Noid's rebellion.
He was.
Is dead.
"By rumors has many crimes In the Federation of Arizona,"
He recently arrived in the northeast corridor.
The reactor 12 has been turned off.
He killed 28.
"Hidden by intelligence, it is in the death zone 714."
Hidden in the death zone?
Does not sound very clever
The fusion of the nucleus has probably smoothed the brain of the Noids.
"Or, Commander?"
Not as soft as your dick.
Revenge is a bitch...
Like you!
"What, Kix?"
Stop him!
Five years ago I got a team sent to kill Ash.
We lost contact here.
There temperatures must be subarctic.
Your Iso-Gel will last 48 hours.
Johnnie.
I wouldn't blame you.
Branigan is one in a million.
And I'm not much to write on about.
Am I?
I'm just an everyday sort of bloke.
Everyday!
?
Everyday for the rest of my life.
Good work!
Bloody good show!
Two shots so far!
"If this thing is being treated for color, it's going to look marvelous."
God!
The American's teeth.
Can that be real?
"If the studio shoot goes half as well, this picture is going to be a triumph!"
"There is however, one area of concern."
Uh!
"Memo, please."
From American distributors.
"I'd ask you to absorb what's said without division, Buckley."
American picture goers liked to be knocked off their feet.
"Bangs, crashes, ambulances careeding around corners."
The same goes for romance.
"What you call understatement, translates as a lack of, uhmf..."
Americans feel that the ending is presently written is too subtly too newses.
Restrained.
Restrained?
I mean it's practically a call to arms!
"Their concern is more, what one might crudely call..."
"""A love triangle"""
"Come on, get out."
Quickly.
Be as quiet as possible.
What a surprise!
I studied in Fuente Nueva as well.
I wasn't there for long.
I studied for one semester and...
Padre Julio!
"Come on, señora, I think one of the men is dying."
Hurry up!
I was about to change the bandage when I noticed he was unconscious.
- Probably internal bleedings.
- Yes.
"- Padre Miguel, I want to tell you something."
- We must operate immediately.
Prepare everything.
"Nurse, I think there's enough plasma left."
"Yes, I'll go and get it, Padre."
Come on.
You ungodly lot!
How dare you threaten me with guns in the house of the Lord?
You're protecting rebels in the name of your Lord.
How many?
We're not protecting them.
They turned up out of the blue.
Some were injured.
What else could we do?
They carry guns like you.
You'd better be sensible.
"Being a priest, I'm sure you detest lies."
Where are the rebels' guards positioned?
You must promise not to kill them.
The world is full of mysteries.
"""Temporary physician's parking."" Right."
"Hey, nice one."
Idiots.
Why don't you learn how to drive?
Stop that.
"Sorry, Dad."
I...
"Look, Dr. Stegman is clearly not coming."
We've all got a lot to do.
Let's start.
He's got a heavy caseload.
You can't expect him here on the dot.
"As he has no neurological complaint, his mental condition... is irrelevant to this meeting."
"Come on, Brenda."
Let's start.
Incompetent system.
I should have just been issued a windshield sticker.
Check this out.
Boston.
General.
Why don't you go collect your welfare checks?
This is a hospital zone.
Look at him.
"How's the famous artist, Hook?"
He is stable.
I admitted Eleanor Druse yesterday.
Good-time Sally's back in town.
She's presenting with numbness of the right arm and possible neurological insults.
"What is this, her tenth admission?"
And that's just since I've been here.
"Sooner or later, the little girl who cries wolf is telling the truth."
- Explains no pulse.
"Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven, dip a urine, chest and pelvis x-rays."
"Chen, give me your hands."
- What are you doing?
- Hold tight.
Ken!
Have you ever been to Hawaii before?
"- Well, pretend that you' re there now."
"- Pratt, wait!"
I can't believe you!
I feel better.
I feel totally better!
I feel totally sick.
Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds?
No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
"In other words, I just saved your foot."
Thank you.
You' re wonderful.
- Subclavian's in.
Is that the film?
- Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.
- He's holding his pressure.
- No pneumothorax.
Looks like a widened mediastinum and loss of the AP window.
Hard to tell.
The pulmonary contusion is impressive.
One of us should go with him to CT.
Not unless you' re ready to crack the chest.
"Flail chest, pulmonary contusions, and labile hypotension."
Could also be from a splenic fracture.
"Carter, I'd like an aortagram."
"Better yet, a TEE."
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions.
Take it or leave it.
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.
This is my last hatchetjob.
"All right, it's a deal."
Money's no object.
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.
"Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
Want to change your mind?
Why take thisjob?
Ifshe doesn't have a cornea transplant soon... she might lose her sight forever.
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong... but it's always empty.
"When a donation does come in, someone else gets it first."
So we're going to try abroad.
I have to leave you for a few days.
"When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery."
"You will come back, right?"
I promise.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
Many VIPs and government officials will attend the opening ceremony.
You are assigned to protect them.
Their information is in your files.
Make sure you're extra alert!
"Yes, sir!"
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."
Attention please!
I'm sure that President Mateo and I... would both welcome the votes of only those people... with sexual indiscretions in their past.
We'd be landslide victors every time.
"Hey, Sheila."
- They've been waiting for you for about ten minutes.
- Okay.
Hey.
"- Henry, I gotta talk to you in five minutes, okay?"
- Okay.
"How about ""Her involvement in prostitution""?"
"No, no."
You gotta couch it like it's something... for the FB...
the AG to investigate.
"- Hi, Reggie."
- Hi.
"Well, how about, ""How embarrassing it is..."
"- that the..."" No, no, no."
- Who...
- What?
- Where's Gilmore?
- Gilmore.
"- Um, Idaho?"
Iowa?
Can I interrupt for one second?
We're all set with America Live.
What are you guys talking about?
We're just going over our statement... in response to The Washington Post story.
- What story?
- The one that says the secret investigation is ongoing... to determine whether she accepted money... for her activities in college.
I didn't hear about this.
"Well, it's, uh..."
"It's, um..."
It'll be in...
I started imagining the future.
I felt everything fell apart.
As Clara was talking...
I felt more afraid.
"Without noticing, I repeated several times:"
"""I won't know how to live alone""."
One of them got Clara mad.
And she said:
"""You've always lived alone!"""
That I should be used to it already.
That even in those moments I was incapable of saying that I couldn't live without her.
That I only thought of myself.
You didn't think of me?
We'll talk about you later.
And what did you two say about me?
I remember telling Clara that I wanted to see you more often.
We discussed some issues concerning you.
And why didn't you ask me?
You were too little.
How long ago?
Two years?
More.
Three?
Would had you preferred to live with me?
No.
Then we decided right.
Yes.
"Not long ago, a girl wrote a letter to Max."
But then she broke it.
You tell me why.
If you interrupt me I lose the inspiration.
The letter said:
... whenI hadthechance to kill that man...
... alltheseyearslater...
... Ihadto do it .
I reckon I'll find out soon enough if God hold me to judgment.
But I'm glad I did it.
"I have to say, this is-- Well, it's a little unusual."
"Um, what shall I call this document?"
A pre-matrimonial stipulation agreement binding to both parties.
All right.
Where do we start?
First and most important...
... shemustbe availableondemand to the marriage bed.
-Except when I'd rather not.
-Agreed.
"And he will, of course, have accounts set up in my name..."
... atallthestoresandsalonsintown .
Of course.
Because she has to do the cooking and shopping for the house.
Only if you want to starve to death.
You'll want a chef and a maid.
-Trust me.
-Fine.
And he must absolutely stop spouting that maudlin poetry at all hours.
Only if she agrees to wear her wedding ring...
-... whenshe'soutinthepubliceye.
-l'll pick out the ring.
-Mm-mm.
-Agreed.
"is that it, then?"
-Can't think of anything else.
-Neither can I.
You both agree the wedding will be tomorrow...
Remember when you made me do chin-ups in the jib crane?
I bloody well did.
-Let's try it again.
Remember how you used to force me into the garbage can?
"Come back, I feel dizzy."
It'll be great to fall down once my muscles get tired.
It'll be such a relief.
How many can you do these days?
Twenty?
I don't feel like jumping anymore.
I want down.
"I'll do a few more, I feel so great."
You ruined my show.
He's coming.
You've been named firefighter of the year.
Irma did this at the factory.
-It's called The Flame Man.
"It's fireproof and you can take it anywhere, even the sauna."
"Come on, guys..."
Guys?
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Where's Viljanen?
Dear colleagues...
Representatives of the TV...
Distinguished Governor...
I thank you on behalf of the fire brigade.
Let's hope that this publicity will bring us more funds.
Viljanen!
Here.
The costume is a gift from his colleagues.
"Congratulations, firefighter of the year:"
My name is Jean.
Jean Jacquemonde.
Where is Mayzel?
!
You want to pick on an old man?
I'm here.
I've got you.
My body became like this because of you.
Ominae!
Jean?
Don't move!
brainwashing him with all the troubles of life your abilities are still only this much.
I'm going to stop the source of your breathing now...
Ominae!
...with this machine body of mine!
You've finally shown your true colors!
That is ENOUGH!
He's already dead.
Both Little Boy and Fatman failed to obtain Mayzel.
They were just big talk.
It was predictable.
that was all they could do.
what if they continue to hold Noah?
Don't worry about that.
When our satellite probe was destroyed the investigation into the magnetic field occurrence was quite significant.
along with the other message plate prove that we are the ones who are holding the key to Noah.
What great confidence.
I will kill all who interfere with me.
quietly.
You seem to be tired.
Who was he?
My former boss.
Yes
Where are you going?
Nilüfer will take you to your aunt's
Come on let's go
Did you understand what I said?
There's a leather covered notebook on his table.
Find the notebook and bring it here
If you are busted.
I didn't send you
Don't say anything
I'll protect you
Don't worry my Sultana
"Come on, make me proud"
"""Io"" means ""I"" my prince."
"If you use the Io all the verbs should end with ""o"""
Sultan Süleyman Khan his Highness
Benvenuto padre
Thank you my lion
Our prince learns very quickly your Majesty.
"He's very smart, mashallah"
I wonder about the sculptures İbrahim.
Do they look good in your yard?
They look magnificent.
But the folks gossip about it here and there
What did my father say?
"He quoted book ofDante Alighieri's, my prince"
"You follow me, the others can keep talking"
"It is enough for today, my Mustafa."
But no dodging.
You'll study hard
"Are our horses ready, İbrahim?"
"Yes, your Majesty"
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"Tell Travis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."
"Right away, sir."
Hey.
"SUBTITULADO EN EL ""PROYECTO GENESIS"" 3 TEMPORADA ENTERPRISE"
- Mar.2004
NARRATOR:
Previously on Enterprise:
HELMSMAN:
The Insectoid ship's been damaged.
Target the second one.
Is that what this is all about?
You think I want to replace you?
"You just can't stand taking orders from me, can you?"
-Tell me something.
-What?
Why won't you let me do my job?
- How are classes going?
- Tough.
Physics.
"- Oh, physics is tough."
"- It's not the work, it's the students."
"A student, to be exact."
- My back.
Personal growth is so painful.
"- My son, doing manual labor?"
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
"Hey, Mom."
Check out this ironic twist of events.
"- Ryan is now a science nerd, I'm working a blue-collar job."
"- That's nice, honey."
- Mom?
"- Oh, Seth, don't worry."
"Your grandfather's situation is very serious, but your father and I are handling it."
Right.
Grandpa.
"To tell you the truth, I haven't even like... um..."
"- .. slept well the past couple nights, so concerned have I been for his well-being."
- But everything is going to be okay?
Right.
- Right?
- Right.
"And what, if Grandpa, like, he did have to go to some white-collar prison with tennis and TiVo, then...?"
"- Don't worry, Seth, it won't affect you."
- He wouldn't lose the company?
- No.
- What about the house?
- Son.
That's crazy talk.
"Mr. Goode, no matter where this ends up, I want you to know, justice was done here today."
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Congratulations.
"I am rarely speechless, but I am speechless."
Thank you.
Thank you both.
It's not over yet.
"They're going to drag this out in appeals, so..."
I thought it was going against us.
Sometimes fate smiles.
"Will, are you standing or sitting?"
Which one do you want me to be?
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Do you know what this means?
That we can pay off our balloon payment.
And dodge the executioner for another quarter.
If you get a settlement.
Where's Canning at?
He'll appeal.
For effect.
$25 million should motivate him.
"Peter, you okay?"
We have a problem with the house.
We?
"Uh, Jackie."
She paid ten percent in cash on the down payment.
"Apparently, she was bidding against someone."
Me.
She was bidding against me.
So I'm planning on going ahead with the purchase and then flipping the house in a few months.
"Well, I am, sir, aren't I?"
"- Nothing to worry about, sir."
"- Oh, I'm sure there's not."
I'm inquiring about a missing cabinet last seen in her possession.
- I don't know if you know anything?
- I've no idea.
"Now, please..."
"- Well, won't you come in?"
"- Yes, thank you."
This is Lord...?
- How do you do?
"- And this is Miss, um...?"
This is a most genial gentleman from the police.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Will you have a glass of sherry?
"Well, I'm not supposed to on duty, if you'll pardon the... word... but a small one for medicinal purposes."
- Splendid.
- Yes.
"Well, for what we are about to receive..."
"Oh, Mumsie, need we flee the country?"
If we made a clean breast of it...
Murdering a stranger by mistake?
Go and finish off that trunk.
How you can use that of all trunks?
(Screams)
- Now what?
- It's...
It's Daddy Batty.
He would come!
Get rid of him.
"We're going on holiday, remember?"
"Well, let me in."
Cleveland?
You're all in grave danger!
There are Somali pirates... they're gonna attack... any minute now... so we need to be prepared... (clears throat)
"♪ Ow, she's a brick house ♪"
(gunshot)
"Give us the gold records, and nobody gets hurt until after we get the gold records."
Nevah!
Don't worry.
I'll blow these pirates away with the power of the funk!
(strums chord)
♪ Funk powerrrrr!
♪
It's okay.
He wasn't one of the original members!
(smattering of applause)
"(gunfire, panicked screaming)"
(explosion)
"Oh, Cleveland!"
"So, you decided to go on the cruise without me, huh?"
"Well, to make it up to me..."
"Roberta, cover your ears."
"I want two oral sins when I want them, even after a flight, and no reciprocals."
"Get us out of this, and you can have one with no reciprocals and three egg cracks."
Mm.
Can I have an egg crack now?
Crack.
Ooh...
"Oo-hoooo, there's egg all down my shoulders."
Shiver.
So gooey.
"Okay, stay here, I'll be back."
(shudders):
"Yes, of course, I want all those things."
Then tell mary I will cause her no harm ever.
And that she will cause you no harm
By loving you.
By marrying you.
Go to her.
Marie:
But do it quickly.
I see your son's return has restored your will to live.
It's because he will live.
Your magic has changed.
How silly and marvelous.
"You don't believe in prophecies, do you?"
"No, I never did."
You're...
Marie de guise.
"Your future mother-in-law,"
If you so desire.
"If you get on your horse, and stop mary"
From making the biggest mistake of her life.
Where is she?
Heading for a church near a quarry.
The servants talked about a village
Nearly destroyed by the plague.
"Yes, I bribed them."
He may as well know
"Who I am, if we're to be kin."
I know the place.
Then hurry.
His hands on everything you want.
"Your majesty, a messenger has arrived."
He said there's news regarding the line of succession.
Do you want her to get raped and murdered?
Of course not.
You sure?
'Cause this is America.
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.
Then stop fucking with me.
This is serious.
She's adorable.
So you guys are fucking fugitives?
It's just it's Kumar's fault.
If we get out of this... the chances of us remaining friends is highly... highly--boobies.
Yeah.
"Hey, what do you think you're doing?"
Put that back on.
And keep it on.
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?
Yo.
What are you guys talking about?
Roldy was just letting me in on your situation.
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.
What about that fuckin' time we had to cover for you... lie to your ex-girlfriend about how you got crabs?
"You owe us, man."
"- Yeah, that's right."
- What?
"- OK, that was a long time ago."
- I love crabs.
Speaking of ex-girlfriends... isn't yours getting married or something?
How does everybody know about this except for me?
Wait.
"Well, let's call him in for the notification."
You haven't cut yet?
"You ever defrost a chicken, Agent Kelton?"
It takes time.
Your decident Amanda McNeil has minimal freezer burn.
Best guess:
She was kept in an airtight industrial refrigerator.
Any idea of cause of death?
I can't say for sure until I cut.
"Given the petechial hemorrhages, she probably died of asphyxiation."
"No ligature marks-- so, maybe drowning."
What about time of death?
Gray at the roots.
A little over an inch.
Average growth is half an-inch a month.
So she was alive about two months after her last visit to the hairdresser.
That was the day before she disappeared.
Two months.
That's plenty of time to party.
"Hey, Joe."
Take it easy there.
"- Sorry, Cap."
- Bucket up.
Hey!
You're eating my sandwich.
"Well, finders keepers, right?"
I was hungry.
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Nope.
"Well, enjoy."
I'm looking for a job.
"At Monty's bar, they're looking for a waitress."
I don't like green cars that much
This is an assault nobody moves!
"Get down, c'mon, lay on the floor"
Lay on the floor give me the car's keys
Don't make a move
Put your head down and don't move
"Let's see.... you, open it for us open it!"
Do it or I'll kill you
Let's go
Faster!
"Come on, open it!"
Open it fast or I'll kill you
What's up now?
"The key, I don't have the second key"
Who has it?
Who has it or I'll kill you
The interventor
- Who is he?
Who is he or I'll kill you
Ramirez
- Who is Ramirez?
", who is Ramirez?"
Who is Ramirez?
You are Ramirez?
", come on here You have to open the locked door"
Did you ring the alarm?
"- No If you ring the alarm I'll kill you, eh?"
"Get out of here, c'mon"
Faster
"Come on, faster"
What are you looking at?
"Come on, lay on the floor"
But...
What?
Seems like he doesn't like you
Who is your Master?
Shi Zhengzong.
Have you heard about him?
He was nicknamed Thunderstorm
He has good technique and holds high acclaim
Thunderstorm?
Think I lied to you?
If he has good technique n' all that... how did I break his bones three years ago?
You've beaten him up?
I despise these hypocrites who call themselves
The decent school of martial arts
All they know is vanity!
"Don't worry, I won't beat you up"
Because we are good brothers!
Of course!
"Brother Jin, are you okay?"
T omorrow get me some medicine Tianqi and Baiyao
1 0 grams of Tianqi and 50 grams of Baiyao
Please get it from somewhere else!
Why?
I've got money?
Get it quick!
"Tianqi, Baiyao"
Do you need them for cuts?
"Hey, don't you want to do business?"
What are you doing?
"T ell me quick, do you need them for cuts?"
It's not your concern
I'll cut your head off if you don't tell me!
"Oh, you ungrateful child!"
You don't care about anyone but yourself!
How did you get that way?
You know what losing your father has done to me and yet you take your life and throw it around like it was worthless!
Why?
'Cause I wish I was dead.
Don't you understand that!
?
"I wish I'd died over there, Mom!"
"Well, you didn't die and I'll be damned if I'll stand around and watch you kill yourself."
Enough.
"Enough, Mom."
God.
You guys are so freaking serious.
"Hey, sorry."
- Hey.
So late.
Any word from Justin?
"- Yeah, he got arrested."
Don't ask.
He's fine.
You almost missed grilled cheese night.
"I'm sorry, I've let us all down."
They're out of grass skirts.
They just sold the last one.
These'll be great.
"Today is one of those days where everything you decide really, really, really matters."
You....need something aside from grilled cheese.
"You need someone to say, ""Congratulations!"""
What for?
Your promotion.
How did you know?
Miyu
Why are you doing this?
"You broke up with that guy, you should come home"
Why didn't you tell me?
I was planning on going home but thought I'd stay a little longer
Why?
Did you think that coming back home wasn't cool?
You were showing off like this amateur virgin?
Nope.
It's just more fun being here
You're having fun doing this job?
"Yep, it's very fun"
Why?
You won't understand
Why not?
Cause you're a virgin
Thanks for everything.
Now it's my turn to work for you.
There's something I want to do with you the day after tomorrow.
What?
Hold hands and walk together.
"Hello, package delivery for you."
"Sure, okay..."
Just a moment.
Coming.
"That'll be 1,280 yen, cash on delivery."
Thank you very much.
It's the book we ordered online.
Don't you think we're fine after all this time?
"No, just hang in for two more days."
"Well, 38 hours to be precise."
"Please, just be patient."
Look through her.
"I mean, make her think she's the most exquisite thing your eyes have ever beheld."
- Who her?
- Who cares?
Pick somebody.
"Well, how do I pick?"
- You got eyes?
- I thought we established that.
Make eye contact.
Make her eyes believe that your eyes are interested in her.
- So I have to be interested in her.
"- No, you're overachieving."
You only have to make her think you are.
"So we find, in Fielding's novel, the character Tom Jones is absolutely irresistible to women."
"- Isn't that right, Matthews?"
"- Uh, yeah, that's right."
- What's right?
- What you just said.
- What'd I just say?
"- You weren't listening, either?"
"Matthews, keep your head facing this way."
"Shawn, tell your buddy what I was saying."
"Uh, he was saying, ""Matthews, you're not listening."""
Thank you.
Did either one of you guys do the reading assignment?
- Some of it.
- What did you read?
I read the page you handed us with the reading assignment on it.
- (bell rings)
- Yay!
Yay!
- What?
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved, doesn't seem to believe in you."
"Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony."
"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
Get back!
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."
"Now, Tony, those wine casks... stack them... neatly."
"Two glasses of burgundy, please."
To molecular mobilization.
To molecular capitalization.
"Hey, got any more clues?"
No.
Nothing at all.
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety of the passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died of a heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
- Do they make pink slate?
- That's enough.
"If it doesn't match your pants, I don't want it."
Slate is a word that falls apart if you say it more than three times.
"So 21 ,000 tons of slate by June."
"- Slate, slate, slate."
- Slate is a stone around my neck.
- Because you took it for granite.
- Right.
Cut it out.
We're slated to install these interiors... I'm going to do the rest of this job by myself.
- Yeah?
Rick.
- Huh?
It's for you.
Yeah.
Uh...
Now?
Okay.
Miles is here.
- l thought I smelled sulfur.
- You... shut up.
"Sammler and associates, I greet you."
"Sorry for the intrusion, but I needed a word with you, Rick, sooner rather than later."
"Well, sure, Miles."
"How was your vacation, by the way?"
Vacations can only be judged by the degree of discomfiture upon one's return.
"In this case, the vacation was a grand success."
"Do you believe in portents, Rick?"
What do you mean?
- How's your filing system here?
- Excuse me?
- Do not think of it.
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.
I'll show you out.
"Margaret, get the gentleman's hat."
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?
John Willoughby of Allenham at your service.
John Willoughby of Allenham...
What an impressive gentleman!
He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf.
- Tell me if I hurt you.
"- She feels no pain, Mamma."
"Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress."
Please don't say anything important.
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy.
Ten words at most.
"- Change, or you'll catch a cold."
- What care I for colds?
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right.
Help me.
He's worth catching.
Marianne must not have all the men to herself.
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.
But what are his tastes.
They'll send someone more skilful here and we won't go anywhere else anymore.
Don't be crazy.
Why didn't you keep the finished answers?
-Our methods are good for nothing.
-So we must use their methods.
"It seems that if someone gives you one blow,"
-you have to strike back.
-You think?
-What are you doing?
-Strike back.
-At once?
-You mustn't hesitate!
If you think...
-How was it?
-Fine!
"Well, that's it!"
"Hurray, we have it!"
-They haven't worked this out badly.
"Pick it up, the galaxy is waiting for our report."
"One moment, we'll just settle something here."
"So you see, an agreement is always possible."
Hush!
The planet is called Earth.
It's inhabited by living creatures.

I want them.

"Would you shut your mouth, bitch."
Who asked you?
Help me.
"Beware, the sailors were here."
They were completely drunk.
Save yourselves.
There is nothing I can do.
I have no more power left.
"Yes, I can save them by myself if you wait here until daybreak."
You will keep them alive until then!
My powers will leave you and return to me.
I will save them.
"Yes, I know what will happen."
You will be left powerless against your enemies.
You will be quite defenseless.
But they will live thanks to you.
That's good.
It's nearly dawn.
Leave as soon as it's light.
Try to save yourselves.
They will live!
Your revenge escapes you.
In this crazy world.
the only thing that might possibly be left for you is generosity.
- Do they have to die?
- In a short while.
I would like to save them.
They gave us their lives.
Can't you help them?
Nothing can save them now.
'Morning.
"Rosa, close the door."
There's a draft.

Of course.
How are you?
How did you sleep?
I'll buy you a coffee.

She went into a coma during childbirth.
"Meryl was a PVS, persistent vegetative state, like Lydia."

Her recovery contradicts all I'm about to say.
So that means there is hope.
"No, I repeat, scientifically, no."
"But if you choose to believe, go ahead."
She can open her eyes.
Or am I imagining that?
"No, she can open her eyes."
But that doesn't mean she can see you or is aware of anything.
Lydia's cerebral cortex has been completely destroyed.
But the brain stem is intact.
Can you see beyond looks?
I see a bad future for my daughter.
How are you returning?
Jai's picking her up in a helicopter.
- We'll drop you
I'm ashamed!
He claims he's building the fastest car in the world!

What's lacking here?
- We needn't suffer like this
"Problem is, you've lived comfortably."
You got no idea how difficult life is
Why should I care?
My parents can give us a life of comfort
"For your comforts, not mine."
- You don't care for me
If my determination is selfishness do whatever you wish
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

I don't want to see reason I'm not living in this junkyard
This is home!

DOCTOR:
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
How do you feel about the girl?
She asked a very good question.
-Which was?
-Why?
"Well, that's a question that needs to be asked."
We are not sociopaths.
We're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else.
"We face these decisions every day, and we vote up or down."
"Like everything else, it has all been distilled down to zeros and ones."
They have asked for me to describe your emotional state
(helicopter hovering) in as detailed a manner as possible.
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field.
A man with your talents...
"My talent is gambling, Pop."
"Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it."
I want to spread out.
"I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky."
"I know I'm going to miss you, Pop."
"Is he staying with us, Pop?"
"No, he's made up his mind to get married."
How do you like that?
Letting his marriage interfere with our career?
We shouldn't have played his hometown.
It was a bad move.
Bad for us and bad for him.
Local boy makes bad.
"- Father, has he come yet?"
"- No, and it's all very much as I expected."
"Hi, fellows."
- How do I look?

Wait a minute.
You're not going like that.
Of course.

What do they possibly need from a drunken nietzschean

Or maybe they have an actual chain of command
And they're waiting for orders.
"You know, if i was a bad guy, i would split us up."
"I mean, why let us conspire unless they want us to?"
Confident in their monopoly of power.

Is it your felicitation ceremony or mine?
You have achieved a great thing.
You've got all the accolades that I should have for my service for 37 years of service today!
Sir...
I just did my job.
People giving the praise...
The photos of the victims have been recovered from Vasundhara's phone.
Is that you?
That is definitely you!
Why would you take a picture that close to her!
Dear...
She is already jailed.
Your anger still not subsided?

"Varun, I'm coming for you."
- What's cooking?
- My mother's recipe...
The chairman of Maruti and I are good friends.
If you say so...
I can talk to him about a job forJai
Jai has several job offers
"All he has to do, is select."
I'll talk to him right away
You aren't doing this for yourself.
You're brilliant.
And we're duds
You can use computers to dig out the exam papers for us
"As morals say, one ought to help pals"
All right.
See me at home tonight
Inside the university's mainframe!
What frame...?
We're inside the university bank.
We just got to break into the papers
Just got to figure out the password.
Of course you will
Let's concentrate
"Go on, smoke."
It's okay
Give me some passwords you know.
I'll give it a try
Shakespeare?
Madhya Pradesh...?
Have you met the managing director?
"Yes, but he wants me To sign up... on an 8-year bond."
Then sign up
"You're staying here, aren't you?"
Why eight?
Sign up for 10 years

The visitors calling CWB.
We have 2 and a half minutes.
Send us some rope quickly.
The time travel is complete.
There is no need for any ropes.
Perhaps with a slight adjustment...
The signal is not clear.
"Give me the parameters, please."
CWB's question:
What kind of rope?
And what kind of adjustment?
It seems there was a mistake in the calculations.
Because we are at the top of a rocky hill right now.
60 meters above the country road between Bournak and Kamenice.
Poochie!
Third check.
No errors found.
"By CWB's estimate, the error must have occurred during mission execution."
The mission is dangerous.
You don't say.
Tell them that!
"What do you mean, I should tell them?"
That we cannot send another Expedition after them?
The World Council approves their return.
Based on CWB's data.
You know what?
The CWB can go and hang itself by the neck.
Explain!
The return would be risky.
It could deplete all the energy reserved for emergencies.

A song?

He might need a police-band.

Shut it down.
What happened?
There must have been a surge in the power grid.
"I'll need a few minutes, Captain."
Archer to Enterprise.
Medical emergency.
[Grave instrumental music]
There was nothing I could do.
I'm sorry.
ARCHER:
How's Hoshi coming with that translation?
Their iconography is different from the other Xindi species.
It's taking some time.
"When she's done, ask her to search their database."
See if she can locate anything about their burial rituals.
Do you plan to hold a funeral?
TRIP: [On radio] Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER:
Go ahead.
TRIP:
I think I figured out the problem.
Their power grid can't handle our converters.
It's going to take at least three days to make them compatible.
What about the reactor?
Any way to bring it online?
"It's possible, but they lost most of their antimatter in the accident."
ARCHER:
Stand by.
Work with Trip.
Help him get their reactor up and running.
Sir?
We're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship.

Welcome Signora Isabella
You are my guest here
Don't worry.
Nobody can do harm to you
You are under my protection.
You'll be treated in the best way here
Yakup Efendi what do you think?
Is there any poison that would kill slowly and with pain?
"My Sultana, it is difficult"
"Well, if you're implying that mr."
Stark would ever...
I'm implying you.
Mr. Stark's on the run.
He is also...
An innocent man.
I can see why he hired you.
"You're smart, cool-headed, extremely loyal,"
"Which is surprising,"
Considering you were charged with treason.
There you go.
Stay on him.
"Oh, yeah."
It's right here.
There's not much in there.
But seeing as whatever you did's
"Been swept under a rug, I'm guessing"
"It's a big green one made of stark money, hmm?"
So you dodged the treason conviction.
But you couldn't get out of the dishonorable discharge.
"Well, I guess money can't buy everything."
This looks bad...
"Bad to every good man who ever served,"
"Bad to your friends, neighbors..."
And to the fine folks at the office of immigration.
"Yeah, I'm putting that on the table."
That'll be a fun conversation to have with the wife.
Yeah?
"""honey, pack a bag."
"""spot of bother."
"We're being deported."""
you know what?
My ex-husband would never agree to any of that.
The lady doth protest too much.
I haven't mentioned your ex-husband.
You're going after my ex-husband unless I cooperate?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Hold on.
I haven't made any threats.
I'm the one who needs help here.
"Okay, what exactly do you want?"
What have you got?
Who were the Atlantor players?
What was the chain of command?
Who is this Miles Drentell?
- Who interfaced with the community?
- Other people were bribed?
Did any witnesses lose interest?
How good are your records?
- Very good.
- Like you never throw anything away.
"Well, I have been called a pack rat on occasion."
By your ex-husband?
No.
That's the pot calling the kettle black.
You still like him.
Excuse me?
Did I say that?
I'm sorry...
Can I see these records?
You'll see everything that I find appropriate for you to see.
Wait.
"Remember, if I take the big guys down, this project goes down with them."
I understand.
The president was the leader of the sweep mission?
Does this make sense!
?
These are records of Mr. President's political slush funds.
Very detailed.
With these named councilmen here.
In order to pass the Private School Reform Bill.
He even made a certain deal.
This is breaking news.
Run.
Private School Reform Bill results.
For: 228 votes.
Against: 41 votes.
Abstention: 5 votes.
I pronounce that Private School Reform Bill is passed.
It passed.
Finally it's passed!
Are you that happy?
"Of course, I'm happy."
"Agent Kim, you also relied on yourself to study, right?"
Yes...
This is something that should have happened sooner.
Come on in.
Mr. President...
Something big happened.
President Choi Eung Chan's Use of Illegal Campaign Funds Revealed.
President Choi Eung Chan...
"While he was trying to pass the Private School Reform Bill,"
"He caused damaged to the separation of legal, administrative, and judicial powers."
And not only did he shake the foundation of democratic society.
The Sweep Mission in the past as well.
He concealed it and deceived the citizens.
"A heavy price, as is often that of the honourable choice."
"Let the gods show us the way, then."
"If Gannicus proves himself against Crixus, he shall remain."
"Yet if he falls, he shall leave this house, following the others that have failed to honour it."

I am to be sold to fucking Tullius?
Only if you fall.
Clear mind.
Prove yourself the man I know you to be.
Doctore.
Let us begin.
And know who truly stands champion of this house.
Crixus.
Gannicus.
Take position.
A second chance to prove myself against you.
- The gods have heard my prayers.
- And they curse you in the answering.
Begin.
"Father, we're near ready to leave."
Pause a moment and see contest ended.
Finish preparations.
Crixus again shows form.
As does Gannicus.
Both men you have often praised.
Perhaps you have learned something after all these years.
Perhaps.
You have lost sense.
All attention is upon the match.
No one will notice your absence for many hours.
They will brand me fugitivus!
They will not find you.
"Oh, Alice"
"Oh, Alice"
Oh!
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
No time for tears today No time for tears today
No time for tears today No time for tears today
"So many doors, how did you choose?"
"So much to gain, so much to lose"
So many things got in your way
"No time today, no time today"
Be careful not to lose your head
Remember what the dormouse said
Alice!
Did someone pull you by the hand?
How many miles to Wonderland?
Please tell us so we'll understand
"Alice, Alice, oh, Alice"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"
"Oh, how will you find your way?"

I won't be long. then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?

No.

I called you last week.
Do you know what that is?
Stay away.

You can help me.

Now I see with my own eyes
You haven't seen anything yet
Don't be that sad
"Look, everyone treats us good"
He told me that I have seen nothing yet
Who?
That barbarian called Süleyman
He thinks I get above myself.
Who do you think he is ?
Sultan doesn't look as a terrible barbarian.
I was surprised
True
At least fire doesn't blow out of his eyes
But his tongue is poisoned
"Your Majesty, Hürrem Sultana is here"
Let her in

I can't close my eyes without seeing you
I'll visit Hatice tomorrow
I'll give her a gift
I'll give her the lucky amulet you gave m
That'd be good
Visit her more frequently.

- Come on.

You jeopardized my life's work.
My accountants' are desperate.
You've proved yourself incompetent yet again.
I don't even know if I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?
I trusted you enough
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.
Don't tell me you don't trust me.
We have to trust each other.
Right.
I trust everybody.
Yes...
"Well, fortunately,"
I thought of something very spectacular
Which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money.
"Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money."
"But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,"
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.
How did she know we were at the museum?
I...
I'm not certain.
Tony.
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?
"Look, I know you're upset about what happened... but I think you're taking this personally."
How long before the reactor is brought online?
"Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about 12 hours."
You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental state.
"If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the Brig."
You're asking me to betray him.
You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect your decision.
We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.

But it's by no means airtight.

"Well,yeah,you're inting right at it."
"The brain revealed an epidurm hematoma, verified by this cat scan."
Though it's far from massive.

"For whatever reason, you could have poisoned your patron."
And then deceived us by injecting it into yourself.

"Interesting, that paper of yours on the Norvins St. case."

And say so ...
Couldn't you push a little further?
"They have no adventures, these people?"
Adventures?
"Yes, you could write a scandalous article about the Baroness de Vibray and Dollon."
"After all, this is the only crime for 48 hours."
We must fill up the column.
And maybe you could drag some Fantomas in all this.
And then I superimposed it...
With a page I photographed in a diary.
Of your diary?
But why did you...
Photograph the picture and didn't take the film negative?
In order to have a photograph...
That's even more photographic than the photograph itself.
"Further away from reality, than it already is."
To really show it's a photograph.
"And not reality, and even less than reality..."
And a lot further than reality.
"You don't like that one, do you?"
I find it strange.

This is Paris.

It's colored with yellow here.
"Yes, it's my watch."

But why taking a picture like this?
It's a still life.

Lift it straight up and...
Bring it down
What's going on here?
Shinbo's practicing vengeance
For the play?
"No, the genuine article"
Swing it down hard And shout
Oto san What would you do in his place?
I'd learn how to take a punch without getting hurt
How's that?
Let 'em hit you where it doesn't hurt and call it quits
Who taught you that pathetic trick?
"My dad, before he died"
What a legacy!
Your mom's a real terror...
"Yup, it's come in real handy."
"Thanks, Dad"
Don't force it
"Give it here Hold this, straight, straight"
When you're ready to strike...
That's it
"Shinbo, come on, hit me like you mean it"
"Hey, that's dangerous"
"Come and get me, crybaby"
"You want to win, right?"
We will have the time that it takes him
To reach the curb to intercept him.
Steal from the gural nataz?
Are you crazy?
Probably.
But letting a priceless relic
Fall into their hands is not something
I'm willing to let happen.
I'm betting you feel the same.
"No way, it's too risky."
As risky as stealing back
The pendant of tuthankhamen
From their stronghold in izmir?
Or of causing the arrest of
An entire gural nataz cell in malta?
The details of how we recovered
That pendant were never made public.
Be that as it may...
"Professor, his train's on time."
In 30 seconds we'll lose a chance to strike
A blow to the very heart of the gural nataz.
"If this is a setup,"
You won't even have to worry about
The gural nataz...
I'll take care of you myself.
Now what are we supposed to do
With this guy once we grab him?
(andreas:)the courier has the map
Inside the briefcase.
Sydney.
Come on.
Excuse me.
I will beat you
- Look there
- My goodness
What are you looking through lens at the opposite house?
Do you know how good she plays the limp game?
"Poor girl, she is one legged and can limp only"
-One legged?
-Yeah
- Whom are you referring?
With two eyes I saw her playing with two legs!
- I too saw
- What happened to your family?
Your brothers rage if I talk about your dad
- You call a normal girl one legged
- One leg only
They have started Let us go and see
Whatever we see doesn't belong to our eyes!
Doesn't belong to our eyes!
Since you have become a pupil of my eyes...
You can't be separated from the eyes...
And you can't be separated from me
Oh God!
"Neelaveni, why did you stop?"
Dance until the pestle break
Dance until the mortar rolls Dance until the house get crumbled
Shut up your mouth
-It's really one leg
-I'll tell if it is one leg or two legs
What for?
...
Catch her
Catch
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
You got anything for us yet?
Over:
"[Man] Admiral, Captain Rogers requesting communication:"
"Thank you, Parsons:"
Put Captain Rogers on the vid-screen:
[Asimov] Dr:
Goodfellow has just completed his review of that ancient star chart:
"Ah, yes, dear boy:"
I'll tell you something:
I got into the chart here:
The planet you're now surveying was once inhabited: : :
By a highly advanced race known as the Goral:
The Goral were indigenous to that planet:
"That is, until they left their world in a strange mass exodus:"
"Oh, it must've been 10,000 years ago:"
- Does that planet have a name?
- A name?
"I should say it has, Buck:"
It's called Vor-Deeth:
D-double E-T-H:
Vor-Deeth?
That's right:
Crichton was good enough to translate it for me:
"Apparently, it means ""Planet of Death:"""
"Oh, terrific:"
You got any other cheery information for us?
Buck:
"Hold on, Doctor:"
We got some visual contact:
Looks like some kind of ruins:
"Ruins, did you say?"
Geometry.
Classic lines.
Nothing is more important to me than the preservation of these images.
Power.
Order.
Solemnity.
You know what I like most?
Your decision to break the formation here and here.
"Not only does it serve the composition, but it gives the impression of the Cross."
Hmmm.
The Messiah theme.
Here it is.
Do you think I should have walked down the aisle alone?
That's an interesting question.
My instinct was that a loner would be viewed
- as less trustworthy.
- Goebbels:
Hmmm.
Hitler:
Better to be surrounded by faithful lieutenants.
Goebbels:
Yes...
I think so.
"Those men, Goebbels, what are they thinking?"
A person wants to be a part of something beyond his... small self.
To escape.
To be lost in a historic moment.
I wonder if their feet hurt.
You organized the people on a whole new basis.
"By invoking Aryan superiority, you enabled us to transcend regional and religious rivalries, even trivial issues of gender, age, class distinctions."
"I created a great circulation of energy, self-replicating, self-reaffirming."
My God!
The theme is something your generation doesn't believe in
Marriage
I'll marry you

# Though we're not still a lad and a girl

# Chose a lover who stuck with his wife

I don't see how that's possible:
"Except for Reardon, there was no sign of life on Vor-Deeth:"
"Possible or not, it's happening:"
We're being held prisoner: : :
By something:
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
Do you read me?
Over:
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
Do you read me?
Over:
"Captain Rogers, Admiral:"
I knew Buck would be okay:
"Buck, where are you?"
"We're on our way back, Admiral:"
We...
We had a little detour:
You mustn't return to the ship:
We've been caught in a snare beam emanating from somewhere on the surface of Vor-Deeth:
"We're helpless, Buck:"
"If you come back, you'll be trapped with us:"
More trouble from Vor-Deeth:
Yeah:
Five will get you 10 that whatever fabricated that fake Searcher: : :
Is also behind that snare beam:
"Admiral, we're going down to Vor-Deeth, try to find the source of that beam:"
Good idea:
Good luck:
Searcher out:
"According to the coordinates of the tractor beam, it should be somewhere around here:"
Buck:
What?
"But naturally, they love you too"
Let's all go for a Sunday picnic

We are back with our  2nd regular album after a year
You know that we don't have any ballad songs
There is one ballad song  in this album
We have an amazing  song
For that song...
She wrote the lyrics  of that song
We have that song.
Which one is it?
Correct answer
Different.
I think he grew up fast.
"Forcedly.... - He is more mature, but he is a good person."
He tries to look harsh but in order not to be hurt... it's obvious he is the only one who is not aware...
"Yaman is a tender kid, he is merciful, he is a real man.."
"Mira, what happened , Mira, what is wrong my girl?"
"We lost hopes with you- I am not late, take it, there are exactly 1000 TL here, count it!"
Is it OK?
"Kenan's issue will be solved, right?"
Hopefully!
"Brother , what time is it?"
- Half past two.
"Brother, can I use your phone shortly."
I have to make an urgent call.
I will pay for it.
But don't let it be so long!
"- OK, give it."
"Hello?&amp;gt; Hello Mert, it's me ,Yaman."
"Hello Yaman, where are you man?"
Half an hour is left for the exam.
"I am dying from worry.-I am on my way, I am coming, I will catch it, don't worry!"
"OK, were you by Mira's side too?"
What happened to Mira?
- Okay... okay... see you!
Mert i'm saying what happened to Mira?
Yaman! &amp;gt; Where's Mira?
Inside.
Her parents are with her.
"What happened, what does she have?- I don't know, they said they would take her for operation but..."
"Why are you here mom, what's happening?"
"Sude, calm down.- Oh my God!"
Again everything comes from you.

Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"I want to reach the greatest mountain, climb, if I want, without all the shouting."

"This is about as good as it can get for ThorZaiN, doing some drop ship micro actually."
Taking..
Oh My God!
-	Ohhhhhh....
I think we should just have a moment of silence and hold hands at what we just saw here.
What is going on!?
"- Alright, we have Medivacs loading."
- Oh my God.
"Watch this, he is going to drop all over the mech army, this is going to be so sick cool!"
"Oh, I am so excited."
SlayerS BoxeR!
You are the funniest player ever!
- He is moving out.
"He unsieges, he may siege up again, but when he sees that many Vikings, he is going to have to land the Vikings!"
- He is..
Here comes the Medivacs!
- Oh my God!
"- Dropping all over those Siege Tanks, just crushing trough!"
"SlayerS BoxeR has out strategized GanZi, completely!"
-	Marines really want to catch the Corruptors.
"If I'm to know my boundaries again, I need to have a last time."
I'm not a fool.
I'll go back behind my boundaries after that.
"Young Master, why are you following me?"
I'm not following you.
I'm just walking.
But Yongmun is all the way over there!
I don't want to go there right now.
Have you run away?
Or are you in trouble with Madam Noh?
"Well, you're higher up than her, so I guess you won't get in trouble."
Did you have an argument with her?
Madam Noh cannot argue with me.
"You know, I was always curious, but how come you're higher than Madam Noh?"
You're younger and don't do much.
Why do you order her around like that?
What is the relationship between you and Madam Noh?
Madam Noh is like a mother to me.
"Who are you anyway, Young Master?"
I've known you for over a year.
But I don't know what you do.
I don't even know your name.
"Like you said, I've run away."
But I have nowhere to go.
"I don't do much, so I won't be missed."
Why don't you teach me how I should spend the day?
"If so, I'll tell you my name."
"First, my surname is Yi."
Young Master Yi?
I'm hungry.
Shall we go eat something?
"Great idea, Young Master Yi!"
I'm going to run away...
"Are you crazy, Mahir?How will you escape from prison? no"
I'm running away from the hospital!
"Enough talking,Gentlemen!"
"Come on,Get back!"
Come on!
Take it easy.
Feride?Are you crying?
"This is due to Mahir, right?Now you cheer upAfter you've seen it, I know it..."
How can such a big lovefinished in a minute?Is this possible?
"Feride...listen to me,I know you're very angryat Mahir, but trust mewhen I tell youthat Mahir loves you!"
"Everything is explained,he did everythingto save his father..."
He did not intendhurt you... . trust methat he is a very good man.
"Maybe it's becausewe want to bevery good man, Bahar!"
Maybe he deceived usin fact we believe that he is good?How can we be sure?
Maybe he hidits darkness in the same mannerthat he hidhis real name?
He was shot in the street...no one knows who did it... he deals with the gangsters...
And above all he is accused of so manyillegal stuff!
"But, he said,it's all justto rescue his father!"
Feride
"You should have listened to him,certainly there is an explanationfor all."
I do not want to hearhis voice or seehis face ever...
Okay.
"As you wish,All right."
I'm going to bringsome water ..
"Ayten,It ""s me , Neždet!"
Are you okay?
"Ayten, you're very worried about me,are you okay?Why do not you answer?"
Get out!
Ayten
"Go I'm sick,go..."
I'll sleep hereif you do not open.
Don't tell the kids.
"Nick, who I found yesterday,  kissing a woman passionately in the street..."
He later claimed that woman was his wife!
[laughter]
Here's to the future.
Drugs... sex... divorce...
Death!
Who'd want to live anywhere else?
Here's to us.
[clink]
Try me again and I promise you  it'll be more fun this time.
"- Hey, everybody!"
Welcome to the Atheist Experience.
We're live.
"It is July 15th, 2012."
"Two days after Friday 13th, and one day after Saturday the 14th, and three days after Thursday the 13th, and they're all equally important."
I'm Matt Dillahunty.
Joining me this week is Don Baker.
Welcome.
- Good to be here.
-We're in a good mood.
"This is a live call in television program out of Austin, Texas."
We'll have the number up for you shortly.
"The announcement stuff has kind of been sidelined, and we're going to go ahead and let Don get started on his talk."
"How are you, by the way?"
- I'm doing good.
"I went to a holy place, believe it or not."
"- Holy to you, or holy to somebody else?"
It's as close as atheists have to a holy place.
I went to a great science museum.
"I went to the American Museum of Natural Science in New York City, where the Hayden Planetarium is."
"I didn't see Neil deGrasse Tyson there, but took in a great planetarium show."
"Choi Chul Joo tried to harm me, but there was always you, and grandfather, and... ..."
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
What?
There's this tall man who wears this black hat.
"When you struck Choi Chul Joo, didn't you meet him?"
The man who helped the women's parents stop the boat from leaving!
- That man rescued me!
- Did you meet him?
So you do know him!
Don't you know who he is?
"He said he couldn't reveal his identity, so I didn't see his face."
Did you see it?
Do you know who he is?
He hid his identity from me.
It is not up to me to reveal it.
But I still want to see his face.
"I'm really good-looking, aren't I?"
You shouldn't look at me too often.
You'll only spoil yourself for other men.
I wasn't looking at you.
So you know how to be shy too?
What was that?
Why do you carry such a dirty thing with you?
It's a pouch.
That thing?
It's embroidered too!
Where is that thieves' mountain retreat?
"Young Miss always blindfolds me when we go, so I don't know."
"But if he's the one that took her, she should be safe."
"She was taken by force, I'm worried."
"If she went voluntarily, then I'm more worried!"
Is there no way to find her without causing too much commotion?
You go ahead.
I'll bring your baggage.
"It's okay, abi."
I got it.
"- Give me one of them, if you want."
"- It's okay, you go ahead."
The fridge is full of food.
And I had the house cleaned yesterday.
Have a nice time in there.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No one can bother you here.
Good bye.
"Call me, if you need anything."
And I bring it to you.
- Bye bye.
- All right.
So... ... guess this'll be our home for a while.
Just ours.
[Music]
I miss her smile.
She had an amazing smile.
"One time, I remember she had just gotten her braces off, and she thought she was for sure that she was going to go work for a toothpaste company, and be one of those people that had their smile on the toothpaste box."
[Music]
The morning of November the 10th was just a regular day.
Alex didn't have to be at school till 9:30 because of her college classes that she was taking in high school.
"So, Katrina and I went on to school."
"When I left, I just called her name and said, ""I'm leaving!"""
"And she went, ""Wait a minute!"""
"And she came running out of her room, and she came up there, and gave me a hug, and pushed her hair back"
"like she did every day, and I kissed her on the forehead, and said ""Be good today."""
And I left.
Just run away.
Just run.
Don't ask why you're going to get the eight pages; just go get them.
Don't play it at night.
You will... you'll die.
Don't play it alone at all.
Or in the dark... you two.
"(Finebros) And finally, will you ever play ""Slender"" again?"
- Probably not.
- Never.
"- God, no!"
- No!
Maybe to see if it has the same effect.
"Maybe if I'm, like with my friends in broad daylight, yeah."
Yes.
I am going to go play it.
Yes.
"Yes, I will."
"I know, for some reason, I'm gonna end up playing it again."
"Curiosity is gonna get the best of me, and I'ma play it again."
"Thanks for watching ""Teens React."""
"If you liked the video, make sure you give it a thumbs-up or the Slender Man might get ya."
"Make sure you subscribe, or I'll send Slender Man after you and your children."
"If you're scared of Slender, just listen to this joke, okay?"
What do you call a shoe made from a banana?
A slipper.
Ha!
"I'll see you next time, unless Slender Man gets me."
"(feigning scream, chuckles)"
Ajahn Brahm:
"Okay, I did notice there's a few people with sore throats who've got coughing, so to make it nice and peaceful during the talk can we all cough in unison at the beginning"
[laughter] and have it all done away.
Nothing to detect these units.
-	Ghosts cloaking.
"They are going to try and EMP all of the Sentries, if he does, he can go in for an attack."
EMP on the entire army!
His entire army is EMP'd!
He Stims and goes in to finish them off.
If he destroys this army he will win the game and advance to the round of 16!
So many Marauders!
The Vikings taking out every single Colossus and BoxeR is on the verge of winning the game and the series.
"Here he goes in, stimming one more time, the Medivacs healing everything."
"Avenge on the run, falling back into his expansion, we might see a GG any moment now."
-	Ohh..
And a Nuke!
"-	Nuclear Missile, dropping onto Avenge's natural expansion where his army is right now."
The Nuke's gonna land on his army!
"-	Ohh, is he going to get his units away?"
-	Ooooohhhhh!!
-	Nuclear Missile killing everything.
"-	BoxeR, 100 supply ahead."
-	Winning the third game!
"- With those Vikings you shoot forward, trying to get rid of those Colossi."
Not overcommitting his ground units quite yet.
And uh..
Actually lost quite a few Vikings in all that.
Choya is giving him chase and going to chase him right into the main base.
"There is the defensive nuke, if he can hold this wall right here, he's got it."
The nuke could go down right in the middle of all these units.
- Oh no!
Oh no!
And it looks like..
"Oh no, Choya!"
- Ohhhhhhh!!!
"You're in love with him too, Doe Eyes!"
Just drink.
Please forgive me for not accompanying you today.
I ran away.
So you shouldn't have come with me anyway.
Can you guess where the tea leaves are?
Here.
I was watching the whole time.
- It's no fun playing with you.
- Let me do it again.
"I've become a bit strange, haven't I?"
But I feel really at ease.
"You're drinking too much, aren't you?"
You should only be drinking from crystal clear streams.
It's because I'm so happy to see you!
"Now that we've spent some time, we should take our leave."
Just stay a while longer.
It feels like olden days when I'm with you.
It feels like Gil Dong is with us like olden days!
"When I'm with you, I'm so happy because"
I can talk about Gil Dong with you.
"I thought you'd forgotten about him, but it seems you haven't."
I shouldn't think of Gil Dong.
I forgot again.
Stupid!
"Even though Gil Dong is dead, we should still remember him from time to time."
But I shouldn't think about him at all.
Because... then I can't go on.
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.
I couldn't stop crying.
I saw Gil Dong everywhere like it was a dream. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I kept calling him to go with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But he would just vanish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
What is this you are blowing out?
"Lado, have I turned epileptic?"
Why am I fizzing from the mouth?
Could it be that you made me take a bath with egg &amp;amp; gave me shampoo to eat?
"It is possible, I was in a hurry."
- What! !
"Not only my gun, even my brain hits right on target."
No one can cheat me.
"Because I, Zibago, if load people with money for loyalty. . ."
I even kill people for betrayal.
I've heard I will have to play with death again?
The fun lies only in this game.
You have to strike a deal of diamonds worth 100 million. . . in the swimming pool of Hotel Blue Diamond.
It will be done.
"But be careful, because this time, the police has information. . . that the diamonds have reached India."
"Mr. Zibago, I very well know how the police department functions."
You had to come at 1 1.
- Ask your daughter.
"She woke me up at 12, then how can I come at 1 1?"
Who asked you to run away with my daughter?
Where did I run?
I took her slowly by rickshaw.
I had to pay a fare of Rs.
7 0.
You still haven't paid me that money.
Why should I pay you?
Did you ask me and elope her?
Does any lover of the world . . . ask the girl's father when he is eloping his daughter?
It has become a routine with you.
You eat breakfast and come late to work.
Breakfast?
"Since I have married your daughter, I am eating grams."
"Perhaps, is it because I came in?"
Are you leaving because of me?
"Anyways, it has nothing to do with you."
Don't relate everything to yourself.
What do you mean you're leaving this house?
"Until now, under your supervision..."
I have lived comfortably.
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.
"Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job..."
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.
What kind of person am I?
What can I do?
Okay.
That's not a bad idea.
"Aigoo, but still..."
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.
"Hey, Seung Jo."
It has nothing to do with her.
It's my life.
Okay.
"Go try it out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; What should I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo is going to move out of this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I came back into this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; But this time, Seung Jo... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; is going to leave. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
Where is Baek Seung Jo?
"If I don't try,"
We couldn't even meet like this.
"It's Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; In what area are you living right now?"
"Hey, Baek Seung Jo."
"Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up."
Tell her like a man.
Seung Jo!
All of a sudden...
It must be lonely living by yourself.
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.
"Over here, continue there, continue there."
"So how many one, two, three, four, five."
Nine.
That's what it looks like.
So obvious. . No.
Okay.
"Now notice, what a pain this is."
Just so I can give you more headaches.
"By the way, you only have to build it once."
"We're going to have the code right here, right now."
So it's only you have to build it.
"It's just, we'll have the code right here, right now."
I ask you guys to put ones with an occasional zero down.
And then going to put zeros with an occasional ones down.
And then you're going to put some ones on the corners.
Okay.
"So, kinda problematic, cuz these guys and these guys are painful I got to figure out how to do that vector."
Okay.
"So, we'll do that."
But for right now let's do some easy things.
"Let's put down these ones, these ones, these ones, and these ones."
Notice where they go.
"This starts at n plus 1N,"
Right?
And this is a little N by N block.
"Or, in my notes, I think, that means it's a M by M block."
"It's N by N, these are M by Ns, M by Ms,"
Okay? you know what?
"If you say you said M I'd say no, you didn't hear me right."
You wouldn't know for sure if I said m or n.
They're so close.
I could lie.
What's going on?
Who did this to you?
"Forget it, just take me to the hospital, I'm not good"
Who did this to you?Say it.Only then I'll take you.
"Serdar, I'm good."
"Take him to the clinicand stitch the wound, thenget him back."
Take me to the hospital!
You will not get away with this.
"You thought to go outand fly, birdie... it's a good plan, but menobody can cheat."
Get him out!
"Mr. Serdar,If you had any humanity in you,let me..."
My son is dying.
What the hell do I care?
He's not my son!
"Perhaps you also will one daybe so helpless,Serdar, and I hope you will findsomeone to help you!"
"See our daughter,does not look good."
"Girl is not good,Take her to her roomand let it rest."
Change clothes you shall goand take a nap...
"'I waited for you,But you did not come."
Pleasant.Your fiancee. '
Bride!
Hello!- Turgut!
"I am Listening sir,tell me."
"Mahir Karaescaped death, he's alive! he canpostpone his fate, but there are thingsthat will happen immediately."
"Listen, afterthis change of events don t you daregive me empty promises!"
Hello!Is this the police station? yes please
I need to report a crime.
"In the store of Bulent Tiryaki,in the mall, I sawhidden boxes with bullets in them was writtenin Bulgarian..."
They were very concernedand I think it will move quickly.
With whom am I speaking?
I am an anonymous citizen.
I received the application.
He will go in and Kuzey Tekinoğlu will go out.
That was the deal.
"Yes, he's the one who offered to go to prison instead of an innocent person."
You're still so sure about Kuzey's innocence.
You're both the prosecutor and the judge of your father's case.
That man isn't my father.
He's a killer.
"Whoever pulled the trigger Kuzey or his men, doesn't matter."
They are not more guilty than Ferhat.
"So yes, an innocent person killed Ferhat."
Mirza knew he would die soon.
And when I told him Kuzey's story he wanted to help him.
But now... ... it hurts to know that he's spending his last days like that.
Wish I could see him at least for the last time.
"Okay, I'll try to do something."
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
I went and checked on the Makara stalls a few times.
"- Everything's going smoothly, don't worry."
"- Okay, good."
Soon you'll be out of here anyway and get back to business.
We'll see.
It's too early to talk about that.
I'll handle the business until you're out.
Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.
- There's not much until 4th of the month.
The visitation is over.
"Warden, could you please give us 5 more minutes."
It was already over 5 minutes ago.
"Okay then, talk to you later."
God be with you.
I can let Emily answer that.
"""Last night, on Allhallows' Eve... ...Father Moore tried to cast six demons from my body."
They refused to go.
"After the attempted exorcism..."""
"*I was taken to my room,* *and I fell into a deep sleep. *"
"*I awoke a few hours later,* *hearing a voice calling out my name. *"
"*""Again, I heard a voice* *calling my name. *"
It was the Blessed Holy Mother of God.
And when I looked at her... ...she smiled at me and said:
"'Emily, heaven is not blind to your pain.""'"
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her in the middle of a field?
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?
I believe Emily spoke the truth.
Please continue.
"*""I asked the Blessed Mother,* *'Why do I suffer like this?""'*"
Why did the demons not leave me tonight?
"*""She said, 'I am sorry, Emily. *"
*The demons are going to stay* *where they are.'*
"*Then she said,* *'You can come with me in peace... *"
*... free of your bodily form... *
*... or you can choose* *to continue this. *
*You will suffer greatly. *
"*But through you, many will come to* *see that the realm of the spirit is real. *"
"*The choice is yours.""'*"
I choose to stay.
"""In the end, good will triumph over evil."
Through my experience... ...people will know that demons are real.
People say that God is dead.
"But how can they think that... ...if I show them the devil?"""
Did you see these wounds on both of Emily's hands and both feet?
Yes.
You will surely meet me.
Hello!
Hello!
"Law can reach far and wide, shekhar."
"By closing your eyes, don""t think everybody is blind."
"Law won""t spare you."
When did I beg for mercy from law? sP.. if you have any evidence then you can arrest me.
I have not come to arrest you.
I have come here as a friend.
Your wife is missing for the past 4 days.
"Maybe you don""t even know.. whether she is dead or alive."
"This is my personal matter, Rajesh!"
You have no right to interfere! - shut up!
You could stoop to this level.. I could have never imagined!
"You are my friend, Rajesh. l can""t raise my hands on you."
"Don""t put a stigma on friendship, shekhar!"
I am ashamed to call you my friend!
"The man who can betray his country.. ..how can he be anybody""s friend?"
There is a patriot who helps law in every step.
And you.. you have betrayed your country in every step! shame on such a friendship!
"I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you, Rajesh."
I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you!
Where are my goods?
Where are my goods?
- We want our goods!
You have got the gold!
We want the goods!
From where will we give it to you?
"- I don""t know anything! shut up!"
The police have blasted our den.
The gold perished in the fire!
Now how can we give you the goods? kaka sir..
"It pissed me off when she did that, and she does it on purpose"
"She knows it, she's always copying me, it pisses me off!"
"Same thing, later she enters my office, she opens my drawer, she takes my pen"
"No ""thank you"", no ""excuse me"", nothing!"
"Jean, are you listening to me?"
Of course I'm listening
"No, you're not looking at me!"
Well I'm sorry but I listen with my ears.
It seems strange but...
Very funny...
"By the way, I should probably clean them, cause it seems like I'm only hearing stupidities"
Strange huh?
I won't tell you anything anymore!
"Oh no Alex, I love your stories so much..."
Really?
So...
"The day after, the day after..."
"Oh, Loulou, I gotta pee"
"Oh, no, Alex, it's only been half an hour since we left"
"Oh, I need to pee, I must pee, I have to pee"
Have you ever thought about wearing a diaper before travelling?
"But, Loulou, I was careful this morning"
"I didnt' have any coffee, orange juice or water, nothing, so that I wouldn't need to pee"
Well what are you peeing then?
"Oh, Loulou, can't you stop at a gas station with restrooms?"
"No no no, I'm doing what I can, at the edge of the road, it will be fine"
"No, Loulou, I want real restrooms!"
What next?
"No, here it's fine, come on"
"No, baby, I'm gonna catch a disease"
"It'll be fine here, Alex"
Disease?
"Did something happen, Hasan?"
"Abla, you are here every day!"
This house's troubles will never end!
"Mom says somethings, too."
Stay home for a little bit!!!
"Did you stay here, Aslan?"
Duriye...
"I told myself not to mess with you, but... ... this is my house!"
My name is Aslan Bulut!
Don't drive me crazy!
Don't push it!!!
"My God, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but enough!!!"
I will stay in my house whenever I want!!!
"Am I supposed to ask your permission, woman????"
"I have tried to make you happy... ..to show you your worth... ..but, enough is enough!"
"And, I don't want to hear such ever again, from anyone!!!"
Where is my tea???
"Off, what a difficult situation!!!"
"Eh, they are going to be sorry even more, Ibo..."
It's not that easy...
"Don't say that, Seher... it is a pity for everyone."
Wasn't it a pity when they were doing it???
Let's hope we are not guilty of anything...
"See, how they have been torn to pieces.."
I don't think they will be problem free until Narin forgives them..
I doubt Narin will forgive them..
"Inci, I have been calling Narin, but she is not answering her phone."
"Harun went to Ankara... she shouldn't stay there by alone by herself, She should come here, Inci Abla."
"Okay.. relax.. perhaps she is in the garden, has some work to do.. She will come when she finishes her work."
- I hope that's the case.
- I am going mom...
"- Ok, sweetheart."
"Every summer we were excited of going there not because of the holidays ,but because we would eat there."
We would go there without fail.
The same for this place.
"It's like that, they have many clients, everyone comes."
Thanks &amp;gt; enjoy it.
Yoghurt? &amp;gt; I will have one more!
Brother if you could bring us two other yoghurts please!
"Ok, ok."
I will take care of Mr. Ismet's issue now.
I have his car.
"I'll eat something, then I will go, it's a long way."
"Ok, if there isn't any lameness we will hand it in at the evening."
"Okay, bye..."
"Wooow, what's up man?"
I recognized you only from your face.
"What can there be, what about you? &amp;gt; Fine."
Hello..&amp;gt; Hello.
I was talking about you here in above.
"I accused you wrongly, by God..."
I said:
"""Yaman forgot all this way"""
I can't forget it even if I wanted.
"How are you, do you have any trouble?&amp;gt; No, thanks. what are you doing?- As you know, the same."
I still work in the phone installment .
Do you have any news from Kenan?
"I didn't see him yet, he is fine."
I am waiting for the visit permission.
Say hello to him when you see him.
I will go to him on the first opportunity I have.
I'll tell him.
"Hey... who's she?- I just came to the reeve, there is nothing more."
Did you get your registration?- For some papers issues.
They cancel out.
Then you have bi times minus bi.
So that's minus b squared i squared.
These cancel out.
So you're left with a minus bi over a squared minus b squared i squared.
We know what i squared is. i squared is equal to negative 1.
You square both sides of that and you get i squared is equal to negative 1.
"So if we multiply, this becomes a negative 1."
"Every zero - this one, this one, this one and this one - that's sandwiched between them is significant."
Are these guys significant?
It's to the right.
Is there a decimal point?
There is.
1-2.
Every single one of them is significant - 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.
10 total.
Wow!
Let's look at this long guy.
OK?
"Again, break it down."
"The 5, the 9 and the 6 we know are significant."
Which means that any zeros sandwiched between them are also significant.
The zeros coming to the left of significant numbers are never significant.
We don't have to worry about them.
There are zeros coming to the right.
Is there a decimal point in the number?
There is.
So the zeros to the right are significant because of the decimal point.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 - total significant figures here.
"8 - 9 significant, sandwiched zeros also, 1-2-3 to the right."
They are significant because there's a decimal point at the end.
6 total here.
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
"They say each paragraph of the preface, and there's 2 of them, has fewer than 150 words."
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
So we could do the same logic.
So that means that the total is going to be less than what?
The total is going to be less than the original number of words plus the preface.
"So it's going to be less than 2,600 plus 300."
"It's going to be less than 2,900."
"Then if you divide both sides by 25 to get the average, 25 goes into 2,900 really four more times."
That's rightŁż
The average is going to be less than-- let me make sure
I'm getting that right.
"So 4, 25 goes into 2,900."
"1, 25, 40, 1, 25."
Then we have 150.
25 goes into 150 six times.
So we have the average is less than 1/16.
So statement 2 alone is sufficient.
"Statement 2 tells us that the average of the words per paragraph is less than 116,which is definitely less than 120."
"So statement 2 alone is sufficient, and statement 1 doesn't help us much."
I'll run out of time.
See you in the next video.
What's up dudes?
Freddy Wong and Brandon Laatsch here.
"What time of year is it, Brandon?"
Springtime.
Springtime?
I guess that means it's time for
Rollercoaster Day 2011!
We had our first rollercoaster day in 2010.
And take a look at how awesome that went!
Where is everybody?
I accused the butterfly wrongly.
The charge was written on me man.
"Let it be, no problem at all."
So?-The thunderstorm in my heart will go on.
I love Eylul so much
"Good- It can't be just go with ""Good"" and step down to the edge, we must join our powers for a new rendezvous."
"Mert, don't mix me man.- You can't ruin it."
We will stick together through thick and thin
You can't leave me in halfway...
"Man, you ask for a war man!"
"But I am asking for it in a sweet way, am i not brother?"
You can't say no.
I can see the smile in your face.
"Okay, I will close it.-Wait, wait, wait... don't close it, don't close it!"
I draw into talk.
I forgot something.
"I am in the forest way, I am done with my obligations I am coming back."
"See you at home!- Don't dare to be late, come early!"
Are you alright?
Did something happen?
"No,nothing, I'm alright."
"Your knee looks bad, shall we go to a pharmacy?"
"No need, my house is near anyways"
Will you be able to walk?
Nothing is sure in this life.
Mind is more important than money.
A stupid investment can turn one's life upside down.
"Unfortunately dear Mine, unfortunately..."
How old are you?&amp;gt; Eighteen...
"Okay sweetie, thanks for calling, good night!"
Hypocrite!
- Are you ok sweetie?-She was worried to know how I am.
Kerim.
Thank you.
Thank you.You did a lot of preparation since the morning.
It was tiring.But it was worth it.
Everything was great.
Yes.
I worked hard for it.
But you see.I didn't think about setting off fireworks.
"- Kerim, don't say this.- God damn him."
- I'll make him pay for this.- Kerim please...
It's obvious why he did it.Don't do anything please.
- Listen to me at least this once.- Don't you see how he provokes me.
Should I pretend that nothing happened?
"A wrong step you take with anger, may affect the whole lawsuit badly."
Please don't do somethingthat would put our case on danger.
- This is what he exactly wants.- He is doing it out of desperation.
"Because, he is so lonely, so helpless.He is well aware that he lost everything."
He is actually taking revenge of himself.He's trying to hurt himself.
I could very well help him get hurt...
He's showing off.
Trying to impress you.
He is nobody for meeven if he pulls down the stars from the sky.
You think he could impress me by showing off with the Yaşarans' money?
He is a poor soul.You don't need to be jealous of him.
"I am not jealous, Fatmagül."
I am afraid.
Bastards as low and dirty as them...
I am afraid of what they are can do.
I'm afraid to loose you.
Don't be.
I love you so much.
Good night.
But I'm still curious.
Chang Hui that boy...
I wonder how he will look when he shows up.
I was afraid of how you were wavering when you were with her.
Attendant Noh.
I am not wavering.
I am searching for the right path.
Your Highness!
"If I don't do that now, I will lose my way forever if I am lost later in the future."
"Right now, I want to look within myself rather than move forward."
"When I look at myself through Yi Nok's eyes, I can see the things I've been hiding."
And Hong Gil Dong gave me some advice as well.
He told me to protect the people if I wanted to be king.
Realize it?
Yi Nok!
- Try this on.
- What is this?
I borrowed this from Mae Hyang.
You should wear this next time you go to Yongmun.
How can I wear something like this?
You should learn to wear skirts now.
"You should dress like noble ladies do, and act like them."
"What's wrong with you, old man?"
"I'm a medicine peddler, Heo Yi Nok!"
The Moonlight Warrior can't wear a skirt!
"And besides, does this look noble to you?"
"Well, I suppose it is a bit sexy for a noble lady to wear."
I'll go bring something more conservative.
How am I supposed to wear this?
How embarrassing!
My colored glasses...!
We crushed the glass and used it to cut our binds.
How .. ?
"Poly: "" by my outfits """
"Okay Poly, we'll get to you back later."
"We'll discuss later, if you're crossing some red lines .. all of that later"
"Thank you so much, Poly"

"Good Evening Nadeem, You're also a Little Monster"
We've never even done anything bad to anyone for this to happen to us
"Guys, we need to calm down and figure out what we're gonna do tomorrow"
Isn't it your job to think about it?
Hello?
"Yeah, it's me"
What?
You sure?
"Okay, I'm on my way to you now!"
Thanks
Dad is in jail!
What?!
Jail?
Come on!
Come on!
"Just like I told you, we heard about a fight and we saw this man, it looked like he was gonna kill the other guy"
What was the reason behind the fight?
He told us he thought the man was gonna rob him
The guy who dad hit was a thief?
"No, he wasn't"
We searched him but found nothing
"Just like you can see, he looks decent"
"Yeah he looks decent and not like a thief, what's wrong?"
I've noticed that there's something weird about your dad
His speech pattern is odd
"I think there's something wrong with him, right?"
Yeah he has Alzheimer's
"Oh yes Alzheimer's, I thought so"
"Because when we saw Mr.Sameh's number, he didn't know whose number it was"
How do you just allow him to go out alone?
"Meem, get him out of the prison bars"
"To be honest, he's been missing for a while"
He left the house and nobody knew where he was and we kept looking for him
You shouldn't have come here.
Can't we see them as they're being taken out?
- Maybe you will.
But you can't talk to them.- That'll be enough for me.
What about the girl?
She's here under control.She departed from Istanbul early.
"- So she should be already here.- Be sure, and then talk to me."
"Okay, okay, okay."
- Yes?- Where are you?
I'm here.I've arrived.
"Okay, good."
- See you at the courthouse.- Okay.
- She is here.- What about that dog?
He's on his way.He should be here shortly.
I'm going inside now.
Kadir Bey wants to talk to you.
"Fatmagül, my child.Look, this is a very difficult day for you."
"You have been waiting and preparing yourself for months, for this day."
"It was very important, and also difficultfor you to even come here."
And you managed it.
We will manage to get them punished as well.
Together we will.
You will feel very tense during the trial.
This won't be a surprise.
You will be hurt and affected negativelyby what's going to be talked about in there.
Shortly it will shake you up badly.
"You may feel prepared for anything now.But during the trial, unexpected things can happen."
"It is okay, if you don't want to come."
Trust me and believe methat I will do my best to represent you there.
Don't come to the trialif you ask me.
But the decision is yours.
"My child, it will be better for you."
There's this great building nearby that the city is just gonna demolish and turn into a parking lot.
- But if we get enough signatures... - Signatures?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
I was saying...
Maybe we could get the city to donate the building to our cause.
"We would be able to pry 250 new beds, get people off the streets and into job training so they could buy rocket packs and go to the Moon and become florists."
"You're not really interested in the homeless, are you?"
"No, I am."
But they're a symptom.
"You're treating a symptom and the disease rages on, consumes the human race."
The fish rots from the head as they say.
So my thinking is why not cut off the head.
Of the human race?
It's not a perfect metaphor but I'm talking about an overhaul of the system.
Putting the power in different hands.
I'm all for that!
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.
Thank you!
"Sorry, I come on strong."
But you signed!
I don't wanna turn my back on a fellow laundering person.
"Well, if we can't stick together, I don't..."
I'll probably see you there.
"No, I will."
I...
She talked to me.
Why did she talk to me now?
Maybe I should...
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
I-I really don't think they liked it.
How do you know that ?
- She's already on a plane back home.
- [ Groans ]
Yeah.
"You know, guys ?"
"Maybe I'm just not good with girls, period."
"No-no-no, really-really."
Like-- Like I was born without that part of the brain.
"I mean, I can't talk to girls."
"And when I do talk to them, I screw it up."
"Yeah, well, come prom those excuses aren't going to do you any good."
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Michelle ]
"And one time at band camp, we weren't supposed to have pillow fights, but we had a pillow fight, and it was so much fun."
"A-And this one time, we all lost our music and we were supposed to play this song, but we didn't know it, so we just made it up and we kept playing and playing, and the conductor didn't know what we were doing, and it was so funny."
"-So, you're pissed about somethin', huh."
-[ Scoffs ]
You know what I do when I'm angry ?
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.
- I learned to do that at band camp.
"- Hold on, uh--"
You have no idea why I'm angry ?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow ?
Sometimes I get cranky...
- when I know I have a big test to study for.
- [ Laughs ]
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
- I thought so...
- because this one time at band camp-- - W-What's your name ?
"Which hospital, what happened to you? :"
Finally I ran off the rails.
Your lawyer knows it.
"What happened, didn't he tell you?"
"No, nobody told me anything."
Why are you at the hospital?
"Anyway, leave it now Yaman."
I need money.
Tomorrow the committee will have a meeting.
"They will decide, they will decide if I am crazy or not."
I have to please someone so that he gives me a sick certificate for being crazy. what are you saying man?
"Yaman, listen to your brother."
"I can't return to jail, if I return I will really go crazy."
"Until tomorrow until midday you find 1000 TL and bring it to me, OK?"
Hello?
Yaman?
"I am not asking if you can find it,i'm saying..find it and bring it."
"Yaman, it's very important, please!"
Where are you?
Which hospital?- My lion!
This is it!
Good morning &amp;gt; Same to you.
"You are so excited, look at your state.-Don't touch me."
"Suzan, today the men will come, you check the invoice, it must be around 500 TL..."
"OK, Mr Selim, don't worry at all."
I won't pay it without having the invoice
Thanks!
"If there is something, you call me."
"While we are here, my sail has to be renovated too."
"Fall in the middle as soon as you find a chance, of course, don't wait at all."
How much do you need?- 8040 EUR
Where am I going to get so much money for you Mert?
"Kaderis enough, I learned everything I wanted to know..."
My father is not a murderer!
I gave you the permission to speak!
The final decisionabout this event will be madeat the next hearing.
Dear Dad!
"Never give upof hope, Dad!"
Neverdo not give up hope!
"Do not worry, my Mahir,finally the water finds its way!"
"Alo has little justicein this life,you will be hanged!"
Uncle Black!
I leave you the familycare
Do you understand me?
"My brave young man, now you care about them... come on"
"Congratulations,Feride dear!"
You did an Exceptionally excellent hearing You were very controlled.
I do not understandwhy have you postponed the verdict?
"I would not interfere, but I think you should nowmake a decision and break a pencil!"
"Do not interferewith this, Turgut!"
I'm justworried about you...
Mahir KaraI was hurt as a judge how many times you have to go throughthe same nightmare ?
"my Nazif is not over yet ,Do not lose hope !"
"No, Safija,it will happen what should happen ."
Fatherbrother will not give up !
Pencil will breakand nothing we can do.
"Grandpa,I know you're very sorry ,but do not be !"
"All you really like ,my little heros !"
"Mr. Nazif ,Come on, we gotta go !"
s it truewhat Mrs . Kader said?
"Do not say that ,Ilknur !"
"You'll see that this is not so ,you'll see !"
"You'll see that this is not so ,you'll see !"
"Everything will be fine , we must not lose hope ,not over yet !"
"Ninja Turtles ill walks in place, and 1943 just fidgets around a lot."
It's another hunk of plastic!
Who made this thing?
Son of a bitch...
"Well, we might as well try an LJN game."
"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!"
Let's see if this works.
"No, of course not."
It doesn't.
It doesn't work.
It just doesn't work.
I need a beer.
I'm drinking Rolling Rock... ...on the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!
Rolling Rock... ...Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!
"Yeah, Rolling Rock, on the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!"
"I've also heard that you can't weigh more than a hundred pounds, but I still don't understand why I can't get any kind of response out of it."
Let's try the cat.
"Get on there, ya little bastard."
"Cat's like, ""Fuck that shit!"""
"Even though the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker does absolutely nothing, the B and A buttons still work."
"Yeah, you plug the regular controller into it,"
"So while you're standing on the thing, you still use the B and A buttons like normal."
"So even if it did work, what's the point?"
"If I'm holding the controller anyway, why not just use the controller?"
"It blows my mind, it's like, what were they thinking?"
"One more, the U-Force."
"So hot, nothing can touch it."
Nothing comes between you and the game.
That's what the advertisement said.
"You open the thing up, it basically looks like electronic Battleship."
It's got a three-dimensional invisible power field.
"Wow, a power field?"
He says that we have a stronger hand now that the killer has come out.
"That's great news son, I feel light as a bird."
He says that you will definitely be free in just one session.
Inshallah...
The nightmare will be over.
"- Well, we can't say for sure."
- Kuzey...
Don't think about bad things.
Obviously there's a misunderstanding.
"Yes, son, it's not like they'll keep you here for lifetime... ... just because you called him to the forest."
Do you know anything about that man?
Who is he?
What is his story?
His name is Mirza Çeltik.
Ferhat killed that man's son.
"Actually, got him wounded."
Are you gonna allow me?
Or keep interrupting?
What?
Who says you're the only one who can talk?
"Handan Hanım, did you swallow a microphone or something?"
Why do you sound so loud?
"After the incident, the boy was never the same."
"I don't know what Ferhat did to the boy but... ... in the end, he suicided."
"- Hence, his hatred to Ferhat."
He couldn't track Ferhat until he saw his picture on the newspaper upon Ali's death.
"And then, he chased him down."
Had Ferhat served time in prison because of that?
"When you first met Ferhat, that was why he was in prison."
He could kill a man without blinking an eye... ... just because he is my lover.
He's a monster with bloody hands who does not fear any prison.
That boy was Deniz's lover.
Then there is nothing we can do.
"It was Narin who tied Mustafa's mind, then she will be the one who would untie it."
"You say that we should bring Narin, don't you?"
"I thought about it, too, but..."
I haven't said anything.
"Very well, but who is going to ask Narin?"
Take it easy!
-Welcome!
-Welcome!
- Take it easy!
- Welcome Yasar - Thank you.
How nice that you've started cleaning here.
This place is important for Guzelyurt.
There aren't many places like this that people can use.
"I love this place very much, too."
How is your brother?
"In fact, I came here for him."
I am going to ask you something difficult.
My brother doesn't recognize or remember anybody;  my mother... my father... me... his friends... no one...
It must be because he is taking a lot of medicine.
They say so...But they say he shut himself off completely and doesn't talk at all.
He doesn't even eat.
The doctor says that visitors whom he knows will be helpful but...
"He only recognized Narin, from a picture."
It will be very helpful if Narin visits my brother.
"Well, what do you want from me?"
"Doctor Bey, we can't ask Narin this."
"If you ask her as a doctor, maybe she would be convinced."
"How could you ask me something like this, Yasar?"
I've already been involved enough in your family affairs.
And I've paid the price for this greatly.
"Your mother, father, everybody see me as their enemy,"
Good.
Um.
"Two uh, galleries, online galleries, and stuff like that."
Mm-hm.
"But, I have some real good stuff on there, but."
"You know, we have um, an interesting series, it's, it's um, Wordpress."
"But, we are doing an interesting series with one of our authors, uh, Morton Ran Hendrickson."
"And he's doing this series called Start With A Theme, and he looks at three free Wordpress themes."
And ah looks at how to tweak them best for your website and the one that j ust released was on creative portfolios.
"Oh so you can actually, so you know if there's some advice on how to tweak them."
"Oh, that'd be great."
"Yeah, so, he did one on um, photography portfolios, and then the one that just came out yesterday I think is creative portfolios, and then he's doing another one this fall, on, um."
Magazines.
Styles.
Oh.
Magazine work.
I'd be interested in that one.
Yeah.
"My husband and I have a podcast, uh, uh, and we're using WordPress to kinda fix the audio thing."
Uh.
It's very hard to find a WordPress that actually has a good audio for the internet.
Um.
"We're having an earthquake. , Hm?"
We're having an earthquake.
Usgs?
What?
Yeah.
Oh right now?
"Uh-huh. , check on the USGS's website."
Have you been on the earthquake site?
I always am on the earthquake site.
"Is there, is there an immediate uh?"
I have received the reward that I deserved.
"Now I won""t live in this house even for a moment!"
"This is too bad, boss! she shouldn""t have come here."
"lt""s very dangerous. she saw everything with her own eyes."
"And now.. as per syndicate""s rule.. she has no right to live! kaka sir.. beware if you uttered a single word against seema."
"lf there is even a scratch on her body.. ..then I won""t spare you all!"
Pinto!
Quickly hide the goods!
"lnspector, what evidence do you have against me?"
"lf we had any evidence then you.. ..wouldn""t have been free like this."
Then why are you guys harassing me?
Tell me.
Why did you set your house ablaze?
I should be asking you this question.
"When you people were there, then who set my house ablaze?"
Thank God I was not at home at that time!
Fine!
But can you tell us what forced.. ..seema to leave her house at midnight?
"Mr. Diwan, this is my and seema""s personal matter."
"You don""t interfere."
"You don""t worry."
"I won""t let my wife be a burden on you. stop! stop! stop! stop!"
No!
"I don""t want to be a burden on anybody!"
"What burden, dear?"
We are poor.
"But we have a big heart. only a human come to a human""s aid."
"lt""s a sin to commit suicide. come, dear. come."
Mr. Rajesh.
"You couldn""t seize the gold."
And that gold is going to be smuggled tonight.. ..in the form of silver from Alibagh beach.
"But why don""t you reveal yourself?"
Don't spoil her life.
Think logically and tell me before 12 o'clock tomorrow night.
Because after 12 o'clock I am going on a test ride.. ..in my past.
Professor I have no time to think.. ..because tomorrow is my parent's 33rd anniversary.
And I have planned a surprise party for them.
Everyone must be thinking looking at you.. ..that why isn't her husband begging on the streets.
You look like Zhaveri Bazaar's showroom.
It's better than looking like an antique piece in the flea market.
How much does she love me?
Enjoy the party guys.
Go on!
"Excuse me, get me a drink please."
I should do all the work.
"Uncle Bhikhu, were mom and dad always like this.. ..or did this happen after marriage?"
They were sworn enemies.
Their marriage was the second biggest mistake.. ..in the history of mankind.
After the atom bomb.
When actually it wasn't their mistake.. ..but your grandparents.
How is that?
They're dead and all that's left of them are their pictures.
But they still don't like staying next to each other.
Your grandpa Rai Bahadur Dhyanchand.
No one ever took his advice nor was he brave.
Especially before your grandma.
And your grandma Bholi Devi.
She wasn't innocent or a Devi.
Wonder why they got their children married.. ..and sent me here as the dowry?
"""If I had wings, I would soar high."""
"""I would show you the anguish in my heart."""
"Here he comes, the great two-in-one."
Two-in-one?
"- Yes, Kundan Lal."
I am grateful to them

She is WOW!
It's the end of year presidential elections and I'm here on the streets... ... to see what citizens really look for in their next presidential candidate.
Someone who is honest and knows how to communicate
I hope that someone who is successful in their field will run.
Someone who is proud for this generation and can blend in with today's values.
If you had to nominate someone?
Announcer Gong Jung Han?
"Gong Jung Han, the announcer."
"If i had to choose, Gong Jung Han."
Do you think he'll really run now?
"If he does, we should vote for him, right?"
We should know what kind of person he is before choose him.
It's ridiculous to vote for him just because he's our next door neighbour.
Gong Jung Han is Jo Ara's Husband.
They're such a lovebirds.
"If her family happy, then wouldn't the nation be happy too?"
Do you think Jo Ara is good?
I'll start the car.
"Honey, please keep our country safe today."
Let's see.
What's this?
Why is this out?
Are you tempted?
Thank you for buying.
My husband was the biggest help before the publication of my book.
He gave up his own study room for me.
And even my son all the way in America helped supervise me writing.
I write this without any exaggerations or lies.
I wanted you all to hear my true voice.
Which part should I read?
Probably 50 feet high
There's a picture of the ice house right there.
They put it right up to the heaves.
You can imagine how much - how many tons and tons of ice would be in there.
500 pound case.
"That was to supply the whole island all summer, or?"
"Yeah, in the 40s, yeah."
Probably 90% of them.
There wasn't that many refrigerators then.
"And in the 50s, you got more."
"But the people still that owned refrigerators, there weren't much size to them or anything."
"And even if the people got one, their old ice boxes, I still delivered a lot of ice."
"They delivered every day, pretty much."
Who did?
Dad.
And he knew every size of every ice box.
"One day he might be going along the harbor, next day he'd be out different places."
"Of course, there wasn't any out here then."
"But, Brother's, they'd take a couple hundred pounds every day."
Couple wash tubs.
"One would be full of the pop and stuff, and the other the cooks would use for the lettuce and -"
The Christian Brothers?
Yeah.
The hotels.
Talk a little bit about the Christian
Brothers at that time.
What were they like?
"Oh, real nice friendly guys"
They come here - there'd be two batches.
"I think 40 at a time, maybe."
40 rings a bell.
And then there was - they had a German guy and his wife were the cooks.
And we brought it all to bankruptcy.
"Of course, all the creditors - We tried to get our members their money back."
"Ten cents on the dollar, and they did."
Some of it was interesting.
How did you and De meet then?
I flew down on a Thursday and caught the Friday and Saturday and when I came back I picked up a case of some Irish whiskey.
I knew that a bunch of friends of ours were having a St. Patrick's Day party.
"So we flew in, I grabbed a jug and went on over there and she was making some salads or doing something like that."
She was looking pretty good.
One thing led to another and that was it.
"She had a background on the island, with her family?"
"She knew some friends, that was it."
The friends that she was at...
Maria [?] was married a guy from here.
And different people
They all went to school.
These were the nurses.
They were having a party.
"She wasn't there, but it was the people that she graduated with."
There was a bunch of them that used to stick together.
[?]
"Cole, Donald Cole's wife,"
Ellen [?].
She was one of them.
"So was De a nurse, too?"
"No, she was an executive secretary."
"She hung out with some Beaver Island nurses, and that was her only connection?"
"Yep, she'd never been to the island."
But then she went to Detroit.
I was sparking her for about a year but I wasn't
looking for that ring yet.
But of course she went to
"It was the USDA that, sort of, came up with the idea of working on pennycress."
And he's going to tell us a little about how they got started and where they are now in the research side of things.
"But before we get to Terry, I'd like to introduce our overhead..."
"Dr. Bill Bailey, he is the director of the School of Agriculture."
"And he has some welcome words, I guess."
William Bailey:
Words of welcome.
A big decision I was involved in was whether or not to have coffee or cocoa or chili today.
We opted for the coffee.
Welcome.
You're part of a historic event.
Truly historic.
"This is the first Pennycress Field Day ever, in the history of the world."
"Right here, at Western illinois University."
So cutting-edge stuff.
"We're very pleased that you took the time to come here and share some of Win's work with him,"
It's exciting stuff.
It's new stuff.
It continues to the tradition that he started here at Western of looking at new ways and new crops to help
Illinois farmers make money.
"So I'll turn it over to you, Win."
Win Phippen:
Thank you.
And I'll turn it back to Terry.
Terry Isbell:
"This is a fun project, because as Brad knows, I've got one answer:"
"""I don't know."""

"I stick with it really well, don't I, Brad?"
We started working on the probably in about 2002.
But Edie is not prepared for how difficult teaching Nathan will be.
"OK, where were you?"
The most basic school work is a chore for Nathan and a challenge for his mother.
Nine times six is 54?
Do I put it under here?
Do you remember what to do next?
You put it under here?
"OK, what do you put?"
5-4.
Nope.
5-4.
5-4.
I don't know that.
"OK, I'm trying to remind you."
"By early summer, Nathan's frustration has turned to anger."
"He is kicking doors, hitting his brother."
He loses control.
And that part is what's frightening.
His family is becoming increasingly fearful that Nathan's plummeting self esteem might cause him to hurt himself or others.
Sometimes I can't stop crying.
"And, like, I'm just in my bed with my head down."
I just get sad.
"A little while ago, like last year, I was like, I could just kill myself."
I tried to run away.
I just felt like no one really wanted me to be there.
"Nathan's mom, desperate to do something to improve her son's self image, begins to look outside Bear Creek for help."
An hour down the road are the offices of pediatrician Mel Levine whose specialty is finding out what's going on with kids
like Nathan.
Dr. Levine tests for strengths and weaknesses.
"You know, for kids, success is like a vitamin."
And it's a real vitamin deficiency to grow up success deprived.
Let's just compare it to the original.
No moreno doubthe was the killer.

Hamburger!
I was so hungry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's really good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Better than the delicious French or Italian food. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I wish time would stop right here.
Eat!
Don't just look at it
"But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?"
You were with Hae Ra. . .
That's because. . .
You were the one closest to me.
Thank you.
I keep causing trouble all the time.
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.
But after you showed up...
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.
"Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve."
Is the ordeal...possibly me?
"At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it."
"But now, I won't run from it."
"If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer."
I'm going to approach it head on.
Huh?
You're going to face me head on?
If you don't get it then forget it.
"No, I get it."
"So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away."
"But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me."
Are you proposing to me?!
Won Kang Hwi was not a Hallyu star from the beginning.
Do you think people will believe this?
"No matter who looks at it, it is obvious that it is fake."
It is not fake!
I took it personally!
You went to Playground (Bar) yesterday.
Manager Kang said... &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;that you left with Kang Hwi.
"Still, if these photos are revealed, the blow will be severe."
"You know, don't you?"
I am close to Reporter Choi in Sports A.
Don't you remember who introduced you to Reporter Choi?
Jae Hee...  no Jong Chul!
"This business is not such an easy arena. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I don't expect anything big. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The commercial that Won Kang Hwi is shooting again.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; If you hand it over to me, I'll keep my mouth shut.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
You should have chosen your opponent well.
Leave the originals behind  and get out immediately!
Do you know that Won Kang Hwi has a sponsor?
I mean it.
This was filmed yesterday at JY Hotel.
Check it out.
She lodged in the suite room.
That's enough.
Star Entertainment!
"Star Entertainment, on the condition that he brings Lee Tae Ik, proposed a huge contract fee to Won Kang Hwi."
Did you know that?
I also heard that personally.
I heard that you were dating a member of a girl group.
If you don't want to be no.
"1 on the internet hit list,"
leave the originals here and get out immediately!
Why don't you trust what I say?
President. you will suffer a blow like that.
I...  trust my kids!
Here's our token of appreciation from us to you.
Paul:
"Aw, thank you."
That's a beautiful knife.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Read it."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" What's that say?"
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
What does it say?
Paul:
"It says, ""Prepared for life."""
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"""Prepared for life."""
Paul: ...I'd like to think I was.
Paul:
I let my Scoutmaster down because I dropped out of
Scouting and it's a big regret for me now.
"But I came out here today, I felt like I've redeemed myself."
I think Scoutmaster McCauley would be proud of me.
I really think he'd be proud of me.
"In the last video, we set up this definite integral to evaluate the volume of the solid of revolution that we set up using the shell method."
"So now, let's just evaluate this thing."
So the main thing is just simplifying this expression.
I'll start off by trying to simplify this part of it.
So that's going to be y plus 1.
"I just ate an apple, so something weird just happened in my throat."
"But anyway, that's done with. y plus 1 minus y squared minus 2y plus 1."
I just expanded out this binomial.
And then that would simplify to-- another apple in my throat moment-- so that's going to be y plus 1 minus y squared plus 2y minus 1.
So this 1 and this negative 1 cancel out.
And let's see.
You get negative y squared plus 3y.
On my wife's advice.
Look.
My first premium was for 1501 rupees..
There's a well-known temple in the South.
I paid it there.
"Then, I've been paying 1000 rupees every year.. ..at Lord Ganesha's stall."
It's called a mandap.
"And, your honour, my mother-in-law used to be very sick."
"So, the temple authorities said, "" Pay us 11,000.. """
""" ..perform a veneration and watch the miracle "" ."
We performed the veneration and my mother-in-law passed away.
"That was a good thing, but I also lost 11,000."
And they didn't refund a single rupee.
"And then, donation at the mosque.. ..blanket at the shrine, candle at church, alms for beggar.. ..incense sticks, veil for Mother Goddess."
ln total I've paid around 10 lakhs in all these stores.
Enough!
Enough!
Don't call it a store.
It's called a temple.
And people donate willingly at the temple.. ..for the peace and prosperity of their family.
Even I gave this amount.. ..for the peace and prosperity of my family.
And not for fun.
But your God snatched all the peace from my life.
Because only God can cause earthquakes.
Humans cannot do it.
"So tell me, don't I've a right to ask God for compensation?"
Mr. Kanji.
"You've a tiff with God, don't you?"
- Yes.
So why don't you ask Him directly for compensation?
Why are you asking the temples?
Which company supplies electricity to your home?
Tanning accelerator for the pastiest inner thighs on a planet?*
They don't make that.
Guess I'm standing here.*
"Mom, do you trust me?"
"Right I mean you think I have a good judgement, right?##"
"Well, you're smarter than I'm."
You've been telling that since your 4th grade.
"Great, can I get a tattoo"
No.
I'm not a totally square.
"Alright, last year when you wanted the magenta stripe in your bangs"
We've got this stripe.
"Yeah, and I hated this stripe because it turned on me."
I thought it was so daring and cool.
I showed up last year and everyone had color hair even the special-ed kids##
"No tatoos, Sam"
"No bikers named Satan showing up here asking for date, no Sam."
No
It's been two years mom.
You have to let go.
Dad wouldn't let you carry him around like this.
"You and your father having that discussion about tattoos, that's something I would like to have seen."
Yeah
"Come on, let's zip this sucker up"
You'll have a great time
Are you ready?
"Dear Diary, How many calories are in grape*?"
I gained 1.7 pounds this weekend.
"It was a box of rasin nuts, that Josh brought on Friday that did it."
I know it.
"He just stopped* holding my hand halfway through the movie and I crashed into into this total panic thinking he's disgustedby me, he's dumping me"
This is so stupid.
The dad.
Good question.
What about the dad?
[ Silence ]
[ Inaudible ]
"Oh, come on."
I don't have to do all the talking.
Who would be-- who was the dad?
Something to do with the dad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe the baby was illegitimate. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bingo.
Okay.
"So if the baby's illegitimate, who would the dad be?"
"And who would be mad at Lucy for having the baby with the dad? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife [inaudible] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife of the father, exactly."
Okay.
"So Lucy wasn't married, and the baby wasn't legitimate, and I went with her that day."
She-- we went and confronted the wife schoolteacher who happened to be the father of the baby.
"So Lucy took the baby; we walked to the other end of the village and she said, listen, I had this baby."
Your husband is the father.
We had an affair.
The affair is over.
I don't want him anymore.
"You know, the baby is an innocent."
So let's please all just get along.
And then she went back.
Did the baby get conjunctivitis anymore? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
Absolutely.
That was not a very serious illness.
But Ferdinand's was.
"He first had minor aches and pains, turned into a fever, got steadily worse, and into the second week he couldn't stand up."
The family was searching frantically for the witch that was causing his illness.
They were trying witch after possible witch after possible witch after possible witch.
"Now the kids get all excited and say ""Alright, I am going vegan!"""
And just God knows what they are telling the parents.
"If your diet consists of nothing but Oreos, Skittles, Airheads, Fritos,"
"Sour Patch Kids, and Big League Chew you are going to die."
This is not healthy.
I do not know if kids hear that.
"""I am going to live."""
"On a healthier note you have your scrambled eggs, I have my scrambled tofu."
Pancakes.
"You don't have to use cow's milk, use soy milk, oat milk , rice milk, almond milk, coconut milk, hemp milk."
Fruits and vegetables.
Spaghetti.
Pasta.
Refried beans.
"Even have vegan sour cream,"
"Guacamole, comes from the avocado."
Soy cheese.
Rice cheese.
They even have this magical cheese I'll get to in a sec.
Veggie burger.
Veggie dog.
"Cupcakes, they have egg replacer."
I think I got them here.
"So you can replace the eggs with bananas, applesauce even."
"You can use soy milk, oat milk, more flour, water."
Coconut milk ice cream.
One of the best ice creams in the world.
"Again, it's not healthy, but healthier than cow milk ice cream."
"I've always said to people, ""Wait a minute, if you can put a man or a woman on the moon, how hard is it to make a cheese that doesn't come from a cow, or a goat?"
"How is it hard to make a vegan cheese?"""
"Well, they heard me."
"This is called a Daiya cheese actually, and it's great thing."
"- I went to meet him, he didn't show."
"I called his office, I called his house."
Okay.
"Go to the hospital, ask around."
Somebody's gotta know where he is.
What the hell happened?
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.
Tell him I know the demons are real and I admire his courage... ...for standing and speaking against them.
Tell him I know what they can do.
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.
Are you drunk?
"- Not yet, but I'm working on it."
- Have you seen this?
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...
You told me you'd talk him out of testifying.
"Instead, you put on a freak show with taped demons... ...and a dead girl speaking in tongues... ...and your client testifies that the archbishop sanctioned the exorcism."
We'll be lucky if the archdiocese isn't named...
I had a doctor who was gonna corroborate.
"Besides that, Father Moore's testimony's crucial to his defense."
Did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
The archdiocese isn't on trial.
I swore an oath to do what's best for my client.
"Spare me the law school pieties, Bruner."
You cashed in your conscience at the door.
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?
It's not over.
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand... ...to corroborate Father Moore about the exorcism.
And there are the girls.
"Her sister Alice, she saw part of it."
My dear!
Why dont you please relent?
If you are angry you will not walk with me till the end
Will you drench me instead of being my umbrella
You are the rain who throws away the umbrella
When I look beyond the curtains .. ..
I found that my impression in your heart.
Since I know the value of love I did not forget like you.
He is always thinking about me but does not talk to me
Even a second lost will never come back
Bye.
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Why are you thundering?
Do you think I am afraid of you?
"Even if you thunder, eventually you have to come to me."
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Cant you hear?
Are you deaf?
Dont make such a fuss.
I know that you also want to speak to me.
You are only trying to placate your ego.
Come to me now.
"Hey rain, you were the witness when a big man promised me.. ..that he will keep me in his heart and my ring on his finger."
He kept the promise too.
I also promised that whenever you come I would hug him.
Should I not keep my promise now?
Even if he is angry with me I am going to hug him.
Venkat!
What is the use of killing a minion like you.
I am sparing your life.
Go and tell him that he cannot harm.. ..even a single strand of my hair.
"Uncle, why are you looking at me like that?"
And we'll have to pay the scrap dealer.. ..to have this cleared.
Why pay?
"We'll give him one of the broken idols.. ..and say "" It appeared from the ground in Amarnath "" ."
"What are you saying, brother-in-law?"
You'll soon be bankrupt.
Do you know the losses you've incurred?
40 lakhs.
Goods worth 25 lakhs bought on credit.. ..and 15 lakhs spent on renovation last month.
40 lakhs?
Where did you get that kind of money?
We borrowed a part of the amount by mortgaging the house.
And I borrowed 10 lakhs from a friend.
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket.. ..for earning 18% interest.
"Pravin, you fool."
You didn't even ask me.
How will we arrange for such a huge sum?
There's hardly 30-40 thousand in the bank.
And we don't even have jewellery.
Sushila.
We'll manage.
- How?
Why don't you understand?
lf you hadn't spoken ill about the Lord.. ..He wouldn't have caused this earthquake.
His justice is silent.
Will you please stop preaching?
"You mean to say, that the Lord.. ..who doesn't exist, razed down my shop.. ..because I spoke ill about Him?"
"So, just to prove Himself.. ..he razed down just my shop in a fit of rage."
And if I still don't believe in Him.. ..he will make me incur more losses?
- Yes.
What yes?
I still don't believe in You?
I haven't incurred any loss.
You know what I'm saying?
We're going by the lyrics.
"Although you may want to wrench your fingers from embarrassment, you have to."
"Now we'll be filming the scene of where I reminiscence about a ""Coffee Shop"""
I say this a lot but acting is very difficult and it doesn't match well with me...
I think that's what it is.
But today's weather is great.
"Wait, no it's not."
I didn't realize because of my sunglasses.
Anyway I have to film the scene where I'm reminiscing about an ex-girlfriend.
But people are staring so I'm embarrassed.
"Still, I gotta try my best."
"Today is the day before the last day of filming for ""Coffee Shop""."
Tomorrow is the last day and today is the day before that.
Many passerby's are taking photos of us.
It feels strange and interesting.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
There isn't much time until we go back.
Tomorrow is the last day of shooting and we leave the day after that.
I want to enjoy NY more while I'm here.
There hasn't been enough time to look around.
What do you want to do?
Me?
Just walking around here a little bit would be fantastic.
"You have a lot of time, walk around."
I'm done filming.
I feel down.
I'm wearing my own gear today
These are the most recent pair I purchased.
I got to dance in a battle with great dancers.
Rainy New York morning.
"Shalu, give me a kiss, please!"
No ki. .ss.
"All this has to be done after marriage, not before marriage."
"Neelambar, neither are you married, nor I.Then what are you talking about?"
You openly express love in the garden.
Don't you feel ashamed?
Why should I feel ashamed?
- Why are you quiet?
Answer me.
Why don't you speak?
- I'm speaking so loudly. . . and you say I'm not speaking?
You have fallen in love.
- Wish what you are saying was true.
"But no, I have not fallen in love."
"Pitambar, he is not telling you, but me and Shalu."
"Oh, so you were talking to these two and I was interrupting . . . and adding to the confusion?"
But what were they doing?
"We have never done it, so how do we know? and reached the garden so soon."
- And will reach marriage stage soon.
"But remember, no kiss, no risk."
"Sir, the information is confirmed."
The diamond dealing will be done in Hotel Blue Diamond's swimming pool.
"Sir, the diamonds are worth 100 million rupees."
Which police officer has been given the responsibility of such a big case?
"Sir, a very capable officer, Inspector Gorpade."
Gorpade?
The one who could not attend the meeting of his own case. . . how will he nab the culprits?
"Sir, agreed that you and Gorpade don't share a good relationship."
That doesn't mean you don't consider him capable of any job.
Even he has solved many big cases.
Is it?
"Gentlemen, what time was this meeting scheduled?"
"- Zeynep, I almost died today."
"- Don't be silly, Burak."
How would he know that you'd use the elevator at that time?
- I don't know but he just did it somehow.
- Stop torturing yourself.
Throw those thoughts out of your mind.
I wish this was just my paranoias as you say.
I know you're going through a difficult period.
But you need to calm down.
It will be over soon.
I am with you.
And no one is gonna kill you.
Are you carrying a gun on your belt?
- I need to be prepared for anything.
- So is this how you protect yourself?
I need to carry this until I can feel safe again.
"""Kuzey, I crossed out one more day."""
"""I shoed away one more day to be with you."""
My captivity is over.
Yours is next.
On 4th of February.
"A new page will be opened for us, you'll see."
I'm filing a divorce suit against Barış.
"I'm with my mom, since that day."
"I won't go to that house again, not even to get my necklace back."
"Yes, Barış was so mad he seized the necklace you gave me."
I tried to get it back.
"But I had to leave it as pawn in exchange for my freedom, until I divorce."
It's a miserable effort by him.
"He will see that nothing can separate you and me, as everyone else will also see."
"Until today, I didn't know what it really meant ""to miss somebody""."
I missed you so much.
Which is it?
"Please stop asking me this, I..."
"Well, just tell me what you really think."
"No, that's okay..."
Tell me.
No... it's fine...
Tell me!
I... like it...
"Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!"
All right!
Since you really wanna know...
"The arm's sized tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel... ...the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile... ...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch... ...and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture."
"But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine."
"Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate."
"Orion has three stars on his belt, not four."
"Stitch by stitch, stitching it together"
Deadline looms Don't know the client's always right?
Even if my fabric choice was perfect
Got to get them all done by tonight
"Pinkie Pie, the color's too obtrusive"
Wait until you see it in the light
I'm sewing them together!
"Don't you think my gown would be more ""me"" with some lollipops?"
"-Well, I think..."
-Balloons?
-Well...
-DO EET!
"Hour by hour, one more change"

Hello!
Could I get some invisibility powder please.
"Yes, would you like the older or the newer kind, the patented powder."
"Of course the patent power, I've heard that it's better, it was invented abroad after all."
"Yes, indeed."
"It's called ""Through the walls"" powder, I recommend it."
"Look, dear young sir, if you ingest this powder, not only do you turn invisible but you can also walk through walls."
I have 1kg of sugar?
I'm going to use 100g of vanilla.
The ideal is using refined sugar or caster sugar.
Moustache:
"And what about the ""brownd"" sugar, can't it?"
"You can, actually you can use any sugar."
But we use more...
"The brown sugar has more flavour, right?"
So it'll mask the vanilla's flavour.
It's easier a sugar that doesn't have much flavour.
"It's better with the refined or with the caster sugar, because they are more thin."
"The caster sugar isn't the Icing sugar ok, guys?"
The Icing sugar has starch.
"It's not this, ok?"
"So, or the caster sugar or the refined sugar."
"But I don't have any of them here, so I'm using granulated sugar."
"I've never seen, really, anywhere, this unique support for cancer research."
"And so I want to thank you for your participation, your collaboration and most of all, for your confidence in our ideas."
(Applause)
Lookie here.
Now I'm f&amp;amp; excited if I've left something more than just ... the usual rations.
See if there is anything else that could be eaten.
Just think if I left some candy.
That would be great.
IS THERE ANY CANDY HERE?
"I don't think there is any, but one can always hope."
"Matches, even more Vaseline I don't really have use for."
Zinc ointment.
"Very much in here, apparently good."
YEAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAA -
You don't even see -
"After suppertime would hit, Jule would put out a set of sawhorses up by the church and up by the museum and the road gets in the winter - packed down."
We'd slide down hill until 10 o'clock at night.
"Kids don't even know what a sleigh looks like, you know."
Sliding down like where the...
"Actually, there was a tennis court where the church is."
But you'd be sliding down like where the rectory is and where the medical center.
"Hell, you're kids, and that was a big hill then."
And we'd go up to where the tower is.
But that's when you're older.
Go down there in a homemade toboggan and kill yourself.
What was Old Patrick Bonner like?
"Nice, pleasant fellow."
A little brogue.
He had one eye.
Accent and everything.
A lot of the guys did.
I don't know what's going on over there.
The seagulls are swarming all over.
Must be some [?] coming in or something.
"But, yeah, he was nice."
"Regular, pleasant guy."
Had the farm up there.
Otherwise...
Was he the only fiddler at that time?
Yeah.
Guy ...
King Strang might have done a little fiddling.
I can't think of...
He pretty much - and Jule played the guitar and he played the steel to the ... he played that really good...
"And Walter McCauley, he was just out of school."
Maybe sailing a little bit.
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.
But isn't the one with the problem you?
You even drop those kinds of things.
"It's good that you two have gotten closer... but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful."
Since Eun Jo is here too. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
When are you going to select your major?
During my second year.
"Then, when you decide what major you're going to take..."
Will you be able to do it?
"If a bunch of people choose the same major,"
"They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner..."
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.
"Well, I'm just saying..."
It would be nice if you went into business.
I'm not interested in that area.
"Ah, Why?"
Please drop me off right over there.
Are you going into class?
Seung Jo!
Again?
"Hey, when you think it's going well with him..."
Why is he so fickle?!
Is he being mean again?
"This time, it feels different from the last, though."
I don't know.
"What-  I mean, you said you even kissed."
Like this... you said you hugged too.
"But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??"
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.
It's very frustrating.
"Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas?"
To find out if he's interested in me or not.
"They are a little cold but, I thought it will serve."
"Oh, thank you..."
"Okay then, tomorrow in your last exam,no?"
"I have the interview and exam too, they come in package."
"Interviews are very important, you know."
You have to show them you have sufficiently capacity to study in that school.
"I would say something for their capacities but...anyways..,"
From tomorrow you will be a university student.
With God's willing!
What?- I will say something... but don't get angry right away.. don't say:
"""Don't interfere"", okay?"
"Call your mom too, talk to her."
Tell her that your exam is tomorrow.
Let her be happy too.
"Okay, i'll call her."
Of course I won't call her.
"Mira we'll talk properly about this in a suitable time but let's not talk about it at the last night before my exam,OK?"
Good!
I am sorry.
Good luck !&amp;gt; Thank you.
Success!
I will ask something...You will be angry with me too...
Ask..
"Last night, why did that blighter make you cry?- Are you spying on us?"
He alarmed the whole street with the voice of his burned plastic.( applying breaks on tires)
Do... you really love that man?
Good night.
Kenan calling...
What's up Dwarf ? &amp;gt; Brother!
- It means you remembered you have a brother.
"Brother, where are you calling from?"
"Don't make a show man, as if you don't know I am at the hospital."
"So, the search and rescue team...?"
"No, this was the astronauts."
"Oh, the astronauts themselves -"
Yes.
They were in with us.
We'd fly out to Houston...
The astronauts fly...
"We just spent like a week, 4 or 5 days or whatever it would be at the time."
And we'd go out and then we'd make changes.
"And back in, and back out."
"There were always 4 or 5 of them or 3 or 4 of them on the plane with us, just..."
And there was that original 8 or 10 astronauts.
Do you recall any of their names?
No.
"We were on missions, you know."
Because that's who the ones were.
So that was -
"I wish we had gotten autographs or something, but then again, you do stuff like this, and it's your job."
Never gave it a thought that it was anything other than a job.
"They were flying on the plane with you, to help you get acquainted with how to rescue them?"
"Yeah, just to see."
"And it was probably to reassure them too, you know, because"
"like I said, the Navy primarily was in the Pacific and then they had another alternate route over there north of the Canaries."
Like between the Canaries and [?]
Someplace in that area.
If I remember right.
"But anyplace in the world, we had a"
C-130 that could reach them within 4 hours.
Any place.
"And our plane was over by Singapore, Hong Kong."
But we had one in Chile.
"And, I don't know, we probably had one wherever the..."
Like zero.
"And of course, we're probably 16 years old"
"I mean, what the hell."
"We all skate, and we weren't experts, but we started skating."
"Now, you don't see a kid out there."
"Sunday afternoon, and nobody knows how to skate."
"But anyway, they're all watching that damn TV, or..."
We got out there and finally one of us had enough brains.
I don't know who.
I ain't gonna take the credit because we looked around and here the island was just a little bit of a smudge like this.
And the mainland
looks like from here to Garden Island.
"So one of us had enough brains to say, Maybe we better..."
"We had good, sharp skates"
Not a drop of snow or nothing.
Just like skating on a groomed rink except for the pressure through the cracks.
One of us finally had enough brains to turn around and come back.
"Now, you were 16 when you - ?"
"Probably was, yeah."
So you've kept pretty close and expect to see all nine of them?
"Well, eight of them."
Kenny died in Texas.
The guy that was in the Navy.
He died from cancer in Texas here a couple years ago.
Good friend.
"That was probably the whole graduating class, then?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"In fact, freshman year I was the only boy."
Gary was in seminary and Kenny was a grade ahead of us.
I was the only boy.
What other exploits did you have together with that group?
I can't believe what an awkward position I've put you in.
"But believe me, I never planned for this to happen"
"I know, I made your schedule."
This was not on it.
"Stacey, I've been looking high and low### for you"
"Well, maybe you should try getting out of the chair"
That'll increase your odds
"Stacey, I need you to testify for me at the people's court."
"Listen, I can't possibly take off walk."
I'm sorry.
It's a definite no
"Alright, I'll go on### TV myself, fine."
National TV?
Millions of cute guys watching?
"Alright, I'll do it"
"Here, I want you to look at these books."
I highlighted some of the cases that are similar to mine
And I've made some notes on some questions that they are likely to ask.
You know what to do.
"Call up the law library, see if they can dig up some legal precedence that we can cite"
"I'm on it, Paulie."
"Hey, Ma."
I'll be on TV.
I don't know.
Some stupid thing
"We just got together to talk like old friends, and the next thing you know, we wind up in my hotel room"
"If this conversation goes any further, I might be forced to go on a tri-state killing spree."
I don't blame you.
You're embarrassed.
"Nah, look, it's all right."
"I mean, growing up together, we had embarrassing moments all the time."
We did not.
"And this holiday season, let us reaffirm our commitment to each other, as family members, as neighbors, as Americans, regardless of our color or creed or faith."
"Let us remember that we are one, and we are a family."
"So on behalf of Malia and Sasha and Michelle and our grandmother-in-chief, Marian -- (laughter)"
"-- I wish you all the happiest holiday season, the merriest of Christmases."
"God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America."
(applause)
"And with that, I'm going to invite the entire Obama clan up here to light the Christmas tree."
"I need some help, and there's a lot of technical aspects to this."
(laughter)
"Come on, guys."
(applause)
All right.
"Okay, we're going to start counting down here."
We've got the switch right here.
The First Lady:
"All right, come on."
The President:
Everybody ready?
And this is the new tree.
"I know it's not quite as big as the old tree, but it's going to take time to grow."
But we're going to fill it up with some spirit and start a new tradition right now.
"All right, everybody ready?"
We're going to start counting down.
"Five, four, three, two, one -- (applause)"
There you go.
That's a good-looking tree.
"Thank you, everyone."
Now I have come to the crossroads in my life
I always knew what the right path was.
"Without exception, I knew."
But I never took it.
You know why?
"Keep your voice low, he is the king of entire Telangana."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"- It is raining, mother."
"If your father sees you, he will.."
Your husband is busy elsewhere.
Look there.
Silk drops which make the young girl happy
Like the colorful parrots and like sugar crystals .. ..the rain drops are falling to enhance the youth
Did you remember me after such a long time
How long will you hide in the skies
You come and go like a guest
If you promise to stay with me forever.. ..I will hold you close with my hands.
If you want to come will I stop you?
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my nose ring
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my ear ring
"like my bangles, and anklets and.. ..like ornaments I wear everyday"
Shall I preserve you like a childhood friend?
Like the blooming youth of a girl shall I see myself in you?
"Like the song on my lips, like the poetry of a poet and.. ..as the dreams in my eyes if you wish to be with me"
Father is very serious.
He wants to see you.
Let us go.
Shall I kidnap her?
Find her details.
The train started but where is your father?
Did father not come?
What are you searching for?
My father did not board the train.
You dont worry.
By the way how does he look like?
How does he look like?
I am asking about his appearance.
"Ball, car, picture."
Can you repeat those back to me please?
"BALL, CAR AND PlCTURE."
Fantastic.
"I'm going to ask you that later, again, so try and remember please."
"Starting from 100, can you take away 7 and tell me what that is? then keep taking away 7 and tell me what the answer is each time and I'll tell you when to stop and you can stop."
100.

Hello.
Today we are going to use fabric to make a crane.
Inflate four balloons
leaving about six inch flat tail.
I use different color balloons for this instruction.
Twist the first yellow bubble.
We are going to twist all bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist the first gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the first gray bubble with free end of the first yellow bubble.
Now let's connect two more balloons.
Twist the first red bubble.
Twist the first pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the first pink bubble with the free end of the first red bubble.
Twist the second yellow bubble.
Twist the second red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second yellow and the second red bubbles in one lock twist.
OK.
Now twist the second pink bubble.
And twist the second gray bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second pink and second gray bubbles in one lock twist.
It is the bottom view of our sculpture.
Twist the third pink bubble.
Motherfucker.
"Oh, hey."
"Just the same 12-year-old little boy-man-girl, except I'm not wearing a sports bra."
[MlMING HEAD EXPLODlNG]
You see?
"And a lot of people on the Internet can rant and rave about how much this guy's a fucking idiot, but I think you really need to go back in your mind, mostly guys, and think about all of the girls that you thought were really manly and gross and, like, athletic-looking, because they had their tits squished down."
Probably a little bit more than you'd like to admit.
Sun just went behind the clouds.
"So while you're watching the rest of the Olympics, and the rest of life, if you see a girl with some flat titties while she's working out or competing for a gold medal, it's not her titties."
It's her fucking bra!
"Sorry that you don't understand sports bras, because us girls have since the day we started growing fucking boobs."
"Right, Marbles?"
Where are your boobs?
In your shirt.
"Kermit, look at your ears, buddy."
You look like Princess Leia.
Yes you do.
Ohh!
"All right, make sure you subscribe to our channel."
We put out new videos every Wednesday!
And we hide our boobs sometimes when we work out so that they don't hit us in the face!
"Right, Kermit?"
"Yeah, you love boobs."
We'll see you next week.
Bye!
[DEEP VOlCE]
Bye —
[NORMAL VOlCE]
"Oh, there's the sun."
Fucking thanks for showing up.
Asshole.
Thank you all for coming tonight.
Far from it!
You should be thankful that he isn't the man of your life.Look!
We came to ask if there is anything we can do for you?
Where is Faruk?
"I don't know, just left, and went away."
Maybe he threw himself somewhere. or maybe he is getting ready to throw himself.
His life- insurance will pay his debts then.
"Do something ,Selim..."
Please ..-You know that i am Ümit's lawyer.
But I'll help you.I can recommend a good lawyer for him.
We're finished.
We simply got ruined.
"Thankfully, land register of this house is on me."
Could something happen?
Could we lose this house?
It depends on amount of the debt.
"But of course, as his wife you're debt's -partner.."
God damn it...
God damn him !
This incompetent guy!
"Come here, we can go outside for a bit if you want."
Since you couldn't carry out this work successfully why did you take such a risk?
Wait let me see the dimensions of this issue tomorrow first.
"Let us first see what's the issue befor you maul yourself, right?"
I 'il check on Beeren.
Everything is clear.
"In the middle of the business world, they proved that he is a thief."
"Even if he can get out of this mess, who's going to work with him again?"
He played with the future of the children.
This is the most important thing.
It looks like Mira will go from here before than that outskirts boy.
They will go away from here.
"Just close your ears (don't listen), no other way."
What are they saying?- I didn't see any of them since the evening.
How am i to look in their faces?!..
"Don't be like this Mira, please!"
"It's all because of uncle Umit's stupidity,"
He did a very shameful thing.
"Whatever it is, was there the place to settle accounts."
Can one attack like savage in that way.
That was definitely barbaric...Inhuman...
"No one cares about what he did, dear Eylul."
Every body will talk about my father.
About our disgrace..- What disgrace ?
"This is business life, one can sing and get out..."
"Uncle Faruk was a good person when he earned money for them, when he lost it he became a bad one?"
Empty words!
Mom..
"Where?- To fix our reputation (honor), which is licking the dust."
Any news from dad?
"No, his phones are switched off."
I will have to find a solution on my own.
Good morning. &amp;gt; Good morning.
"Wow, my dad did the omelet, I knew it from the smell."
"Sit down, it will get cold.."
What is it? &amp;gt; Nothing.
There is something...
"Everybody is tensed because of what happened last night Mert, don't force it if you want."
If I get anything I will be Darth Vader
"Yaman, you have to take care of the official documents for the school.."
Birth and citizenship certificate and so on.
"Don't neglect it, Friday is the last day."
"Ok, I will prepare them someday."
"-This is important, get it done today!"
[laughter]
"Um, listen, you two are going to fight like hooded roosters."
Let's just get it out there.
It's science.
"You know, place any two animals in a contained area together, um, you know, there will be awesome tenderness, but also there will be blood."
[laughter]
Tristam:
That is my pocket Walt Whitman.
"He was surely one of the greatest poets that ever lived, and if my babies can read Walt Whitman day and night and learn from him, I'll be very happy."
"After all, babies, he did say,"
"""I am August."
"I do not trouble my soul to vindicate itself."""
"No, he didn't say ""soul."""
"He said, ""I do not trouble..."" woman:"
"That's enough, Tristam, you'll use up all the memory."
"This is self-indulgent, and-- Please stop."
They need winding.
"Please stop, Tristam."
Tristam:
"""I do not trouble my spirit..."" woman:"
Stop being so selfish and putting yourself first.
"Please, I've been looking after them all day."
Just stop it.
Tristam:
"""I do not trouble my soul to--"
"""I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood."" woman:"
"Okay, fine. man:"
Ann and John are today renewing their vows in the light of their 50 years experience of marriage.
"Rather unusually, each of this special couple has agreed to write the vows of the other."
"That is, Ann has written John's vows, and John has written Ann's. man speaking native language:"
"Pull, pull. woman speaking native language:"
This one doesn't lift me up.
Right away!
You will talk with the foreman and will get the permission.
Thank you.
Is there any news from uncle Faruk?
What will happen if they find him?
Will he go to jail?
"He has to pay his debt, of course first he has to appear."
Give it! ~ Faruk calling.
"Yes, Faruk."
-Hi -I guess you need me more than you need her?
"Thanks, ..Thank you very much."
"How bad is the situation ,Faruk?"
"Very bad, very."
I am totally in a mess.
We guess so.
"Of course you're Umit's lawyer, you must know it."
But now I am here as a neighbor.
As much as I knew you were a hardworking man who loved his work.
We knew that everything was going well.
What happened that you came in this state?
"I made an investment in Japan,"
"I was in reserve incomes and a little risky but... ... the business was a flop, and the money lost."
Exactly.
"For a time being I managed by taking in cash from the account .. but after the rumors, everyone started to withdraw their money at the same time."
I was disintegrated.
How do you think to pay your debt?
Actually not everything is over...
There are also other investments I am waiting for the return.
"Those are solid, but I need at least 3 month till the money is back.. can't postpone the debts anymore."
"My problem is time, I don't have any other worry."
"Let's consider that you postponed your debts, how much can you pay?"
Everything.
And if I'm offered to drive in a
Ferrari I don't ask questions.
I just drive it.
The problem with this situation is that I'm now at
least a year late to reviewing the Spider.
You've all read about it and watched the video so you need to see something different.
"Now I've searched YouTube and there are lots of beautiful shoots and factual films, but there isn't much bad behavior."
"I've, therefore, decided in the interest of original programming that I'm going to drive this car"
like a complete idiot.

"Well, I have to say, it's dead impressive for a car with a conventional construction that's got no roof."
"570 horsepower, at about 1550 kilograms, at"
"little bit less, actually."
It's just as fast as you ever wanted a car to be.
Very direct steering.
I've got the suspension in full firm at the moment.
But I might just try and soften it off a bit and see what it does.
[TlRES SQUEALlNG]
It might make the car a bit lazier.
[CAR ENGlNE]
I hope you can get some of this noise.
Because it's--
[CAR ENGlNE]
That's the defining aspect of the 458.
It's normally aspirated.
It makes a noise that the McLaren just can't hope to match.
[CAR ENGlNE]
The problem with these flippin' Spiders these days is they kind of undo my argument that you have to have a hard top on the driving front.

"Well, get back the ball!"
But you shot it!
"Yes I did, but it bounced back from you!"
"Oh, Coward, coward!"
"Coward, are you afraid of dogs?!"
Why are you sitting at home?
On your own ...
Well ...
"Mind you Mitya, don't touch these pills!"
They are magical.
"Wow, That's great!"
Yeah-yeh.
If you'd eat one you'd immediately turn to stone.
Why didn't YOU turn to stone?
Only children turn to stone For grown-up it's just a cure for the common cold.
Will it turn dogs to stone too?
"Yes, Mitya, It will, very much so."
What do you want?
I was struck that these students knew more than I did.
I was in med school and was one of the best in my class in Uppsala.
But these Indians knew more than I did.
"I was thinking, ""This can't be right."
"They're Hindu!"""
"""They have caste marks and limited schooling."" But they were brilliant."
The first day I attended a course in internal medicine.
The instructor questioned us on renal cancer.
"After the fourth question I couldn't answer any more, but they knew more."
It was a strange experience.
Stockholm City Hall - Have you lectured here?
"- No, but I've eaten dinner here."
This ceiling is Stockholm's best big screen.
"It'll be like ""divine truth""."
Rehearsal Knowledge Gala 2008 Let's see how close we can get...
- Hi!
Hans Rosling.
- We're testing your equipment.
"So, that's it?"
"Wow, that's gorgeous!"
So you take care of this machine?
And then you project from here...
Doesn't that cause distortion?
"It creates a nice feeling, like the ceiling tilting."
Our presentation comes from page...
Here!
This is a great picture.
Mom and Dad are in our basement in SvartbŠcken with the box for us in Mozambique where Agneta and I worked.
Food was extremely scarce in communist Mozambique.
"They packed crispbread, fish balls, spaghetti and raisins."
The kids loved it when the box from home arrived.
"In autumn 1967 I helped arrange a meeting in Uppsala for Eduardo Mondlane, first leader of Mozambique's liberation front."
Janelle I'm so sorry.
I should've talked to you first
You're nervous.
I understand.
Let me make it up.
We're going to that Italian restaurant we saw
I'll get you a nice-a table by the fireplace-a.
"Hey Ross, Rachel."
"Hi, I just wanted to come in and say that I think it's great."
Two peopel who work together are having an open and honest relationship
"Well, I think that relationships that could potentially ruin people's professional careers should be left confidential."
For how long
Five months
"So, what do we do now"
"Well, sir, it's not like we can just make it go away."
"I mean, let's face it."
You let the genie out of the bottle.
We only kissed
What's up Carter
James.
Romantic complications.
The guy I'm seeing is a boxer.
"Yesterday, I was overcome with emotion and I accientially outed### him."
"Personally, I think bennet should be proud of who he is, but, uh, I may have irreparably damaged his career."
"Bottom line is, I care about the guy."
He's not returning my calls
I'm here for you buddy
It was an awkward moment and somehow it led to a kiss
But we're both single consenting adults and if we choose to move forward as a couple
Ms Cooper would undoubtedly take a different job here in city hall.
"I however, would still be the mayor"
Why are you being so upfront with us
"(Male announcer) This is the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen, where, for one home cook, dreams will become a reality."
[Cheers]
"After searching across the entire country for America's finest home chefs, we've narrowed it down to 18."
I'm a food photographer.
I'm a graduate student.
I'm a stockbroker.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
"(Announcer) But to earn the title of Masterchef, they must impress three of the biggest names in the culinary world..."
Joe Bastianich...
"The hallmarks of a Masterchef are elegance, sophistication, and finesse."
- (Announcer) Graham Elliot...
"- To me, a Masterchef is constantly innovating."
(Announcer) And Gordon Ramsay.
A true Masterchef puts perfection on every plate.
"(Announcer) Tonight, the competition officially begins."
We're looking for one stunning dish.
(Announcer) And with that comes twists...
What the heck is gonna happen now?
(Announcer) Turns...
Fire.
Fire.
(Announcer) And tears.
The search for America's next Masterchef begins now.
"Thousands of cooks have already been eliminated, and only 18 remain in the search for America's next Masterchef."
Now it's time for these top home cooks to take their place in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
(Michael) Walking into the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen for the first time is incredible.
"It's such a beautiful kitchen, you know."
It's the kitchen that I've always dreamed of.
(Josh) The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen even has its own bar and restaurant.
"Man, this is crazy."
It's freakin' awesome.
I have never seen so many glorious bottles of wine.
You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
I have forgotten too much.
I have to go to China in this ship to pay you back.
So that's why you agreed to such a high interest.
"Since my ship is not setting sail, you're the only one that's making money here."
Ten thousand yang a day.
Am I the only one that's benefitting from the ship not setting sail?
That is why I am going to put the bait out tonight.
"If the bait is out and we put out the trap, the mice will be caught!"
He's showing him the girls!
Does he suspect Gil Dong hyung?
"He must have gone along with him to not arouse suspicion, but how infuriating!"
We have to come out aggressively so that they will fear us.
But isn't this too much?
"You know this business well, don't you?"
"Be gentle, won't you?"
I'm scared I can't even look at them!
You will get your money only if the ship sets sail.
"If you stand here, you will have a nice view of all the mice."
Throw them in!
"Yes, sir!"
Help us!
Help us!
"We'll send them into the water, so they can have them back!"
Save us!
Please help us!
What is it?
You want to help them?
"If he does something, it's all over."
Then should he let them all die?
"When he gives the signal, we go."
I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
"So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size."
"Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green."
"I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so --"
I think we're OK.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"So, let's see,"
"let's take a different row of people, starting with you."
"I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four."
"Oh, I did this row already."
"Let's do the row before you, starting with you: one, two, three, four, five."
"Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead."
Five.
Seven.
Six.
Eight.
Three.
"57,683 -- squared."
Yuck.
Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
"I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two."
"Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer."
"Now, let me recap."
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Laughter)
While I explain something else -- (Laughter)
"-- I know, that you can use, right?"
(Laughter)
"While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation."
Let me explain what that is.
"But It, itself,  is not an appearance."
Hm?
What are we speaking about?
You!
"It's not  some abstract principle, somewhere behind here; that's also an idea."
"And when you  keep on looking and seeing that everything that has form depends upon a formless seer  of them, somehow."
"All of them report back, as far back as the attention can follow."
It evolves into emptiness.
Everything is coming back  to emptiness.
You have to prove this  for yourself.
This is why  I don't say it's a teaching; it's pointing.
Look.
"Ultimately, can what we are be a phenomenon?"
And a phenomenon  cannot witness itself.
"We say the ego  is aware of itself, but what's aware of that?"
So that awareness somehow comes into emptiness again.
And it is  the experience of this that brings clarity  and peace to the mind.
'What does the third eye see?'
"First, the second eye  and the first eye, then they are seeing  only things."
"And the third eye  is seeing what, also?"
"They call 'eye of intuition,' what is that one seeing?"
Hm?
[Music plays in the background]
[M:]
"Its light  is understanding, that is the light  of the third eye: intuitive understanding."
"But what sees third eye, also?"
Can the Seer of the third eye  be seen?
And by whom?
"All these questions,  they can be solved here."
Okay.
[M:]
Okay. www.mooji.org
"So, if these things are true, than we'll say that these two pairs are equivalent."
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, that's a relation."
Is it an equivalence relation?
There's some things to check here.
Right?
"We won't do them all, but do you want you to think that..."
"So here's the important thing to do, once you have a construction, the work is not done, you should check that it is an equivalence relation."
Check tilde is an equivalence relation.
"So, for instance, is it reflexive?"
Some of you said yes right away and some of you hesitated.
How would I check if it's reflexive?
What would I have to check to check the reflexive condition for this relation?
Which is on pairs of pairs?
Right?
"You give me a pair and another pair, how would I check... what would I have to check for reflexivity?"
What do I wanna check?
What's the condition I wanna check?
What corresponds to a R a over there?
"Yeah, is p q equivalent to p q?"
"Now, does everybody agree this is what we have to check?"
"It's not the only thing, but it's one of the things."
Yeah?
"Ok, good, now, is this easy to check?"
"Well, then you go back to this definition, since this is why definitions are so important in Mathematics, because we know what we mean, we have a definition."
What does it mean to check p q tilde p q?
It means checking that... p q equal q p.
Is that true?
For integers.
Yes.
Ok?
Which is good today and good tomorrow.
Dr:
"Yes, it lowers heart disease and cancer down the road."
S:
I had no clue.
I thought the flu shot was just a nice thing to avoid a week of the sneezing.
But flu shot can actually reduce your cancer...
Dr: ...and heart disease down the road.
And we have to think long-term as a society.
S:
What about statins?
"I mean, it seems things like Lipitor, etc.--"
"no one should take medical advice based on a thing in a video-- but, are taking it, just for heart disease?"
Or are people taking it more broadly now?
Dr:
Listen:
"I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound affect on cancer, heart disease, stroke, potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases."
"And again, giving no recommendations, but what I say is, you and parents should talk to your doctor and say,"
"""Why shouldn't I be on this drug?	"""
S:
And there are some side effects?
Are they easy to test for?
Dr:
"They test for them, and they're reversible."
You have to do a risk-benefit analysis.
"Have to look at you and say, are you at high risk for XYZ?"
"If you are, what can prevent it or delay it?"
"The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease."
S:
This is fascinating.
"But no advice here, everyone should talk to their doctor."
Dr:
[Student speaking].
Interesting.
"That's not something I'm going to demand right away, but what's a more important consideration?"
Second row here.
[Student speaking].
"Good, tell me your name... n cannot equal zero, David said."
"So m, n are in Z and n is not zero."
Ok?
"This is one possible answer you might give to this question, but it is not very satisfactory, for a few reasons."
Probably the most important reason is... we have no idea what this notation means.
What do you mean by m over n?
Right?
What's that mean?
The integers don't have a division defined on them.
Right?
What does it mean?
"Ok, so I'm just gonna say this is not quite good enough."
Because we don't know what you mean by... what's this symbol.
What does this mean?.
"Ok, so, let's try to be a little more careful."
And we can be guided by what we do know.
"So, let's think about the motivation."
"So, when we think about fractions, you know, we're usually thinking about trying to teach children something about dividing,"
"I don't know, cakes into pieces or something like that, right?"
"So, you know, you might for instance take a cake, which looks remarkably like an interval"
"[Laughter]... and dividing it into, I don't know, three pieces, and giving somebody one of those three pieces, ok?"
"We have a name for this fraction, we call it?"
One third.
Right?
Ok.
One third.
"Which really means one part of three, right?"
I sat up till after midnight studying *The Roman Ritual*... ...thinking about what lay ahead.
You mean *The Roman Ritual* *of Exorcism*.
A text used by Catholic priests... ...as a guide to performing the exorcism rite.
"Yes, I think I actually fell asleep with the book in my hand."
What happened next?
"*I woke up, freezing. *"
*It was exactly 3 a. m.*
Three a. m. is the demonic witching hour.
It's a way for demons to mock the Holy Trinity.
"It's an inversion of 3 p. m., the miracle hour... ...which is traditionally accepted as the hour of Christ's death."
I thought I smelled something burning.
*Only later did I connect it... *
*... and I remembered that that same* *smell of something burning... *
*... had been perceived by Emily. *
"Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and..."
"Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our..."
At the hour of...
"What do you make of this gesture, this nod in your direction?"
I don't know.
"Some kind of acknowledgment, I guess."
That the game is on.
"You're really God's gunslinger, aren't you, Father?"
Standing tall and facing the devil with your prayer book at your side.
"Objection, Your Honor."
Counsel's harassing my witness.
Sustained.
"Mr. Thomas, you know I won't allow that in my courtroom."
"Forgive me, Your Honor."
"Father, did you understand this black-robed figure to be the devil?"
I believe it was a demonic manifestation.
Like the demonic force you believe possessed Emily?
- Yes.
"My lord, this isn't small issue."
That shop means everything to me.
My means of earning.
The only way to support my family.
And I built that shop with hard work.
"Now, it's just a piece of land."
And no one's ready to buy that as well.
"These people say,  "" Donate with faith.. """
""" ..and you'll never be wronged "" ."
"And the insurance people say  "" Pay your premiums on time.. """
""" ..we're there in your troubled times "" ."
I gave donations and also paid my premiums.
But none of them are willing to help me.
I am an ordinary human.
A middle-class man.
"My family, my wife and children.. ..will be forced to live on streets."
"No, my lord."
You'll have to give me a chance.. ..to defend my case in this court.
And the constituency of lndia gives me the right.. ..to voice my plea in this court.
"So please, my lord."
One crore is a big amount for a middle-class businessman.
"And especially, when it's a question of his survival."
"So, the court accepts Kanji Lalji Mehta's case."
Silence.
"And only after carefully examining.. ..all the evidences and arguments.. ..the court will give its verdict, whether.. ..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will get his compensation or not."
"And if he does, then who will pay him?"
"The insurance company or, the temple."
The court's adjourned for the day.
Wait.
Wait.
You can perform all the veneration you want.. ..and ring those bells as many times you wish.
Your God razed down my shop.
But you know - consumer resistance against factory farming is steadily growing due to the increasing awareness of the animal suffering that it entails.
And sometimes you come across people from an entirely different background who surprise you.
It was in America that I met a man who is known as the Mad Cowboy.
He was a factory farmer who got out of the livestock industry and went vegetarian around the time of the Mad Cow Disease crisis in Europe.
"Hi, nice to finally meet you."
Nice to see you're un-lost again.
"- Yeah, finally, we made it."
Welcome to my humble abode.
- Thank you.
It's nice and warm here.
This is on the farm.
"And this is one of the dogs we had, which was Sam."
Good critter.
That's the farm ...
"I'm a fourth generation farmer, rancher, feedlot operator from Montana."
"At one time I had 7000 head of cattle, 12,000 acres of crops and 30 employees."
I spent 45 years of my life in production agriculture.
Not something I learned from a book.
I learned it by doing it.
I was a factory farmer.
The worst of all.
"Not a family farmer, but a factory farmer."
Never met a chemical I didn't like.
We'd actually grind up animals and feed them back to our animals.
Had all of the bad habits ...
What are you doing here?
- Branding.
- Ughh.
See there.
I've branded hundreds of thousands of animals.
It's still allowed in America?
- Absolutely.
I sat freeze
I heard some poor guy standing near the candy machine got hit
"When I bite into a York peppermint Patty, I get shot"
"Okay, people, here is our problem."
The mayor was caught handing money to a known prostitute
You lost me my job
My lawyer says I have an open-and-shut case.
"See you in court, Sonny."
You cannot believe what I have been through tonight.
"I have spent the whole night, scouring the city, searching for the mayor"
"Hey, is that breakfast?"
There he is
Good morning people
"Alright, I'm sure we are all focused on the same problem, so let's get right down to it."
Mr Fluffy
"The children's zoo mascot, has recovered from mange..."
"And he's now available for petting, However, until he's completely out of the Woods, there is a 2-stroke maximum.**"
Mr Scruffy's speedy recovery is notwithstanding
"Mr Fluffy, Carter"
"I've seen him, Mike."
His fluffy days are way behind him
Don't we still* have that tiny problem of the photo of the mayor with the prostitute?
That's over with.
"I found the mayor, he's not with the prostitute last night. so our strategy in#### dealing with this is straight denial."
What do I say if somebody asks me about this
Tell theem you don't know anything.
But I don't.
But I don't know anything
Very good.
Hope you all learn from James
Learn what?
Will you stop showing off?
And she's ferried a couple airplanes.
From North Carolina to Oklahoma.
Stuff like that.
Just little pick up...
You can see her picture up there.
That's her with her uniform on and that's her next to it with the...
"Oh, yes I can see that."
130-something pounds and...
She likes it.
"She says, ""I go to work for my hobby."""
Runs in the family then.
Came right down from you
When did you meet De then and where?
In Grand Rapids.
A flight to Chicago.
I was doing some commercial bill collecting.
And they had some kind of convention went went to around St. Patrick's Day.
So the boss flew down.
There was a big headquarters where the western... area...
That was - I forget the initials now.
It was like a commercial version of...
We did credit reports on places.
They'd have a group - say all the plumbing and suppliers would meet once a month and they'd discuss and you'd keep building habits.
We had a part of our outfit would
liquidate - if a place would go bankrupt
We'd send our crew in to get them out of bankruptcy.
"I remember one guy, we made him sell his airplane"
His twin-engine airplane.
He had a hot secretary.
"He got rid of the secretary, got rid of the airplane and he lived in east Grand Rapids."
Gave him so much money for groceries and that was it.
With the stipulation he couldn't even go to the building for a year.
The people will find his name on the updated witness list... ...we provided to them this morning.
Very well.
I'll allow it into evidence.
Father Moore.
Will you play the tape for us now?
*This is the exorcism of Emily Rose. *
"*Those present are myself,* *Father Richard Moore... * ...Nathaniel, Emily's father... ...Jason, her friend... ...a doctor who is here to monitor Emily during the ritual... ...and Emily herself... ...who has given her permission for the ritual to be performed."
"All right, now listen."
You may say the rosary or any private prayer for her deliverance... ...when you're not responding to my words.
"Above all... ...do whatever I ask, without question."
Don't ask it any questions... ...or pay any attention to what it says.
"""It""?"
We won't be dealing with Emily tonight.
Restrain her.
"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us."
It has begun.
Let us pray.
"""Because she hopes in you, my God."""
"""Send her help from the holy place, Lord."""
"""And give her heavenly protection."""
"""May the Lord be with you."""
"""And with your spirit."""
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
My God.
Are you all right?
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
I'm fine.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation...
But deliver us from evil!
"Who are you, demon?"
Star Wars!
That's a great one.
What else?
Student:
Rand al'Thor.
Brandon:
"Ok, Rand."
"Or basically anyone on a ""Hero's Journey."""
Student:
Frodo.
Brandon:
"You know, I honestly don't think Frodo counts."
"I think Frodo stays as an everyman, and I think that's perfectly plausible."
Frodo stays as an everyman.
Aragorn stays as a superman.
In the movie they move Aragorn from here to here.
But in the books he basically starts here and stays there.
And it's fine to do that.
Any three of these archetypes can work.
I like to put up spiderman here.
"Because he basically fits the perfect archetype of the everyman who becomes superman, right?"
And that's why his story is so compelling.
That's why it works.
But there are plenty of stories that work with the superman straight off.
"And we're talking... in this we talk about power level, which is not always the same way it is."
"There are plenty of books that are about, you know, the young woman who is not socially adept who becomes super socially adept."
And this is the same sort of archetype.
Or stories that start off with somebody being perfectly socially adept.
"I mean, Oscar Wilde's characters are all basically social supermen, right?"
"And we like reading about them because we're like ""Wow, I wish I could come up with rhetoric that quickly in the middle of a conversation."
"I love this character."""
They're still going to have a growth arc.
"Now, I should just draw the"
"line, right, connecting those two points at -- that will give me the"
whole line.
"And if I've done this reasonably well,"
"I think it's going to happen to go through -- well,"
not happen -- it was arranged to go through that point.
"So I think that the second line is this one, and this is the"
all-important point that lies on both lines.
Shall we just check
"that that point which is the point x equal one and y was two,"
right?
"That's the point there and that, I believe, solves"
both equations.
Let's just check this.
"If x is one, I have a minus one plus four equals three,"
okay.
Apologies for drawing this picture that you've seen before.
"But this -- seeing the row picture -- first of all, for n equal 2,"
"two equations and two unknowns, it's the right place to start."
Okay.
So we've got the solution.
The point that lies on both lines.
Now can I come to the column picture?
"Pay attention,"
this is the key point.
So the column picture.
I'm now going to look at the columns of the matrix.
I'm going to look at this part and this part.
I'm going to say that
"the x part is really x times -- you see, I'm putting the two -- I'm"
kind of getting the two equations at once --
that part and then I have a y and in the first equation it's multiplying
Did you call to ask how much I got as priests fee?
Nothing.
The marriage was cancelled due to differences between.. ..the two parties.
We are returning in the same bus.
The boys people are at the back.. .. and the girls people on the right.
I and Shambu are suffering in between them.
Why should it not be cancelled?
It is a love marriage.
Is there any rule that lovers will never go apart?
They got separated due to a silly issue.
The groom has.. ..a temporary job but the girls side was told.. ..that it is a permanent job.
At this the girls father got angry and made the girl.. ..take the issue up with the groom in front of everyone.
At this the boys ego got hurt.
So it is an ego problem.
Because the girls side insulted them..
When did we insult them?
They only lowered our dignity.
As if they had any dignity.
"Hey priest, why should we talk with those people.. ..who do not have any status or capability?"
We are drinking scotch because we are capable.
The drinking during day time shows.. ..that theirs is a manner less family.
"You driver, stop the bus."
I will finish off this man.
Who are you to finish me?
"If I hit you, you will go sprawling."
What will you hit me?
If I take one more peg.. ..I will sleep on the seat myself.
We do not talk to idiots.
- But we are talking to idiots.
Do you mean that my teacher is an idiot?
It seems to be your opinion.
Not theirs.
Baby blue is so last year
"Thank god, I brought reinforcements, front color, top shelf"
"Okay, this is ugly, who would want to wear this"
Everybody after we do
"You know, I think I'm gonna go bare."
I'm gonna create a naked zen millenium kind of a look.
Genious.
Thank you
"Okay, check it out."
I spent all morning covering these things.
I was so exhausted goes like manual labor of it all.
Broken a nail.
I decided
"Nick, no way, my dad will kill me if he finds that I'm throwing a party"
He doesn't have to know.
He would be out of town.
He's always out of town Brooke
"The first party of the year creates the social Siberia, and I, for one, do not intend to be left out in the cold##"
"Besides, if you back, we will be wearing Monica knee-pads for the rest of the semester"
You're right
Of course I'm.
You're so right
Hi
"Hi, I'm here with Thomas"
Tom
So yh
Talk about your self and how long you have been breaking and how you finding it so far
I have been breaking for 3and a bit years so since October 2008 and
I first go into it at university and the first time I saw breakin was with bboy Diggity
He was our first coach he is a crazy guy neat moves and everything is good so yh good
How you finding the society and how has the society developed over the past few years
Bigger
It goes like this.
"Woo, woo, woo, you are my flower,"
I want to pick you and put you to my heart.
Kimho played a wonderful melody from the cultural revolution of Mao in China.
Behind me on the screen there was a big pictue with three people.
A pilot
A soldier
I don't remember his gesture.
And a girl with a red cap.
Forth question:
What must a somali businessman do to get his business running?
On the picture there was a sentence in three languages.
We must free Taiwan!
Fith question:
"What happend indeed, when someone migrates?"
During this time I concerned myself alot with Taiwan.
I watched lots of videos on youtube.
"One video shocked me, as I heard about it 30 years late."
"It was about a resistance fighter from Taiwan, who opted for absolute freedom of speech."
The government said: we will catch you.
He said: no you will catch my corpse.
70 days he barricaded in his office.
Then the police came to arrest him.
Shortly before that he burned himself.
Some minutes later the police entered and you saw a black burned corpse on the floor.
You couldn't recognise him.
He turned thin as bones.
His skin turned to scurf.
His arms were like this: fists towards the sky.
His 9 year old daughter was at his funeral.
She looked into the casket and didn't recognise that it is her father.
She cried and didn't understand why she should watch that.
"And now, a rockabilly guitar."
Which is nice.
"But what if I want to make, say, a -- (Applause) --"
Thanks.
"What if I want to make, say, a rock organ?"
Is that possible?
"Yes, it is, by recording myself like this."
(Organ sound)
"And now I have that, I have that recorded."
Assign it to a keyboard.
(Music)
So that's cool.
(Applause)
But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
"Impossible, you say."
No.
"It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine."
It's really fantastic.
Check it out.
(Music)
So every noise you can hear there is my voice.
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that.
There's no samples.
There's no synthesizers.
"That is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point?"
Why do this?
(Laughter)
"Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd,"
"I suppose, is the easy answer."
"But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist."
I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine.
"So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see."
Let's just make some funny tails.
Twist about two inch bubble at the end of each balloon.
And force the bubble to the very end of the flat tail.
Do it with all four balloons.
"I know, it does not look like a crane now."
Some silly sculpture... anyway.
We are going to improve it now.
We are going to use one more balloon to make the crane's arm.
Inflate a balloon.
I use a brown balloon
leaving about eight inch flat tail.
Oh!
I forgot to mention.
Not for this sculpture. but with regards to many other sculptures.
We can use technique desribed in this instruction to wrap balloon in balloons.
Now let's fix the crane's arm.
Just force the brown balloon through both sides of the cabin.
That is the simplest crane's arm.
"Again, we can make funny tail."
It will represent the hook.
Let's make this bubble up to one inch size.
This time I am going to tie a knot to secure the funny tail at the end of the balloon.
It is a necessary precaution.
Be course my young son will play with this crane.
As all we know all unlocked bubbles doomed to be deflated in hands of little kids.
Here I twist two small soft bubbles.
And lock all ends of those two bubbles in one lock twist.
"Actually,"
I twist one bubble.
Lock both ends and split the bubble on two bubbles.
"In anyways, it will look the same."
It looks ... ridiculous.
"Frank, let's go, please."
"Everybody's looking at me to make the quintessential Italian dish, so, yeah, I'm feeling the pressure."
I'm feeling that I need to bring it.
What have you got for us?
"Clam, artichoke, and blood orange."
"Pancetta, basil, toasted fennel seeds, and guajillo pepper."
I knew you guys were gonna be looking at me
"'cause I'm Italian, so I wanted to do something different and hopefully impress you."
"Well, it worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Bravo."
Good job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you so much.
Look at the texture in that.
"That's what I loven risotto, you know, being able &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to stir&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and find all the little goodies&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- hiddenn there.
- Yes.
"Um, Frank, you ain't playing around, dude."
"That's pretty good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Thanks, guys.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Frankie!"
[Applause]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Frank, the light bulb's on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"- That's it, baby. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All right, David, please."
"I need to start making a name for myself in this kitchen, or else I'm gonna go by the wayside, and I can't have that happen."
"In the veal stock risotto, I put portobellos and some oyster mushrooms, gooseberry-roasted poblano, and some scallops. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Making risotto and&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; using veal stock at the same time is a very dangerous game."
You nailed it.
Thank you.
Really good job.
This is one of the best things that I've tasted in a long time.
- Oh.
"Oh, my gosh."
- It's delicious.
"The poblano, the cook on the rice is perfect. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The layering of flavors.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Well done.
"- Oh, my God."
And then I jump up and say:
"""I won this award last year, but didn't say the most important thing."""
It should look like I just grabbed a mike.
"Then I say that... ...some people are glad that child- ren die, it saves the environment."
Others fall on their knees and say someone has to save the children.
"Some pray to a higher power, but most feel powerless and stare off into space."
They think only crazy optimists like Rosling think it's getting better.
In school we did a lot of variety shows.
I had good directors but they said that I couldn't act.
"""You're always yourself."
"You can't take direction and you can't act."""
So I became a stage manager.
-Were you disappointed?
"-Yes, but the criticism was right."
I have semi-controlled ADHD.
I can communicate and lecture but playing another person takes a different kind of skill.
You have to tape it well on my cheek.
This is totally awesome...
I've been waiting for this for five years.
- Can't you make it bigger?
- We can run it in widescreen.
The total projection was bigger a minute ago.
- We can stretch it sideways.
- Make it as big as possible.
- It's not even half the ceiling.
- That's because of the lens.
"Sure, but for the maximum effect it needs to be as big as possible."
Try widescreen.
"See that, Karin?"
"They said it worked, but it doesn't."
We're not using the whole ceiling.
You lose 90% of the effect.

Manish has developed ill intentions.
He wants to keep the 100 million worth of diamonds to himself.
Manish has turned a betrayer who we cannot trust anymore.
"I don't want Manish now, but those diamonds."
Go and search every corner of the city.
Beat him!
I don't want to hear anything.
If I don't get those diamonds. . .
I will bury you half in soil and blow up the other half with a bomb.
I want those diamonds worth 100 million.
Go and find Manish anyhow.
Is Lily home?
"- No, she has gone to Goa."
My name is Manish.
Ask her to call me when she returns.
"Look, don't forget, it is very urgent."
"Do make her call me, okay?"
When I lost my virginity
You walked in mid-lose
That was an honest mistake.
Mom you stayed and talked.
She seemed a bit confused.
"So, you swear I didn't cause you any big problems here at work?"
Here's the morning papers with a big picture*
I read those yesterday.
Thank you
"Mom, you didn't cause me any problem"
There is no reason that you should feel bad about any of this.
"I just want you to know, the last thing I thought would happen on### my visit that I'd wind up sleeping with the mayor of New York City"
Did we forget to knock
"No, they're not my family."
They're just friends
"I know, bad idea"
"Stuart, I don't feel well."
"Stuart, I don't feel well."
Knowing about Mike's mom and the mayor is killing me.
"James, secrets are power."
"You get something good like this, sit on it."
"Right now, you leak it, it just office gossip that makes everyone uncomfortable"
"But, in 20 years, when Mike's running for president, this little gem gets me an ambassadorship to Sweden."
What do I get?
Topless postcard from Sweden
We just connected
The mayor is really an amazing man.
He's smart.
"He's funny, he's sweet"
I guess it's uncomfortable talking to your mother about sex
"No, mom, I've been looking forward to this day"
"Before I give them the last digit of my card number to confirm this ill-conceived and nonrefundable mistake### of a vacation,"
Dr. Cartwright?
I recognize you from those courtroom drawings on the news.
You're much prettier in real life.

"- Yes, please."
You're losing.
I had hoped Father Moore wouldn't need me... ...but I don't wanna see him put away.
How do you know him?
"Well, I was his parishioner at St. Vincent's Church... ...about 15 years ago."
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years when he called me last fall.
"But he needed help, so..."
"What kind of help, doctor?"
"He wanted a medical perspective from a psychiatrist... ...you know, one that he knew, trusted... ...to observe Emily's physical and mental state during this..."
During the exorcism.
Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Can you help our case?
"That girl was not schizophrenic... ...and she was not epileptic, or any combination of the two."
I've seen hundreds of people with those problems.
"They can be terrible afflictions, of course, but they don't scare me."
"But what you saw that night in Emily, that did scare you."
"God, if I'd known, I never would've been there."
"I started praying again since then, you know."
I examined that girl before I drove back to the city that night.
She was lucid... ...and she was completely aware of this separate entity inside her.
"When she wasn't in his grip, she was totally herself, completely normal."
The awareness of her alternate mental state is counterindicative of psychosis.
Crazy people don't know they're crazy.
That's right.
"You'll testify to all of this, in detail?"
Everything you saw?
Tape?
Who dares to throw it here?
"Salute, sir."
Everyone has different problems... ...and different solutions too.
Your daughter wants proof and we want your statement.
And you want your daughter's life.
On the reverse side of this tape... ...you must record in your voice that I'm telling you now.
Listen to it carefully.
"Dear daughter Radha, because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, I'm forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Your father Shreekant.
"After recording it, you'll keep it behind the big door of Mahalaxmi."
"Mr. Shreekant, if you or police will try to play any trick... ...I'll send you half a piece of Radha's body."
It will never happen.
Why are you breaking the utensils?
When daughter's body will come home you can break my skull.
I'll die but not bend at an ordinary goon.
Then I'll have to bend.
"Aunt, please try and explain him."
This is the time we must think practically.
After all it's a question of Radha's life.
"Come, Uma!"
"Why, Uma?"
Come Uma.
"Radha, this is Damodar."
"Because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, we're forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Fine!
AB:
I'll talk to you later.
"In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier."
"Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649."
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
"And instead of squaring it this time,"
"I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number."
So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.
"How many digits do you have, six or seven?"
"Seven, and yours?"
Seven?
Seven?
"And, uncertain."
Seven.
Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have?
"Say ""No."""
(Laughter)
"Good, then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable."
"What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits, any six of them, in any order you'd like."
(Laughter)
"One digit at a time,"
I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.
"Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2."
AB:
Did you leave out the number 6?
"Good, OK, that's one."
"You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"4, 4, 8, 7, 5."
I think I only heard five numbers.
A function allows us to do that.
Expressions and statements don't do that because they just get done at 1 time when they're executed.
Functions allow us to package up computation that we want to do later.
"Hi,Lee"
"Sup,Vovan"
"Lee ,you're one eyed Pterodactyl"
And I was riding on you
And you're an goat
"So, what do you want from me"
I ...
I insulted you
And you should be upset
And I beat you!
LOL
I'm bad!
I came to one simple conclusion
Insults are only hints who is the offender and not much more
"Well, suppose if you analyze what Volodya said about me"
First.
I'm one eyed Pterodactyl...
"First of all.It's a obvious lie,and inconsistencies"
And as a our friend suggests us
I have two eyes and I'm a human
"Second of all,my system of values does not see anything wrong with one eyed Pterodactyls and even if it saw something wrong with it"
I I know anyway that I'm not a Pterodactyl
I think
It also refers to Volodya allegedly riding on me
Did not happen and that I'm am an goat
"I'm not a goat ,and there nothing wrong with goats"
"Put in Volodya sentence harsher words, witch you will not hear on our show"
But you can hear everyday in the neighborhood and nothing will change
"Insults are fantasy, fears and complexes of the offender all and nothing more"
"You are, you are in no condition to deal with this right now."

Faults are breaks in the Earth's crust where rocks move past one another in some way.
Typically faults are associated with earthquakes.
We've called faults 'boundaries' in class.
"We've talked about divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, but there are 2 types of common faults."
The first is a dip slip and the second kind is a strike slip.
Dip slips are in the top of the picture and this occurs when 2 pieces of land move vertically.
This leaves one of the pieces higher than the other.
A strike slip occurs when 2 pieces of land move horizontally.
Most of you would call this a transform boundary because the pieces of land move from side to side.
Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions.
Let's get started.
Let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much.
This should hopefully be a relatively easy question.
If I were to ask you what one fourth plus one fourth is.
Let's think about what that means.
Let's say we had a pie and it was divided into four pieces.
"So this is like saying this first one fourth right here,"
let me do it in a different color.
"This one fourth right here,"
A and the right-hand side is also a vector that I'll always call b.
So linear equations are A x equal b and the idea now is to solve this
particular example and then step back to see the bigger picture.
"Okay, what's the picture for this example, the Row picture?"
"Okay, so here comes the Row picture."
So that means I take one row at a
time and I'm drawing here the xy plane and I'm going to plot all the
points that satisfy that first equation.
So I'm looking at all the
points that satisfy 2x-y =0.
It's often good to start with which
"point on the horizontal line -- on this horizontal line,"
y is zero.
"The x axis has y as zero and that -- in this case,"
"actually, then x is zero."
"So the point, the origin --"
"the point with coordinates (0, ) is on the line."
It solves that
equation.
"Okay, tell me in -- well, I guess I have to tell you"
another point that solves this same equation.
"Let me suppose x is one,"
so I'll take x to be one.
"Then y should be two,"
right?
So there's the point one two that also solves this equation.
And I could put in more points.
"But, but let me put in all the"
"points at once, because they all lie on a straight"
line.
This is a linear equation and that word linear got the letters for
line in it.
If the mean beak width does significantly increase or decrease in size.
This is referred to as Directional Selection.
Then the environment allows the survival and reproduction of finches with bigger beak widths.
Let's say we know that the average beak width of all finches is 6.07 millimeters.
This includes finches that have been studied over the last few years.
But now let's say we're studying a sample of finches from today.
"We want to know, do finches today have beak widths that are different in size?"
"That means our null hypothesis is that, the population mean for finches today is equal to what they have been."
And what should the alternative hypothesis be?
"That mu is less than 6.07, greater than 6.07, or not equal to 6.07."
"Sir, what's the progress?"
The New West is on strike until the King agrees.
We're in the right.
The King can't ignore our petitions.
Not just the Southerners.
The majority of the ministers are with the New West.
They insist the King punish Prince Yuning.
What will you do?
Geum.
Mom.
We'll have him banished for this.
He won't threaten your crown again.
I'll see to that.
We're leaving.
As you say.
Your Grace.
The New West is applying pressure.
If they keep this up the King will have to accede.
Is something bothering you?
The Crown Prince knows everything.
What?
He knows what's wrong with him.
"Now I can see the suggested route to my destination, the length of the ride, and also the price estimate."
We've arrived.
I'm paying for the ride and I'm rating the driver.
I was very satisfied.
Done.
You can see how very easy all of this was.
"Instead of waiting, the driver got a job thanks to Liftago."
"As a passenger, I am happy with the service."
I didn't wait in vain and my order didn't depend on a single phone number or on a single transport company.
I chose the best driver around.
I was able to see his price in advance and his rating.
I knew who would pick me up and in what car.
"Actually, I didn't have any trouble at all."
"With Liftago, we're creating a free taxi market."
Hassle-free for passengers and hassle-free for taxi drivers.
"The better and more convenient service we provide, the more orders we get for Liftago drivers."
And that is our goal.
"Thanks to the skills of the whole community of marketers, we can create something truly great together."
"Just imagine that in a few years, we'll be as important for city transport as Google is right now with searching for information on the internet."
Good luck!

"Whatever happened to — ""agree to disagree?"""
Third-year Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke has become the face of the campaign for access to birth control coverage for women.
"""Without insurance coverage, contraception can cost as much as $3,000 dollars during law school. """
Both sides have been locked in a weeks-long battle over mandated birth control coverage.
"But on his radio show — Limbaugh took a personal shot at Fluke to make his point. ""essentially says she must be paid to have sex."
What does that make her?
"It makes her a slut, right?"""
And he didn't stop there.
"Thursday he said — if taxpayers have to foot the bill , then. ""we want something in return."
"And that is the videos of all the sex posted online so we can see."""
That got Limbaugh's critics fired up.
As an anchor for WFLD somewhat tentatively puts it.
"""Wow."
"You can um, imagine um, that sparked a lot of um, reaction and not very well, negative as you can imagine."""
"Now I don't know where that point is, frankly."
But --
linear algebra will find it.
The main point is that the three
"planes, because they're not parallel, they're not special."
They do meet in one point and that's the solution.
"But, maybe you can see that this row picture is getting a little hard to"
see.
The row picture was a cinch when we looked at two lines meeting.
"When we look at three planes meeting, it's not so clear and in"
four dimensions probably a little less clear.
"So, can I quit on the row picture?"
Or quit on the row picture before
I've successfully found the point where the three planes meet?
All I really want to see is that the row picture consists of three
"planes and, if everything works right,"
three planes meet in one point and that's a solution.
"Now, you can tell I prefer the column picture."
"Okay, so let me take the column picture."
That's x times --
"so there were two xs in the first equation minus one x is,"
and no xs in the third.
It's just the first column of that.
And how many ys are there?
"There's minus one in the first equations,"
two in the second and maybe minus three in the third.
Just the second column of my matrix.
And z times no zs minus one zs and
four zs.
"And it's those three columns,"
"right, that I have to combine to produce the right-hand side,"
which is zero minus one four.
I won't lose someone again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Young Master!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Did you lose something?
What are you looking for?
I thought I lost you!
Young Master!
What's wrong with you?
I...
I don't want to lose you.
Have you eliminated all of Choi Chul Joo's men?
Yes.
"When the prince said that he was going to the harbor,"
I thought he was going to attack the people holding the ship to let it sail.
But this is what happened.
Now we have no way to obtain explosives.
The prince eliminated Choi Chul Joo so that we would not be implicated.
The police have finally reached the harbor.
Now we must give the Interior Minister a sufficient explanation for this.
"Choi Chul Joo used explosives to set sail, but the ship's owner Yongmun eliminated him."
"In the ensuing fight, all of his men were killed."
All of the men involved directly are now dead.
It is now impossible to identify the origin of the explosives.
Why did Yongmun kill the men with the explosives?
We were investigating explosives traders as you instructed us.
"As a result, we found Choi Chul Joo."
He had borrowed a ship from us to go to China.
Everyone is dead!
We cannot find out the source of the explosives!
We had no choice.
They had used explosives from our ship.
"If they had escaped to China, would you not have suspected us instead?"
"In addition, we did it to save lives."
We risked our lives to save the poor girls who were going to be sold in China.
They've succeeded - despite crowded areas and problems with hygiene.
Everyone has missed that because it happened slowly.
Journalists miss it.
You don't see things that go slowly.
It can pass through the studio unnoticed because it moves so little.
This is a 1967 issue of the Uppsala newspaper.
A slum was being torn down in central Uppsala.
Behind that window my mother grew up.
"It was called ""unplanned workers' quarters""."
"Gran lived there, so I've sat at that window eating soup."
She had an inner window and an outdoor toilet.
She moved in the late 1950s.
This is Grandma on the steps.
The picture was taken in the 1920s.
Grandma was born in 1891... ...when Sweden was somewhere between Uganda and Ghana.
Here she is on the steps.
She's actually showing her hair.
Otherwise she always wore a kerchief when she left the garden.
"Mom had tuberculosis and was quite ill, so I was a very longed-for child."
Which I realized later.
"When I was born, people questioned whether she should look after me."
When I was four she had another bout and I stayed with Gran.
But by then streptomycin had come.
"It came in 1949, when I was one."
It cured the disease.
Previously you were consumptive.
"Once a consumptive, always a consumptive."
I remember from Mom that it was very shameful to have tuberculosis.
Robert is in charge of the lighting.
"It shouldn't be a ""Welcome to this year's knowledge gala."""
The reception is upstairs.
"Then we go downstairs, Princess Victoria comes and the kids sing."
She never eats.
Never drinks.
Never goes to the toilet.
"The female polar bear is number 6 because she sleeps for over three months,"
living off her fat reserves.
She not only survives the winter-- but creates two new lives.
The young bears learn their survival skills from mother.
"How to keep warm, what to eat, where to walk."
They must learn fast-- or freeze solid-- just like the animal sliding into number 5.
Only one frog in the world is found north of the Arctic Circle.
The wood frog.
It has to survive the northern winter.
The frog is cold blooded.
"So when the ground freezes, so does the frog."
Cold's not the problem.
It's the ice.
The crystals expand like daggers.
"For most animals, freezing means certain death."
But not this frog.
The first ice crystal forming on its skin sets off a chain reaction.
The cells prepare by filling with glucose-- a natural antifreeze.
The fluid between the cells contains proteins that attract ice-- quickly forming crystals small enough to prevent injury.
Blood freezes in veins.
And the ice races towards the heart.
"In 20 hours, the frog is frozen."
70% of the water in its body is ice.
There's no breathing.
No heartbeat.
The wood frog is number 5 because it survives the winter in suspended animation.
Essentially there's no frog here at all.
"It's just a collection of individual cells, suspended in ice, struggling to stay alive."
The frog spends months locked inside its frozen time capsule.
Why not using it ?
"For too long, we are the laughing stock of Horizon 1.0."
We have an opportunity to regain our dignity.
We can't control it !
"Artheon is right, we can't use it !"
We have to sale it at the auction house.
"No, the cheated staff must be destroyed."
"Bandaid, delete it !"
"No, I don't want to."
It'll be a waste !
Imagine how much we could earn if...
"Delete it, if not I will kick you out from the guild !"
"Ho, dictator, tyrant, fascist, communist !"
OK...
But it's really not fair at all...
"Obviously, this cheated staff is indestructible."
"I'm the only one who can destroy it, or a game master, maybe."
"But for that, he will have to delete the avatar of the owner with it."
On no.
"The staff cannot be destroyed, by any craft we here posses."
"So let's sale it, it's the only solution."
Let us use it !
"With it, even Bandaid will be usefull."
"I say it again, this item is a gift."
We have one solution left.
"We have to bring it into the Vulca earth, and throw it into the endless abyss fault of the Arks."
What ?
This zone is only available from the level 45.
Every player falling into the Arks fault will for ever lose one of his items.
It's the biggest penalty in the game.
We just have to throw in Bandaid until his cheated staff disapears.
"No, this is crap, in that case, we can call a game master right now !"
You may see on the right side
"Casentino and Murlo, two small villages, once Etruscan settlements, closer to South West Asia than to Europe, while in Volterra this ancient signal is now too diluted to be detected."
"Human and bovine mitochondrial DNAs indicate that Etruscans and bovines docked to Tuscany, sailing from S-W Asia."
This also confirms how the Italian wisdom
"""take wife and cattle from your homeplace"" is now totally implemented."
"Since domestication, animals always accompanied humans during migrations, wars and conquers."
"They have been silent witness of human history, but until recently they have been impossible to query."
"Now, thanks to DNA analysis, they can tell us their story."
Thanks for your attention.

"Both - Martin Luther King, a baptist pastor -"
"- and Ku Klux Klan, movement led by white people, protestants in the USA. -"
"And so, you will find the catholic church, with a moral, well, it is a conservative society."
"Like, the prohibition of marriage to the priest."
To forbid the use of condoms.
"And you might find too the episcopal church, in the USA, the anglican church in the USA, that allows gays pastors."
They live in union with those pastors.
There are specific denominations for homosexuals.
Like a contemporary church in Rio.
A few brothers here have heard of that church.
There is the metropolitan church too.
Those are communities to the homosexuals.
You might find people with totally different opinions.
There is no way you can join them.
As an example:
Obama and Bush.
Both are christians.
Obama was a member of the United Church of Christ.
A tradicional denomination in the USA.
I don't know if until today.
"Spiritualistic, catholics, protestants, mormons, Yehovah-witnesses, all of them declares themselves christians."
And there are many other groups!
"But...Well, everybody seems to be christian, huh?"
"So, depending on what christian is, in the head of a person,"
Jesus really doesn't want christians.
What christian means?
What the word christian is?
"If you search for the origin of that word, it arises in the city of Antioch."
"Before that, the church of Jerusalem, the church of Judea, was serving the Lord."
Then came the persecution.
"They had to flee and establish in Antioch, Syria."
"And there, it was the first time the disciples were called ""christians""."
You broughtthe right decision.
"Thank you,Mr. Prosecutors."
He's getting away!

See?
The murderer is caught.
He confessed everything.
Read it and maybe you'll realize how unfairly you treated me.
Ferhat killed the man's son.
And he waited for the right time to get revenge.
It was the defendant.
Counselor.
Ethan Thomas calls himself a man of faith.
"I, on the other hand, am a woman of doubt."
Angels and demons.
God and the devil.
"These things either exist, or they do not exist."
Are we all alone in this life?
Or are we not alone?
Either thought is astonishing.
Do I really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
"To be honest, I don't know."
But I cannot deny that it's possible.
The prosecution wants you to believe... ...that Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder was a fact... ...because facts leave no room for reasonable doubt.
But this trial isn't about facts.
This trial is about possibilities.
Is it a fact that Emily was a hypersensitive... ...as Dr. Adani suggests?
"A person who's more likely, by her very nature, to become possessed?"
"I can't say that, but the question is:"
Is it possible?
Is it a fact that Gambutrol anesthetized Emily's brain... ...so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
I can't be sure of that.
But is it possible?
Is it a fact that Emily was beloved by God?
"And that after her exorcism, she chose to suffer till the end... ...so that we might believe in a more magical world?"
A world where the spiritual realm really exists?
I can't say that's a fact.
But ask yourself:
Is it possible?
It's what Emily believed.
It's what Father Moore believed.
And that sincere belief is what determined her choices and his.
"Oh, by the way, the Louvre was doing them too."
"Programs are now available, they are on art."
The history of art.
There's a group called Art Education for the Blind.
New York.
"They produce twenty volume set, with great photos in it."
Art history for the blind.
Cave art to the present.
It's spectacular.
A lot of people are getting hehind this evidence.
"This is not a practice or a fashion, this is evidence that this stuff works."
"And when you build a practice, a program on top of that to suit whatever needs you have."
Why do this?
"Well the evidence shows, raised line pictures can be used by the blind."
When they are drawing objects they show the shapes of objects.
The very thing you see.
And they have different levels of sophistication in their drawings.
Especially if they have only recently gone blind.
A child and an adult.
And I think
"Eriko and Esref's perspective and metaphor drawings are kind of ""firsts"" in art history."
"We had no idea, 20 years ago that any of this was possible."
And it's just spectacular that it is possible.
Thank you very much.

Constance:
So we have time for a few questions for Dr. Kennedy.
"Does anybody have anything they would like to actually comment on, based on what he said, or questions for him?"
"Anything you would like for clarification, possibility for your museum."
"Speak loudly, if you don't mind."
"I'll ask you to say your name, your organization and then ask your question."
And if you could stand up.
I'm gravely concerned that it might become public works project involving concessions.
We don't have the luxury to spare a single second considering the financial condition of the Japanese government.
We must figure out how we really do the decontamination work.
"What on earth is the Diet doing, when 70,000 people are forced out of their homes and wandering?"
That's all.

"You want to know why, well, let's start from the beginning"
I've come to set the record straight
I've come to set the record straight
From scientific propagation of the species
"To poets and philosophers, your Baudelaires and Nietzsches"
I've come to set the record straight
I've come to set the record straight
But if you're asking for specifics
Well this isn't hieroglyphics
If you want to know sincerely
"Listen up, I'll tell you clearly"
What I like about you is...
Candace:
"So, you were saying...?"
Jeremy:
"Oh, yeah:"
I've come to set the record straight
I see you still don't get it
But you really shouldn't sweat it
I'll say one more time with feeling
Here's the reason you're appealing
What I like about you is...
What I like about you is...
What I like about you is...
I wanted to take a year of your life to give back to a positive cause in a real world setting.
columns.
So I know how to get that one.
So what's the solution?
What combination will work?
I just want one of these and none of these.
"So x should be zero, y should be zero and z should be one."
That's the combination.
One of those is obviously the right
one.
Column three is actually the same as b in this particular problem.
"I made it work that way just so we would get an answer,"
"(0,0,1), so somehow that's the point where those three planes met and I"
couldn't see it before.
"Of course, I won't always be able"
"to see it from the column picture, either."
"It's the next lecture,"
"actually, which is about elimination,"
"which is the systematic way that everybody -- every bit of software,"
"too -- production, large-scale software would solve the equations."
So the lecture that's coming up.
"If I was to add that to the syilabus,"
"will be about how to find x, y, z in all cases."
"Can I just think again, though, about the big picture?"
By the big picture I mean let's keep this same matrix on the left
but imagine that we have a different right-hand side.
"Oh, let me take a different right-hand side."
So I'll change that right-hand side to something that actually is also
pretty special.
Let me change it to --
"if I add those first two columns, that would give me a one and a one"
and a minus three.
There's a very special right-hand
Upon recognizing her condition... ...I would have tranquilized her and force-fed her.
"And then, if necessary... ...I would've treated her with electroconvulsive therapy."
Electroshock treatment.
You would've done this against her will?
To save her life?
Absolutely.
Nothing further.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, I offer into evidence this photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A."
"And having done so, the people rest."
The photograph is entered into evidence.
"We are recessed until tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp... ...at which time the defense will give its opening statement... ...and call its first witness."
I'm sorry I was late.
I didn't get a lot of sleep.
Big power outage knocked out my alarm clock.
- It won't happen again.
"- No, I didn't sleep either."
What kept you awake?
Doesn't matter.
You're under attack.
What are you talking about?
"You're in a spiritual battle, Erin."
The forces of darkness are trying to keep you away from the light.
Don't let them.
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.
We're getting creamed.
I can't believe I walked right into that.
"Look, if we don't find a doctor to testify that Emily... ...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose."
Care of the city's main branch and the university library... ...I bring you another dozen fun-filled books... ...about the demonic and the mentally deranged.
They burned women at the stake... ...during witch hunts for being possessed.
Glad you don't have to defend those guys.
But this is the only rivet that we found between this lentoid and the previous lentoid that was cleaned.
And you can see that the rivet is resting on top of a small silver divider and that's something that is a feature that is also present on the previous lentoid.
And I am right in thinking - you were telling me at the other side you can actually see the holes where these pins may have been?
You can.
So if I pan over the central gold foil...
You can see that there are two large rivet holes present on this side as well.
And one small rivet hole sort of tucked in the corner
looks like maybe they made a mistake!
So what are we looking at here Ellen?
You can see here the clean garnets and some of them are quite lovely and you can still see the inter play of light with the backing foils showing through.
And I'm presently working on writing up a little blog for the website about this treatment so that you can see the before and after of images.
hey guys how are y'all doing
"I was hanging out with a friend yesterday and he said something that ""REALLY"" hurt me!"
(Yesterday)
"Me:Hey man, you should go talk to her."
My friend:
No!
Me:
"You, go."
My friend:
No
Me:
"Just go, don't be scared My friend:"
Noooooo
Me:
Why not?
(A:Don't know what's going on) (B:Yeah)
My friend:
Cuz she is white
What?
Are you racist or something?
She is WHlTE.
"We'll just have to take your word, won't we?"
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.
I apologize.
"Father, as Emily's parish priest... ...are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?"
Yes.
Yes.
Her family is very devout.
"And in that training, did she study Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?"
"Yes, I think that's right."
"Might have even studied Aramaic, Christ and his disciples' language... ...which, according to the transcripts, we also heard on the tape, correct?"
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.
But it was offered as an elective at her catechism school.
I have the school's curriculum here if you'd like to see it.
No.
I'll accept that she might have been exposed to that language.
"And according to her high school records... ...German was the foreign language she studied there, yes?"
I don't know.
If you say so.
"So that covers the strange languages we heard on the tape, correct?"
Did I miss any?
- No.
- Good.
We've already established you're no medical expert.
You said it's not your field.
But are you aware of the dual sets of vocal cords every human possesses?
- No.
"- Have you heard of... ...the superior vocal cords, which are higher than the ones we use to speak?"
No.
"So you didn't know that Tibetan monks, for example... ...as part of their religious training, teach themselves... ...to activate both sets of vocal cords at once?"
"No, I didn't know that."
"You're not safe either. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your dish was confused,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bizarre.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's almost like you're trying&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to outsmart your competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"You can bamboozle every amateur &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;behind you, but you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;cannot bamboozle us three,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
let me tell you.
"Sorry, chef."
I just didn't...
This is my first time cooking a risotto. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Stay there.
Based on that risotto...
The person leaving is...
Dave Mack.
Ohh. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your time is done&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please bring your apron&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on your station&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and leave the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
Thank you.
"Thank you, chef."
"I'm disappointed, but, at the same time,"
I'm glad I got to compete at this level.
The judges did make a mistake by sending me home.
I have a lot of creativity.
Thank you very much.
What can you say?
"You know, hope for the best, plan for the worst."
Tali.
"You have dodged that bullet, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but, Tali, you are flying&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by the seat of your pants.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Back on your station. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Whew!
That's the sigh of relief.
"I dodged the biggest bullet of my life, and..."
I don't want to be in that position again.

CANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[music starts]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the quay
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli
How well I remember that terrible day
When the blood stained the sand and the water
When how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
"Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well"
"He showered us with bullets, and he rained us with shells"
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury our slain
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
And it started all over again
"Now those who were living, did their best to survive"
"In that mad world of death, blood and fire"
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive
combination words?
"So in linear combination words,"
do the linear combinations of the columns fill three dimensional space?
Every b means all the bs in three dimensional space.
Do you see that I'm just asking the same question in different words?
Solving A x -- A x -- that's very important.
"A times x -- when I multiply a matrix by a vector,"
I get a combination of the columns.
I'll write that down in a moment.
"But in my column picture, that's really what I'm doing."
I'm taking linear combinations of these three columns and I'm trying
to find b.
"And, actually, the answer for this matrix"
will be yes.
"For this matrix A -- for these columns, the answer is yes."
This matrix -- that I chose for an example is a good matrix.
A non-singular matrix.
An invertible matrix.
Those will be the matrices that we like best.
There could be other --
"and we will see other matrices where the answer becomes,"
"no -- oh, actually, you can see when it would become no."
What could go wrong?
How could it go wrong that out of these --
out of three columns and all their combinations --
when would I not be able to produce some b off here?
When could it go wrong?
Do you see that the combinations --
let me say when it goes wrong.
If these three columns all lie in
"the same plane, then their combinations will lie in"
that same plane.
planes inside nine-dimensional space that we have to work with eventually.
"For now, let's stay with a nice case where the matrices work,"
we can get every right-hand side b and here we see how to
do it with columns.
Okay.
There was one step which I
realized I was saying in words that I now want to write in letters.
"Because I'm coming back to the matrix form of the equation,"
so let me write it here.
"The matrix form of my equation,"
of my system is some matrix A times some vector x equals some right-hand
side b.
Okay.
So this is a multiplication.
A times x.
"Matrix times vector, and I just want to say how do you"
multiply a matrix by a vector?
"Okay, so I'm just going to create a"
matrix -- let me take two five one three --
"and let me take a vector x to be, say, 1and 2."
How do I multiply a
matrix by a vector?
But just think a little bit about
matrix notation and how to do that in multiplication.
So let me say how I multiply a matrix by a vector.
"Actually, there are two ways to do it."
Let me tell you my favorite way.
It's columns again.
It's a column at a time.
"For me, this matrix multiplication says I take one of that column and"
two of that column and add.
So this is the way I would think of
"Yeah, that's the way I do it, [laughter] it seems to work fairly reliably."
[Coordinator]
"Um, there's a, hang ...There's another question from the phone."
Go ahead.
[indecipherable question]
[Coordinator]
So let me start with that.
"So if you're in a meeting and you're taking notes, ... and you either have voice over off and your headphones on...okay continue with the question."
[Teleconference caller]
That's my question.
[Coordinator]
"That, So your question is, ""When you're in a meeting taking notes, which option do you use""?"
"Or, do you need voice over off when you have your headphones on?"
Do you guys understand the question?
[Panelist]
You definitely need voice over on.
Voice over will work fine with head phones.
[lower tone]
I think that's what she was asking?
[Coordinator]
So Is your quest....is the answer you have voice over on when you have headphones on the answer to your question?
long pause.....[teleconference caller]
"Uh...Yeah, I guess it is."
[undecipherable conversation between two teleconference callers]
You would have to wear your headset otherwise [undecipherable]
[Coordinator]
"If I understand the question correctly, as a Skype user, ah, in setting up whether or not you're going to use the computer's built-in microphone and speaker ah, that is an option that needs to be selected."
"If you're going to use a headset, look forward to the option of listening through the computer speaker the headset speaker, and speaking into the mic."
Does that answer your question?
[Teleconference caller]
Yes.
[Phone coordinator]
"Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,"
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
NT:
"To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility."
MT:
"And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination, he would build them in his workshop."
NT:
"I needed no models, drawings or experiments."
"I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it."
Only then do I construct it.
MT:
His great idea was alternating current.
But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?
"To sell his idea, he became a showman."
NT:
"We are at the dawn of a new age, the age of electricity."
"I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether."
It is the magic of science.
(Applause)
"Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics."
He even photographed the bones of the human body.
"But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream: harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls, and bringing light to the city."
But Tesla's success didn't last.
NT:
I had bigger ideas.
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.
"A world telegraphy center -- imagine news, messages, sounds, images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly."
MT:
It's a great idea; it was a huge project.
"Expensive, too."
NT:
They wouldn't give me the money.
My eyes lit up.
"There was molecular powders,"
"Xanthan gum, tapioca maltodextrin, sodium alginate..."
Pretty much everything you need to make awesome risotto.
"(Scott) Risotto, it doesn't have to be fancy."
"You can't really use cayenne and a blast of this or a blast of that, you know, to really mask some of the subtle errors that you might be making."
Some kind of shellfish.
Either clams or scallops or mussels or shrimp.
Everyone else can see what's in the pantry.
I can only really cook with ingredients I know about.
Innovation is going to be a big challenge for me.
Wow.
"Some half-full baskets. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Some full baskets.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you were out there&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;right now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what kind of risotto would you be doing? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Something super simple.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One ingredient.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;all the way through,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you have to season&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the onions when they go in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You have to toast the rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;add the wine,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;burn the alcohol out,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more salt, make sure&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;your stock is seasoned.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I mean, there's a lot of balance here."
Mm-hmm.
You cannot rush a risotto.
"Okay, Frank, how's your rice coming?"
"So far, so good."
What would your family think if you get sent home on a risotto?
My dad would definitely break my balls.
Dave Mack.
"Yes, sir."
Flavor.
What are you doing?
"I got some white wine, butter."
I got the morels.
I know those have a nice flavor to 'em.
- Good luck.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Felix, how you feel up there?"
Good.

"From page 168 to 169,"
Jesus's character says:
"""Those who love me"""
"""are in all existing systems."""
"""They are buddhists or mormons,"""
"""baptists or muslims,"""
"""democrats and republicans,"""
"""and others that don't vote and"""
"""are not part of any religious institution."""

"""But I want to join them in their process"""
"""to transform into sons and daughters of Dad."""
"""Into brothers and sisters, into my beloved."""
"These are the words of Jesus, of his character, the main character of the book."
It is an interesting sentence.
"Indeed, says that Jesus can be anywhere."
Any system.
But what called my attention was the affirmation:
"""I do not want you to become christians."""
"And, depending on what christian is, the word ""christian"" in each person's mind can have different meanings."
"And, depending on what christian is,"
Jesus doesn't want us to become christians.
"So you can understand this, about the designation ""christian"", the word ""christian"", you will find people with completely different ideas."
Antagonistic.
"You will find Ku Klux Klan, who were protestant christians. and Martin Luther King."

Welcome to the Simulation Center at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
"My name is Marissa Carrillo, the simulation technician providing your tour."
"The simulation center is currently located on University of Alaska Anchorage campus, in the School of Nursing."
We have two high-fidelity simulation rooms with one control room.
Each patient room is equipped with medical supplies and enhanced with features that may be found in a hospital room to practice care of patients.
This is our adult human patient simulator or adult simulation mannequin.
Can you see the chest rise or did you notice his blinking?
"I can listen to heart, lung, and bowel sounds."
"I can check his carotid, brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses too!"
What are the more exciting capabilities?
"Interventions such as CPR, defibrillation, IVs, intubation, and urinary catheterization may also be performed on the mannequin."
"(""Go Away"") Oh, and he can speak too."
Sounds like now is the time that we should visit the SimBaby.

So then we're in trouble.
If the three columns of my matrix -- if those three vectors happen to lie
"in the same plane -- for example, if column three is just the sum of"
"column one and column two, I would be in trouble."
That would
"be a matrix A where the answer would be no, because the combinations --"
"if column three is in the same plane as column one and two,"
I don't get anything new from that.
All the combinations are in the
plane and only right-hand sides b that I could get would be the ones
in that plane.
So I could solve it for some
"right-hand sides, when b is in the plane,"
but most right-hand sides would be out of the plane and unreachable.
So that would be a singular case.
The matrix would be not invertible.
There would not be a solution for every b.
The answer would become no
for that.
Okay.
I don't know -- shall we take just
a little shot at thinking about nine dimensions?
Imagine that we have
vectors with nine components.
"Well, it's going to be hard to"
visualize those.
I don't pretend to do it.
"But somehow, pretend you do."
Pretend we have -- if this was nine
"equations and nine unknowns, then we would have nine columns,"
and each one would be a vector in nine-dimensional space and we would
be looking at their linear combinations.

"Pick for me from your hair, a quaff"
That coats me
My whole poem and words aren't sufficient for you
Your depiction needs special language
Spun from my blood
With my last call from my mouth
With my dream paste
Guarded with my pall
And the dialect of your depiction
Come out in one word
"O girl, gypsy girl"

It was my mother's death that stopped me from traveling
I miss her very much
I failed to write something about you.
Thanks
So Ghost Ship.
Now Ghost Ship is a movie that gets better with every subsequent viewing and one thing about a Val Lewton film is it's generally very short.
"So you could watch this thing a couple times in a day, and start to really unpack its poetry."
"The sur, surface story of the film is quite simple."
"You have a young officer who comes on board a boat, finds that the senior officer is crazy."
"The senior officer tries to kill the young officer, and the senior officer dies instead."
"In fact, it's a story that's so thin, Frank Borzage might like it."
"Well, now that you do know, would you think it's possible... ...that Emily, in her psychotic state... ...might have activated both sets of vocal cords... ...so as to achieve the amazing effect we heard captured on your audiotape?"
Her state was not psychotic.
"Father Moore, you told us that in the exorcism we heard... ...you actually saw, once again, this black-robed figure... ...or demonic apparition, am I right?"
- Yes.
"But we couldn't see him when you played the tape, correct?"
"- No, of course not."
- Of course not.
"So that would be another supernatural aspect of the exorcism... ...your tape doesn't prove, correct?"
- Yes.
"Where is your dark figure, Father?"
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.
I have nothing further.
Does the defense wish to redirect?
"No, Your Honor, but we reserve the right to recall the witness later."
Very well.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, my next witness must have been detained."
If we could take a short recess so I could...
"You've made this court wait before, counselor."
I'm inclined to...
"Your Honor, please."
Dr. Cartwright came to us in good conscience... ...as an eyewitness to the exorcism on Father Moore's tape.
He can substantiate all of my client's testimony...
"Your Honor, the defense has already presented its exorcism testimony... ...in dramatic fashion."
Do we really have to..?
We have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.
I think we'll take some time to consider it.
Court is adjourned until 9:30 tomorrow morning.
- You can't find him?
If there is a need of timely vaccination then that's going to be picked up and provided by the respective government programs.

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
"Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won"
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care
"You touched my heart, you touched my soul"
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
"I know you well, I know your smell"
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer but when I wake

MONEY!
"And different currencies are as Catholic and Christian religions, Protestantism, Buddhism, Judaism"
Literally money as your god.
"We all believe in them, they are the source of everything and may occasionally perform miracles."
"And this God has his disciples, sacred millionaires ... .."
Which you so enthusiastically studying.
Here also you do systematic rituals of divine society getting the envelope with piece of the sacred body
"And ask anyone, just for fun .."
"""How much money you get?"""
They gonna shit their pants as if you ask for confession
And what's the story with this banknotes?
They are the holy icons.
"You are looking at them and for you they are not just paper and ink, no ..."
For you are the body of your god
"Which arise in a sacred place, which can't access any common mortal."
"And these sacred scraps of paper fall into the hands of people and then tired, wrinkled and dirty .. ..."
"Burn in the incinerator to be reborn again, like the phoenix"
To do their earth's path.
We all touching them.
Take out your wallet.
Can you imagine the path each banknote have done? ...
To get your hands.
Who was the first who rinkle that?
Where they are going?
"One with syphilis, a prostitute, a prime minister and you ... ..."
Wiping with the same piece of paper.
People c'mon.... wake up ..
Circulation of money used to give money your power
Since the value of money means your work
And without it money do not cost anything.
She said that Father Moore had suggested she stop taking the drug.
"And what, in your medical opinion... ...was the result of Father Moore's suggestion?"
I believe Father Moore's suggestion killed her.
"Objection, Your Honor!"
The witness is asserting outrageous conclusions based on pure hearsay.
"Technically correct, but I'll allow it as part of his expert opinion testimony."
"Thank you, Dr. Mueller."
Your witness.
You said you observed a possible epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
Doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
"Yes, that's also possible."
"Would Father Moore's advice to stop taking Gambutrol be good advice... ...if Emily were, in fact, not epileptic?"
Of course.
But that's not the case here.
She was epileptic.
Really.
When Emily saw objects move on their own... ...and felt an invisible presence on top of her... ...was she experiencing symptoms typical of epilepsy?
"Not typical, no."
Are they typical indications of any other conditions?
"- Say, for example, psychosis?"
"- Yes, I would say that's correct."
But isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
"- Yes, in my..."
- So aren't you selectively choosing... ...what parts of Emily's experiences fit your epilepsy diagnosis... ...while ignoring those which indicate something else?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.
No further questions.
We have to work fast.
They're only giving me an hour with you tonight.
Listen.
"Before we get started, there's something I have to tell you... ...something I should've said to you before I let you take the case."
But the corpses around me piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit
And when I awoke in my hospital bed
"And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was dead"
Never knew there were worse things than dying
And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda
To the green bushes so far and near
"For to hang tent and pegs, a man needs two legs"
No more waltzing Matilda for me [instrumental]
"So they collected the cripples, the wounded, the maimed"
And they shipped us back home to Australia
"The legless, the armless, the blind, and insane"
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As they carried us down the gangway
"But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared"
Then they turned their faces away
And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
"And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march"
Reliving the dreams of past glory
And I see the old men all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war
"And the young people ask me, ""What are they marching for?"""
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
*... and sometimes extreme paranoia. *
*The seizures may lock up the joints* *and slightly contort the body. *
"*The pupils will dilate,* *making the eyes appear black. *"
So you believe that Emily had epilepsy... ...which developed into a form of violent psychosis... ...a condition that can be controlled with Gambutrol?
Yes.
"And it would've been, if she'd continued her treatment."
"In your opinion, if Emily had continued with her medication... ...would she be alive today?"
- Absolutely.
"If treated early, psychotic epileptic disorder is rarely fatal."
"I mean, this..."
This was a very sick girl.
The defendant should've realized that Emily was in need... ...of continued medical treatment.
"Thank you, doctor."
Your witness.
"Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol could've controlled Emily's condition."
How do you know that?
It's the inevitable result of taking the drug.
It would've controlled her seizures... ...which were the root cause of her psychosis.
But wasn't Emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms... ...even after she started taking the medication?
Yes.
Because Gambutrol has a cumulative effect.
It takes time to build up in the system.
"You assume that Gambutrol would've helped her, but you don't know."
"It's a reasonable assumption, but..."
"No, of course, I can't be certain."
"Doctor, is ""psychotic epileptic disorder"" a common medical term... ...or did you just make it up?"
"Well, I distinguished and named the..."
So psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Sustained.
When Emily chose to stop her medical treatment... ...what do you think should've been done?
I'm staring out the window
Wonder where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour
Across every ocean
For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
Across every ocean
For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion
I'm crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion

The module on responsiveness by saying that the worst thing about going to the doctor is waiting.
I think I was wrong with that saying.
I think that the worst thing that can happen to a patient in a care process is to experience a quality problem.

Dimensional analysis
"Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis."
"Any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide ""miles"" by ""gallons"", which gives the unit ""miles/gallon"" or ""miles per gallon"". The final answer is ""25 miles per gallon""."
"Looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters, use the equation ""1609.34 meters equals one mile"" or 1609.34 meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles × meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters."

Battle of Guam (1944)
"The Second Battle of Guam (July 21 — August 10, 1944) was the capture of Guam by the United States from Japanese control. Guam was a U.S. territory (in the Mariana Islands). The battle was during the Pacific campaign of World War II."
Background.
Guam is the largest island of the Marianas. It is 30 miles (48 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) wide. It had been a United States island since its capture from Spain in 1898.
"It was captured by the Japanese on December 10, 1941. This was after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. It was not as fortified as the other Mariana Islands, such as Saipan."
The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas was for heavy bombing by planes and then bombing by battleships.
"Guam was chosen as a target because it was big enough to be a base for the next attacks on the Philippines, Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. The harbor at Apra could take the largest ships. The two airfields were big enough for B-29 Superfortress bombers."
"The invasion of Saipan was planned for June 15, 1944, with landings on Guam planned for June 18."
A large Japanese carrier attack and heavy fighting in Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being delayed for a month.
Battle.
"Guam is surrounded by reefs, cliffs, and heavy waves. This makes Guam hard to attack."
"On July 21, the Americans landed on both sides on the western side of Guam. The 3rd Marine Division landed at 08:28. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Ships. The Americans had many dead and wounded."
By 09:00 men and tanks were on both beaches. The 77th Infantry Division had to walk through the shallow water. Japanese guns fired at them.
"By nightfall the Americans controlled the beachs about 2,000 meters deep. Japanese attacks were made throughout the first few days."
"Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on July 28, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the defenders."
Supply was very difficult for the Americans in the first days of the battle.
"The attacks against the American beaches, as well as the violent fighting, had tired out the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a few tanks left."
Obata moved to the mountainous central and northern part of the island. He could not get any more supplies or get new troops because of American control of the sea and air around Guam.
"T-Third has been built in phases. The second phase, currently under construction, is also known as the Central Subway project, and will reroute T-Third north of the 4th and King Station.

History.
"Muni introduced the S Castro Shuttle. This aimed to reduce crowding at the busy Castro station. The service began on April 2, 2001. At this time it was running only at peak hours on weekdays."
Service changes.
"A lot of service changes took place with the start of full service on the T Third Street line on April 7, 2007. The new line was routed through the subway to Castro station. It replaced the S Castro Shuttle; changes were also made to the J Church, N Judah, and several bus lines. The changes were unpopular with the public; the Muni Metro changes caused big delays in the Market Street subway, and forced many users to transfer to reach the Caltrain station when they did not back then."
Reversing changes.
"On June 30, 2007, Muni reversed some of the changes. The J, N, and S were restored to their previous routes. And the T was combined with the K Ingleside line."

Temperament.
"Even though Affenpinschers were bred to hunt mice, they do not like to chase other animals, so they can happily live with other pets. They are playful but very stubborn. These dogs can be difficult to train, because they do not like to listen to instructions and often become bored. Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial (protective) when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for homes with very small children."
"This dog is mostly quiet, and does not bark much. It can become very excited if attacked, and shows no fear. toward any aggressor."
Health.
"A small study showed that these dogs live an average of 11.4 years, which is not very long for a small dog (small dogs usually live 14–15 years). One of their most common health problems is bladder disease, which happens most often when the dogs are older (8 years and up.) Their short faces can make it difficult for them to breathe and exercise in hot weather. Like many kinds of dogs, Affenpinschers often get a disease called hip dysplasia which makes it difficult for them to run or walk."

William Bradford (Mayflower passenger)
"William Bradford (15901657) was a passenger on the ""Mayflower"" in 1620. He travelled to the New World to live in religious freedom. He became the second Governor of Plymouth Colony and served for over 30 years. Bradford kept a journal of the history of the early life in Plymouth Colony. It is called ""Of Plymouth Plantation""."
Childhood.
"Bradford was born to William and Alice Bradford in Austerfield, Yorkshire, England. His family were farmers. The Bradford family owned a large farm and were considered rich."
"Bradford's father died was he was one year old. When he was four years old he was sent to live with his grandfather. Two years later, his grandfather died and he returned to live with his mother and stepfather. A year later, in 1597, his mother died. Bradford became an orphan at age 7. He was sent to live with two uncles."
His uncles wanted Bradford to help on the farm but Bradford was ill and was not able to work. Bradford started to read many books. One of the books was the Bible. This may be where he started learning of a religion that was different from the church of England.
When Bradford was 12 years old he went with a friend to hear the pastor Richard Clyfton. Clyfton was a minister who did not believe in the Church of England. Bradford believed in Clyfton’s words. His uncles told him not to go to that church but he went anyway.
During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.

"Four chefs are given three cooking challenges. Each challenge has a type of dish that the chefs have to make in 30 minutes. Before then, the chefs have one minute to get ingredients out of a pantry. After 30 minutes, a judge tastes each dish, and the chef with the worst dish is eliminated."
"At the start of the game, the chefs are each given $25,000. In the first two challenges, Brown shows items that are put up to auction for the chefs to buy using their money. The chefs can use these items on other chefs to change their ingredients, what cooking tools they can use, and other things. For example, an item may force a chef to cook using canned ingredients instead of fresh ones. The chef who is eliminated has to give back the money that they have. In the last challenge, no items are shown at first, but during the first minutes of the challenge, Brown will put items up for auction. This makes it so the person who gets the item has to change their dish based on what the item does. The chef that wins keeps the money that they have left."

Pollinator
"A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the ""pollenizer""."
"To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use."
"Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads."
"Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments."
"The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents."
"Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species."

Manslaughter
"Manslaughter is the crime of killing a person. When a person is killed, lawyers also look at the reasons, and motives why this person was killed. If the death of a person was not on purpose, but the killer did something that resulted in the death of the another person, this is usually called manslaughter, in English. It is less serious than if a person was killed on purpose (sometimes with planning involved), which is called murder, in English. Killing someone in self-defence may be manslaughter. Depending on the circumstances, killing in self-defence may be no crime at all. Negligent homicide is an even lesser crime."
"Manslaughter is a relatively new legal concept. It was first mentioned in an English statute in 1547, but was interpreted very loosely and not earnestly enforced, instead usually charging with murder. Very few countries had manslaughter on their books until the latter half of the 20th century. In fact, no jurisdiction in the United States had manslaughter on its books until the 20th century. England and the United States were the first two countries to introduce manslaughter into their laws."

Ossicles
The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body. They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles. They are in the auditory system of all mammals.
They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness.
Anatomy.
"The ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The terms mean hammer, anvil, and stirrup."
Development.
"Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified (turned into bone) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the quadrate, prearticular, articular, and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates."

Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of getting coal out of the ground. It is part of the mining industry. Coal is used as a resource for making electricity.
Extraction.
Surface mining is done when the coal is near the surface. Coal miners remove the soil above the coal. The coal can then be removed without the coal miners having to go deep underground..
"Underground mining is when the coal is farther underground, making it too expensive to remove soil. In this process, coal miners and all of the coal mining equipment are brought deep underground and coal is carried up out of the ground. This is especially dangerous because of fires, explosions, and poison gas in coal mines."
Processing.
"Before coal can be used, it must be processed in a coal processing plant. It is made smaller using a sizer and crusher. Parts that might be harmful to any equipment which will use the coal later on, such as the screening for metallic parts inside the mined coal."

Critical thinking
"Critical thinking is ""thinking about thinking"". It is a way of deciding if a claim is true, false, or sometimes true and sometimes false, or partly true and partly false."
"To find out if someone is telling you the truth, one needs evidence. Information is found in libraries, online, and by asking people. Professional librarians can help research library sources. Cybrarians can help research using computers. Professional interviewers are good at finding people who are experts in their fields, and they know how to ask the right questions."
"To solve a problem, questions can be written as clearly and simply as possible, making certain that all terms are well understood by giving definitions if necessary. Then, this critical thinking can help one judge how true this information is. Critical thinking tools are taken from many fields of study: statistics, logistics, semantics, experimental research methodology, psychology, sociology. Research sources should be of good quality: up to date, thorough, well-informed, and impartial."

Journalism sourcing
"In journalism, a source or news source is a person, written thing, or other way of getting knowledge gives the reporter information that is new. Sources can be official records, books or other printed works, broadcasts, people who work for governments or businesses, organizations and corporations, people who saw and heard crimes, accidents, or other news, and people to whom a news event or issue is important."
"According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), many things can make a source bona fide, or good, or bad. Reporters should build good relationships with sources so that they trust each other, especially if they write about the same kind of thing often. These reporters are called ""beat reporters."" Beat reporters should also not become close friends with their sources. Journalists should also be skeptical. That means they should wonder whether the source is telling the truth or whether they are lying or wrong. For example, the City News Bureau of Chicago wrote ""If your mother says she loves you, check it out."" Journalists should not use only one source. Instead, they should find many sources that agree with each other, especially when they are writing about a controversy, or something people might disagree or fight about."

Tomaso Albinoni
"Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was a Venetian composer. He wrote operas and instrumental music. He is best remembered as the composer of a work called ""Adagio in G Minor"". Albinoni did not actually write the Adagio."
Life.
"Albinoni was born in Venice. He learned to play the violin and to sing. It is not known who his teachers are. His first opera, ""Zenobia, regina de Palmireni"", was performed in Venice in 1694."
"In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi, a soprano singer."
"He became famous and he performed his operas in many Italian cities, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. He also wrote and published instrumental music during this time. Albinoni did not try to find a job in a church or a court. He remained an independent composer and published music on his own."
"He retired from writing music after 1741, and died in Venice in 1751."
Music.
"Most of Albinoni's operas are lost. This is because he did not publish his operas during his life. His instrumental music has survived. Nine collections of instrumental music were published. Because of this, he is better known for writing instrumental music today. He is the first Italian composer to publish an oboe concerto."
"He was known by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues based on themes by Albinoni."
Voiceless alveolar fricative
"The voiceless alveolar fricative is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨s⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by 's' in ""sun"" and ""sorry""."
List of numbers
"This is a list of numbers. This list will always be not finished. This happens because there are an infinite amount of numbers. Only numbers will be added. Numbers can be added as long as they are popular in math, history or culture."
"This means that numbers can only be if they are a big part of history. A number isn't if it is only related to another number. For example, the number (3,4) is a number when it is a complex number (3+4i). When it is only (3,4), however, it's not notable."
Natural numbers.
Natural numbers are a type of integer. They can be used for counting. Natural numbers can also be used to find out about other number systems. A negative number is not a natural number.
"0 is argued on whether or not it is a natural number. To fix this, people use the terms ""non-negative integers"", which cover 0 and ""positive integers"", which does not."
USA.
"A 2005 patient study found an average emergency room wait time from 2 hours in Iowa to more than 5 hours in Arizona. The Midwest had the highest number of emergency room visits (460 per 1,000 people). The West had the lowest number."
Gynecology

"The name ""Transantarctic Mountains"" was first used in 1960, in a paper by geologist Warren Hamilton."
John Singer Sargent
"John Singer Sargent (January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925) was an American artist. He was the leading portrait painter of his day."
"During his career, he created about 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as many sketches and charcoal drawings. He travelled worldwide. His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris, and then moved to London."
"His ""Portrait of Madame X"" resulted in scandal, though today it is hard to see why. She was thought to be somewhat loose sexually. In the original portrait as exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down her right shoulder. This suggested to some the possibility of further revelation; ""One more struggle"", wrote a critic in ""Le Figaro"", ""and the lady will be free""."
"Sargent visited Spain, studied Velázquez, and was entranced with Spanish music and dance. He understood what the Impressionists were doing, and adopted their habit of painting ""en plein-air"". He was a big fan of Monet, and bought four of his works. His portrait of Monet shows he understood what was going on in French art at the time."
"Sergent kept his American citizenship, and went back there four times. However, he remained living in London to the end of his life."

Research labs.
Research at the school relate to the following topics:
Two-body problem
"The two-body problem is a problem from classical mechanics: there are two bodies which influence each other. Very often they attract or repel each other. In many cases they rotate. The problem uses bodies which are circles, or spheres. Solving the problem is possible for many situations, but it usually involves higher level mathematics."
Simplification: One body has a mass that is much smaller.
"When one of the two bodies has a mass that is much smaller, the influence of this smaller body on the larger one is very small, and can be disregarded. In such a case, the problem can be reformulated as a one-centre problem, where there is a stationary big body in the centre, and a small body orbiting around the big one. This setting is very comon. Johannes Kepler was the first person to formulate and solve it. For this reason, it is also known as Kepler problem."
General solution for the two-body problem.

Equation of state
"In physics, chemistry and thermodynamics, equations of state are used to describe the state a dynamical system is in. . Equations of state are commonly used to describe the state of gases and fluids. In the real world, equations of state are approximations. They can be quite complex to write down, and usually, they are solved using numerical methods."
Variables.
"There are certain variables such as pressure, volume, or temperature, that can be used to describe such a system. So in its simplest form, an equation of state is a function, that takes these dependent variables as input, the state can then be as simple as saying that in its current state, the function has the numerical value zero:"
formula_1
"where p ist the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature."
Ideal gas.
"The simplest of these describes an ideal gas, it is the ideal gas law. This law can also be used to describe the state of real gases, in certain conditions (such as with a low pressure, and high temperature)."

Match fixing
"Match fixing, in organized sports, occurs as a match is played to an entirely or partly pre-determined result. This violates the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to get a payoff from gamblers."
"The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and the future team advantage. In Eastern Europe, mafia gangsters are linked to illegal gambling and match fixing. In Russia, people have disappeared or died after acting against bribes in sports."
"Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines tFheir opponent in the next. By losing a match, a certain team can face an easier opponent in the next round. This makes them much more likely to win."
Sports betting
"Sports betting is the activity of predicting sports and placing wagers on the outcome. Some suggest bets were placed for the first time in Ancient Greece, while others insist there is evidence of similar betting activities even before that."
"The frequency of sports that is bet upon differs with culture. Most of those bets are placed on basketball, baseball, mixed martial arts, boxing and auto racing at both professional and amateur levels."
"In many parts of the United States, sports betting is illegal. It is legal in several other states. They include Iowa, New York, Rhode Island, Colorado and Nevada. In countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden sports betting winnings are not taxed. Other jurisdictions, like Germany, impose taxes on wagering profits, but naturally the percentage varies from one country to another."
Sports betting can be done on several Internet websites or in public.
Bookmaker.
"The bookmaker, also known as “a betting agency” or “sportsbook” is a company or a person that provides the sports betting services at odds, agreed upon in advance."

Career.
Exponentiation
"In mathematics, exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It can be thought of as repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition."
"In general, given two numbers formula_1 and formula_2, the exponentiation of formula_1 and formula_2 can be written as formula_5, and read as ""formula_1 raised to the power of formula_2"", or ""formula_1 to the formula_2th power"". Other methods of mathematical notation have been used in the past. When the upper index cannot be written, people can write powers using the ^ or ** signs, so that 2^4 or 2**4 means formula_10."
"Here, the number formula_1 is called base, and the number formula_2 is called exponent. For example, in formula_10, 2 is the base and 4 is the exponent."
"To calculate formula_10, one simply multiply 4 copies of 2. So formula_15, and the result is formula_16. The equation could be read out loud as ""2 raised to the power of 4 equals 16."""
More examples of exponentiation are:
"If the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square, because the area of a square is calculated using formula_20. So"
"Similarly, if the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube, because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_23. So"
"If the exponent is equal to -1, then the power is simply the reciprocal of the base. So"
"If the exponent is an integer less than 0, then the power is the reciprocal raised to the opposite exponent. For example:"
"If the exponent is equal to formula_28, then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base, with formula_29 For example:"
"Similarly, if the exponent is formula_31, then the result is the nth root, where:"
"If the exponent is a rational number formula_33, then the result is the ""q""th root of the base raised to the power of ""p"":"
"In some cases, the exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base ""a"" to an irrational ""x""th power, we use an infinite sequence of rational numbers (""xn""), whose limit is x:"
like this:
There are some rules which make the calculation of exponents easier:
"It is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. In this case, the matrix must be square. For example, formula_44."
Commutativity.
"Both addition and multiplication are commutative. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, and 2 · 3 is the same as 3 · 2. Although exponentiation is repeated multiplication, it is not commutative. For example, 2³=8, but 3²=9."
Inverse Operations.
"Addition has one inverse operation: subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: division."
But exponentiation has two inverse operations: The root and the logarithm. This is the case because the exponentiation is not commutative. You can see this in this example:

Lumbricus terrestris
"Lumbricus terrestris, also known as the common worm, lob worm, or dew worm, is a large reddish worm native to Europe, but now also widely distributed elsewhere around the world (along with several other lumbricids), due to human introductions. In some areas where it has been introduced, some people consider it to be a serious pest species, since it is out-competing locally native worms."
"Through much of Europe it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm, typically reaching 20 – 25 cm in length when extended (though in parts of southern Europe there are native species which are much larger). It has an unusual habit of copulating on the surface at night, which makes it more visible than most other earthworms."

"Bulimia nervosa can cause many health problems. Because vomit has lots of acid in it, purging frequently can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth. One can lose nutrients or fluids in their body. Glands in one's throat and face may get larger and hurt. The immune system is weakened, as well as the possibility of muscle or heart problems."
Sometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing. This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damage the bronchioles. There is also feedback to the ego and a social stigma that may cause further psychological impact.
Statistics.
Most people who have bulimia are between the ages of 10 to 25. It is more common in females than it is in males. People who have had past trauma are more likely to be bulimic. People with obsessive compulsive disorder or perfectionism are also likely to have bulimia.

Béarnaise sauce
"Béarnaise sauce () is a sauce made of clarified butter, egg yolks, and herbs. It is considered to be a 'child' of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine. The difference is only in their flavouring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorn, and tarragon, while Hollandaise uses lemon juice."
"In appearance it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy."
Béarnaise is a traditional sauce for steak.
History.
"Although a similar recipe was published in 1818, Béarnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef Collinet, the inventor of puffed potatoes (), and served at the 1836 opening of ""Le Pavillon Henri IV"", a restaurant at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, not far from Paris. Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was born in the former province of Béarn."
Preparation.
"A Béarnaise sauce is simply clarified butter, an egg yolk, a shallot, a little tarragon vinegar. It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect."
"Like Hollandaise sauce, there are several methods for the preparation of Béarnaise sauce. Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics. Here we highlight the differences."
"The most common preparation is a ""Bain-marie"" method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. Others are similar. Alternatively, the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (""sans"" lemon juice)."

Lineal championship
"In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called ""the man who beat the man""."
"Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted."

Motion of no confidence
"A motion of no confidence, is a vote on whether a group of people still has confidence in a government or leader. This is mainly a statement or vote which states that a person in a superior position, be it government, managerial, etc., is no longer deemed fit to hold that position."
"The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782 when, following news of the British defeat at Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War the previous October, the Parliament of Great Britain voted that they ""can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers"". In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is relatively rare in two-party democracies. Party discipline is usually enough to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence."
"There are variations of this in different countries. For example, in Germany, Spain, and Israel, a vote of no confidence requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the respective head of state. A motion of no confidence in some countries can be proposed in the government collectively or by any individual member, including the Prime Minister. In Spain it is presented by the Prime Minister after consultation."
Sometimes a party proposes a confidence vote even though it is not likely to pass. The no confidence vote may pressure the government. Or when the government proposes the vote it can embarrass critics who do not vote against the government.

Crop (anatomy)
"A crop (sometimes called a croup or craw) is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary canal used for storing food before digestion. It is found in many animals. It occurs in birds, some dinosaurs, and invertebrate animals such as gastropods (snails and slugs), earthworms, leeches, and insects."
Birds.
"In a bird's digestive system, the crop is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. It is a part of the digestive tract, essentially an enlarged part of the oesophagus. As with most other organisms that have a crop, the crop is used to temporarily store food. Not all birds have a crop. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds."
"Scavenging birds, such as vultures, will gorge themselves when prey is abundant, causing their crop to bulge. They subsequently sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food."
"Most raptors, including hawks, eagles and vultures (as stated above), have a crop; however, owls do not."
Bees.
"Cropping is used by bees to temporarily store nectar of flowers. When bees ""suck"" nectar, it is stored in their crops."
Difference to gizzard.
"In a gizzard, the food is ground down before digestion, usually by stones. Gizzards have a tougher lining, and muscles. The gizzard is lower down the digestive tract, and more like a part of the stomach."
"The crop is just a storage device. Often, it pays a bird to feed while the going is good, and do the digestion later. In many birds and in bees, the food is eventually brought back to the nest and given to family members."
"In other species, food brought back to the nest is pre-digested. That would mean it is regurgitated (brought up) from the stomach."

Backpacking (wilderness)
"Backpacking is hiking in the outdoors with a backpack full of all your food, clothing, water, and shelter. Usually, backpackers hike in groups to stay safer. They must think to bring first aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, food and other camping supplies."
"Backpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared."
"When following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all waste and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world."

Hades
"Hades (, ""Háidēs"") is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld in ancient Greek religion and myth. He is the eldest son of the Titans Kronos and Rhea and brother to Zeus, Poseidon, Hestia, Hera, Demeter and Chiron."
"As the lord of the dead, Hades was greatly feared by the Greeks, and he had few temples or shrines dedicated to him. He was married to the goddess Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Hades’ symbols were the cornucopia, a sceptre, the cypress, narcissus, poplar and his Helm of Darkness; the screech owl was his sacred animal. His sacred fruit was the pomegranate, the fruit that Persephone ate one- third of when she was kidnapped and in the underworld."
"Hades’ Roman equivalent was Pluto, whose name is merely a Latinization of the Greek ""Plouton""."
Superlative
"A superlative, in grammar, is an adjective describing a noun that is the best example of a given quality. In other words, a superlative describes a noun that has more of some quality than any other."
Some examples:
"In English, most superlatives can be formed by adding -EST to an existing adjective, like the examples above. (For adjectives that end in ""-y"", like ""crazy"", you often change the ""y"" to an ""i"" before you add the -EST on the end.)"
"Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms, which do not follow the rules, such as far (""farthest"") and bad (""worst"")."
"Other adjectives have no superlative form at all, and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb ""most"" before the adjective. For instance, you do not say ""funnest,"" or ""interestingest"". Instead, you say ""most fun,"" and ""most interesting."""
"This way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in ""ing"" (like ""interesting"", ""fascinating"", ""disgusting"" or ""appealing"".)"
Learning disability
"Learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are conditions that make it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn."
"Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading) and dysgraphia (a difficulty with writing). They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism). People with learning disabilities may have average intelligence. Learning disabilities are not the same as mental illnesses. They can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways."
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not a learning disability, but it may affect how a person learns."
Wheelbarrow
A wheelbarrow is a kind of vehicle that is built to be pushed around with a load inside it. It is usually used in gardens.
"Most wheelbarrows have one wheel, but some have two."
Wheelbarrows are used to carry heavy stuff which some people cannot carry.
Cold
"Cold is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective warm (opposite of cold). Because it is relative, there is no range in coldness. The temperatures in the winter season are often categorized as being cold. Cold is the opposite of hot."
"The coldest possible temperature is −273.15 °C, which can be expressed as -459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale. This is called absolute zero. Absolute zero is also 0 K on the Kelvin scale and 0 °R on the Rankine scale"
People can break DRM. If someone breaks a DRM technology then copying is possible. All common DRM technologies have been broken. Making a DRM technology that can not be broken is very hard. Some people say that all DRM technologies can be broken. In the United States it is illegal to break a DRM.
DRM is a way for companies to keep their profits while sharing their content online. A good example of this is BBC iPlayer. They do this by keeping their content online for a certain amount of time.
Cement
"Cement is a material that hardens and sticks to other materials to hold them together. Portland cement is a common kind, and made from quicklime (heated limestone) and clay. Cement is used to make concrete and mortar."
Brown algae
"Brown algae are a large group of multicellular algae. All the brown algae are multicellular. Most brown algae have fucoxanthin, a chemical that gives them a brown color. They include many seaweeds in colder waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Most brown algae live in marine environments, where they play an important role both as food and as a potential habitat."
"There are 2000 species of brown algae. Most species live in the ocean. They are important as food and as homes for many animals and marine life. Some brown algae are gathered by humans for food. The giant kelp ""Macrocystis"" is a brown alga that forms underwater forests, and it may grow to 60 meters. The Sargasso Sea gets its name from the ""Sargassum"" seaweed that floats on the surface. Many brown algae grow on rocks at the seashore."
Brown algae are unique among heterokonts in developing into multicellular forms with differentiated tissues. But they reproduce by means of flagellated spores and gametes that look like the cells of other heterokonts. Genetic studies show their closest relatives to be the yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae).
Classification.
This is a list of the orders in the class Phaeophyceae:
Bacillus
"Bacillus is a genus of rod shaped bacteria. They are Gram-positive, meaning they have an extra outside cell layer."
"Bacilli are partly or wholly aerobic. They do aerobic respiration. They are everywhere in nature. ""Bacillus"" includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species."
"Under stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods."
"Some species of ""Bacillus"" are worth noting:"
Milk powder
"Milk powder is a powder made by dehydrating milk. When water is added, it becomes liquid milk again. Milk powder is often used in countries that lack widespread access to refrigeration. As well, it is often used in recipes that call for milk."
Vaccinium vitis-idaea
"Vaccinium vitis-idaea (also called lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry) is a small evergreen shrub from the heather family that makes edible fruits."
Dehydration
"Dehydration (hypohydration) means less water in something. The word comes from the ancient Greek word for water, ""hydor""."
"People get dehydrated when they lose more water than they take in. The human body needs water to survive. If a person gets badly dehydrated, their body will be unable to work the right way. Bad dehydration can cause organ damage and even death."
What causes dehydration?
A living organism will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water. The most common causes of dehydration are:
Who gets dehydration?
"Any living being can get dehydrated. Some people are more at risk of dehydration. Elderly people, very young children, and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration."
Reception.
"""Grand Theft Auto IV"" was praised for having more realistic graphics and story."
Secure Digital card
"A Secure Digital card (SD card) is a kind of memory card. Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. As of 2008, different capacities between 4 megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made. The card has a rectangular design, but one edge is ""chipped off"". This means that the cards cannot be inserted into the cameras (or other devices) the wrong way."
There are different kinds of cards:
"SD and SDHC are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards. The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same, but SDXC uses a different file system. Some devices (for example the Wii) that originally shipped only with support for SD can be made to support SDHC with a firmware update."
"There are also different ""classes"". These refer to the read and write speeds. Currently in use are ""Class 2"" - which means 2 MBytes/second, ""Class 4"" - 4 MB/sec and ""Class 6"" at 6 MB/sec. The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions."
"Still another measurement is called ""rating"". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x."
microSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller.
Gold Coast
Gold Coast could mean:
Natasha Bedingfield
"Natasha Bedingfield (born 26 November 1981) is an English singer-songwriter. She was born in West Sussex and was raised in Lewisham, South London. Her music genres are rock, R&amp;B and pop. Her albums are ""Unwritten"" (which contains the hit single of the same name), ""N.B."" (the U.S. title is ""Pocketful of Sunshine"") and ""Strip Me"" (released in 2010). Some of the most famous songs by her are ""Unwritten"", ""Say It Again"", ""Soulmate"", ""These Words"" and ""I Bruise Easily"". One of her two brothers is singer Daniel Bedingfield; her sister is singer Nikola Rachelle."
Dje
"Dje (Ђ, ђ), also known as Djerv, is the sixth letter of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, used in the Serbian language to represent the sound for need to tell , a palatalisation, similar to the English sound of letter ""j"" . It was created on model Cyrillic letter ћ by Vuk Karadžić."
Serbian Cyrillic alphabet
"The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet (, ""srpska/Vukova ćirilica"", literally ""Serbian/Vuk's Cyrillic alphabet"") is the official and traditional alphabet used to write the Serbian language."
The alphabet.
"The following table gives the upper and lower letters forms of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, along with the Serbian Latin equivalent and the IPA value for each letter:"
Rhinoceros (genus)
"The genus Rhinoceros of the family Rhinocerotidae includes the one-horned rhinoceroses, of which there are two extant species: the Indian rhinoceros (""R. unicornis"") and the Javan rhinoceros (""R. sondaicus""). These are characterized by one horn (actually thickly matted hair) on the upper snout."
Sumatran rhinoceros
"The Sumatran Rhinoceros (""Dicerorhinus sumatrensis"") is a member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses. It is the smallest rhinoceros, standing about 120–145 centimetres (3.9–4.8 ft) high at the shoulder, with a body length of 250 centimetres (98 in) and weight of 500–800 kilograms (1100–1760 lb)."
"The Sumatran rhinoceros is a small, hairy rhinoceros which survives in limited numbers in pockets of Indonesian and Malaysian rain forests. Only three institutions showcase Sumatran rhinos, the Cincinnati Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Borneo."
The new methods using both lasers and LED systems are showing good results and are possible alternative to chemicals.
Susana Dosamantes
"Susana Dosamantes Rul Riestra (9 January 1948 – 2 July 2022), was a Mexican actress."
Personal life.
"She is the mother of Mexican pop diva Paulina Rubio, She has appeared in around 50 movies and TV series, including telenovelas."
"On 11 January 2011, her ex-husband died from kidney cancer."
"In her final years Dosamantes worked in the United States so that she could live near her daughter, Paulina. Both Susana and Paulina lived in Miami, Florida."
"Dosamantes died on 2 July 2022 at the age of 74, in Miami from pancreatic cancer."
Potter Palmer
"Potter Palmer (May 20, 1826 – May 4, 1902) was an American businessman and architect. Palmer is known for helping creating new streets in the city of Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire during the 1880s."
"Palmer was born on May 20, 1826. He was raised in Chicago, Illinois. Potter was married to Bertha Honoré from 1871 until his death in 1902. They had two children. On May 4, 1902, Palmer died from heart failure in his home in Chicago, Illinois. He was 75 when he died. He is buried at Graceland Cemetery in Uptown, Chicago."
Human chorionic gonadotropin
"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy. Some tumors might produce this hormone. From December 6, 2011, the [FDA] (Food and Drug Administration) made illegal selling hCG diet products in pharmacies."
"Controversy about injected hCG for weight loss started marketing campaign for injections of ""homeopathic hCG"" for weight control. The ingredients in these products if prepared from true hCG via homeopathic dilution, will contain either no hCG at all or only small amount of it."
We can measure hCG level with Blood or urine tests. These can be done by pregnancy tests.
"Below is a list of hCG levels during pregnancy. (""LMP"" is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of your last period.) The level of hCG grows over the time during pregnancy."
Giovanni Bellini
"Giovanni Bellini (; c. 1430 – 26 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter based in Venice. His father Jacopo and his brother Gentile were also painters, as was his brother-in-law Mantegna."
"Bellini used a coloristic style exemplified by his use of clear oil paints, deep colors, and detailed shadings. His atmospheric landscapes influenced Venetian painting, particularly the work done by his pupils, Giorgione and Titian."
International marketing
International marketing (IM) or global marketing is a marketing done on international level. The International Marketing is based on strategy created in home country of company and distributed to its other offices/affiliations. In most cases it is international company level (company have offices in different countries) market identification and targeting. International Marketing is very similar to Global marketing.
The main difference will be the fact that Global Marketing is focusing on intercontinental point of view.
The example of International Marketing would be where an English company would like to enter Chinese market. It will be done by either developing marketing strategy in their home country that will be then introduced in new market or they will hire a company to create such a plan.
Differences between marketing and international marketing.
International marketing is developed by many multinational companies on a global level. It is then send to local markets which make changes for their country and starts following new strategy. Such a way of creating marketing strategies ensures that the global brand will be following same strategy and targeting same buyers group.
Harold Pinter
"Many people like to make their own paper. Engel describes a process shown to him by Robert J. Lang that is ""a sandwich of aluminum foil and two pieces of tissue paper."" In this method, two pieces of paper are pasted to each side of the aluminum foil. Many people like origami because there is almost always paper. Copy paper, napkins, wallpaper, index cards, and even paper money can be used to make interesting and unique models."
Tools.
"Many paperfolders prefer to use a flat surface to fold models on, but others, like the Japanese, fold in the air. Traditional paperfolders believe that only the hands should be used when folding, but many modern folders use other tools when folding. Tweezers and paper clips can be used to make very small folds. Some folders use rulers or other flat tools to make sharper creases in the models."
Types.
New types of origami have been made because more people are making origami models.
Pureland.
"Pureland origami is origami with one rule: only one fold can be made at a time. British paperfolder John Smith started pureland origami for inexperienced paperfolders or for people with poor motor skills. Hard folds, like the inside-reverse fold, are not allowed in pureland origami."
JSPWiki
"JSPWiki is a feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki software built around the standard J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP)."
It was created by Janne Jalkanen.

Statement has several meanings:
Salvation
"In theology, salvation can mean various things:"
Polyhedron
"A polyhedron (one polyhedron, many ""polyhedra"", or ""polyhedrons"") is a geometrical shape. It is a 3D shape with flat faces, and straight edges. Each face is a polygon surrounded by edges. Usually it is defined by the number of faces, or edges."
Two types of polyhedron are convex and concave. The line connecting any two points of a convex polyhedron is inside the polyhedron. The line connecting two points of a concave polyhedron may go outside the polyhedron.
"Mathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron. They do agree that there are five Platonic solids, which are regular polyhedra. On a regular polyhedron, all faces are the same and all vertices are the same."
Naming.
"Usually, polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have. The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron, which is made of four triangles, pentahedron (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), hexahedron (six faces, a cube if it is regular), heptahedron (seven faces) and octahedron (eight faces). Prisms, pyramids and other shapes can also be named according to how many faces they have."
Pentagon
"A pentagon is a polygon with five edges. It is defined by five points, which are all on a plane. If all the edges have the same length and the angles at the corners are all 108°, the pentagon is called ""regular"". If the pentagon intersects itself, it is called a pentagram."
"Pentagons also occur in nature: Fruits of the Okra are pentangular. The flowers of Ipomoea are pentagular. In chemistry, many Cyclic compounds are pentangles: Cyclopentane and Furan are examples for this. In architecture, many bastions are pentangular: Bourtange, in the Netherlands has been completely restored, and is a pentangle. The Citadel of Lille, Nyenschantz, near St. Petersburg, or the Citadel of Pamplona are . The Villa Farnese is a palace in the form of a pentagon, so is the castle of Nowy Wiśnicz. The Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk near Žďár nad Sázavou also uses a pentangular design."

"Martin Luther King, Jr. was staying at the Gaston Motel when it was bombed on May 11th. Fortunately, he had departed earlier. In the residence of A.D. King, King's younger brother, another explosion exploded. In response to the explosions, the demonstrators became more violent. They rioted across the city, torching buildings and cars and assaulting police officers. To restore control, soldiers from the United States Army were dispatched."
The Youth Protest.
"Despite its best efforts, the campaign did not receive the national attention that its strategists had hoped for. They decided to include students in the demonstrations. On May 2, almost a thousand African-American kids skipped school to join the protests. Demonstrators quickly overflowed the cells in Birmingham. With the cells full. He used police dogs and fire hoses on the kids. Images of children being hosed down and dogs being mauled made national headlines. The protests had drawn the attention of the entire country."
Results.
"Despite the fact that there were still numerous issues with racism, the Birmingham campaign helped to break down several barriers to segregation. When the new school year began in September of 1963, the schools were likewise integrated. The campaign's most important effect was the nationalization of the issues and the engagement of leaders like President John F. Kennedy."
Louisville metropolitan area
"The Louisville Metropolitan Area is the area that spreads in Kentucky and Indiana and is more commonly known as by the public as ""Kentuckiana""."
Yakutian horse
"The Yakutian (Yakut: Саха ата, Sakha ata) or Yakut is a horse breed that is native to the Republic of Sakha (or Yakutia) in Siberia. It is similar to the Mongolian horse and Przewalski's horse, but is larger than them. It is special because of how it adapts to the very cold climate of Yakutia. It is able to find and graze on vegetation that is hidden under deep snow. It can survive without shelter in temperatures that reach −70 °C (−94 °F)."
Breed traits.
"The breed averages 140 centimetres (13.3 hands) in stallions and 136 cm (13.2 h) in mares. It has a sturdy stature, thick mane, and heavy hair coat. It shares these traits with other northern horse breeds, like the Shetland pony, Fjord horse, and Icelandic horse."

Professional Game Match Officials Limited
Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) is the body responsible for match officials in English professional football.
"Formerly known as the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOB), it was formed when English referees became professional in 2001, to provide Officials for all games played in the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and Football Association competitions. The organisation is funded by the Premier League, EFL and the FA."
The governing body has a senior refereeing group called Select Group.
Evaluation.
The Select Group referees meet twice per month for training sessions and analysis of match videos and data.
Controversy.

Sulfur cycle
"The sulfur cycle is the way sulfur moves between rocks, waterways and living systems."
"Sulfur (S) is an element important to ecosystems and the climate. The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion."
Steps of the sulfur cycle.
Sulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around.
Human Impact on the sulfur cycle.
"Humans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the H2O falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming."
Flag of Azad Kashmir
"The State flag of Azad Jammu and Kashmir traditionally displays the Pakistani national colours, white and dark Green, with a Crescent and star to represent the Muslim-majority all of which shows its Islamic heritage and strong ties with the Federation of Pakistan. It also has a saffron square to represent the Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh and other minorities of the disputed region, the colours are clearly influenced by the Mughal Empire. The four white stripes symbolizes the main rivers of the Kashmir region; Indus (National River of Pakistan), Jhelum, Chenab and Ravi. It also represents the five geographic divisions of the Disputed territory, namely, Baltistan, Gilgit, Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh."

Claire Aho
"Claire Anita Aho (2 November 1925 – 29 November 2015) was a pioneering Finnish-born Swedish photographer. She started her career in the 1940s at the Aho &amp; Soldan company. Aho moved to Sweden in 1974 where she worked as an photographer for several newspapers including ""Hufvudstadsbladet"" and with Nordic Museum."
Map coloring
"Map coloring is a term used for two different concepts: In geography and mapmaking it is used to say that colors are assigned to certain areas on a map. Examples of this are coloring that show the countries or divisions of a country, but also to visualize other data, for example the altitude. The other use is in mathematics: There it is used to describe the problem of finding the minimal number of colors needed to color a given map."
In mapmaking.
"Color is very useful to show different features on a map. Typical uses of color include showing different countries, different temperatures, or different kinds of roads."
"Displaying the information in different colors can affect the understanding or feel of the map. In many cultures, certain colors have certain meanings. For example, red can mean danger, green can mean nature, and blue can mean water, which can be confused with the sea."
"Mapmakers may also use colors that are related to what they are mapping. For example, when mapping where it rains more or less, they may use different shades of blue. For a map of wildfires, they may use yellows, reds, and oranges. Carefully choosing colors is important so the map is easy to read and understand. Also, the mapmaker must take into account that many people have impaired color vision, and colors must be used such that these readers can see their differences."
QED
QED may mean:
Q.E.D.
"Q.E.D. is an acronym or initialism of the Latin phrase , which means ""what was to be demonstrated"". In other words, Q.E.D. means ""something was to be proven, and now it has been done""."
History.
"In the European Renaissance, scholars often wrote in Latin. The phrases ""Q.E.D."" was often used at the end of mathematical or philosophical proofs."
Equivalents in other languages.
"""Q.E.D."" is used in many languages, including:"
Five color theorem
"The Five color theorem is a theorem from Graph theory. It states that any plane which is separated into regions, such as a map, can be colored with no more than five colors. It was first stated by Alfred Kempe in 1890, and proved by Percy John Heawood eleven years later. Kempe also tried to prove it, but his proof failed. There are two restrictions which are placed on the maps: First, a country must be contiguous, there must be no exclaves, and secondly, countries that only touch in one point can be colored with the same color."
"There is also a four color theorem, which is stronger, and much more difficult to prove."
Silence procedure
"Silence procedure (French: ""procédure d'approbation tacite"") is a decision-making tactic or process used in international political contexts. The procedure is based on the Latin phrase ""qui tacet consentire videtur"" which means ""he who is silent is taken to agree"" or ""silence means consent""."
"The silence procedure is used to enhance the process of consensus-building. It is used by many international groups, including NATO, and the European Union (EU)."
"In the contexts of such multi-party groups, silence signifies a willingness to work together to limit the possible causes of paralysis."

Cache coherence
"A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource. When there are several such caches for the same resource, as shown in the picture, this can lead to problems. Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data, and that the data in the caches makes sense (called ""data integrity""). Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence."
"There may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource, as data in the cache may no longer make sense, or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others. A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system. As can be seen in the figure, if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block, the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory, without knowing. Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory."
Definition.
"Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location. The caches are coherent, if all of the following conditions are met:"
"These conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously. However, this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture. A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made. The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors."
Cache coherence mechanisms.
Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.
"The two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory-based. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping is not scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system. As the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (&gt;64 processors) use this type of cache coherence."

"Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. He studied at Princeton University and at Carnegie Institute of Technology."
Career.
"The winner of a Westinghouse scholarship, he attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he received both his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in 1948. From Pittsburgh he went to Princeton University where he worked on his equilibrium theory. He received a Ph.D. in 1950 with a dissertation on non-cooperative games. The thesis, which was written under the supervision of Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of what would later be called the Nash equilibrium. His studies on this subject led to three articles:"
Nash also did important work in the area of manifolds (complex spatial structures):
"This work led to ""Nash embedding theorem"": ""Two real algebraic manifolds are equivalent if and only if they are analytically homeomorphic."""
Personal life.
"He is best known in popular culture as the subject of the Hollywood movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"", about his mathematical genius and his struggles with schizophrenia, with which he was diagnosed."
"Nash married Alicia Lopez-Harrison de Lardé in 1957. They had one son. Nash had a first son out of wedlock to Elenor Stier.. In 1963, the couple divorced. They later remarried in 2001. Nash lived in West Windsor Township, New Jersey for a long time."
Death.
"On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife Alicia were killed in a car accident near Monroe Township, New Jersey. A taxi that they were riding in was struck by another vehicle and the pair was ejected from the taxi. Nash was 86 years old."

Calisthenics
"Calisthenics is a series of exercises used to develop strength, power and balance or a repeated rhythmical exercise that uses the weight of the body as resistance or the systematic exercises for attaining strength-gracefulness or the practice of calisthenic exercises."
"The name calisthenics is Greek in origin, a combination of the words 'beauty' and 'strength'."
"Calisthenics is recommended for general good health, light exercises designed to promote general physical fitness."
Muteness
"Muteness means not being able to speak. A person that cannot speak is called a mute. A mute keeps the ability to hear the speech of others. If not, the person would be a deaf mute."
"Muteness is a type of speech disorder. A person who chooses not to speak is said to be ""silent"" rather than mute. Slang for this (British English) is ""keeping mum""."
"Originally, the common word dumb or ""dumbness"" used to mean ""unable to speak"". Unfortunately this was taken over to mean """"unwilling"" to speak"" or ""unintelligent"". So people prefer ""muteness"". ""Dumb"" is a much commoner word, and might be used if it would not be misunderstood."
Cause (eteliology).
"In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: genetics, psychological, or trauma."
"For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder."
"Adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak: this may be due to disease, injury, damage or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur, but rarely, for psychological reasons. Damage (however caused) to the parts of the brain needed for speech is called aphasia."
Action.
"Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. A speech assessment may decide cause and treatment. Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is a permanent condition, a range of communication devices are available to help communication."
Speech-generating devices help people with speech deficiencies.
Wooden spoon
"Two key problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the H-Block hunger strikers, two of Thomas McElwee's sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting; Mary said to the media outside that ""he's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions"". FitzGerald then ordered Gardaí to remove the families from the meeting."
"In the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months, in November 1982, resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael–Labour coalition with a working majority."
Taoiseach 1982–87.
Constitutional reform.
"As Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society. His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws."
"A controversial Pro-Life Amendment (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the ""Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother"", was added to the Irish constitution—against FitzGerald's advice—in a 1983 national referendum."
Northern Ireland.
"FitzGerald set up the New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from Northern Ireland. It provided the incentive for the reopening of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which resulted in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985."
"While the Agreement was rejected and criticised by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the Irish and British governments which, in time, would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and, subsequently, the republican and loyalist cease-fires."
Infighting and declining support.
"In January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach, heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna Fáil returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election, and Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach."
Post-Taoiseach period.
"FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, and retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, died before him in 1999; after that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in ""The Irish Times"", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs."
"In 2009, FitzGerald had received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to have been bought by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008."
Death.
"On 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, sent his regards and called him an ""institution"". He was put on a ventilator. On 19 May he died aged 85, from pneumonia, at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin."

Secant (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the formula_6 or formula_7.
Cotangent (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the formula_8 or formula_9.
"Students often use a mnemonic to remember this relationship. The ""sine"", ""cosine"", and ""tangent"" ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them as strings of letters, such as SOH-CAH-TOA:"
Using trigonometry.
"With the sines and cosines, one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called ""solving"" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle, as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since ""every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles""."
"Trigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions. It developed from a need to compute angles and distances in fields such as astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding."
"There is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry. This is used for calculations in astronomy, geodesy and navigation."

Monotheism
"Monotheism is the belief in only one god, rather than two or more, which would be polytheism such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt and partly Hinduism. Many religions are monotheistic, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baha'i Faith, Sikhism, Eckankar, Zoroastrianism, Cao Dai and Tenrikyo. Some pagan and neo-pagan religions are also monotheistic. Deism is the belief that a higher being like god exists, but rejects the belief in many gods, revelation, religions, rituals, sacred books (like the Bible or Quran), prophets (like Jesus or Muhammad), etc. Judaism and Zoroastrianism are thought to be the oldest living monotheistic religions."
Polytheism
Polytheism means believing in many gods. A person that believes in polytheism is called a polytheist. A religion with polytheism can be called a polytheistic religion.
"Polytheism is well documented in historical religions of classical antiquity, especially those of ancient Greeks and Romans. Other ancient people who were polytheists include German pagans, Turkic peoples, Ancient Egyptians, the Celts and the Norse."
"There are various polytheistic religions practiced today. Examples include Sanamahism (Meitei paganism), Tengrism, Shinto, Chinese folk religion, Thelma, Wicca, Druidism, Taoism, Asatru and Candomblé."
"Usually, a polytheistic religion has a set of stories about the gods. This is called mythology."
"The opposite of polytheism is monotheism, which is the belief in only one god, practiced by the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, etc."

Rocket engine
"A rocket engine is a device that produces a force by pushing gases at high speed out of a nozzle. Rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion. In some cases (such as NASA rockets), the force created can be over ."
A garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force. When a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still. The exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine.
"Liquids, solids and hybrids."
"Some rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels. Solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called ""rocket motors""."
"Liquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move (and pressurize) the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine. These machines must work in extreme temperatures and pressures. Liquid oxygen is very cold (-223˚C) while the engine is very hot (3000˚C), and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure. Because of these conditions, liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials (metals, ceramics, etc.)."
"Solid fuel rocket motors have the fuel (called propellant) as a solid mixture of an oxidizer and fuel. An oxidizer supports the burning of fuel much like oxygen supports burning. The common oxidizer is powdered Ammonium Perchlorate, while the common fuel is powdered aluminum metal. The two powders are stuck together with a third component known as the binder. The binder is a rubbery solid that also burns as a fuel. The simple idea makes solid rocket engines cheaper, but they cannot be turned off or controlled, and are more likely to explode than liquid rocket engines. Solid rockets also provide a smaller specific impulse, hence must be heavier to launch the same payload."
"Military missiles commonly use solid rockets because they can be kept ready for many years. Many satellite launchers use solid rocket boosters when they start, but liquid rockets for the majority of the flight."
"Hybrid rocket engines combine the two ideas. The two propellants are different states of matter, often with liquid oxidisers and solid fuels. They are not used much, but might be safer than solid rocket motors or liquid rocket motors"
Nozzle
A nozzle is a device that takes incoming fluid (such as gas or liquid) and increases the speed. This is done by changing the size of the pipe (or tube) that the fluid is flowing through.

Penny Black
"The Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. It was issued by the United Kingdom on the 1 May 1840 and used from the 6 May the same year. All London post offices received official issues of the new stamps, but other offices in the country did not. Some post offices like in Bath, offered the stamp unofficially after 2 May."
Other media.
"In the live-action movie The Last Airbender by M. Night Shyamalan, Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone. His name is pronounced ""So-kah,"" but in the show it's name pronounced ""Sah-kah"". Several important changes to the character's personality were made. In the film he is no longer the comic relief, nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle. He rarely shares screen time with Aang, the main hero, or contributes in any way to the plot. M. Night Shyamalan has said in an interview that these decisions were made in order to ""ground"" the character."
He will be played by Ian Ousley in the Netflix of the series.

Structural engineering
"Structural engineering is a subset of civil engineering dealing with the design and analysis of buildings and large non-building structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters. Besides, it may also cover design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved. Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes."
"Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages: ""research"", ""design"", ""testing"", and ""construction"" which are featured with the images below:"
Structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century.
"Entry-level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure, for example, beams, columns, and floors of a building. More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building."
"Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields, such as bridge engineering, building engineering, pipeline engineering, earthquake engineering, industrial structures, or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts."

Their three principles.
"MUJI is based on three core principles, which remain unchanged to this day:"
"Their products, born from an extremely rational manufacturing process, are succinct, but they are not in the minimalist style."
"They think simplicity and emptiness yield the ultimate universality, embracing the feelings and thoughts of all people."
History.
"1980 Seiyu Co., Ltd.’s private brand “MUJI” was born"
1985 MUJI Business Division was established
"1989 Established Ryohin Keikaku Co., Ltd."
"1990 Transferred the business rights of “MUJI” from Seiyu Co., Ltd."
"1991 Started overseas expansion (first store in the UK, first store in Hong Kong)"
1997 Received the PLMA (International PB Product Manufacturers Association) Excellence Award
"2000 Established MUJI HOUSE Co., Ltd. (currently MUJI HOUSE Co., Ltd.)"
Countries of operation.
"As of August 2021, 497 MUJI stores were opened domestically and 571 stores were opened in 32 countries and regions around the world."
"China(299), Hong Kong(20), Taiwan(54), Korea(39)"
"England(7), France(7), Italy(6), Germany(8), Spain(4), Portugal(1), Ireland(1), Sweden(1), Poland(1), Switzerland(1), Finland(1), Denmark(1), US(10), Canada(9),"
"Singapore(10), Malaysia(9), Thailand(22), India(3), Australia(5), Philippines(5), Vietnam(2), Kuwait(3), UAE(7), Saudi Arabia(5), Bahrain(2), Qatar(2), Oman(1)"
Sustainability.
"MUJI contributes to the realization of a resource-recycling, nature-friendly society and a sustainable society through the products, services and activities it provides."
"As one of the examples, they collect unnecessary clothes at stores to circulate global resources and reduce waste.  The collected clothes are recycled as raw materials for clothes, re-dyed and resold as ""ReMUJI""."
"Also, as part of their efforts to reduce plastic waste, they have installed water dispensers in MUJI stores.  This is a water supply service that uses tap water that anyone can use for free if people purchase a ""bottle of water that you pack yourself"" at the store or bring their own bottle."
MUJI’s expanding activity.
MUJI wants to be a platform that responds sensitively to various issues that are occuring in society and solves them in a better direction from “conscience and creativity. This commitment drives them to various activities. Here are eight examples.
"The first one is “Resource Utilization”. As one of these activities, in order to support producers in areas where it is difficult to maintain paddy fields due to the aging of the population, they brewed sake by studying products with added value before general-purpose products, where prices are sluggish, with local people."
The second one is “Building Connections”. This is a service for mobile sales in rural areas and direct delivery from production areas at online stores.
"The third one is “Public Design”. As a concrete example, In April 2015, MUJI set up sofa benches in the gate lounges and natural oak tables and chairs in the food court of the Narita Airport Terminal 3 to create a pleasant environment in which passengers can relax."
"The fourth is “Simple Food”. At MUJI Diner and Cafe &amp; Meal MUJI, the person in charge goes to the production area and offers the ingredients selected."
The fifth is “Reduce Waste”. One example is ReMUJI. This is an initiative to recycle products that customers have used for years and those products that are deemed unsellable as a result of a glitch during the manufacturing and distribution process.
"The sixth is “Social Initiative”. In Japan, MUJI provides support for earthquakes and heavy rain disasters, and in developing countries, they are working to revitalize the region."
The seventh is “Long-lasting Homes”. MUJI Renovation Club and MUJI House provide a one-room space where people can easily change their life according to lifestyle changes and family growth.
"The last one is “Nature Conservation”. With the idea of “enjoying nature--naturally”, they operate three campsites and manage a total of approximately 700,000 tsubo of forests around the sites."
"American Public Television (APT) is the largest syndicator of programming for public television stations in the United States. APT continues to show a many public television programs nationally, as well as administering the Create and World channels on public TV. APT began in 1961."
"At first, it was called Eastern Educational Television Network (EEN). EEN was a regional cooperative that began to show programs between a couple of its member stations. EEN was one of the first distributors of shows such as ""The French Chef"" (with Julia Child) in 1963, ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"", and ""Washington Week in Review"" on a national basis."
Television Hall of Fame
"The Television Academy Hall of Fame was founded by a former president of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (ATAS), John H. Mitchell (1921–1988), to honor individuals who have made big contributions to U.S. television."
"The first ceremony in 1984 celebrated the careers of Lucille Ball, Milton Berle, Paddy Chayefsky, Norman Lear, Edward R. Murrow, William S. Paley and David Sarnoff."

"Rollins College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college. It was founded in 1885 and located in Winter Park, Florida along the shores of Lake Virginia."
"Rollins is a member of the SACS, NASM, ACS, FDE, AAM, AACSB International, Council for Accreditation of Counseling, and Related Educational Programs."
"Rollins has about 30 undergraduate majors and several graduate programs. It was ranked #2 Regional Universities, South by U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2017. Rollins College has ranked among the most beautiful U.S. college campuses by the Princeton Review ranking #1 in 2015 and #10 most recently in 2017."
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary
"Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, founded in 1794, is a graduate seminary in the Reformed tradition teaching theology and preparing students for service in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and other Christian churches."
"Teaching is based in scripture. The Seminary is located in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States and houses one of the largest theological libraries in the Pittsburgh."
"World Mission Initiative (WMI) at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary is a fellowship of Presbyterians dedicated to developing mission vision, nurturing missionary vocation, and cultivating missional congregations."
Master of Divinity
"In the academic study of theology, the Master of Divinity (MDiv, ""magister divinitatis"" in Latin) is the first professional degree of the pastoral profession in North America."
"It is the most common academic degree in seminaries and divinity schools. In many Christian denominations and in some other religions the degree is the standard education for ordination to the priesthood or pastorship or other appointment, ordination or licensing to professional ministry."
National Honor Society
The National Honor Society (NHS) is a nationwide organization for high school students in the United States which is made up of many chapters in high schools.
"Selection is based on four criteria: scholarship (academic achievement), leadership, service, and character. The National Honor Society requires some sort of service to the community, school, or other organizations. The time spent working on these projects contributes towards the monthly service hour requirement."
"The National Honor Society was founded in 1921 by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The Alpha chapter of NHS was founded at Fifth Avenue High School by Principal Edward S. Rynearson in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
Minister (Christianity)
"In Christianity, a minister is a person authorized by a church, or other religious organization, to perform functions such as teaching of beliefs; leading services such as weddings, baptisms or funerals; or otherwise providing spiritual guidance to the community."
"The term is taken from Latin ""minister"" (""servant"", ""attendant"")."
United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America
"The United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) was the largest branch of Presbyterianism in the United States from May 28, 1958, to 1983."
"The number of individuals who hold membership in the Baptist denomination totals to 75-105 million, being represented in the following Churches:"
Lutheranism – 70–90 million.
"The number of adherents in the Lutheran denomination totals to 70-90 million persons, being represented in the following Churches:"
Reformed churches (Calvinism) – 60–80 million.
The Reformed tradition is represented by 60-80 million people who hold membership in the following Churches:
Methodism – 60–80 million.
"The number of members in the Methodist denomination totals to 60-80 million people, being represented in the following Churches:"
Seventh-day Adventist Church – 21.4 million.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a membership of 21.4 million people.
Plymouth Brethren – 1 million.
The Plymouth Brethren number around 1 million members.
Modern Protestantism – 400–500 million.
"The denominations listed below did not emerge from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century or its commonly acknowledged offshoots. Instead, they are broadly linked to Pentecostalism or similar other independent evangelical and revivalistic movements that originated in the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, several sources tend to differentiate them from Protestants and classify them as together as Independents, Non-core Protestants etc. Also included in this category are the numerous, yet very similar Nondenominational churches. Nonetheless, sources eventually combine their numbers to the Protestant tally. Despite the absence of centralized control or leadership, if considered as a single cohort, this will easily be the second largest Christian tradition after Roman Catholicism. According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC), there are an estimated 450 million Independents world-wide, as of mid-2019."
Pentecostalism – 280 million.
Those who are members of the Pentecostal denomination number around 280 million people.
African initiated churches – 60 million.
60 million people are members of African initiated churches.
New Apostolic Church – 10 million.
The New Apostolic Church has around 10 million members.
Eastern Orthodoxy – 230 million.
"The best estimate of the number of Eastern Orthodox Christians is 210–230 million or 80% of all Orthodox Christians worldwide. Its main body consists of the various autocephalous churches along with the autonomous and other churches canonically linked to them, for the most part form a single communion, making the Eastern Orthodox Church the second largest single denomination behind the Catholic Church. In addition, there are several Eastern Orthodox splinter groups and non-universally recognized churches."
Oriental Orthodoxy – 62 million.
"The Oriental Orthodox Churches are those descended from those that rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Despite the similar name, they are therefore a different branch of Christianity from the Eastern Orthodox (see above). There are an estimated 62 million Oriental Orthodox Christians, worldwide."
Non-trinitarian Restorationism – 35 million.
"A sixth group is composed by Non-trinitarian Restorationists. These groups are quite distinct from orthodox Trinitarian restorationist groups such as the Disciples of Christ, despite some shared history."
Christendom
"Christendom or the Christian world, in the widest sense, means Christianity as a territorial phenomenon. That means: those countries where most people are Christians and because of that are part of Christendom."
"People have used the term Christendom for the medieval and Renaissance understanding of the Christian world as one single ""Body of Christ"" with Christ as the head. With the rise of Modernity and the Reformation during the early 16th century the understanding changed to a modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society that consists of many different communities."
Creed
"A creed is a statement or confession of belief — usually religious belief — or faith. The word comes from the Latin ""credo"" for ""I believe"". It is called ""symbol"" (Greek, συμβολον), that means a ""token"" by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other."
"The Christchurch Call to Action Summit (also called the Christchurch Call), was a political summit started by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern that took place on 15 May 2019 in Paris, France, two months after the Christchurch mosque shootings of 15 March 2019. Co-chaired by Ardern and President Emmanuel Macron of France. The purpose was to ""bring together countries and tech companies in an attempt to bring to an end the ability to use social media to organise and promote terrorism and violent extremism""."
COVID-19 lockdowns
"COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to limit the spread of the disease by adding stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, ""cordons sanitaires"" and similar societal restrictions. By April 2020, about half of the world's population was under some form of lockdown, with more than 3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments."
Carbon neutrality
"Carbon neutrality refers to the goal of getting to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions to prevent or reduce global warming. This can be done by balancing emissions of carbon dioxide with its removal (often through carbon offsetting) or by eliminating emissions from society (the transition to the ""post-carbon economy""). It is used in the context of carbon dioxide-releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, agriculture, and industry."
Hybrid vehicle
"A hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that uses two or more specific types of power, such as submarines that use diesel when surfaced and batteries when submerged. Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in hydraulic hybrids."
"Switching from one to the other at the proper time while speeding up yields a win-win in terms of energy efficiency, as such that translates into greater fuel efficiency, for example."

"Suhayra Aden (born 1995) is a New Zealander and former dual Australian citizen who travelled to Syria in 2014 to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Because of her connections to ISIL, her Australian citizenship was removed. In February 2021, she was detained by Turkish authorities while trying to enter the country with her two children. Turkey dropped charges against Aden and began proceedings to deport her."
British Vogue
"British ""Vogue"" is a British fashion magazine published based in London since autumn 1916. It is the British version of the American magazine ""Vogue"". The magazine is considered to be one that connects fashion to high society and class."
"Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son."
Um. What kind of
"It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess."
pine?
But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
"and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,"
"the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard"
Uh-huh.
I guess he's young.
"and then,"
yes
He's about five and a half years old.
"Oh, he'll be delighted."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Now I just have to finish it though.
"I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work"
"and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,"
"because I've got it all cut out,"
"it's all, uh,"
I've done most of the coloring
but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
Did you do it with a jigsaw
"or do you have powered, you know, a,"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it."
Um.
So yeah.
"to do the, uh, the turn cut."
"Uh, how about yourself?"
"Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking."
I don't have lots of tools.
And the same way with those calls.
"What is it,"
"oh M C I, M C I really does."
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back."
M C I
what's that?
M C I
it's the long distance telephone company.
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up."
"Uh-huh,"
well they they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.
They just keep calling back.
"I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,"
Uh-huh.
"so, uh, I'm very polite"
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely"
"and I hang up and, don't bother me after that."
Uh
Yeah.
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me.
Uh-huh.
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau."
Oh yeah.
That bothered me.
Uh-huh.
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
Right.
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
and I don't understand what their need to know is.
"Okay,"
what kind of dinner parties have you had?
"Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and I had help with them."
"Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it,"
"I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers"
"and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres"
"and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,"
Uh-huh.
"you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to."
"Whatever you like, huh?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh, you put that in"
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
"and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes"
Um.
and they are so good.
"Oh, that sounds delicious."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
"You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,"
"but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick."
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"and I was just like, we've got to quit this."
And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
"Oh, shoot."
"My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything."
Eat this or <laughter>.
That's right.
"So, I can see the concerns on what different people want."
Yeah.
"Because some,"
"I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
"I think,"
"yeah,"
"I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement."
Uh-huh.
"And just have like at the most, like ten kids."
And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
No.
Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
That's true.
"I, I'd love to do it."
But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.
Yeah.
"I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ..."
More than what it's worth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would scare me.
"in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania"
Uh-huh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
Uh-huh
"Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting."
"So it's really up north in the country, really, ."
"Yeah,"
I guess so.
yeah.
"It's,"
"well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far."
Gosh.
I see.
"So,"
It's pretty nice country up there?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Hills, or what?"
"Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops."
Uh-huh
Is it farmland?
"Um, not a lot of farmland there."
"Mostly it's, uh,"
"I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own uh, growing their own food."
"Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle."
"Oh, yes."
"And even that's, you know, small time mostly."
Sure.
"Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry."
Uh-huh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
"Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out."
"Yeah,"
good.
That's considered a pretty good program.
"It's nice and small, which means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get,  it again."
Huh
"But, uh, it's worth it once you get it."
"Well, yes,"
that's good.
"And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah
Most the class are pretty small.
Good.
That works out real well.
"Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment"
"or a house somewhere, what would you get?"
"Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy."
Uh-huh.
"I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs."
Uh-huh.
"Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, had a hamster or two,"
"and they, they got,  to be a lot of fun."
A hamster.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, it's amazing how much character,"
Okay.
Your family have reunions on a regular basis?
"Probably, once every five years."
"You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with."
"Um, uh-huh."
"You know, they, they see most, uh,"
"they're, they're quite upset about the, uh, the disruptive influence of school."
"Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And in Japan they would be, you know."
Right.
"But, uh, here again, you get back into a political thing, where, uh,"
Yeah
"there's, there's,"
right.
"There's definitely too much leeway as far as,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,"
Uh-huh.
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
"and I, I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,"
"but, I appreciate more what I had."
Uh-huh.
"And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,"
"Yeah,"
were you at Baylor?
and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
"Yeah,"
did you go to Baylor?
"No,"
"I went to U T at Austin,"
uh-huh.
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I'm, uh,"
"Yeah,"
do you?
"Yes,"
that is great.
"Yeah,"
it's fun.
"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
"Oh, really?"
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
It is a real different one.
"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
"But,"
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
"No,"
I haven't watched that.
"Oh, it's, it's really good."
"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
Uh-huh.
and it's set in post World War Two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
It's really interesting.
"Oh, yeah."
It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
Sounds neat.
"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
Yeah.
"Is that on, what what station?"
"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
"Oh, okay."
What other shows do you like?
exactly.
they have to just go through everything.
Exactly.
"And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down,  something will slow you down."
Uh-huh.
Do you know what I'm saying?
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling the roses,"
"and I know that sounds trite,  and all that."
"Yeah,"
"I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way,"
"I know, I'm probably feeling that way because it's, everything's geared towards young.  You know"
Uh-huh.
"and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young,  young, young, young."
Oh it is.
"You can't be a model after thirty,"
"you can't do this after twenty, you know"
"and,  everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen.  You know,"
That's right.
Uh-huh.
and so I feel like I'm old.
"It's like I sing,  I sing"
"and I would really love to become,  uh, a professional singer,"
Uh-huh.
"but I think I'm too old now,"
"Oh, you're not,"
no.
"and I'm twenty-three,"
No.
"because everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen.  You know,"
That's true
Quite a difference.
Yeah.
"What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?"
"Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently"
"so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area"
and it's very very nice
Oh.
"and,"
"The only experience I have,"
I don't have any children
"but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school."
"And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked."
"And I just, uh ..."
<talking> Yeah.
"That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby-sit."
Is it? ery faint.
"But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care."
"Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers."
"Oh, yeah."
The expense.
Yeah.
"Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock"
or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that
Uh-huh.
Which is understandable.
"I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late"
Just sit around
That that's true.
but
"See the lady I did it for,"
that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.
So she could sleep in.
same here.
"Uh, very seldom are they any different."
"And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen"
Uh-huh.
and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.
"Oh, okay."
"And then we put our receipts in there, you know,"
and usually that's enough.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them."
Right.
Luckily I don't either.
"I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick"
"but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
right.
"In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day"
"But you so you know what I'm saying,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?"
"I,"
sometimes it can be.
Yeah.
Sometimes it can be.
I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.
Uh-huh.
"But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing"
so.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I'm not working right now."
"Yeah,"
"unfortunately it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and  where they are at particular points of the day."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, the, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, quite a bit, uh, more pronounced, uh"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, yeah."
"I guess,"
"I mean,"
"I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis,"
"I'm not real sure. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"it helps to know your neighbors, you know."
"They give you,"
"you're supposed to make lists of, uh, cars."
"Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we, we have a list"
"is that what you, you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates?"
Pretty much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I was, I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it."
Uh-huh.
And then I left right in the middle of it.
"I'm not sure  where we went from there,"
"Oh, uh-huh."
"but,"
Yeah. Well.
"Yeah,"
"that, that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious uh, activities like that, sure."
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,"
"but, then, again, they may they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,"
"you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,"
"they get so fast, you know."
I didn't know that.
"Yeah,"
"they get pretty quick,"
but
That that would be something.
"uh,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I haven't, I haven't personally done that,"
"but, uh, the races,"
"I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, races catamarans in the summertime"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it."
"He's got a good, uh,"
"What kind of, what lake do you all use?"
"Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit"
Uh-huh.
"so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. Uh,"
"for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast."
"We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,"
"and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know."
"So, uh, so that's a good thing."
Yeah.
"But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job?"
"Uh, I build transformers."
"Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know."
Yeah.
That's true.
"And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem."
Exactly what happened to them.
I'm building my own house.
"Oh, that's nice."
"And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today"
"Oh, really."
Yeah.
Are you doing it yourself?
Yeah.
Wow.
I used to be a builder.
"Oh, that's nice."
And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
"Oh, I see."
Huh.
And now I'm a college educated builder
"There's still no work, you know."
Yeah.
"So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials"
so I did.
That's great.
"And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home."
is that so?
I didn't know that.
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
Well that sounds kind of dumb.
"Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home"
Uh-huh.
"It really does, except when you have to fill them up"
and then you get those Visa bills in.
And
Yeah.
"So anyway, um, anything else about the area, about, um,"
"you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there."
Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.
This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five.
Yeah.
"So it's, it's,"
"Everybody has got a pretty good size yard,"
Yeah.
"I mean, I got probably the biggest,"
"if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it,  in the entire neighborhood."
Yeah.
That's nice.
That is nice.
"But, you know, too, the only bad thing, too, is that then you have to keep up, you know,"
"you have to,  the yard to deal with"
"Well, I,  I enjoy that though."
"and,"
Do you.
"You must have more time than, than I have."
I'm sitting out here right now.
We had this terrible rain
and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
and it seems like
"now that's, that's,"
"I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. You know,"
It's rained
Yeah.
"Well, um, I don't know, do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time?"
"and, uh, acorn squash are good winter keepers."
Yeah.
"I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste"
Uh-huh.
"you know, we eat it, we,"
just too much.
"She, she starts her own plants."
She plants a lot of tomatoes
Uh-huh.
"I let her do all the planting and putting,"
"and I, I do a lot of the, uh, a lot of the, the the back work, and stuff."
"But she does, she helps me a lot, too."
Uh-huh.
She puts a lot of financial.
She plans it all out.
Beans like to be near certain types of plants.
"Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, uh, peas,"
I don't know.
"Something,"
"Oh, really"
"because of like the cross-pollination,"
"or,"
"No,"
"it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans."
"I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off,"
they just don't like each other.
Huh.
"I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books,"
"so. I wish I knew more to tell you why,"
"but,"
"Huh. My mom put, uh, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once,"
and the got cross pollinated by the bees
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah"
"I guess it's what sells newspapers, you know."
It's a very low way of living.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, so,"
"and, and, and as far as, uh, you know, myself having any particular personal, uh, knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, it, I'm not terribly involved in it."
Uh-huh
Just in a very cursory way.
Right.
I vote
"and I, you know, try to do whatever I can on the little local area,"
"but, I, I, it just is not one of the things that I have, uh, placed, uh, uh, a, a lot of my particular time and effort into,"
Yeah.
"so, I, I always feel very outside this kind of, uh, this kind of an issue."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
I am kind of the same way.
"I just kind of read the paper follow up on I mean, you know, just keep an eye on what's going on"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
right.
but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
"Yeah,"
"uh,"
"Uh, uh-huh."
"I'm not, I'm not in there,"
"I'm not one of those, uh, you know, volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever, uh, although I admire the people that do that"
and they certainly do get inside information
Uh-huh.
"really,"
especially in Texas
"Oh, I know it"
"The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful."
"It really was,"
yeah.
"So I don't know,"
"I, I,"
"it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go."
Yeah
Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
"Yeah,"
"I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem,"
and I think it could get worse.
Yeah.
"You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude,"
"and say, huh, you know, why should we vote,"
"then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things."
Yeah.
"It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting."
Uh-huh.
"Right, uh,"
"yeah,"
"we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull."
"Yeah,"
"it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected."
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Kind of scary when you think about that.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, who's the other guy, LaRouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but"
"he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's probably a good thing.
It's probably the safest thing.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum"
Yep
and simple majority won't do.
No.
"And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"yeah,"
quorums are to easy to get.
Yep.
"And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know."
"So it's, it's"
definitely
"but, uh, I don't know."
"I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing."
Yeah.
Like Gives them a little too much power
Yeah
"I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently."
"But, uh,"
"Plus, you know, you may be, you know, doing, you know, a, a guilty verdict"
"but it may not be, you know, it may be for technical reasons"
Yeah.
"About the only good thing I would say about that is it that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit"
Yeah.
"but I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that"
and  that's what the trial by jury.
"and on the water pump, it was all metric."
"And, and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, uh  screw lock uh, uh, radiator hose clamps."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Essentially they do that though
"because if, if you look at General Motors, the size"
"and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler."
"If they all went, if they all went metric,"
"but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, when you're milling something, uh  you simply set your, uh, equipment,"
Yeah.
"or, or you or you got your calipers there"
"and, and you measure, you know,"
you mic it to see if it's accurate
and.
Right.
It's it's not a problem either way.
No.
"Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car."
Yeah.
And you go to look at it
"and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric."
Yeah.
"and, and, you're never quite sure,"
"well, is that a metric bolt."
"You get you a pair of metric pliers, right"
"Right,"
right.
And you beat on it
and a metric hammer
"It, it can be annoying"
"and my other concern is, is the American government going to force us to go."
Yeah.
Yeah
"I know a lot of companies that waste so much that,"
"I'm even trying,"
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
Yes.
"and I thought, I don't understand this, you know."
Yeah.
"We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff"
"and, and here we are wasting."
"And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it."
"Well the last time, uh, someone moved offices in my building"
"and, uh, the, uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes."

"The film was released on VHS in 1995 in Canada by Cineplex Odeon, but as of April 19, 2010, a DVD of the film has yet to be announced."
"Lizette acquires four front-row tickets to the Dan Hill concert in Toronto, Ontario - one for her, one for her husband, Terry (Scott Renderer), one for Simon (Andrew Miller), and one for Simon's date. At the very last minute, Simon's date cancels and the group decides to invite Cheryl Ann to fill the seat."
"Cheryl Ann becomes a memorable character not far into the film. She is eager, possesses an open attitude, and has a positive outlook on life no matter what comes at her. Her mother is dying, and she wishes to bring her to Greece for treatment from a ""miracle man."" Her car sometimes doesn't start and most of the time she ends up walking all the way to her job with Lizette at the donut shop. Despite the unfortunate events she is constantly victim to, Cheryl Ann sees the good in everything."
"Lizzette wants nothing more but to escape their small town of Stayner, (now Clearview), and everything in it, including her coworker Cheryl Ann. So when she receives the news that Cheryl Ann will be joining the group for the trip, she is anything but amused. The problem is that Simon will not go on the trip without a date, and Terry will not go without Simon. Both men would rather stay in town and attend the local hockey game, however Lizette wants this trip to be a success and therefore allows Cheryl Ann to come along."
"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the evening does not go according to plan and the friends must examine their relationships with eachorther and others in town."
"The film's soundtrack includes songs by Cowboy Junkies, Rickie Lee Jones, Lyle Lovett and Lee Aaron."

DeltaPlex Arena is a venue usable for not only sports and concerts but also trade shows, conventions, concerts and special events."
"The original building was constructed in 1952, and began life as the Stadium Arena. The building had an arched roof design with wooded arch supports instead of steel. The building housed many different tenants including two defunct IHL Hockey teams. The Grand Rapids Rockets in the 1950s (an NAHL team of the same name played in the building during the 1990s) and the Grand Rapids Owls in the late 1970s until 1980. During the 1960s and early 1970s it was home to Atlantic Mills Department Store. It was also home for a short time to a drive-in theater, known as the Stadium Drive-In Theater. For most of its life it was located at the corner of Turner Ave. and West River Drive. However, due to a reconstruction of West River Drive, the parking lot was enlarged and Turner Ave. ended at West River Drive."
"It was the Grand Rapids area's main indoor entertainment facility until the opening of Van Andel Arena in 1996. In the mid-1990s the building was sold to the Langlois Family. After the purchase an extensive, ground-up restoration and remodeling regimen followed and the newly christened DeltaPlex was born."

"Sevier was born in 1896 in Madison Parish, Louisiana, a son of the former Roxie Roberta Allen and James Douglas Sevier, Sr., a native of Port Gibson, in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. His parents moved to Madison Parish in 1880, where his father became a planter. Sevier attended local segregated schools for his lower education. He graduated in 1917 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge."
"His father's family were descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and pioneer and first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. His line became prominent in northeastern Louisiana. One of Henry's cousins was Andrew L. Sevier, who served as a Louisiana State Senator with repeated reelection, from 1932 until his death in office in 1962."
"During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals."
"After the war, in 1918 Sevier married the former Retta Brooks (1899-1992) of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. The couple had three children: Carolyn S. Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish."
"Sevier and his wife went to New York City, where he completed postgraduate work at Columbia University in 1921. He graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center, and they settled in Tallulah."
"There Sevier entered into practice with Jefferson B. Snyder of Tallulah, the political boss of the delta parishes in northeastern Louisiana. Snyder wielded power for more than 40 years as the regional district attorney, from 1904 to 1948."
"Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978)."
"Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested."
"After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.) The senior Sevier was also president of the Tallulah State Bank and Trust Company. Given these additional responsibilities, and having served eight terms in the state house, he chose not to run again after his term ending in 1952."

"Eaton Chapel is a private chapel to the north of Eaton Hall in Eaton Park, near the village of Eccleston, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"Building of the chapel commenced in 1869, soon after the estate was inherited by Hugh Grosvenor, the 3rd Marquess of Westminster, in conjunction with a major rebuilding of the hall. Grosvenor became the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1874. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse as architect and the building was completed in 1884. When the Waterhouse hall was demolished in 1963, the chapel was retained."
"The chapel is built in buff sandstone with a grey slate roof. Internally the stone is in pink and buff bands. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave that is continuous with a three-bay chancel. The chancel terminates with a three-sided apse containing the altar. The chapel is oriented with the altar at the west end. The last bay at the east end constitutes a narthex (ante-chapel) with a gallery. On the south of the chapel is a tower which is free-standing, but joined to the chapel at the lower two storeys, and by a bridge above. At the southeast corner is a staircase turret. On the south side of the nave and in the apse are two-light windows and at the east end behind the gallery is a four-light window. The tower has six stages and contains tall lancet bell-openings. Above these is the clock stage, corbelled out from the shaft of the tower and surmounted by pinnacles at each corner. On each side is a clock face made from vitreous enamel; each clock face is in diameter. Over this is a spire decorated with gables and pinnacles. The staircase turret is surmounted by a spire."
"The narthex at the east end has a groin vaulted oak roof, and is paved with black marble and with encaustic tiles. A stone screen leads into the nave. This also has a groin vaulted roof, but built in stone. Between the nave and the chancel is a low alabaster screen. A continuation of this screen leads to the pulpit: this is also constructed in alabaster with Devonshire marble columns. The reredos and the font are also made in alabaster. The benches in the nave and chancel are in walnut and have carved ends. In the chancel is a recumbent effigy in alabaster of Constance, 1st Duchess of Westminster, by Joseph Boehm. For the effigy, Boehm worked from plaster casts of the face and hands taken after her death."
"The stained glass in the windows of the south side of the nave and the apse, and the mosaics in the blank on the north side of the nave were designed by Frederic Shields. These were commissioned in 1876 and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The two-manual organ is in an alcove on the south side of the chancel. It was built in 1870–71 by Charles Whitley of Chester and is still in good working order. The clock tower contains a carillon of 28 bells which were cast by Chavalier Severian Van Aerschodt of Louvain; it plays 31 tunes. The clock was manufactured by Gillet's of Croydon."
"The chapel continues to be the private chapel of the Grosvenor family and is used for family christenings, confirmations and memorial services. Each December it is made available for up to eight charities to arrange carol concerts. The chapel is also open to the general public on three annual open days."

Ostensibly it all seemed harmless, but the personnel all belonged to Jamat-e-Islami front organisations in Britain.

"Norcot is an area of the suburb of Tilehurst in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading."
"Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor."
"The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road."
"The ward of Norcot is west of the town centre and is bordered by Kentwood (the far western ward), Battle (the inner western ward), Southcote and Tilehurst wards."
"As with all wards, apart from smaller Mapledurham, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four."
"In the 2011, 2012 and 2014 a Labour Party candidate won each election."

"The film begins at a village Accha Rao (Rajendra Prasad) an innocent craven leads a rejoicing life. He acquires a constable job, proceeds to take charge where the Station S.I. (Vallabhaneni Janardhan) is malicious. Here, their Head Constable (P. L. Narayana) endears Accha Rao's amiable nature, gives him shelter and his daughter Seeta (Kanaka) loves Accha Rao. Meanwhile, a new scheme commences in the town by a company to sell household goods at the lowest prices. The company agent Peter (Sai Kumar) collects huge amounts as advance from the public. Thereupon, the Company turns fraudulent and the Proprietor's son tries to escape with the money when Peter restricts his way. In that quarrel, accidentally, he dies in the hands of Peter when S.I. takes him into custody and tortures terribly. Just as, Accha Rao shows his solace which Peter exploits and absconds. So to protect Accha Rao, Head Constable takes the guilt. Right now, to redeem himself, Accha Rao moves to nab Peter along with Seeta. At present, the district S.P. (Kota Shankar Rao) instructs S.I. to present Accha Rao & Peter before him. Parallelly, the Company Proprietor (M. S. Gopinath) bids the S.I. to slay them out. In that process, Accha Rao meets his mother (Radha Kumari) and learns that Peter's wife (Sailaja) is terminally ill. Be concerned, Accha Rao looks after them, even finds whereabouts of Peter and unites him with his wife. Thereafter, Peter surrenders himself to Police. Simultaneously, Accha Rao goes into the clutches of the Company Proprietor. Both of them try to slaughter Accha Rao & Peter, but Accha Rao breaks out by eliminating the blackguard and rushes towards Peter. By that time, S.I. encounters Peter and tries to kill Accha Rao too. Fortuitously, the S.P. witnesses it and knocks out the S.I. Finally, Accha Rao is promoted as S.I. and the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Accha Rao & Seeta."

= = = Printer's sample stamp = = =
"A printer's sample stamp is a label produced by a printer resembling a stamp, but with no postal or other validity. Often it will include the name of the printer and demonstrate their printing capabilities. The stamps are not intended for use and are therefore to be distinguished from test stamps, though both test stamps and printer's sample stamps are dummy stamps in the broadest sense of that term."
"The R.M. Phillips Collection at the British Postal Museum and Archive contains a number of sample stamps produced by De La Rue before 1900, bearing their name and demonstrating their printing abilities for the British Post Office."
"Waterlow & Sons produced many small sheetlets of sample stamps in the same design as genuine stamps produced for their customers, but with the colours changed and overprinted diagonally ""Waterlow & Sons Ltd. Specimen"". The stamps in these sheetlets were also punched with a small hole in the corner to prevent their postal or revenue use and the sheetlets were displayed at the 1910 Brussels Exhibition. Clive Akerman comments in ""The Presentation of Revenue Stamps: Taxes and Duties in South America"", that the stamps were produced from obsolete dies."
"The ""Prince Consort Essay"" was a printer's sample stamp created in 1851 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds."
"Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp."
"The concept has been used worldwide with modern sample stamps from printers in Switzerland and the Netherlands, amongst other countries, commonly seen in philatelic circles."

"Dr. Shrinker was a segment during the first season of the ABC network's ""The Krofft Supershow"" in 1976."
"Dr. Shrinker (Jay Robinson) is a mad scientist who creates a shrink ray that can miniaturise anything. Three young adults — Brad Fulton (Ted Eccles), B.J. Masterson (Susan Lawrence) and her brother Gordie Masterson (Jeff MacKay) — crash land their airplane on an island. As they make their way to the only house on the island, they meet Dr. Shrinker and his assistant, Hugo (Billy Barty). Dr. Shrinker, in an effort to prove that his shrinking ray works, shrinks the three people down to tall. The remainder of the series was different efforts by the 'Shrinkies' to return to normal size, while Dr. Shrinker and Hugo want to catch the trio so that they will have physical proof that the ray works for whatever world power wants to buy it. Dr. Shrinker also implied that he would give the unnamed buyer the Shrinkies as a free bonus. However, in one episode, Dr. Shrinker's plan was to sell the shrink ray to the highest bidder, and the second highest bidder would receive the Shrinkies."
"Each episode was basically the same. As Dr. Shrinker himself said in one episode...""I chase the Shrinkies. I catch the Shrinkies. The Shrinkies escape. It's a vicious cycle, and it's driving me mad!"""
"The concept was very likely inspired by the 1940 film ""Dr. Cyclops"" in which a scientist working in the South American jungle uses his radiation experiments to shrink a group of fellow scientists to prevent them from discovering his secret work."
"""Dr. Shrinker"" lasted only one season on the ""Krofft Supershow"". During the second season, it was dropped (as was the superhero segment ""Electra Woman and Dyna Girl"").

= = = Pupil Referral Unit = = =
"In the UK, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) (previously known as Pupil Re-integration Unit by some Local Education Authorities) is an alternative education provision which is specifically organised to provide education for children who aren't able to attend school and may not otherwise receive suitable education. This could be because they have a short- or long-term illness, have been excluded, or are a new starter waiting for a mainstream school place."
Each LEA has a duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school. Placing pupils in PRUs is just one of the ways in which local authorities can ensure that they can comply with this duty. PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.
"There are currently over 421 PRUs in England. Between 2002 and 2003, 17,523 pupils attended PRUs at some point. Although PRUs do not have to provide a full National Curriculum, they should offer a basic curriculum which includes English, mathematics, the sciences, PSHE and ICT."
"A PRU is treated the same as any other type of school, subject to the same inspections from Ofsted. Since September 2010, some PRUs are referred to as ""Short Stay Schools"", although the government still broadly refer to them as PRUs or Alternative Provision (APs)."

"Within five years of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, replaced by a one-story porch. Other modifications were the addition of a conservatory and the demolition of outbuildings, including a stable. Upon Thompson's death the house was sold by his widow to Colonel Ernest H. Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would look too opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it."
"By 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark."
"The association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970."
Letters and diary entries written by Louise Taft during her time in the home helped preservationists to return the domicile to how it appeared during William's childhood.

These branches were omitted from the system plan for Conrail in 1976 and would have been discontinued without state subsidies. As an alternative to the higher cost of subsidizing Conrail as operator of the branch lines, the Maryland and Delaware governments selected the Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company (MDDE) to serve as the designated operator."
"The railroad did not own any of the track it uses until 2000 when it acquired a line between Frankford, Delaware and Snow Hill, Maryland, from the Snow Hill Shippers Association. Today, the railroad operates on 120 miles of track and runs out of a restored station in Federalsburg, Maryland. The new engine house in Massey, MD, was opened in the fall of 2019."
"MDDE incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 20, 1977 as a closely held, small railroad company. At that time, the states of Maryland and Delaware were paying subsidies to Conrail for branch lines, still owned by Penn Central, serving rural communities."
"The Maryland Department of Transportation selected MDDE to operate three of the rural branch lines in August 1977. These included the current Northern and Seaford Lines, and the discontinued branch between Clayton, Delaware and Easton, Maryland. Maryland purchased the two branches served by the MDDE Northern and Seaford Lines."
Snow Hill Shippers Association purchased the branch currently known as the Snow Hill Line in 1982 and hired MDDE to serve as operator. MDDE became owner of the branch in 2000.
"MDDE was awarded a five-year contract by Delaware in 1994 to operate a branch between Ellendale, Delaware and Milton, Delaware, and another branch between Georgetown, Delaware and Lewes, Delaware. These branches were part of the former Queen Anne's Railroad, which began providing rail service between Queenstown, Maryland and Lewes, Delaware in 1894, and extended its track to Love Point, Maryland in 1902. MDDE did not seek renewal of the Delaware contract and operation of the two lines was returned to the previous contractor, Delaware Coast Line Railroad, in 1999."
The 5-year operating contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation for the North Line and Seaford Line became effective in 2008. Two 5-year renewal options allow the contract to be extended until 2023.

Colin Richardson was the initial producer for the album, but stepped down after four weeks due to creative differences."
"A music video was shot for the song ""Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel"" which was produced and directed by Grupa 13, and Dariusz Szermanowicz. The video premiered on the Behemoth YouTube channel on December 3, 2013."
"On January 7, 2014, Behemoth released the first part of their video prologue for this album. Subsequently, the second part was released on January, 14, the third part was released on January, 21, and the fourth part was released on January, 29. Earlier, on January 28, the official lyric video for the song ""Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer"" was released."
"The song ""In the Absence ov Light"" contains a spoken word quote from the Witold Gombrowicz drama ""The Marriage"" (pol. ""Ślub"") which states:"
"Upon its release, ""The Satanist"" received universal acclaim reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 92, which indicates ""universal acclaim"", based on 10 reviews. Joe DiVita of Loudwire noted that the album ""sees the band shed away that skin as they simultaneously get back to some of their blackened roots while exploring new areas with ... dynamic songwriting"". The album would claim the top spot on Loudwire's list of the best metal albums of 2014, with Loudwire stating that ""The disc is a masterpiece from beginning to end, with absolutely no filler to be skipped over""."
"Grayson Currin of Pitchfork said """"The Satanist"" is a terrific coil of most everything Behemoth have ever done well, a strangely hopeful vision of hell wrested away from its very grip."" The editorial staff of Dutch webzine Lords of Metal named it the third best album of 2014, after a score of 93/100 for the initial album review."
"In 2019 the album was voted as the ""Best Metal Album of the Decade"" by various publications such as Loudwire, Consequence of Sound, WhatCulture and others."

= = = Relay Graduate School of Education = = =
Relay Graduate School of Education is a private graduate school for teachers in New York City and other cities across the nation. It was established in 2011 after being spun off from Hunter College's Teacher U program. It is the first stand-alone graduate school of education to open in New York since Bank Street College of Education was founded in 1916.
"The New York Board of Regents approved the school unanimously with one abstention. Alternative certification programs such as Teach for America and the New York City Teaching Fellows utilize existing colleges for required coursework, while Relay GSE provides its own course program. Teacher U CEO Norman Atkins was chosen as the graduate school's president."
"Teacher U was founded by three charter school networks ""with impressive student achievement records"": KIPP, Achievement First, and Uncommon Schools. The school will serve charter school and district teachers. There was opposition to the school's establishment from some of New York's existing universities that offer teacher education programs."
"On September 7, 2013, Relay GSE held the commencement ceremony for its first graduating class of students on Pier 60 at Chelsea Piers in New York City."
"The school has since expanded nationwide, with additional campuses in Baton Rouge, Chicago, Connecticut, Delaware, Denver, Houston, Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Newark, Philadelphia, Camden, and San Antonio."

"The Hovey Fund was created by a bequest from Charles Fox Hovey (1807-1859), a Boston merchant who supported a variety of social reform movements. Hovey left $50,000 to support abolitionism and other types of social reform, including ""women's rights, non-resistance, free trade and temperance."""
"Hovey appointed a committee of trustees to administer the fund, headed by abolitionist Wendell Phillips. Hovey specified that the funds should be spent at the rate of $8,000 per year to meet immediate needs."
The fund paid Susan B. Anthony's salary ($12 per week) while she coordinated the Women's Loyal National League's massive petition drive asking Congress to approve an amendment that would abolish slavery.
"With 400,000 signatures, it was the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, gathering signatures from approximately one out every twenty-four adults in the Northern states and significantly contributing to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."
= = = Kuha-class minesweeper (1974) = = =
The Kuha class minesweepers () is a series of six inshore minesweepers of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1974-1975. All the vessels of the class were modified and modernized in the late 1990s. This included a lengthening of the hull.
"The vessels have a glass fibre hull and are amongst the largest vessels built in this material. They are equipped with hydraulic machinery, and its engines are placed in the aft part of the superstructure. The engines are separated from the hull with rubber springs. The engine power is transferred to the propeller unit (which can turn 360 degrees) through two separate hydraulic valves; in this manner the vessels are as quiet as possible, and it has been possible to completely eliminate propeller axles, which are very difficult to silence and are easily damaged in mine explosions."
"The vessels are very lightly armed with only a twin anti-aircraft gun and a couple of heavy machine guns; ""Kuha 22"" is an exception, as it assumes an anti-aircraft readiness role. It is therefore equipped with a couple more guns than its sister vessels."
"The ""Kuha"" class vessels usually operate together with some vessels of the ""Kiiski"" class, and they can sweep both impact and influence mines."
"The ""Kuha"" class will be retired when the ""Katanpää"" class mine countermeasure vessels enter active service."

"Jandro was born in Mieres, Asturias. A product of Valencia CF's youth system, he played three times for the first team in a three-year span (with a stint at CD Numancia in between, where he did not appear. Subsequently, he had another La Liga spell with RC Celta de Vigo, also featuring sparingly during two seasons and being loaned in between."
"After helping Celta regain its top flight status in 2005, scoring 12 league goals, Jandro moved to Deportivo Alavés also in the top division, being immediately relegated. He signed with Gimnàstic de Tarragona in summer 2007 and, after two second level seasons with the Catalans as first-choice, continued in that tier as he joined Elche CF on a two-year contract."
"On 11 March 2010, after appearing rarely for the club – but netting three times – Jandro was released by mutual consent. In late July he signed with another club in division two, Girona FC, and scored 11 goals while playing in all 42 games (38 starts, nearly 3,500 minutes of action) in his first season, with his team eventually ranking 11th."

= = = 31st Reserve Field Artillery Regiment (Ireland) = = =
"The 31st Reserve Field Artillery Regiment was a field artillery unit of the Southern Brigade Irish Reserve Defence Forces tasked with the defence of part of County Tipperary and also with providing support to the 1st FAR, a unit of the Irish Army."
"The Corps of Artillery of the Irish Army was founded in 1924, and based in Connolly Barracks in the Curragh Camp. The Patron saint of the corps is Saint Barbara, and she appears on the corps insignia sitting astride a cannon. The 31st FAR came into being on 1 October 2005, and was made up of units from the former reserve structure, the FCÁ. The units which were disbanded in order to form the new 31st FAR were the 8th FAR (Cork), 3rd FAR (Tipperary) and part of the 14th Infantry Battalion also from Tipperary."
The 8th FAR was originally formed in Ballincollig in 1979. It was made up of the reserve batteries which had once formed part of the 1st FAR. The regiment consisted of two batteries: 2nd Battery (25 Pounder field guns) and 21st Heavy Mortar Battery (120 mm Mortars). The unit moved to Collins Barracks in Cork City following the closure of Ballincollig Barracks. 2nd Battery and 21st Battery merged to become 1st Battery of the 31st FAR on 1 October 2005.
"The unit had both ceremonial and training commitments, with annual artillery practice held in the Glen of Imaal in Co Wicklow in July of each year. A camp was also held around Easter time which focused on small arms training. Reservists from this unit were often invited to participate in training courses outside the unit, and members also participated in Defence Forces sporting events and shooting competitions, and have won several medals across a variety of events."
"The Pistol Team from 1st Battery was in the forefront of army shooting competitions for some years. In January 2005, members of the 8th FAR (later the 1st Battery) were called upon to take part in a ceremonial 21-gun salute in honour of the City of Cork becoming the European Capital of Culture. Other ceremonial duties have included committing a contingent of reservists to represent the 1st Southern Brigade at the National Day of Remembrance ceremony at Kilmainham. Reservists in the 31st FAR were also trained in Infantry Tactics, Amphibious operations, Fighting in Built Up Areas (FIBUA) and Peace Support Operations."
"The unit used 25 Pounder field guns and L118 and L119 105 mm Light guns. Some smooth-bore Brandt 120 mm heavy mortars were in the unit's possession but this obsolete weapon was later removed from service, while the 25 pounder became an exclusively ceremonial weapon. The unit acquired a number of 120 mm Ruag mortars."
"Morphisms in monoidal categories can also be drawn as string diagrams since a strict monoidal category can be seen as a 2-category with only one object (there will therefore be only one type of planar region) and Mac Lane's strictification theorem states that any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. The graphical language of string diagrams for monoidal categories may be extended to represent expressions in categories with other structure, such as braided monoidal categories, dagger categories, etc. and is related to geometric presentations for braided monoidal categories and ribbon categories. In quantum computing, there are several diagrammatic languages based on string diagrams for reasoning about linear maps between qubits, the most well-known of which is the ZX-calculus."

"Lewis Archer Boswell (May 9, 1834 – November 26, 1909) was an early aviation pioneer who some believe made the first powered heavier-than-air flight, before the Wright Brothers."
"Born May 9, 1834 in Lunenburg County, Virginia, Boswell went to study at Thomas Jefferson University and later Johns Hopkins University, earning his medical degree. During the Civil War, he worked as a Confederate surgeon in Richmond, Virginia."
"In 1868 Boswell began experimenting in aeronautics, but supposedly threw his small model into the Yazoo River that same year. It is unknown why he did this, although speculation points to the purpose of hiding his plans or ending local ridicule. He moved to Eastaboga, Alabama in 1869 with his new wife, where he was granted a patent for an in 1874."
"While he continued his study until his death on November 26, 1909, it is unknown if he ever built a full-scale model and attempted flight. In 1900, he wrote a letter to the Secretary of War, asking for funding and promising results, but it was rejected. Locals in his area have made claims that he actually did fly in November 1902, beating the Wright Brothers by a year. In fact, at the time of his death, Boswell was pursuing lawsuit against them, but this action was never carried through by his estate. Other stories tell that he made a short flight after being rolled off a barn roof back in the mid-1890s. However, no conclusive proof has surfaced to support these claims."
"In 2002, the local airport in Talladega, Alabama was renamed Boswell Field in honor of the local aviator, and according to the Airport Board Chairman, if Boswell made the first heavier than air flight, that would make Boswell Field the first airport."

"The music in the film features a number of indie-rock artists, notably the Shins. In an early scene, Sam passes Andrew a headset which is playing the song ""New Slang"" by the Shins as she says ""You gotta hear this one song — it’ll change your life; I swear."" A second Shins song, ""Caring Is Creepy"", is also featured on the soundtrack. The presence of Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" on the soundtrack has been cited by some as evidence of a connection to ""The Graduate""."
"The song ""Orange Sky"" by Alexi Murdoch was also featured in the movie, but did not appear on the soundtrack, as the rights to the song were owned by Fox's ""The O.C."" It was played between ""New Slang"" and ""I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You"" in the film. Additionally, ""Love Will Come Through"" by Travis was used in the film’s trailer, but never made it into the film or onto its soundtrack. The trailer also featured ""Such Great Heights"" in the original version by the Postal Service rather than the Iron & Wine cover used in the film. The song ""Chocolate"" by Snow Patrol appeared in the commercials but didn't appear on the soundtrack. The song ""Adelita"" by Francisco Tárrega was played on guitar by Peter Sarsgaard when he was talking to Zach Braff in his room, and played on the video of Sam ice skating in the alligator costume.

"In an episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" hosted by Braff, Braff plays a high school student in a skit where various high school interest groups are attempting to select a theme for the upcoming senior prom. Braff’s character suggests a ""Garden State"" theme because the soundtrack ""changed [his] life"", but the prom committee describes it as a ""Pitchfork mix CD"".

"The see became one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells in 1152, and has approximately the same boundaries as those of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne. In the Irish annals, the bishops were recorded of ""Breifne"", ""Breifni"", ""Breifny"", ""Tir-Briuin"", or ""Ui-Briuin-Breifne""."
"In the second half of the 12th century, it is likely the sees of Breifne and Kells were ruled together under one bishop. In 1172, Tuathal Ua Connachtaig took the oath of fealty to King Henry II of England as bishop of Kells. Soon after 1211 the see of Kells was incorporated into the diocese of Meath."
"In 1454, Pope Nicholas V gave permission for the then bishop, Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Anglicised: Andrew McBrady), to have the ancient church at Kilmore, founded in the 6th century by Saint Felim (or Feithlimidh), to be the cathedral church of the diocese. This building passed into the hands of the Church of Ireland at the Reformation, and, following the construction of a new cathedral, is now used as a parochial hall."
"After the upheavals of the Reformation, there were parallel apostolic successions: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church."
"In the Church of Ireland, the title was intermittently held with Ardagh until they were finally united in 1839. In 1841, the sees of Kilmore and Ardagh were amalgamated with Elphin to form the united bishopric of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The current incumbent is The Right Reverend Samuel Ferran Glenfield M.A. M.Th. (Oxon.) M.Litt. He was elected, consecrated, and installed in 2013."
"In the Roman Catholic, the title continues as a separate bishopric. The most recent Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore was the Most Reverend Philip Leo O'Reilly, who succeeded as the diocesan bishop on 16 October and installed at the Cathedral Church of Saints Patrick and Felim, Cavan on 15 November 1998. He had been appointed coadjutor bishop of Kilmore by the Holy See on 20 November 1996 and received episcopal ordination on 2 February 1997. He resigned on 31 December 2018 on health grounds."

"Gil Gutiérrez (born May 1, 1962 in Oaxaca, Mexico) is a virtuoso Mexican guitarist"
"His mother sent him to study sculpture, painting and ceramics at the art academy in Oaxaca. It was there that he heard the sounds of classical music and learned to play cello on a borrowed instrument. He then switched to a guitar which was a gift from his brother, because his family could not afford a cello. At the Benito Juarez Autonomous University in Oaxaca, Gutiérrez studied classical guitar and his musical interests spread to diverse genres including classical, flamenco, son cubano and jazz."
"At age fourteen he began playing classical guitar in restaurants in Oaxaca and caught the attention of German born guitarist Wolfgang “Lobo” Fink of Willie & Lobo. At 17, he teamed up with Fink to play venues in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. When Fink returned to Germany, Gutiérrez went to Mexico City to study jazz earning money by playing his guitar on city buses. The guitarist has played in South America and Spain with Ana Gabriel, Ricardo Arjona, Francisco Cespedes, and Pedro Guerra. A virtuoso with the nylon string guitar and tres, Gutiérrez has performed at the Kennedy Center, the Mexican Cultural Institute of the Mexican Embassy in Washington D.C. and to a crowd of 10,000 people at Millennium Park, Chicago.Gutierrez is recognized for his unique ability to connect with the audience and channeling a bit of the local energy into each performance."
"Gutiérrez talent was then discovered by Doc Severinsen who heard him play in a restaurant in San Miguel de Allende. Severinsen led the NBC Orchestra for twenty years on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show. They recorded their first album together in 2007 called En Mi Corazon. Gutierrez is the band leader, founder and musical director of the group the San Miguel 5 and they have performed with symphony orchestras across the United States. Other musicians of the San Miguel 5 include Grammy award winning violinist Charlie Bisharat, Cuban percussionist Jimmy Branly and bass player Kevin Thomas. In 2011 Gil Gutiérrez and Doc Severinsen played at New York City’s Carnegie Hall accompanied by the New York Pops under the direction of conductor Steven Reineke. Gutiérrez has performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony, Florida Symphony and with the Doc Severinsen Big Band Tour in Dallas, Texas. In 2013 he was the featured artist and directed the ensemble at the Calaca Festival honoring Chavela Vargas in San Miguel de Allende. Constantly pushing boundaries as a musical director he brings together new combinations of musicians and musical styles. These include opera, jazz, cantaor flamenco, Cuban and Mexican styles to create performances considered the cultural vanguard. Among his works are performances of his original compositions with the New York Choral Society and scoring of several films including El Cochero, El Alcazar de Chapultepec and Una Causa Noble. Gutiérrez composed and performed the soundtrack for the documentary film Lost and Found in Mexico. In 2013 Gutierrez was featured in the National Geographic Traveler documentary The Granny Diaries.

"Diogo Veloso, or Diego Belloso in the Spanish historical accounts, (Amarante 1558 - Cambodja 1599) was a Portuguese adventurer active in Southeast Asia in the last quarter of 16th century, acting sometimes in the service of the Spanish Governor of the Spanish East Indies (within the Cambodian–Spanish War) and sometimes as a free-lancer. He and Spanish Blas Ruiz were the first Europeans to ever set foot in Laos."
"Veloso's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Veloso met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Ruiz of Spain. When Lovek was invaded by Ayutthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Veloso to flee to Portuguese Malacca, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Veloso returned with Ruiz, who had fled to Spanish Philippines, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam."
"Veloso and Ruiz decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek. They arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Veloso and Ruiz were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Veloso and Ruiz returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayutthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos."
Eventually Veloso returned to Malacca.

"Between 1842 and 1849, 234 juvenile offenders were transported to Western Australia on seven convict ships. From 1850 to 1868, over 9,000 convicts were transported to the colony on 43 convict ship voyages. Western Australia was classed as a full-fledged penal colony in 1850."
"Parkhurst apprentices were juvenile prisoners from Parkhurst Prison, sentenced to ""transportation beyond the seas"", but pardoned on arrival at their destination on the conditions that they be ""apprenticed"" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the original term of their sentence. Between 1842 and 1849, Western Australia accepted 234 Parkhurst apprentices, all males aged between 10 and 21. As Western Australia was not then a penal colony, contemporary documents studiously avoided referring to the prisoners as ""convicts"", and the ships that brought them were not officially recognised as convict ships there. English records were not so reticent, classing as convict ships the seven ships that transported Parkhurst apprentices to Western Australia."

The university offers more than 70 undergraduate majors and seven graduate programs. Walsh has a satellite campus in Castel Gandolfo, Italy."
The school's namesake is Bishop Emmett Michael Walsh of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown.
"Walsh University was first founded as LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine in 1951 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction on an idea by Ferdinand Waldo Demara, who was then posing as a monk, to educate young men as brothers and teachers. LaMennais College continued in Alfred, Maine from 1951 until 1959. Because of a chance 1957 conversation between Brother Francoeur of La Mennais College and Monsignor William Hughes of Youngstown, Ohio about the Brothers' wish to move LaMennais College from Alfred, Maine, Bishop Walsh invited the Brothers to choose Canton, Ohio as the new location. Bishop Walsh donated $304,000 to the Walsh College project. In 1959 the present location of Walsh University began as of farm land on which two buildings were constructed, College Hall (Farrell Hall) and LaMennais Hall which continues to house the Brothers and international priest-students. The Founding Brothers include: Dacian J. Barrette, Thomas S. Farrell, Henry J. Vannasse, Edmond Drouin, Paul E. Masse, Robert A. Francoeur, and Alexis Guilbeault."
"Throughout the school's history, the Brothers have played an active role, serving as faculty during the original years and playing a part in the growth and development of facilities and programs. Several have served as President."

He is also the Chairman of Perennial Real Estate Holdings Ltd. He has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion as of March 2019."
"Kuok earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the National University of Singapore, and began his career in 1973 trading soft commodities at Kuok Oils and Grains. He eventually became Managing Director of the business, and developed the Pasir Gudang Edible Oils refining complex in Johor, followed by China's first edible oil refinery, South Seas Oils and Fats."

Starting as a small commodities trading company with S$2m in seed capital from the mortgage of his family home, and further seed funding obtained from Kuok Hock Swee and Sons, his father's investment company. Wilmar grew rapidly from the outset, with initial growth in the Indonesian edible oil market, followed up with development of Sumatran oil palm plantations and Indonesian edible oil refineries. A large expansion into edible oil refining in mainland China, and a joint venture with the Adani Group in India subsequently placed it in leading positions within Asia's largest consumer edible oil markets. In 1994, a meeting with the legendary then-chairman of ADM, Dwayne Andreas, resulted in a US$30m investment into the company after the first meeting, and ADM coming on board as a long term strategic partner."
"In 2006, Wilmar International launched an Initial Public Offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange with a capitalisation of S$2.38Bn. In 2007, after a 16-year estrangement, he agreed with his uncle Robert Kuok to merge the Kuok Group's edible oil, trading and oil palm plantation assets into Wilmar in return for a 31% stake in the company. The merger resulted in the unification of Kuok's previous early career contributions to the Kuok Group with the rapidly growth of Wilmar International led by him and Martua Sitorus since 1991."
"Kuok's family investment vehicle HPRY Holdings acquired the Aviva Tower in the City of London in 2011 in a joint purchase with Martua Sitorus valued at £290m. The property subsequently received planning approval by the City of London for redevelopment into the Eric Parry designed 'Trellis', slated to be at 1000 ft the tallest building in the City and the second tallest building in Western Europe."
"Besides holding stakes in music, media and biotechnology businesses, HPRY is a substantial shareholder in Perennial Real Estate Holdings, which is a developer of commercial mixed use integrated developments and healthcare projects in China. It owns several iconic properties in Singapore including CHIJMES, the Capitol and AXA Tower.

"His father, Kuok Hock Swee, had arrived in then British Malaya from Foochow in Southern China at the age of 18, eventually setting up a provision store in Mersing that he expanded into a thriving business distributing foodstuffs along the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia. This was subsequently merged with the Kuok Group in exchange for an equity stake in Robert Kuok's rapidly expanding business which by then included the first ShangriLa Hotel in Singapore."
"The Kuok family traces its ancestry to the 8th century Tang Dynasty general Guo Ziyi, whose descendants included several famous generals under Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Guo Ziyi was notably mentioned by the Nestorian Christians (known as the Church of the East) as perhaps the earliest high ranking patron of the Christian Church in Tang Dynasty China."

The story centres on a magician, Father Alfonso, his daughter, Elsee and an Ayurveda Vaidyar Kumaran and his two twin sons and how their life changes after the land is decolonised. The novel won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and the N. V. Prize. It was adapted into a film by noted director Lenin Rajendran in 1992."
"The story begins in 1950s, when the French, the colonial rulers were packing off from Mahé, a coastal town in North Malabar, after 230 years, leaving behind remnants of a cultural history. Those, who considered themselves as belonging to Francophone culture, jumped onto the first available vessel to France. And many of the older generation, orphaned by the departure of the French, struggle to eke out a living even as they remember their days of plenty under their foreign masters. Caught up in their suffering, Kumaran Vaidyar does everything he can to keep the people of his beloved Mayyazhi from starving, but entrusts his own children to the care of his wife, who is no more. Meanwhile, Father Alphonse waves his magic wand and changes pebbles into candy and waits for his good-looking son to return. Through all this, untroubled by the woes of the elders, Shivan, Shashi and Elsie spend an idyllic childhood in sunny, sleepy Mayyazhi. Until the day of reckoning catches up with them and they pay the price of growing up."
"The English translation of the book by Prema Jayakumar was released by Penguin Books India on 30 October 2013.

"The Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL, engl.: ""German Train Drivers' Union"") is a German trade union that represents workers in train companies. It has a membership of 34,000."
"In August 2007 the GDL planned to strike after talks failed with Deutsche Bahn, the main German railway operator, over a range of demands from the union. A key disagreement was GDL's wish to represent its members in collective bargaining processes, independently of other unions representing staff in that job category."
"On 8 August 2007, the labour court in Nuremberg declared that a strike of affected long-distance and goods services would be illegal if carried out before 30 September, claiming it would affect the national economy too severely."
"On 2 November 2007, the labour court in Chemnitz overturned a previous judgement limiting strike action to short-haul routes. After the decision the GDL declared a three-day strike. It was the first national rail strike since 1992 and of unprecedented duration. The strike ended as the union had planned, at 2:00 a.m. CET on the morning of Saturday, November 17, 2007, but without a new contract."
"On 19 November 2007 the labour court in Nuremberg admonished Deutsche Bahn for its practice of contacting multiple labour courts around the country to try and obtain an injunction against strike action, which it regarded as misuse of the legal system."
"In 2014 the GDL started a series of strikes of the German railway system as a result of Deutsche Bahn declining its demands for a shorter working week (reduced from 39 hours to 37 hours), for a 5% pay increase and for the right to independently represent 17,000 railway workers not working as engine drivers in collective bargaining processes. Deutsche Bahn maintained that it would only enter collective bargaining with a single trade union per job grouping, as was the case until June 2014 when GDL had an agreement with the much larger EVG union."
"The strikes continued in 2015 with a three-day railway strike starting on 21 April 2015, the GDL's seventh strike in 10 months. This was followed by a strike from 4–10 May, the longest strike in Deutsche Bahn's history.

"Born in Sapporo, he took up skiing as a young boy, as he came from an area famous for its ski slopes. He also played basketball at school. However his father was an amateur sumo enthusiast and encouraged his son to try the sport. In his third year of junior high he took part in the National Junior High School Sumo Championships, held in Tokyo, and was put up in Tatsunami stable during the championships. Daishoho was an amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, and after graduation he returned to Tatsunami stable. He entered professional sumo in January 1990 at the ""makushita"" level, and quickly reached the top ""makuuchi"" division in July 1991. His best performance in a tournament was in September 1992 when he was runner-up to Takahanada with 11 wins. He reached his highest rank of ""komusubi"" in January 1993, but after that he was plagued by a number of injuries to his knees, back and triceps. He fell back to the ""jūryō"" division after pulling out of the January 1997 tournament on the 4th day."
"In 1999 Daishoho was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He wanted to receive treatment whilst still remaining active on the ""dohyo"", but in June he was persuaded by his doctors to enter hospital full-time and so retired from sumo. Since it was clear that he would be unlikely to live long enough to have a formal retirement ceremony (""danpatsu-shiki"") at the Ryogoku Kokugikan, which normally takes place up to a year after retiring, in October 1999 his fellow wrestler and graduate of Nihon University Mainoumi organised a private function for him which was attended by around 400 people including wrestlers such as Konishiki and Musashimaru and his former stablemaster Haguroyama, although senior members of the Sumo Association and his former coach at Nihon University Hidetoshi Tanaka did not attend as it was an unsanctioned event. Daishoho's weight had dropped from 150 kg to below 90 kg. He died on December 4, 1999 at the age of 32 due to pancreatic cancer."
"Daishoho liked pushing techniques, particularly ""tsuppari"", a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. However, he was also good at fighting on the ""mawashi"" or belt, where he preferred a ""migi-yotsu"" grip, a left hand outside and right hand inside position. His most commonly used ""kimarite"" were ""yorikiri"" (force out), ""oshidashi"" (push out) and ""uwatenage"" (overarm throw)."

Hovey was one of a group of Boston businessmen who had provided most of the funding for the American Anti-Slavery Society in the years prior to the American Civil War.
"During and after the war the Hovey fund helped to sustain the Anti-Slavery Society as fund-raising became more difficult and the cost of publishing abolitionist newspapers increased sharply. After slavery in the U.S. was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the fund's continued support assisted the Anti-Slavery Society's campaign for the political rights of the newly freed slaves, playing a crucial role in the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendments, which secured citizenship and voting rights for African Americans."
"A controversy over the fund developed after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified. Hovey's will stipulated that if slavery was abolished before the fund's money was exhausted, the remainder was to be channeled to other specified reform movements, including the women's rights movement. Despite the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, Phillips declared that slavery would not truly be abolished until African Americans secured the right to vote, and he continued to channel much of the fund's money to that cause."

In reality, however, women are still not occupying ""higher economic, professional, political, social, and religious positions"". In relation to the political arena, UN Women reported that a 2012 study made by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being ""103rd out of 189 countries in terms of representation of women in Parliament"". Uruguay low ranking is partly due to its low political participation of women: only 16% of members of Parliament are women as of 2014."
"One prominent Uruguayan woman is Paulina Luisi. Luisi was a leader of the feminist movement in the country of Uruguay. In 1909, she became the first woman in the country to obtain a medical degree and was highly respected. She represented Uruguay in international women's conferences and traveled throughout Europe. She voiced her opinion on women's rights, and in 1919, Paulina started the force for women's rights in Uruguay. By 1922, the Pan-American Conference of Women named Paulina Luisi an honorary vice president of the meeting and she continued to be an activist until Uruguay gave women the right to vote."
"Domestic violence is a very serious problem, especially so-called crimes of passion, which continue to be tolerated under Article 36 of the Penal Code (The passion provoked by adultery) – ""Artículo 36. (La pasión provocada por el adulterio)"". Since 2013, there have been ongoing political efforts to remove this provision from the Criminal Code. Before 2006, perpetrators of rape could avoid punishment if, after the assault, they married the victim. Uruguay's law against domestic violence is ""Ley Nº 17.514"", enacted in 2002."
The abortion law of Uruguay is very liberal compared to the other Latin American countries.
"In 2012, Uruguay become the second country in Latin America, after Cuba, to legalize abortion on demand (during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy)."
"Unlike most other Latin American countries, women are not very present in politics. Uruguay has one of the lowest percentage of women in politics in Latin America."

"L'Opéra du pauvre (English: Poor's Opera) is a piece for voices and orchestra formalized by Léo Ferré as a quadruple concept album released in 1983. This dreamlike and wry plea in favor of the Night, symbol of imagination and subversiveness for Ferré, synthesizes all aspects of the French poet and musician."
"""L'Opéra du pauvre"" comes from a ""lyrical"" ballet titled ""The Night"", written in 1956 at the request of choreographer and dancer Roland Petit, within the Revue des Ballets de Paris. The piece was abandoned by Petit after a few performances (critics being severely negative). Ferré published the libretto same year at La Table Ronde Editions. This work stayed then on the shelf for twenty-six years."
"It was after the triple LP ""Ludwig - L'Imaginaire - Le Bateau ivre"" was released in 1982, that Léo Ferré decided to dedicate his upcoming year to bring ""The Night"" back to life. As time had passed, Ferré had accumulated a lot of material, and he chose to enrich his original text and score with elements from various sources, thus creating a new Baroque work of much larger scope (it would take four LP to hold this whole new version)."
Léo Ferré changes his voice and acts all parts.
"The Night is accused of having murdered the Lady Shadow, who is missing. The opera depicts Night's trial by the ""day people"", allegorized by animals. The judge is a raven, prosecutor is a cock and Night's attorney is an owl. Witnesses, all night owls for some reason of their own, are called to the bar and try to save the Night."
= = = Lucsuhin Natural Bridge = = =
"Lucsuhin Natural Bridge, locally called Cabag Cave or Lucsuhin Cave, is a natural bridge located between Brgy. Lucsuhin and Brgy. Kalubkob in Silang, Cavite province in the Philippines. The bridge, which crosses the Ylang-Ylang River, is the first large natural bridge reported in the country."
"The first American to discover and study the bridge is Paul R. Fanning from the Division of Mines during the early part of the American colonial period. He was making a geological reconnaissance in the vicinity of Silang, Cavite in July 1910 when he discovered the natural bridge of unusual size. Owing to its remoteness, Fanning believed no white men have probably visited the place before."
The natural bridge is located in the great bedded tuff area lying between Manila and Tayabas Bay where the rock is favorable for their formation.
"The opening under the bridge span is tunnel-like and has a diameter of about and a length of about . It makes a double turn that roughly approximates the shape of the letter 'S.' During low water, the stream occupies a central channel consisting of a staggered series of small falls and potholes which are the result of the action of the water upon the horizontal bedding of the tuff rock."
"The floor of the bridge, which is about above the stream, was examined by Fanning and showed evidence of once having formed the bed of the stream. Erosion had nearly obliterated this old bed, but had not been sufficient to destroy the sides of the valley. At one time, the river must have flowed at this higher elevation to a place several kilometers down stream from the present tunnel and then passed over a cliff. This cliff gradually receded upstream forming the present box canyon. As illustrated by the sketches, seepage began at a point several hundred meters above the falls and, owing to the horizontal bedding of the rock, it first took a path at right angles to the river course, then descended from bed to bed to the bottom of the falls. The porous, soft nature of the rock favored the rapid enlargement of the underground channel, and eventually the entire stream followed this course."
"Subsequent erosion and caving had greatly decreased the length of the underground channel and produced the short canyon above the present entrance portal. Owing to the thinness of the roof, the first part of the tunnel caved rapidly, whereas the erosion and caving of the lower part was much slower. A condition now has been reached where the entrance and exit portals will be eroded with about equal speed and at the same time the tunnel will be greatly enlarged in diameter by down cutting and by caving of the roof. Under these conditions the bridge eventually should assume the arch structure characteristic of famous natural bridges in other parts of the world."
"The bridge and cave is not a protected area and need preservation for future generations, as well as the areas upriver to preserve the quality of water, lest it would end up like Hinulugang Taktak falls in Rizal province."
"The bridge can be reached from Silang by following the Silang-Banaybanay Road for about west from the Aguinaldo Highway and J. Rizal Ave. junction to the barrio of Lucsuhin, past the road to the Riviera Golf & Country Club, past the bridge over Ylang-Ylang River to Brgy. Kalubkob. From here, it is about long hike to the site."
"An alternate route from Kalubkob, is to head north on Fresco Belen Drive for about to a dirt road to the right. The bridge and cave are reached by hiking east on the dirt road for ."

"Currently, the DPS system is used by online shops for product delivery as an alternative to regular post services. Private customers can send their packages through the system as well and pay for the delivery on the spot with a debit or credit card. The system also encompasses an SMS-based notification system notifying clients when an item has been delivered. SmartPOST's solution was implemented in April 2009."
"Unlike other similar systems (such as the Packstation solution in Germany), SmartPOST has placed its Delivery Point Solution indoors (e.g. in shopping malls), making them convenient to use even with bad weather. In July 2009, SmartPOST reported it is in negotiations with an Italian company interested in licensing SmartPOST's Delivery Point Solution for usage in Italy."
Currently SmartPOST is servicing roughly two hundred distant selling companies and online shops in Estonia.
"During its first year of operation, SmartPOST reported a 13.8 million EEK (about 1.2 million USD) turnover with an 8.3 million ($740,000 USD) profit loss. SmartPOST's member of board Antti Oolup said that the loss was expected and planned, with monthly profits planned for the end of 2009. SmartPOST reported that over 33 thousand packages were sent through its service in Estonia in December 2009."
"SmartPOST was chosen as the Logistics Deed 2009 at the annual Purchase Management and Logistics Conference. At the end of 2009, SmartPOST also reported that it will expand its business to Finland. Currently, only one-way packages can be sent from Estonia."

"The Armenian Native Faith, also termed Armenian Neopaganism or Hetanism (Armenian: Հեթանոսութիւն ""Hetanosutiwn""; a cognate word of ""Heathenism""), is a modern Pagan new religious movement that harkens back to the historical, pre-Christian belief systems and ethnic religions of the Armenians. The followers of the movement call themselves ""Hetans"" (Armenian: հեթանոս ""Hetanos"", which means ""Heathen"", thus ""ethnic"", both of them being loanwords from the Greek ""ἔθνος"", ""ethnos"") or ""Arordi"", meaning the ""Children of Ari"", also rendered as ""Arordiners"" in some scholarly publications."
"The Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of ""Tseghakron"" (Ցեղակրօն, literally ""national religion"") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist Garegin Nzhdeh. It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a climate of national reawakening, when the Armenologist Slak Kakosyan founded the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (""Arordineri Ukht""). Neopaganism expert Victor Schnirelmann estimated the following of Armenian neopaganism to be ""no more than a few hundred people""."
"The first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (or ""Ara""; ""Arordineri Ukht"" in Armenian) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936–2005). He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from Soviet Armenia; in 1979 he fled to the United States where he became familiar with the ideas of Garegin Nzhdeh (1886–1955)."
"Nzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and ""fedayi"" of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of Armenia, and is still one of the driving forces of Armenian nationalism. Kakosyan praised him as the ""prophet of the Armenians"". Nzhdeh founded a movement named ""Tseghakron"" (""religion of the nation""), which was among the core doctrines of the Armenian Youth Federation. In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as Atlas upholding the ordered world, and it makes reference to Hayk, the mythical patriarch of the Armenians, and to Vahagn, the solar and warrior god ""fighter of the serpent"", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide of 1915."

= = = Egocentric presentism = = =
"Egocentric presentism is a form of solipsism introduced by Caspar Hare in which other persons can be conscious, but their experiences are simply not ."
"Similarly, in related work, Hare argues for a theory of perspectival realism in which other perspectives do exist, but the present perspective has a defining intrinsic property."
"In one example that Hare uses to illustrate his theory (starting on page 354 of the official version of his paper), you learn that you are one of two people, named A and B, who have just been in a train crash; and that A is about to have incredibly painful surgery. You cannot remember your name. Naturally, you hope to be B! The point of the example is that you know everything relevant that there is to know about the objective world; all that is missing is position in it, that is, whose experiences are , A's or B's. This example is easily handled by egocentric presentism because under this theory, the case where the present experiences are A's is fundamentally different from the case where the present experiences are B's. Hare points out that similar examples can be given to support theories like presentism in the philosophy of time."
Several other philosophers have written reviews of Hare's work on this topic. Giovanni Merlo has given a detailed comparison to his own closely related subjectivist theory.
= = = Perspectival realism = = =
"As Hare points out, the same type of argument is often used in the philosophy of time to support theories such as presentism. Of course, we can say that A is happening on [insert today's date]. But, it can be argued, this misses the fact that A is ""simply"" happening (right now), not relative to anything."
Hare's theory of perspectival realism is closely related to his theory of egocentric presentism.

= = = HMS Desperate (1896) = = =
"HMS ""Desperate"" was a two funnel, 30-knot destroyer ordered by the Royal Navy under the 1894 – 1895 Naval Estimates. She was launched in 1896, served in Home waters and the Mediterranean before World War I. She was based in Portsmouth during the war and was sold for breaking in 1920."
She was laid down as yard number 305 on 1 July 1895 at the John I. Thornycroft & Company shipyard at Chiswick on the River Thames. She was launched on 15 February 1896. During her builder's trials her maximum average speed was 30.3 knots. She had her armament fitted in Portsmouth. She was completed and accepted by the Royal Navy in February 1897. During her acceptance trials and work ups her average sea speed was 25 knots.
The Vicesima hereditatium was a Roman 5% tax on inheritance money.
"No inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The ""vicesima hereditatium"" (""twentieth of inheritance"") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated—from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source, but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign."

"Alice Mary Baldwin (born January 24, 1879, Lewiston, Maine; died 1960) was a historian and educator, noted as the Dean of the Woman's College of Duke University from 1923 until her retirement in 1947."
"Baldwin was born in 1879 in Lewiston, Maine, the eldest of five children of a Congregationist minister. She moved with her family at the age of nine to East Orange, New Jersey, where she was educated in private school before entering Bates College in 1896. After one year, she transferred to Cornell University where she was named to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and from where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1900."
"Baldwin remained at Cornell to receive her master's degree in history in 1902, and then went to Europe on a fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and research in Sweden. (The subject of her master's thesis had been ""Gustavus III of Sweden: A Study in Enlightened Despotism."")"
"Returning from Europe in late 1903, Baldwin took a series of teaching positions culminating in a position as Instructor of History, and later head of the Department of History, at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While at the Baldwin School, she pursued graduate studies in history at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as studies in education at the Teachers College of Columbia University."
"In 1921, Baldwin left the Baldwin School to attend the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate degree."
"In 1923, Baldwin took the job as Acting Dean of Women at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina (later to become part of Duke University). Seeing little opportunity for a woman in the 1920s to become a full professor at the University of Chicago, Baldwin remained at Trinity to become Dean of Women and Assistant Professor of History. While at Trinity, Baldwin completed her doctoral thesis (on the topic of New England clergy and the American Revolution) in time to receive her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1926."
"Baldwin's responsibilities as dean and as an active teacher (which she believed necessary to remain effective as an administrator) left her no time for research, and she produced no further scholarly historical material after this time. She did, however, maintain active memberships in various women's educational organizations and North Carolina historical organizations. She also encouraged student participation state and national women's organizations as well as the formation of a number of student-led organizations on campus; under her guidance and example, students launched organizations such as a Forum Committee to invite speakers to East Campus, DISTAFF, a monthly magazine edited entirely by women, the Nereidians, a synchronized swimming club, and numerous honorary and leadership societies such as Ivy, Sandals, and the White Duchy, a counterpart to the Order of The Red Friars."
Baldwin retired from Duke University in 1947.
"As an historian, Baldwin is best remembered for her doctoral dissertation ""The New England Clergy and the American Revolution"". Her other writings include:"
"Baldwin has been held up as an example of the key issues in the intellectual life of women in the early twentieth century. Upon her retirement, she ordered that her papers and notes be sealed for twenty years. Upon their unveiling, it was revealed that Baldwin had struggled bitterly with her role as a female educator and on the education of women in general. She had found little documentation of interest in her research in the lives of women in colonial times, and left unfinished many papers and treatises in which she expressed the disdain she uncovered for the education of women in America."
"Baldwin remains a much-beloved figure at Duke University and is credited with advancing the prestige of the Woman's College at Duke and the education of young women. One of the most prominent buildings on Duke's East Campus, the auditorium anchoring the campus, is named in her honor in recognition of her dedication to the institution."
"Recognizing Baldwin's contributions to the University, Duke has created the Alice Mary Baldwin Collection within their library, wherein all of Baldwin's papers are available for review and research."

"Etihad Rail DB is a certified and integrated heavy-rail Operations & Maintenance (O&M) service provider in the UAE. The company was set up in 2013 as a joint venture between Etihad Rail (51%), the developer of the UAE's national railway network and Deutsche Bahn (DB) (49%), Europe's largest railway operator and infrastructure owner. Etihad Rail DB is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Stage One of the UAE's national railway network for Etihad Rail’s primary customer, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Etihad Rail DB concluded an Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Agreement with Etihad Rail in August 2013."
"Stage One is the first of three stages of the UAE's vision to build a mixed freight and passenger railway across the country. Stages Two and Three will extend the railway geographically to the other Emirates as well as connect with partner Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) railway systems in the Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Not only will the UAE's railway provide a valuable boost to sustainable and diversified economic growth and bring communities together across the Emirates, it will also be a concrete step to the development of a safe, more efficient and integrated system movement of freight and people across the region."
"In Stage One of the UAE's national railway network, Etihad Rail DB operates and maintains 264 km of railway route across the Western Region of the Abu Dhabi Emirate and transports granulated sulphur from the sour gas fields of Shah (Al Hosn Gas) and Habshan (GASCO) to the port of Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, where the sulphur product is exported. The spine of the network is the double track line between Liwa and Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi. This section is designed to also operate passenger trains in the future."
"Etihad Rail DB is now set to provide 'Shadow Operator' services for stage two of the Etihad Rail project. The choice builds on the five years of expertise and Etihad Rail DB's outstanding success in managing Stage One operations and maintenance. In its 'Shadow Operator' role, Etihad Rail DB will aim to utilise its expertise and lessons learned from Stage One to provide consultancy services to Etihad Rail in preparation for stage two. Such services will include reviewing the design of stage two assets, developing Emiratization requirements, drawing up operational procedures and safety management plans and assisting to ensure the project is delivered with the optimum operations cost."
"Since officially commencing commercial operations in January 2016, Etihad Rail DB has been responsible for the transport of up to 22,000 tonnes of granulated sulphur every day in trains of up to 110 wagons. Trains are hauled by 4,300 horsepower EMD SD-70 locomotives. In February 2017, Etihad Rail DB announced that it had safely run its 1,000th train for ADNOC. As of 20 January 2017, Etihad Rail DB confirmed that it had transported more than 10 million tonnes of sulphur in over 1 million hours worked with zero lost time injury (LTI) in a relatively short time since inception, which reflects its internal culture."
"As of the first half of 2017, Etihad Rail DB had achieved its highest performance records against all international safety standards with no lost-time injuries. As railways are new to the region, a community safety campaign was undertaken in 2014 to educate the public on safety around rail tracks."
"One of the key purposes of the Etihad Rail DB joint-venture is to facilitate knowledge transfer, the sharing of best practices, as well as providing the UAE with a world-class, modern, integrated and efficient rail network that will drive economic growth and social development. In May 2016, Etihad Rail and Etihad Rail DB co-signed an MoU with the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education & Training Institute (ADVETI) related to occupational training. Under the terms of this MoU, the stakeholders will collaborate to create opportunities for occupational training and share knowledge for Emirati students seeking qualifications in the UAE's rail industry, in line with the goals of the country's Emiratization policy. This means that UAE Nationals will have skills across many disciplines needed to operate and maintain the railway such as maintenance and mechanical technicians. Moreover, Etihad Rail DB has also established a human resources excellence programme which is enabling UAE nationals to gain on-the-job experience."

"In 1871 he founded the ""Westfälischen Vereins für Vogelschutz, Geflügel- und Singvögelzucht"" (Westphalian Association for bird protection, poultry and songbird breeding), and during the following year founded the ""Zoologischen sektion für Westfalen und Lippe"" (Zoological Division of Westphalia and Lippe)."
"In 1875, he founded the Westphalian zoo in Munster, a preserve with emphasis on European domestic mammals. It had a building for the display, cultivation and breeding of various fowl as well as avaries for songbirds. In 1876 a ""monkey house"" was constructed. Eventually, the zoo expanded to include native fauna in general. By the end of 1882, the site had ""niche displays"" (dioramas) representing fauna from Australia, the North Sea coast, German forests, the African landscape, as well as a section that contained fossils from prehistoric Westphalia."

"The Stadtbahnwagen Typ B (translation ""Type ""B"" Light Rail Vehicle"", short form B-Wagen) is a light rail vehicle used by several Stadtbahn networks in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It was mainly developed by Düsseldorf-based DUEWAG, who also built the majority of vehicles in a consortium with Siemens and Kiepe. A small series of ten units was built by Waggon Union in Berlin. As the type evolved over two decades of production, some vehicles have little more in common than their outer dimensions and the basic configuration of a two-part multiple unit on three bogies with both outer ones powered. For the Dortmund Stadbahn, some cars were modified with a central section and a fourth bogie. These vehicles are referred to as ""B8"" or "" B80C/8"" (eight axles). These vehicles have a length of 38 m (124 ft 8.036 in) and a weight of 49 t."
"When the Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn network was planned in the early 1970s, standardised rolling stock was planned as well. At the same time, a second Stadtbahn network was planned for Cologne and Bonn. Because the future Cologne Stadtbahn already had one finished tunnel, that was built with the city's own money with streetcars in mind, the ""Stadtbahnwagen"" designed for the Rhine-Ruhr network was not suitable. So, another vehicle was designed for the Cologne/Bonn network, that was capable of driving though tighter curves. This vehicle, now referred to as ""Stadtbahnwagen Typ B"" was immediately ordered by transport authorities in Cologne and Bonn, while Rhine-Ruhr authorities remained hesitant about ""their"" vehicle, now renamed ""Stadtbahnwagen Typ A"". Eventually it was decided that the type ""A"" LRV was too unwieldy and type ""B"" LRVs were ordered by Essen, Mülheim, Düsseldorf, Duisburg and Dortmund. The type ""A"" concept, which consists of close coupled two-car sets, was shelved and later revived for the Stuttgart Stadtbahn."
"The ""Typ B"" formed the basis for the British-built Metrocars on the Tyne & Wear Metro, which opened in 1980."
Different variants are usually referred to by a combination of their top speed and a letter denoting the engine type.
= = = Training needs analysis = = =
Training Analysis (sometimes called Training Needs Analysis (TNA)) is the process of identifying the gap in employee training and related training needs.
"Training Need Analysis (TNA) is the process of identifying the gap between employee training and needs of training. Training needs analysis is the first stage in the training process and involves a series of steps that reveal whether training will help to solve problem which has been identified. Training can be described as “the acquisition of skills, concepts or attitudes that result in improved performance within the job environment”. Training needs analysis looks at each side of operational area of job so that the concepts and attitudes of the human elements of a system can be effectively identified and appropriate training can be specified."
"Training needs analysis is most often used as part of the system development process. Due to the close tie between the design of the system and the training required, in most cases it runs alongside the development to capture the training requirements.needs additional citations for verification"
"Tools and methods for an integrated approach, Design Integrated Training Analysis, have been proposed and developed. The trade-offs between design and training are both assessed in light of the understanding of the operational tasks. This approach also uses information on recorded critical incidents to review proposed training and to provide traceability between hazards and training. This single, integrated approach to human factors and training needs analysis has been successfully used on a number of defence projects."
"Over the last 20 years the critical nature of the man-in-the-loop has changed from simply manual dexterity and procedural operation to a state in which their decision making, cognitive abilities, data assimilation, communication skills, and attitude are all crucial. In addition the job structure of the personnel operationally involved with modern systems has diversified in direct proportion to the complexity of the technology. This has fueled the need for a formal approach."
"The task of training can be broken down into a number of discrete components, each addressing a different part of the overall learning process. This breakdown is as follows:-"
"The role of training analysis is to build a formal bridge between the available design data and the training media and training objectives, in order to facilitate the transfer of training elements into the operational environment."
For complex multi-user system a user-to-task map is often constructed to present the relationship between the tasks and the identified team structure and also to identify new groups of users that would need to have an understanding of the system. The training gap is assessed by a comparison between the goals and tasks undertaken by the individuals and the existing training.

"Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) is an Indonesian survey and political consultancy institution. It was founded in 2005 by a group of public opinion makers, researchers, columnists and survey experts. LSI is active in committing political surveys, for example during the General Election (Pemilu) or District Head General Election (Pilkada). In 2011, Universitas Kristen Indonesia (UKI) awarded LSI an “Achievement Award” since it was judged that LSI has provided significant contribution to the field of social science, political communication, and election politics in Indonesia."
"Lingkaran Survei Indonesia is often made a study subject and even the place where foreign politicians conduct their comparative studies. At the end of 2010 a delegation of US Congress led by Zack Hudgins conducted a meeting with Lingkaran Survei Indonesia. That meeting was a part of their chain of political activities in Indonesia aside from visiting various other institutions such as the People's Representative Council (DPR), political parties, and other elite entities of Indonesian politics. The reasoning behind that meeting was stated as due to Lingkaran Survei Indonesia being considered as an influential political institution in Indonesia, especially as its role as the pioneer of such form of institution in Indonesia."
"According to Tempo Newspaper, LSI was founded in 2005 by Denny JA. Before founding LSI, Denny founded Lembaga Survei Indonesia and served as its Director. Denny JA founded Lingkaran Survei Indonesia as a statement that a survey and consultancy institution can be profitable. The Swa Sembada Magazine wrote that Denny wished to build an institution not only focusing on committing political survey but can also perform political consultancy. Armed with the experience of securing the victory for the team that made Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's claim to presidency possible in 2004, Denny JA founded LSI with the focus of doing political surveys as well as providing political consultancy for political parties and candidates."
"As survey institution, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) provides aid for political parties and individuals in mapping their own strengths and weaknesses. Various political parties, such as Partai Golkar, have used LSI's survey results as consideration in choosing which candidates should be supported in District Head General Election (Pilkada.) As political consultant, LSI's first client was Ismeth Abdullah, who was elected as Governor of Riau Islands in 2005. Afterwards, LSI has provided aid to various clients from legislative members to district head candidates. Until 2013, LSI worked with 24 governors and 55 mayors/regents who were later elected."
"Currently, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) has developed six subsidiaries: Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI), Konsultan Citra Indonesia (KCI), Lingkaran Survei Kebijakan Publik (LSKP), Citra Publik Indonesia (CPI), Citra Publik Advertising (CPA), and Citra Komunikasi LSI (Cikom)."
"From 2004 to 2012, LSI conducted over 800 voter behavioral surveys across Indonesia for a variety of clients, including political parties, presidential candidates, legislative bodies candidates and district head candidates. Republika Newspaper even deigned the title of “Political Foreseer” to Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI) due to its ability to predict the correct victors on various elections far before the real results are announced and published. Museum Rekor Indonesia (MURI—Indonesian Museum of Records) awarded five awards to LSI due to its accuracy in predicting various election results: (1) The 1st Accurate Advertised Survey Predictions for 2005's District Head Election on the Riau Province, (2) The 1st Accurate Advertised Legislative Election Survey Prediction on 2009, (3) The 1st Accurate Advertised Presidential Election Survey Predictions on 2009, (4) The Most Amount of Accurate Advertised Survey Predictions of District Head Elections in One Season of District Head Election (13 elections from 2005 to 2008), (5) The Research Institute with the Most 100% Accurately Predicted Surveys in One Month, (6) correct predictions on March 2006"

"The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF) is the national aviation authority in the Republic of Fiji and is responsible for discharging functions on behalf of the Government of Fiji under the States responsibility to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). CAAF regulates the activities of airport operators, air traffic control and air navigation service providers, airline operators, pilots and air traffic controllers, aircraft engineers, technicians, airports, airline contracting organisations and international air cargo operators in Fiji."
The agency's head office is at Nadi Airport in Nadi.
To be a model aviation regulator
To promote effective aviation safety and security in Fiji and the region.
"The Authority strives to reflect certain key values as the characteristics of the people who are the CAAF team and equally for the organization as a whole by professionalism, accountability, commitment, and integrity in our conduct."
"The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji was ISO certified in July 2008 following a successful audit by Bureau Veritas, international auditors for ISO certification."
Background to Reform
"The reform of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF) is a case which illustrates the impact of both political and trade union activities on the reform process. At the time of its reorganisation in 1999, its employees were members of the Fiji Public Service Association (FPSA). Many of the CAAF workers were opposed to the restructuring plans and the job losses that were a central part of the reform."
"The CAAF was a statutory body established by the CAAF Act of 1979. Apart from providing regulatory oversight for domestic civil aviation and fulfilling international air safety obligations, it also owned and managed Nadi International Airport, as well as managing the Nausori Airport near Suva and the 23 small domestic airports located on many islands with low populations. In addition, it provided aviation support services to the region."
"The CAAF functioned like a government department, but had a mixture of statutory responsibilities and commercial obligations. Effectively, it was a referee and a player in its own game. For the 20 years prior to the restructuring, it had been making annual profits. This was largely because its annual revenue growth was directly linked to the expansion of the international tourism industry in Fiji. Income was derived from landing and parking fees, air navigation charges, passenger service charges, terminal building concessions and rentals, fuel concessions, and the sale of excess power. It was exempt from income tax until the reform. Only minor investments were made into infrastructure. It received heavy financial assistance in the form of an annual government grant to run Nausori airport and the other loss-making airports."
"Yet the government realised that the CAAF was inefficient, overstaffed and overburdened by bureaucracy. Its staff members' unions were in constant dispute with the management and the unions strongly resisted any changes to work practices. Two reviews of the CAAF had recommended non-core activities be divested to other organisations. In the late 1990s, processes were introduced to improve efficiency through a continuous quality improvement programme."
Division into Statutory Authority and Company
"In April 1997, the then Minister for Public Enterprises, Isimeli Bose announced that the CAAF was to be declared a ""commercial statutory authority"" and, in May, he said it would be reorganised pursuant to provisions of the public enterprise reform legislation. Subsequently, a reorganization charter was prepared. The principal objective of the reorganization was to increase the CAAF's efficiency and rate of return on assets, while at the same time providing an efficient regulatory function that meets international civil aviation standards (MCICP 1998c)."
"The reorganisation, facilitated by the Civil Aviation Reform Act 1999, involved separating the CAAF's regulatory role from its commercial operations. The commercial responsibilities and assets were transferred to a new company, Airports Fiji Ltd (AFL), which was established as a ""government commercial company"". It was incorporated under the Companies Act and required to operate along commercial lines, with clearly defined profitability targets and with new terms and conditions of employment. The main functions prescribed were the provision of air traffic management in Fiji and its flight information region; the management of airport commercial assets (the aerodromes, terminal buildings, commercial properties and infrastructure necessary for commercial activities); and the administration and management of airports as commercial businesses."
"The CAAF's regulatory role was given to a newly formed regulatory organisation called the Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands (CAAFI). The CAAFI's functions, as provided under the Civil Aviation Reform Act, include civil aviation regulation and international civil aviation obligations, along with safety oversight and safety education responsibilities for all airports, airlines, airport operations, and personnel. It oversees the activities of airport operators, air traffic control and air navigation service providers, and aircraft operators. It also has the responsibility for disposing of assets not required by AFL and for managing a housing estate (with over 150 residential sites) and other properties. In addition, it has a 51 percent shareholding in Air Terminal Services (Fiji) Ltd which provides ground handling services, including passenger handling, aircraft engineering, and in-flight catering. The implementation of the reform occurred in early April 1999, during the campaign for the May 1999 national elections. The approach adopted to transfer staff from CAAF to the two new organisations resulted in chaos. CAAF staff were terminated and paid their retirement gratuity and recreation leave entitlements. Many excess CAAF employees were offered redundancy packages and resigned."
