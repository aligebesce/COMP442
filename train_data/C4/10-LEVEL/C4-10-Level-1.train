And John Gummer was

"I only tax mine for six month now then,ay?"

"But er  they  what's er name, it'd cost me fifty five quid  end of this month!"
Yeah.
Know what I mean?
"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
cried the startled pirates .
"`` The cabin 's as black as a pit , '' Cecco said , almost gibbering , `` but there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ''"
"The exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were seen by Hook ."
"`` Cecco , '' he said in his most steely voice , `` go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo . ''"
"Cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying `` No , no '' ; but Hook was purring to his claw ."
"`` Did you say you would go , Cecco ? ''"
he said musingly .
"Cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly ."
"There was no more singing , all listened now ; and again came a death-screech and again a crow ."
No one spoke except Slightly .
"`` Three , '' he said ."
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . ''
"'S ` death and odds fish , '' he thundered , `` who is to bring me that doodle-doo ? ''"
"`` Wait till Cecco comes out , '' growled Starkey , and the others took up the cry ."
"`` I think I heard you volunteer , Starkey , '' said Hook , purring again ."
"`` No , by thunder ! ''"
Starkey cried .
"`` My hook thinks you did , '' said Hook , crossing to him ."
"`` I wonder if it would not be advisable , Starkey , to humour the hook ? ''"
"`` I 'll swing before I go in there , '' replied Starkey doggedly , and again he had the support of the crew ."
`` Is this mutiny ? ''
asked Hook more pleasantly than ever .
`` Starkey 's ringleader ! ''
"`` Captain , mercy ! ''"
"Starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now ."
"`` Shake hands , Starkey , '' said Hook , proffering his claw ."
"Starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him ."
"As he backed up Hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye ."
With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea .
"`` Four , '' said Slightly ."
"`` And now , '' Hook said courteously , `` did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ''"
"Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , `` I 'll bring out that doodle-doo myself , '' he said , and sped into the cabin ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ?"
"No more do you , says you ."
"Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers ."
Then we 'll see .
"If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . ''"
"`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick ."
"`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver ."
"`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?"
"That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last ."
"If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day ."
But I know the sort you are .
"I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is ."
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
"Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! ''"
"`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel ."
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
"`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ?"
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cried Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
"I seen a thing or two at sea , I have ."
"If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would ."
But not you !
I know you .
"You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''"
"`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel ."
"`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did ."
"They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . ''"
`` So ? ''
says Silver .
"`` Well , and where are they now ?"
"`` I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , '' she replied ."
"`` Dear madam , '' Dick cried , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . ''"
"`` Swear to me that he still lives , '' she returned ."
"`` I will not palter with you , '' answered Dick ."
`` Pity bids me to wound you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cried .
"`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '"
Y ' have won your spurs by my good kinsman 's murder .
"And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy 's house , ye should have died the death , and he -- he that was worth twelve of you -- were living . ''"
"`` I did but my man 's best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , '' answered Dick ."
`` Were he still living -- as I vow to Heaven I wish it !
"-- he would praise , not blame me . ''"
"`` Sir Daniel hath told me , '' she replied ."
`` He marked you at the barricade .
"Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle ."
"Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him ."
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hands not washed from killing ?
But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall .
He 't is that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom .
"Old Arblaster returned upon his mind , and he groaned aloud ."
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he said ; `` you that defended me -- you that are Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What made ye in the battle ? ''
she retorted .
"`` Y ' are of no party ; y ' are but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !"
Wherefore did ye fight ?
"For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` I know not ."
"But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other ."
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
"When Mrs. Liddell had gone , she rose and leaned over the counter ."
Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together .
`` What can I do for you ? ''
she said .
`` Nothing .
I ai n't looking for to have anything done for me .
"You need to have something done for you , I guess , by the looks of you ."
You seem dead beat out .
Are n't you awful tired ?
I 've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind .
"I do n't know how you kept your patience with her , but I can tell you I admired you for it , and I made up my mind I 'd tell you so . ''"
The kindness and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down .
Tears rushed to her eyes .
"She bowed her head on her hands and said sobbingly , `` Oh , I am tired !"
But it 's not that .
I 'm -- I 'm in such trouble . ''
"`` I knew you were , '' said the other , with a nod of her head ."
`` I could tell that right off by your face .
Do you know what I said to myself ?
"I said , ` That girl has got somebody at home awful sick . '"
That 's what I said .
Was I right ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed you were , '' said Marcella ."
`` I knew it '' -- another triumphant nod .
"`` Now , you just tell me all about it ."
It 'll do you good to talk it over with somebody .
"Here , I 'll pretend I 'm looking at shirtwaists , so that floor walker wo n't be coming down on you , and I 'll be as hard to please as that other woman was , so 's you can take your time ."
Who 's sick -- and what 's the matter ? ''
"Marcella told the whole story , choking back her sobs and forcing herself to speak calmly , having the fear of the floor walker before her eyes ."
"`` And I ca n't afford to send Patty to the country -- I ca n't -- and I know she wo n't get better if she does n't go , '' she concluded ."
"`` Dear , dear , but that 's too bad !"
Something must be done .
I only got home half an hour ago ... and no Dora to be seen .
Davy declares he never saw her since I left . ''
"`` Neither I did , '' avowed Davy solemnly ."
"`` She must be somewhere around , '' said Anne ."
`` She would never wander far away alone ... you know how timid she is .
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms . ''
Marilla shook her head .
`` I 've hunted the whole house through .
But she may be in some of the buildings . ''
A thorough search followed .
"Every corner of house , yard , and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people ."
"Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood , calling Dora 's name ."
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar .
"Davy accompanied each of them in turn , and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be ."
Finally they met again in the yard .
"`` It 's a most mysterious thing , '' groaned Marilla ."
`` Where can she be ? ''
"said Anne miserably `` Maybe she 's tumbled into the well , '' suggested Davy cheerfully ."
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other 's eyes .
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words .
"`` She ... she might have , '' whispered Marilla ."
"Anne , feeling faint and sick , went to the wellbox and peered over ."
The bucket sat on the shelf inside .
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water .
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea .
If Dora ... but Anne could not face the idea .
She shuddered and turned away .
"`` Run across for Mr. Harrison , '' said Marilla , wringing her hands ."
`` Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away ... they went to town today .
I 'll go for Mr. Barry . ''
"Mr. Barry came back with Anne , carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork ."
"Marilla and Anne stood by , cold and shaken with horror and dread , while Mr. Barry dragged the well , and Davy , astride the gate , watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment ."
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"""No! only just look,"" they said; ""there the fool sits still."""
"The next day when they went out to battle, they saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange champion it could be that had helped them, but no one got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one guessed it could be the lad; that's easy to understand."
"So when they went home at night, and saw the lad still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail; 'twas enough to break one's heart; and so the King threw his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound."
"When they went out to battle the third day, the lad still sat there."
"""Gee up! gee up!"" he said to his hack."
"""Nay, nay,"" said the King's men; ""if he won't stick there till he's starved to death."""
"And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. When they were gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew the enemy's king, and then the war was over at once."
"When the battle was over, the King caught sight of his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound round his leg, and so it wasn't hard to find him out. So they took him with great joy between them to the palace, and the Princess, who saw him from her window, got so glad, no one can believe it."
"""Here comes my own true love,"" she said."
"Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded, and so they all got well again in a moment."
"So he got the Princess to wife; but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy, and hung its ears down, and wouldn't eat its corn. So when the young King for he was now a king, and had got half the kingdom spoke to him, and asked what ailed him, the Horse said:"
"""Now I have helped you on, and now I won't live any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head off."""
"""No, I'll do nothing of the kind,"" said the young King; ""but you shall have all you want, and rest all your life."""
"""Well,"" said the Horse, ""if you don't do as I tell you, see if I don't take your life somehow."""
"So the King had to do what he asked; but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the head, there stood the loveliest Prince on the spot where the horse had stood."
"""Why, where in all the world did you come from?"" asked the King."
"""It was I who was a horse,"" said the Prince; ""for I was king of that land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who threw this Troll's shape over me, and sold me to the Troll. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never make on one another."""
"And they didn't either; for they were friends as long as they lived, and each paid the other very many visits."
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF
"Once on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was ""Gruff."""
"On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker."
So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""Trip, trap! trip, trap!"" went the bridge."
"""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, with such a small voice."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy-goat; ""wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge."
"""WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! It's the second billy-goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, who hadn't such a small voice."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, ""Now you must really go."""
"""Aunty,"" he answered, ""I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me."" So the old woman let him stay."
"When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room."
"There he said to his bag, ""Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring."""
"The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened."
"""Who are you?"" she said to the prince. ""Where do you come from? Why do you come to my room?"""
"""Do not be afraid, princess,"" he said; ""I am no thief. I am a great Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came to see you."""
"""Well,"" said the princess, ""as you are the son of such a great Raja, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry you."""
"The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning came the princess said to her mother, ""The son of a great Raja has come to this country, and I wish to marry him."" Her mother told this to the king."
"""Good,"" said the king; ""but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall die."""
"In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. ""Oh,"" said the old woman, ""go away from this country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away."" But the prince would not listen to anything she said."
"The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king."
"There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house. ""Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,"" he said to the prince, ""must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed, you will die."""
"The prince was very sorry when he heard this. ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?"" he said to himself; ""and if I do not, the king will kill me."" He took the mustard seed to the old woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. ""Why do you look so sad?"" said the Ant-Raja."
"The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."""
"""Be happy,"" said the Ant-Raja; ""lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king."" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil."
"The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king said, ""You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my two demons and kill them."" The king a long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons; ""for,"" said the king to himself, ""perhaps the demons may be killed, and then I shall be rid of them."""
"When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. ""What can I do?"" he said to himself. ""How can I fight with these two demons?"" Then he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, ""Why are you so sad?"" The Raja's son answered, ""The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do this?"" ""Do not be frightened,"" said the tiger. ""Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."""
"Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him, ""May these tigers fight your demons for me?"""
"""Yes,"" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided they were killed. ""Then call your demons,"" said the Raja's son, ""and these tigers will fight them."" The king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons."
"""That is good,"" said the king. ""But you must do something else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you."""
"The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman's house and sat on his bed. ""Little bed,"" he said, ""up in the sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it."" The bed flew up with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him."
"Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter."
"""You have,"" he said to the prince, ""done the three things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."" ""If I can, I will,"" said the Raja's son."
"Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, ""To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."""
"The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad, and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. ""I had his oil crushed out by the ants,"" he said to himself. ""I had his demons killed by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"""
"At night he went on his bed to see the princess. ""To-morrow,"" he said to her, ""your father will kill me."" ""Why?"" asked the princess."
"""He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet."
"How can I ever do that?"" said the Raja's son. ""Do not be afraid,"" said the princess; ""do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."""
"Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince."
"""To-morrow,"" she said, ""when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet's blade."""
"Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:"
"""Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear."
"No there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."""
"""Good-bye, ducky,"" said Nurse. ""Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."""
"So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"""
"He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time."
"As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand."
"""I thought we were a Republic,"" said Lionel. ""I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."""
"""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"" said the Prime Minister, ""and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown so much a week, you know, according to people's means sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."""
"""But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"""
"""Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."""
"Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery."
"Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked."
"After tea Lionel said: ""I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"""
"""Bless the child,"" said Nurse. ""You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."""
"So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now when Lionel cried out: ""Oh, what a worldful of books!"
"Are they yours?"""
"""They are yours, Your Majesty,"" answered the Chancellor. ""They were the property of the late King, your great-great """
"""Yes, I know,"" Lionel interrupted. ""Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."""
"""If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"" said the Prime Minister, ""I should not read these books. Your great """
"""Yes?"" said Lionel, quickly."
"""He was a very good King oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little well, strange."""
"""Mad?"" asked Lionel, cheerfully."
"""No, no"" both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. ""Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was er too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."""
Lionel looked puzzled.
"""The fact is,"" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, ""your great """
"""Go on,"" said Lionel."
""" was called a wizard."""
"""But he wasn't?"""
"""Of course not a most worthy King was your great """
"""I see."""
"""But I wouldn't touch his books."""
"""Would there were folk hereaway,"" thought Halvor, ""that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together."""
"When he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle."
"""Good evening,"" said Halvor."
"""Good evening,"" said the old wife."
"""But what errand can you have in coming hither?"" she went on, ""for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more."""
"Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to Soria Moria Castle, and asked if she knew the way thither."
"""No,"" said the old wife, ""that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything?"""
"So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the tree-tops, the old wife went out."
"""THOU MOON, THOU MOON,"" she screamed, ""canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"""
"""No,"" said the Moon, ""that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."""
"""Wait a bit still,"" said the old wife to Halvor, ""bye and bye comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."""
"""Nay, nay,"" said the old wife when she went out again, ""you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door."""
Then she ran on:
"""But won't you swop him away to me? we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to Soria Moria Castle."""
"That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy."
"""For now,"" she said, ""I shall be able to ride to church. I, too, think of that."""
"As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry."
"""Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes."""
"So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again."
Out ran the old wife.
"""THOU WEST WIND, THOU WEST WIND! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."""
"""Yes, I know it very well,"" said the West Wind, ""and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."""
Out ran Halvor.
"""You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,"" said the West Wind."
"So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up."
"""Well,"" said the West Wind, ""now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."""
"In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding."
"""Aye, aye, that I have,"" said Halvor, ""he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It'll not be long before he's here,"" and then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle."
"So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be."
"So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor. He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass."
Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
"""Who is most worthy to have one of us,"" she said, ""he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom?"""
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
"""It was only a short time after this that I had such trouble about making my fort. Whenever I started to dig in a place I would find some other Mole there ahead of me."""
"""And then you would have to go somewhere else, of course?"" said the Ground Hog."
"""I'd like to know why!"" said the Mole, with his glossy silver-brown fur on end. ""No indeed! I had a perfect right to dig wherever I wished, and I would tell them so, and they would have to go elsewhere. One Mole was bad-tempered enough to say that he had as much right in the meadow as anybody, and I had to tussle with him and bite him many times before he saw his mistake.... They are disagreeable people over there, but why are you going so soon? I thought we would have a good visit together."""
"""I promised to meet Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband, ""and must go."
"Good-night!"" and he trotted away."
"Not long afterward this highly respectable couple were feeding together in the moonlight. ""What do you think of the Mole?"" said she."
"""Well, er ahem,"" answered her husband. ""You know, my dear, that I do not like to talk against people, and I might better not tell you exactly what I think of him. He is a queer-looking fellow, and I always distrust anyone who will not look me in the eye. Perhaps that is not his fault, for the fur hides his eyes and he wears his ears inside of his head; but I must say that a fiercer or more disagreeable-looking snout I never saw. He has had trouble with all his old neighbors, and a fellow who cannot get along peaceably in one place will not in another. He is always talking about his rights and what he thinks  """
"""You have told me enough,"" said Mrs. Ground Hog, interrupting him."
"""Nobody ever liked a person who insists on his 'rights' every time. And such a person never enjoys life. What a pity it is!"" and she gave a sigh that shook her fat sides. ""Now, I had it all planned that he should marry and set up housekeeping, and that I should have another pleasant neighbor soon."""
"""Ah! Mrs. Ground Hog,"" said her husband teasingly, ""I knew you would be thinking of that. You are a born matchmaker. Now I think we could stand a few bachelors around here, fine young fellows who have nothing to do but enjoy life."" And his eyes twinkled as he said it."
"""As though you did not enjoy life!"" answered his wife. ""Still, I could not wish any young Mole such a husband as this fellow. It is a great undertaking to marry a grumpy bachelor and teach him the happiness of living for others."" And she looked very solemn."
"""I suppose you found it so?"" said Mr. Ground Hog, sidling up toward her."
"""What a tease you are!"" said his wife. ""You know that I am happy."" And really, of all the couples on whom the moon looked that night, there was not a happier one than this pair of Ground Hogs; and there was not a lonelier or more miserable person than the Mole, who guarded his own rights and told people what he thought of them. But it is always so."
THE WILD TURKEYS COME
"The Wild Turkeys are a wandering people, and stay in one place only long enough to rear their young. One could hardly say that they lived in the Forest, but every year when the acorns and beechnuts were ripe, they came for a visit. It is always an exciting time when the Turkeys are seen gathering on the farther side of the river and making ready to fly over. Some of the Forest People have started for the warmer country in the South, and those who still remain are either talking over their plans for flight, or working hard, if they are to spend the winter in the North, to get their stores of food ready."
"It was so this year. One morning a Red-headed Woodpecker brought the news that the Turkeys were gathering. The Ground Hog heard of it just as he was going to sleep after a night of feeding and rambling in the edge of the meadow. One of the young Rabbits told him, and coaxed him to stay up to see the newcomers."
"""I've never seen Turkeys in my life,"" said the young Rabbit, ""and they say it is great fun to watch them. Oh, please come with me to the river-bank and see the Turkeys cross over. Please do!"""
"""Ah-h-h,"" yawned the Ground Hog. ""You might better ask somebody who has not been up all night. I am too sleepy."""
"""You won't be sleepy when you reach the river-bank,"" said the Rabbit."
"""Beside, I think there should be someone there to meet them."""
"At this, the Ground Hog raised his drooping head, opened his blinking eyes, and answered with great dignity: ""There should indeed be someone."
"I will go at once."""
"When they reached the river-bank there was a sight well worth seeing. On the farther side of the water were a great many Turkeys. Old Gobblers were there, and the mother Turkeys with their broods of children, all looking as fine as you please, in their shining black coats. When they stood in the shadow, one might think that they wore no color but the brilliant red of their heads and necks, where there were no feathers to cover their wrinkled skin. When they walked out into the sunshine, however, their feathers showed gleams of beautiful purple and green, and the Rabbit thought them the most wonderful great creatures he had ever seen."
"""Look at them now!"" he cried. ""Why do those largest ones walk up and down in front of the rest and scold them?"""
"""They are the Gobblers,"" answered the Ground Hog, ""and they are doing that to show that they are not afraid to cross the river. They strut and gobble, and strut and gobble, and say: 'Who's-afraid? Who's-afraid?'"
"until the rest are ready to fly over."""
"""Now the others are doing the same thing,"" said the Rabbit, as the mothers and young Turkeys began to strut back and forth."
"""That shows that they are willing to cross,"" answered the Ground Hog."
"""Now they will fly up to the very tops of the trees on the hill and visit there for a time. It is always so. They start from the highest point they can find. It will be some time before they come over, and I will take a short nap. Be sure to awaken me when they start. I want to welcome them to the Forest."" And the Ground Hog curled himself up beside a log and went to sleep."
The Rabbit wandered around and ate all the good things he could find.
"Then he fell to wondering how it would feel to be a bird. He thought it would be great fun to fly. To pass so swiftly through the air must be delightful, and then to sweep grandly down and alight softly on the ground without having people know that you were coming!"
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."

"[1474] Psellus (_Quaenam sunt Graecorum opiniones de daemonibus_, 3,"

I cannot agree with Miss J. Harrison (_Prolegomena to the Study of
"Greek Religion_, p. 569) as to the importance of Psellus’ testimony"
in any respect. He appears to me to give no more than a _résumé_ of
"information derived from Clement’s _Protreptica_, misunderstood and"
even more confused.

LADY DEDMOND.  Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be
"supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone.  Go"
quietly into the dining-room and wait for her.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!  Leave your mother to make up something.  She'll
do it!
LADY DEDMOND.  That may be he.  Quick!

being out.  I'll explain.

"LADY DEDMOND.  Yes, I know.  But you needn't say so.  Do you"
understand?
"PAYNTER.  [In polite dudgeon]  Just so, my lady."
[He goes out.]
SIR CHARLES.  By Jove!  That fellow smells a rat!

CHAPTER I
HIS LORDSHIP
Madame Gilbert's war service ended when Austria fell out. She had been
in Italy busied with those obscure intrigues for the confounding of an
"enemy which are excused, and dignified, as patriotic propaganda. She is"
"satisfied that on the Italian Front she, and those who worked with her,"
really won the war.
"The war satisfactorily won, Madame Gilbert sped home to revel in the"

almost historical importance in the events of the German occupation.
But the reader must interpret its meaning for himself.
LA GUERRE
"Ma soeur, vous souvient-il qu'aux jours de notre enfance,"
"En lisant les hauts fails de l'histoire de France,"
"Remplis d'admiration pour nos frères Gaulois,"
Des généraux fameux nous vantions les exploits?
"En nos âmes d'enfants, les seuls noms des victoires"
Prenaient un sens mystique evocateur de gloires;
On ne rêvait qu'assauts et combats; a nos yeux
Un général vainqueur etait l'égal des dieux.
Rien ne semblait ternir l'éclat de ces conquétes.
Les batailles prenaient des allures de fêtes
Et nous ne songions pas qu'aux hurrahs triomphants
"Se mêlaient les sanglots des mères, des enfants."
"Ah! nous la connaissons, hélas, l'horrible guerre:"
"Le fléau qui punit les crimes de la terre,"
Le mot qui fait trembler les mères à genoux
Et qui seme le deuil et la mort parmi nous!
Mais ou sqnt les lauriers que réserve l'Histoire
A celui qui demain forcera la Victoire?
Nul ne les cueillira: les lauriers sont flétris
Seul un cypres s'élève aux torubes de nos fils.]

"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."

SIR CHARLES.  Who's that?
LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.

GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?
GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.

"PAYNTER.  Yes, sir--that is, yes.  The--er--mistress was not dressed"
"at all.  A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir."
GEORGE.  What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?
PAYNTER.  Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine;
"and Captain Huntingdon, too--Mr. and Mrs.  Fullarton might be a bit"
"late, sir."
GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?
"PAYNTER.  Not to me, sir."
GEORGE.  Send Burney.
"PAYNTER.  Very good, sir.  [He withdraws.]"

associated with Ferrier.

PARTY AT RAM MOHAN LIBRARY
"On Saturday, 24th July, 1915, the members of the Ram Mohan Library and"
"Reading room received Dr. J. C. Bose, the President of the Library in a"
"right royal fashion, on his return to India from his Scientific"
Deputation to the West.
"There was a large and influential gathering, and the spacious hall was"
tastefully decorated.
Dr. J. C. Bose arrived at 6:15 p.m. and was received at the gate by Mr.
"D. N. Pal, Secretary. Dr. Bose then went round the hall accompanied by"
the members of the Executive Committee while the Bharati Musical
Association played excellent Jaltaranga Orchestra.
"Babu Bhupendra Nath Bose, Vice-President of the Library, made a"
brilliant speech welcoming Dr. Bose and detailing the great services
done to the country by him.

head?
CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.
CLARE.  [With a touch of rapture]  Ah-h!
GEORGE.  Why do you let him come?  What d'you find interesting in
him?
CLARE.  A mind.
GEORGE.  Deuced funny one!  To have a mind--as you call it--it's not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
CLARE.  We don't.
GEORGE.  Then what do you talk about--your minds?  [CLARE looks at
him]  Will you answer a straight question?  Is he falling in love
with you?
CLARE.  You had better ask him.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.
[She follows the GENERAL out]
"[CLARE stands perfectly still, with her eyes closed.]"
MALISE.  Delicious!
"CLARE.  [In her level, clipped voice]  Perfectly beastly of me!  I'm"
so sorry.  I simply can't help running amok to-night.
MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]
MALISE.  Don't spoil it!
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.

GEORGE.  Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir."
GEORGE.  Well?
"BURNEY.  I don't think she meant it, sir."
"GEORGE.  I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact."
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir.  The mistress said: ""I hope it'll be a pleasant"
"evening, Burney!"""
GEORGE.  Oh!--Thanks.
"BURNEY.  I've put out the mistress's things, sir."
GEORGE.  Ah!
"BURNEY.  Thank you, sir.  [She withdraws.]"
GEORGE.  Damn!

SIR CHARLES.  I'm fond of her.  Nothing she wants that she hasn't
"got, is there?"
HUNTINGDON.  Never heard her say so.
SIR CHARLES.  [Dimly]  I don't know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her.  H'm?
[A short silence.]
LADY DEDMOND.  There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night.  I forget
if you know him.
HUNTINGDON.  Yes.  Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.
LADY DEDMOND.  He's literary.  [With hesitation]  You--you don't
think he--puts--er--ideas into her head?

"bit of an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows.  Can't see Clare----"
"LADY DEDMOND.  No.  Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be"
encouraged.  Listen!--It is her-coming in.  I can hear their voices.
Gone to her room.  What a blessing that man isn't here yet!  [The

"BECAUSE you cried, I kissed you, and,"
Ah me! how should I understand
That piteous little you were fain
To cry and to be kissed again?
"Because you smiled at last, I thought"
That I had found what I had sought.
"But soon I found, without a doubt,"
No man can find a woman out.
"I kissed your tears, and did not stay"
Till I had kissed them all away.
"Ah, hapless me! ah, heartless child!"
She would not kiss me when she smiled.

_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.
"PAYNTER.  Country homes--I know 'em.  What's her father, the old"
"Rector, like?"
BURNEY.  Oh! very steady old man.  The mother dead long before I took
the place.
"PAYNTER.  Not a penny, I suppose?"
BURNEY.  [Shaking her head]  No; and seven of them.
PAYNTER.  [At sound of the hall door]  The Governor!
BURNEY withdraws through the curtained door.
"GEORGE DEDMOND enters from the hall.  He is in evening dress,"
"opera hat, and overcoat; his face is broad, comely, glossily"
"shaved, but with neat moustaches.  His eyes, clear, small, and"
"blue-grey, have little speculation.  His hair is well brushed."
"GEORGE.  [Handing PAYNTER his coat and hat]  Look here, Paynter!"
"When I send up from the Club for my dress things, always put in a"
black waistcoat as well.
"PAYNTER.  I asked the mistress, sir."
GEORGE.  In future--see?
"PAYNTER.  Yes, sir.  [Signing towards the window]  Shall I leave the"

THE DAWN
An undefined melancholy overshadowed the world. Autumn breathed in the

"On the summit of a wood-crowned hill, rising like a pyramid above moor"
"and forest, stood two men silent under the shadows of an oak. In the"
"Perfectly-running Motor Cars I’ve seen,"
It’s quite a Different Proposition when
"They’re on the Road, and filled With Gasolene!"
"The Moving Motor speeds, and having Sped,"
Moves on. Nor all the Cries and Shrieks of Dread
Shall lure it back to settle Damage Claims;
Not even if the Victims are Half Dead!
"And when at Last you’ve mastered Belts and Bolts,"
"When with no fear of Side-Slips, Jars or Jolts,"
Your Sixty H. P. Racer licks up Miles
"At Lightning Speed,—turn on a few more Volts!"
Then in your Glorious Success exult!
"When your Car plunges like a Catapult,"
Sit tight! Hold hard! Pass Everything in Sight!
And you will be Surprised at the Result!

"""I want to come back to you.  I can't go on there.  It's--it's--I've come"

"His hand pressed hers tightly, as if he were trying to save her the need"
for saying more.  Gyp went on:
"""I must get baby; I'm terrified that he'll try to keep her, to get me"
"back."""
"""Is he at home?"""
"""I don't know.  I haven't told him that I'm going to leave him."""
Winton looked at his watch and asked:
"""Does the baby ever go out as late as this?"""
"""Yes; after tea.  It's cooler."""
"""I'll take this cab on, then.  You stay and get the room ready for her."
"Don't worry, and don't go out till I return."""
Good to be roaming;
"Even in London, even at midnight,"
Lover-like in a lover’s gloaming.
"You the dancer and I the dreamer,"
"Children together,"
"Wandering lost in the night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
DURING MUSIC.
"THE music had the heat of blood,"
A passion that no words can reach;
"We sat together, and understood"
Our own heart’s speech.
"We had no need of word or sign,"
"The music spoke for us, and said"
All that her eyes could read in mine
Or mine in hers had read.

Brent Taber was human and his triumph had been a thing of satisfaction

Not that he was unhappy. He was content and almost relaxed as he sat in

GENERAL FOREWORD
"No word of Preface is necessary to this Volume, except to say that"
"in presenting it to his readers, the author feels that that he is"
fulfilling a promise made to them when Volume I of the series was
issued.
A word of explanation will be found as an introduction to each
"subdivision of the book, which excludes the necessity of making any"
reference to such subdivisions in this General Forward.
THE AUTHOR.
"Salt Lake City, January, 1912."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
GENERAL FOREWORD
AFTER LOVE.
"O TO part now, and, parting now,"
Never to meet again;
"To have done for ever, I and thou,"
"With joy, and so with pain."
"It is too hard, too hard to meet"
"As friends, and love no more;"
Those other meetings were too sweet
That went before.
"And I would have, now love is over,"
"An end to all, an end:"
"I cannot, having been your lover,"
Stoop to become your friend!
ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.
"IF I bid you, you will come,"
"If I bid you, you will go,"
"You are mine, and so I take you"
"To my heart, your home;"
"Well, ah, well I know"
I shall not forsake you.
One of Captain Roberts's pirates. Hanged at the age of 25.
"SMITH, JOHN."
One of the mutinous crew of the _Antonio_. Hanged at Boston in 1672.
"SMITH, JOHN WILLIAMS."
"Of Charleston, Carolina."
"Hanged in 1718 for piracy, at Charleston."
"SMITH, MAJOR SAMUEL. Buccaneer."
At one time a buccaneer with the famous Mansfield.
"In 1641 he was sent, by the Governor of Jamaica, with a party to reinforce"
the troops which under Mansfield had recaptured the New Providence Island
from the Spanish. In 1660 he was taken prisoner by the Spanish and carried
to Panama and there kept in chains in a dungeon for seventeen months.
"DE SOTO, BERNADO."
One of the crew of the schooner _Panda_ that took and plundered the Salem
brig _Mexican_. The crew of the _Panda_ were captured by an English
"man-of-war and taken to Boston. De Soto was condemned to death, but"
eventually fully pardoned owing to his heroic conduct in rescuing the crew
A sleepy old forgotten song.
"Softly the stealthy night descends,"
The black sails fade into the sky:
"Is this not, where the sea-line ends,"
The shore-line of infinity?
I cannot think or dream: the grey
"Unending waste of sea and night,"
"Dull, impotently infinite,"
Blots out the very hope of day.
RAIN ON THE DOWN.
"NIGHT, and the down by the sea,"
And the veil of rain on the down;
And she came through the mist and the rain to me
From the safe warm lights of the town.
"The rain shone in her hair,"
And her face gleamed in the rain;
And only the night and the rain were there
As she came to me out of the rain.
BEFORE THE SQUALL.
"""I wish this confounded thing hadn't happened. It spoils our win."""
"The Chief Justice nodded, and whistled a bar or two of some sad ditty."
"""I'm glad she's dead, poor soul, Perry,"" he said."
"""There's the girl,"" said Sir Robert."
"""Ay, there's the girl."""
"They did not speak again till they were just parting, when the Chief"
"Justice broke out,"
"""Why the deuce couldn't the fellow take his beastly photograph with"
"him?"""
"""It's very absurd,"" answered Sir Robert, ""but I feel just the same about"
"it."""
"""I'm hanged if you're not a gentleman, Perry,"" said the Chief Justice,"
"and he hastened away, blowing his nose."

"MY DEAR WHITE,"
The publication of this book is a business arrangement between you and

of friendship and esteem. This then is to remind you of pleasant hours

"In the Table of Contents, the ""PART III"" division precedes Chapter VII,"
but in the body of the book it precedes Chapter VIII.
"Page numbers in this book are enclosed in curly braces.  For its Index,"
a page number has been placed only at the start of that section.  In
"the HTML version of this book, page numbers are placed in the left"
margin.
Footnote numbers are enclosed in square brackets.  Each chapter's
footnotes have been renumbered sequentially and moved to the end of
that chapter.
"PERKINS, BENJAMIN."
One of Quelch's crew. Captured at Marblehead in 1704.
"PERRY, DANIEL."
Of Guernsey.
"Tried for piracy in 1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and found guilty."
Hanged on November 8th at White Point. Buried in the marsh below low-water
mark.
"PETERSON, CAPTAIN."
"Of Newport, Rhode Island."
"In 1688 he arrived at Newport in a ""barkalonga"" armed with ten guns and"
"seventy men. The Governor prosecuted him for piracy, but the grand jury,"
"which consisted of friends and neighbours of Peterson, threw out the bill."
"Among other charges, Peterson was accused of selling some hides and"
"elephants' teeth to a Boston merchant for £57, being part of the booty he"
had previously taken out of prizes in the West Indies.
"PETERSON, ERASMUS."
Tried for piracy with the rest of Captain Quelch's crew at Boston. Was
"hanged there on June 30th, 1704. When standing on the gallows ""He cryed of"
"injustice done him and said, 'It is very hard for so many lives to be"
"withholding the non-essentials. But, above all, let us fill the scrip"
"with gifts that the child need never reject, even when he passes"
through “the gate of sleep.”

The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans
"reckoned An VIII as a leap year, though it is not one in the Gregorian"
"Calendar. Hence that year ended on Sept. 22, and An IX and succeeding"
years began on Sept. 23. Consequently in the above table of months the

When there are two appellatives coming in different parts of
"the alphabet, cross-reference from the rejected one, as _Thomas"
Cantuariensis_. See _Thomas Becket_.
Arrange in two alphabets names that differ slightly in spelling and
"come close together in the alphabet: e.g.,"
"_Brown_ and _Browne_, and the French names beginning with _Saint_ and"
_Sainte_. As readers may not always know the spelling of the author's
"name, cross-references should be made: e.g., _Brown_. See also _Browne_."
Arrange by the forename headings in which the family name is the
same.
"No attention is to be paid to prefixes, as _Bp., Capt., Dr., Hon., Sir,"
"Fräulein, Miss, Mlle., Mme., Mrs._, or to suffixes, as _D.D., F.R.S.,"
"LL.D._, etc."
"When the forenames are the same, arrange chronologically."
"No attention is to be paid to the titles _Sir_, etc.: e.g., _Bart, T."
"L._, comes before _Bart, Thomas_, for the same reason that _Bart_ comes"
before _Barta_.
Forenames not generally used should be neglected in the arrangement.
When an author is generally known by one of several forenames he will
"heard it, for he stood up and forced a smile upon his long sad face."
Noll went close to him hurriedly:
"“One word, Netherby--quick, before she comes--do you know where Betty"
is?” he asked hoarsely.
Netherby smiled a sad smile:
"“Ah, Noll, that _you_ should have to ask _me_ that!”"
Noll passed Julia at the stair-head and left them together.
"As he stepped across the hall he hesitated, turned, and went into the"
"old lady’s room. She was sitting in the window, looking out; and she"
turned at his footfall.
Noll bent down and kissed the old face; and he saw that the harsh light
had gone out of her eyes:
“Won’t you be a little lonely here to-night?” Noll asked her.
"“No,” she said--“she has taken seats for all three of us.”"

sausages--Nushliki--The last of civilisation--Further
information--Sand-holes and digging--Petrol in the desert.

"Staff at Delhi, sent for me and gave me orders to take charge of the"
military operations in South-East Persia.

A great silence held for a moment. The woman's head sank upon the
man's shoulder. Madness had passed. Her eyes were fixed upon his with
"a wonderful earnestness, a splendid calm."
"""Is this a dream?"""
"""It is the truth!"""
Through the forest aisles rode the Duke of Spoleto.
He saw and paused.
"""I return beyond the Alps to join the forces of Rudolf of Hapsburg. My"

He wheeled about and was gone.
Again silence held for a pace.
Presently Ilaria gave a great sigh and looked strangely at the sun.

SPRING TWILIGHT.
To K. W.
"THE twilight droops across the day,"
I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
That palely comes and covers all.
"The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,"
The menace of the dreary night:
"But in her face, more fair than morn,"
A sweet suspension of delight.
IN WINTER.
"PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,"
"go on when one was tired--tired of her--and wanting only Gyp, only his"
"own wife?  That was a funny thing!  And now, when, for an hour or two, he"
"had shaken free of worry, had been feeling happy--yes, happy--this fellow"
"must come, and stand there with his face of a sphinx!  And he said"
pettishly:
"""Well, Paul! sit down.  What troubles have you brought?"""
Rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down.  He struck even Fiorsen by
his unsmiling pallor.
"""You had better look out for Mr. Wagge, Gustav; he came to me yesterday."
"He has no music in his soul."""
Fiorsen sat up.
"""Satan take Mr. Wagge!  What can he do?"""
"""I am not a lawyer, but I imagine he can be unpleasant--the girl is"
"young."""
"Fiorsen glared at him, and said:"
"""Why did you throw me that cursed girl?"""
"Rosek answered, a little too steadily:"
"""I did not, my friend."""
"""What!  You did.  What was your game?  You never do anything without a"
"game.  You know you did.  Come; what was your game?"""
Lift not your Hands to him for Help. For he

Went and came in the gloom:
It was dark in the little room.

And a hand and a ring I know.

"Unclouded noon of peace, there lies"
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs
In the seclusion of her eyes;
Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;
And there’s a little flame that dances

LOVE IN SPRING.
"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then"
"Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!"

"Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife."

Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring.
"Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,"
Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.
Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!

Frank Corson rang the bell and waited at the door of Rhoda Kane's
apartment. The door opened. She wore a pale blue brunch coat. Her hair
"glowed in the light of midmorning, but her face was pale and a little"
drawn.
"Her eyes were slightly red, as though she might have been crying."
"""Hello, Rhoda."""
"""Hello, Frank."""

"""I should have climbed that peak long ago if you, Miss Torsen, hadn't"
"forbidden me,"" said the lawyer."
"""You'd never have made it,"" said Mrs. Molie in an indifferent tone. This"
was probably her revenge. She turned to the Dane again as though ready to
believe him capable of anything.
"""I shouldn't want anyone to think of climbing that peak,"" said Miss"
"Torsen. ""It's as bare as a ship's mast."""
"""What if I tried it, Gerda?"" the manufacturer asked his wife with a smile."
"""After all, I'm an old sailor."""
"""Nonsense,"" she said, smiling a little."
"""Well, I climbed the mast of a schooner last spring."""
"""Where?"""
"""In Iceland."""
"""What for?"""
"""I don't know, though--all this mountain climbing--I haven't much use for"
"it,"" said the manufacturer."
"""What did you do it for? What did you climb the mast for?"" his wife"
repeated nervously.
The manufacturer laughed.
"""I don't know, Rhoda. I should know but I don't. I should have known"
what was wrong so I could have done something about it. It just went
"sour, I guess."""
She turned and walked to the window. He wondered if there were tears in
her eyes.
"""Good-bye, Rhoda."""
"""Good-bye, Frank. I'm sorry."""
"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"
open. A man stood there--a man in a blue suit with empty eyes.
Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.
"""Sit down,"" he said."

tearing off his blouse.
"""Oh, Lav, what'll we do! What are you going to do now?"" cried Sidney."
"""It's so black,"" wailed Pola. ""I'm--sick!"""
"""I'm going to swim ashore. It's the only way. I don't know how long"
"this old tub'll stand a sea and the wind's rising. We got to get help."""
"""You shan't swim alone, Lavender Green. We'll _all_ swim. That's"
"nothing of a swim--"""
"""You can't! You forget--Pola."""
"Sidney wheeled in consternation. ""Pola's complex!"" The girl was"
"crouched, now, on the deck, an abject, wailing figure."
"""You go with Lav, Mart,"" said Sidney in a quiet voice. ""I'll stay with"
"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""
"""Oh, gran'ma!"" Mart's voice choked. ""But she'd be the one to _tell_ me"
"to stay--"""
"""It's no use our all trying it,"" muttered Lav. ""I'll get there or I"
"won't get anywhere."""
"""Maybe it's too far for you to swim!"" Sidney was at Lavender's side,"

Fiorsen said violently:

Rosek smiled.
"""My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like"

"""Gustav, don't be a fool!  With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man."
"Without--you are a child.  Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr. Wagge."
But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the
"moment.  Calm yourself.""  And, flipping the ash off his cigarette on to"
"the tray by Fiorsen's elbow, he nodded and went."

AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
"IT was a day of sun and rain,"
Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.

"Rance dealt the cards. Before either looked at them, he glanced across"

"“Yes,” he admitted, taking off his glasses and polishing them"

hear that a somewhat similar attempt was made on the safe of my friend
Herman Schloss in Maiden Lane.”
“You lost nothing?”
Moulton put his glasses on and looked Kennedy in the face frankly.

Giovanni Frangipani saw a furious face glaring dead white from under

"He stopped in his onward rush, blinked at the duke as one gone mad."

The Frangipani growled like a trapped bear.
"He raised his sword, put forward his shield."

Slowly Lavender placed the knife in Sidney's eager hands. It was an
"ordinary case knife such as the fishermen carried, but Lavender pointed"
to two initials that had been carved on the case.

ON JUDGES’ WALK.
THAT night on Judges’ Walk the wind
Was as the voice of doom;
"The heath, a lake of darkness, lay"
As silent as the tomb.
"The vast night brooded, white with stars,"
Above the world’s unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
Like a strong heart repressed.
"That night we walked beneath the trees,"
"Alone, beneath the trees;"
There was some word we could not say
Half uttered in the breeze.
That night on Judges’ Walk we said
No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
Before the Judge’s Day.
IN THE NIGHT.

"“That’s my name,” replied the boy."
“You are here on a mission for your father?”
“I am here on a hunting trip.”
"“With business on the side, eh?”"
"“No business at all,” replied Jack."
“We know better than that!” the stranger answered.
“What do you want of us?” asked Jack.
"“We want information now in your possession,” answered the fellow,"
looking Jack sharply in the eyes.
“What kind of information?”
“We want to know where certain documents are.”
"“You’ll have to ask some one else, then.”"
“We are certain that you have the information we require.”
"“If I had,” Jack answered, “you never would get it from me.”"
"“You will gain nothing by being obstinate,” the fellow said. “Remember"

_C. Custance._ And he stood by
"While Ralph Roister Doister, with help of Merrygreek,"
For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.
"_C. Custance._ And of a ring and token,"
"That Suresby, I spied, did more than half suspect"
That I my faith to Gawin Goodluck did reject.
"_T. Trusty._ But was there no such matter, Dame Custance, indeed?"
"_C. Custance._ If ever my head thought it, God send me ill speed!"
Wherefore I beseech you with me to be a witness
That in all my life I never intended thing less.

Yourself knows well enough.

The affair seemed to cause him intense amusement. A ray of light
appeared to Yvonne.
"“You won’t interfere with me at all, Amédée--not claim anything?”"
"“Oh, don’t be afraid. _Dès ce moment je vais me reflanquer au sapin!_ I"

"“Thank you,” said Yvonne. “You were always kind-hearted, Amédée--oh,"
it was a horrible mistake--it can’t be altered. You see that I am
helpless.”
"“Why, my child,” said he, seating himself again, “I keep on telling you"
it is a farce--like all the rest of life. I only laugh. And now let us
talk a little before I pop into the coffin again. What is the name of
the thrice happy being?”
"“Oh, don’t ask me, I beg you,” said Yvonne shivering. “It is all"
so painful. Tell me about yourself--your voice--Is it still in good
condition?”
“Never better. I am singing here this afternoon.”
“In the Kursaal?”

The lawyer was startled.
"""Is he--?"""
"The blankness of the lawyer's face was a remarkable sight. His small,"
athletic brain failed him. A moment passed in silence.
"""Yes, early tomorrow morning,"" said Solem. ""I thought I'd tell you."
"Because after all it was your idea first."""
"""Yes, so it was,"" said the lawyer. ""You're quite right. But now he'll be"
"ahead of me."""
Solem knew how to get round that.
"""No, I didn't promise to go,"" he said. ""I told him I had to go to the"
"village tomorrow."""
"""But we can't deceive him. I don't want to do that."""

"“I'll go and tell her now,” said John."
“Let me just say how d' ye do to her first. I won't stay a minute.”
The two men entered the sea-chamber together. Stella welcomed her Great
High Favourite and chatted gaily for a while. Then she commanded him to
sit down.
"“I 'm afraid I can't stay, Stellamaris. I have to go back to London.”"
Stella glanced at the clock. “Your train does n't go for an hour.” She
was jealously learned in trains.
“I think John wants to talk to you.”
"“He has been talking to me quite beautifully for a long time,” said"
"Stella, “and I want to talk to you.”"
"“He has something very particular to say, Stellamaris.”"
"“What is it, Belovedest?” Her eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands"
over her childish bosom. “You are not going to marry Belinda Molyneux?”
"“No, dear,” said John; “I'm not going to marry anybody.”"
“I'm so glad.” She turned to Herold. “Are you going to get married?”
"“No,” smiled Herold."

THE ARRIVAL OF THE DOBUANS IN BOYOWA
3rd April               The Dobuan fleet appears in Vakuta.
"3rd-5th April           They receive Kula gifts, exchange presents"
and trade in Vakuta.
"6th April               Arrival of the Dobuan fleet in Sinaketa,"
"magic at the beach of Kaykuyawa, ceremonial"
reception.
6th-10th April          The Dobuans (as well as the Amphlettans)
"remain in Sinaketa, receiving Kula presents,"
giving pari gifts and trading.
"10th April              They all leave Sinaketa, receiving talo'i"
(farewell) gifts. The Dobuans sail south (and
the Amphlettans to Kayleula and the smaller
Western Trobriand Islands).
10th-14th April         The Dobuans are engaged in fishing in the S.
Lagoon.
RETURN JOURNEY
"14th April              They reappear in Vakuta, and receive their"

One of Captain Quelch's crew. Turned King's evidence at the trial for
"piracy held at the Star Tavern, Boston, in June, 1704."
"PRINCE, CAPTAIN LAWRENCE."
In 1760 this buccaneer sacked the city of Granada in company with Captains
"Harris and Ludbury. Late in the same year, Prince, with the rank of"

"PRO, CAPTAIN."
"This Dutch South Sea pirate owned a small plantation in Madagascar, and"
was joined there by the pirate Williams after he had escaped from slavery.
Both were taken prisoner by an English frigate. In a fight with the
"natives, the pirate crew was defeated, but Pro and Williams managed to"
"escape and to reach some friendly natives. Procuring a boat, they sailed"
away to join some other pirates at Methulage in Madagascar.
"PROWSE, CAPTAIN LAWRENCE."
"A Devon man, a noted sea captain, and a terror to the Spaniards. Was"
imprisoned by King James I. at the instance of the King of Spain for
Balt. A half-hour's run down the bay and he clambered from his launch
"to the pile-driver, where, amid the confusion and noise, he made known"
his tidings. The big fellow's calmness amazed him.

"""Butcher by hand,"" said the fisherman."
"""But how? That takes skilled labor--lots of it."""
"George grinned. ""I'm too old a bird to be caught like this. I figured"

The blue-grey smoke of cigarettes
Curls from the lessening ends that glow;
"The men are thinking of the bets,"
"The women of the debts, they owe."
"Then their eyes meet, and in their eyes"
"The accustomed smile comes up to call,"
A look half miserably wise.
Half heedlessly ironical.
IN THE HAYMARKET.
"I DANCED at your ball a year ago,"
"To-night I pay for your bread and cheese,"
"“And a glass of bitters, if you please,"
"For you drank my best champagne, you know!”"
"Madcap ever, you laugh the while,"
As you drink your bitters and munch your bread;
"The face is the same, and the same old smile"
Came up at a word I said.
"A year ago I danced at your ball,"
I sit by your side in the bar to-night;
"And the luck has changed, you say: that’s all!"
"And the luck will change, you say: all right!"
"The rain on my garret roof is falling,"
And I am cold and in pain.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And my heart is wild with delight;
"I hear her voice through the midnight calling,"
As I lie awake in the night.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And I see her bright eyes gleam;
"She smiles, she speaks, and the world is ended,"
And made again in a dream.
MUSIC AND MEMORY.
To K.W.
"ACROSS the tides of music, in the night,"
"Her magical face,"
A light upon it as the happy light
Of dreams in some delicious place
Under the moonlight in the night.
"Music, soft throbbing music in the night,"
Her memory swims
"Into the brain, a carol of delight;"
The cup of music overbrims
"With wine of memory, in the night."

'Where is he?' I asked sternly.

"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"

'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of

Something in his tones brought to his hostess one of those swift fits of
repentance that were apt to wait for her whenever she allowed herself to
treat this visitor with friendliness. He was so very prompt in
responding!

"""I--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing her?"""
Mr. Coxon's wishes were fulfilled to the moment. The door opened and
Alicia came in. On seeing him she stopped.
"""Come in, Alicia,"" said Lady Eynesford. ""Here's Mr. Coxon come to be"

Coxon stood up with a propitiatory smile.
"""How do you do, Mr. Coxon?"" said Alicia, giving him a limp hand. ""Shall"

And amorously bends above
The wonder of your face.

"As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit passage,"

She clung to him:

“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling
"rosaries and photographs who spoke scarcely any Italian or French, but"
did speak Spanish. Probably he was a Jew.

The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....

"is to be taken in place of the family or forename, as _Tintoretto_"
(whose real name was Giacomo _Robusti_). Similar cases are _Canaletto_
"(Antonio _Canale_ and also B. _Belotto_), _Correggio_ (Ant. _Allegri_),"
"_Garofalo_ (Benvenuto Piero _Tisi_), Il _Sodoma_ (Giov. Ant. _Bazzi_),"
"_Spagnoletto_ (Jusepe _Ribera_, now however oftener called _Ribera_),"
_Uccello_ (Paolo _Doni_). Always cross-reference from the family name.
"(_b_) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g., _Kaye_, John,"
"Bishop of Lincoln. _Lincoln_, John, Bishop of. See _Kaye_."
"Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their forename: e.g.,"
"_Canon Liddon_, _Bishop of Ripon, Henry Edward_, _Archbishop of"
"Westminster_, i.e., _H. E. Manning_. Care must be taken not to treat"
Canon as a forename or Edward as a family name.
"(_c_) Married women, using the known form:"
"Wives often continue writing, and are known in literature only under"
"their maiden names (as _Miss Freer_ or _Fanny Lewald_), or after a"
second marriage retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
"Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., _Ward, Mrs. Elizabeth"
"(Phelps)_. Use the form _White, Mrs. Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C._,"
"when the husband's name is used: e.g., _Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake)"
"Garretson_. _Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)_. _Soyaux, Frau Frieda"
"(Schanz)_. _Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier) Comtesse de_."
Women known under their husbands' names are to be entered as follows:
"_Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan), Mrs. H. A. Hinkson_. Cross-reference"
to be made from the latter form.

Oh.
"Now, were the gophers two-dimensional or three?"
Three.
"No, no, no."
"3D, super 3D."
Like...
Yeah.
- Now this is just a limited test demo.
- That was a demo?
I think you should beta test the full experience we're working on.
"There'd be more money in it, of course."
If you're game?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Uh-huh, I'm game."
I'm game.
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh!

Like Lee Marvin hitting John Wayne.
Did they?
Yeah.
"These are wooden, wooden chairs?"
Aye.
Wooden chairs.
Tell me more about this party.

"~ It was at our restaurant, Pete's."
"Oh, the American one?"
"Ah, right, I've heard that's good."

"No, we both own it."
"In love I am lucky, you know?"
"- My love brings ""bonheur""."
- What's she saying?
- Look in the guide book.
"- Me, have a look?"
"- Explain, guide book."

- I don't understand.
- Like this.
"Hey, dites-moi!"
"Hey, he likes me!"
See?
Voilà!
I told you this would be an adventure!

"WELL,"

You're not rescuing anyone being the size of a gerbil.
"Well, do you have any more of that cake that made me grow before?"
Upelkuchen?

You got my attention.
The statue.
Yeah.
Bring the girl to me and you'll get it back.
Sounds like a fair trade to me.
Where you wanna meet?
I need to know the girl is still alive.
Her brother isn't.
"Listen, I'm a businessman."
The death of the little girl is trouble I just don't need.
I need proof of life.

Sorry about that.
Room 311 has no hot water in the bath.
Room 311?
"Hurry, go."
You go instead.
"It's your job to deal with customer complaints, no?"
"Please, go for me."
And you call yourself a man?

To cook Chinese food.
I didn't come back even when Grandpa died.
I trained hard.
Was it all in vain?
What's so great about ShaoIin Kung Fu?
What can you do?
I don't...
You can break logs?
You're strong.
It's just more violence.
Found it.
Good.
Who's there?
Rin.
What are you doing?
"You'II teach me Shaolin Kung Fu, right?"
But the Teacher said I shouldn't.

- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.
Is your mom back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Will your mom be OK with this?
"- Yes, I'm sure she will."
She always gives that much.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize that...
We usually don't accept money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we're allowed."
"Well, it is a nice house."
Just look.
I guess they can afford it.

"Violet, a little bit more to the right."
Malakhov!

It is the headquarters.
"-Astra, Astra, we've started the fight on the hill."
"-Astra, Carnation is on the line."
Keep it high overthere.
Can you hear ir?
Keep it high!
"- Camomile, it is Astra!"
-Why are you dragging along overthere?
She is going to Mumbai.
Party is fine.
But till 2 o'clock?
Her lifestyle here is such.
What will she do in Mumbai?
I worry when I think about it.
Her friend Pia has found her a job.
In a fashion house.
She will be busy in Mumbai.
I don't think so.
"Well, she is our daughter."
She will make us proud.
And keep your diary with you.
It pricks me the whole night.
Shobha.
"Mother, catch."
"- Oh, God."
Gul.
Stop it.
Shobha.
- Yes.
Coming.
Sit.
"Gul, how many clothes will you take?"
Yes.
- Yes.
Mother and daughter's meeting is over?
- Yes.
It's over.
Gul.
Last night you returned home very late.
I didn't like that.
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
Yeah.
"Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?"
You prick!
This is no time for jokes.
What a fucking loser.
Go!
- Nothing?
- No.
Don't just stand around.
Check the back.
What's that?
Fucking bastard...
Byeong-gyu!
Over here.
Hurry UP-
Is that him?
Over there.
Where?
Follow me.
Where?
What the...?
Who's that?
What is that thing?
Don't come any closer.
Back off.
Back off.
Stop it.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
"My name... is Indrid Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?
"I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here."
"Slow down, Gordon."
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
"Gordon, let me talk to him."
Sure.
Hang on.
I saved my job.
That's good.
But how?
"Well, last night I showed my work."
I will be promoted soon.
Congratulations.
So today's dinner is your treat.
Okay?
Done.
Tell Carol as well.
Cool.
How did you come here?
"Wow, Carol!"
It's amazing!
I also feel like doing something.
Shall I go for a shoulder massage?
Very funny.
Go out.
We will meet for dinner.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We will meet for dinner.
But what about lunch?
I am very busy right now.
I can't.
Please go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Give me some money then.
What?
Is good.
It make you relax.
(GROANS)
Get me out of here!
Get me out!
"Oh, pardon moi!"
"Oh, pardonnez-moi, monsieur."
Let me out.
"Wait, I shall get the button."
WILBUR:
Easy!
One moment.
Stop this thing.
"Voila, we stop."
"Good, oui?"
And now to get you down.
Just one moment.
"One moment, monsieur."
"Monsieur, one moment."
(SIGHS)
And now for the landing.
(GASPING)
"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Let me go!
Let me go!
"There we are, monsieur."
You are next.
Shampoo?
You're a sick man.
That's it!
"I've got the merchandise all right, but I can't deliver it."
They're checking everyone in and out of the hotel.
Thank you.
"Alright, say ""kimchi""."
Kimchi.
Here.
Thanks.
No!
Get away from me!
I said don't!
Don't!
Let me go!
Please!
Please!
Don't do this!
"No, no..."
Where's the vibrator?
"Sorry, I'll go get it."
Found it.
Ready.
And... action!
"Wait, no..."
Stop...
"Please, let me go."
No streetwalkers allowed here.
You talk big for a kid.
Thanks.
See you in a bit.
But you allow that?
Delivery girls are fine.
They're not filthy like you.
"I used to be a call girl, you know."
That's an ancient term.
You're showing your age.
"YOU WATCH, NANCY."
THEY'LL ALL BREAK DOWN-ALL THREE OF THEM.
MAYBE ONE WON'T.
WHICH ONE?
THE REPORTER-EDITOR OF THE SENTINEL
"BUT, STILL AT HEART, A REPORTER..."
THE ONE WHO OFFERED ME NOTHING FOR MYSELF-
A GOOD OFFER- THE OFFER OF A FRIEND.
THEN DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO HELP HIM?
NOBODY EVER HELPED ME.
"NOW, YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE!"
AMOS KYNE DID AND GRIFFITH WOULD...
AND I WOULD.
I'D DO ANYTHING YOU ASKED ME.
YOU BETTER STICK TO YOUR FRIEND.
HE'S YOUR TYPE.
YOU'RE MY TYPE.
SHALL WE PHONE MY MOTHER AND FATHER?
AND ASK THEM IF YOU SHOULD MARRY
A REPORTER WITHOUT A PENCIL?
TO TELL THEM I'M GOING TO.
"OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW!"
IS THAT YOUR BOSS CALLING?
DOES HE USUALLY CALL AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?
EVERY NIGHT.
HELLO?
YES.
JUST A MOMENT.
IT'S FOR YOU.
YES?
"LISTEN, ED,"
"YOU'RE A REAL GOOD PAL OF LIEUTENANT KAUFMAN'S, AREN'T YOU?"
"""And while sitting there and basking in the glory"
"""and sublimity of mercy..."""

Mmm.

AUDREY:
"If you're hungry, I could make you a sandwich."
Give me something to do.
Maybe you haven't eaten.
OTIS:
No thanks.
I had something.
I do appreciate it.
[Greta growling]
"Oh boy, this is a real sick headache."
Better wait a while.
It's still bubbling a lot.
OTIS:
"Well, I like it best."
[Gasps]
[Gagging]
"My god, what's wrong?"
[Audrey screaming]
What happened?
What's wrong with him?
AUDREY:
The do...
"Damn it, I want to know what happened here."
"Now, what's wrong with her?"
[Audrey sobbing]
You get on the phone.
Call an ambulance now!
Do it!
[Growling]
What are you going to do with him?
"What do you mean, ""do with him""?"
He can't stay here forever.
No.
"When he's recovered, that's for him to decide."
"You look a little flushed, dear."
Do I?
Perhaps you should get some fresh air.
"Well, when it's a little cooler, I will."
"Well, it's time for my rest, I think."
I'll look in on the patient.
Hello.
Hello.
I've had an idea.
"Now, look."
"I say the word, and you repeat it after me."
You understand?
Never mind.
You'll soon catch on.
"""Chair."" Now you say it."
"""Chair."""
Chair.
Very good!
Very good!
"""Door."""
Door.
Oh!
"Uh, ""clock."""
- Clock.
- Yes.
"""Mirror."""
- Mirror.
It smells good.
I'll just go get the clothes.
That machine's thunking again.
Paulie!
"How are you, Frank?"
"-l'm good, considering."
"-Yeah, of course."
Of course.
Coffee?
Nettie's down with the laundry.
Stay for lunch?
Osso buco.
Osso buco.
Nettie fixes it piemontese.
Peppers and everything.
"No, that's all right. I had my lunch."
-Can I get coffee?
"-No, thanks."
So.
What do you think?
"Well, same old thing."
This time it's this Calhoun guy.
I never liked him.
-He's a cracker.
-Of the worst kind.
He's out of here tomorrow.
"No, I don't think so."
What are you talking about?
He's a reed.
You push him and he bends.
Not this one.
This one's a terrier.
"Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase."
"Me, you, dinner."
Pi-cha-kow!
- What the...?
Ow!
Oh!
- Ka-chow!
- Please!
- I know.
I get that reaction a lot.
I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.
Agh!
Ow!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Did I scare you?
"A little bit, but I'll be all right."
OK.
I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
"Do what you gotta do, baby."
But listen.
Be careful.
"Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean."
Ka-ching!
Ah!
I'll keep that in mind.
"- Hey there, Mater."
"- Howdy, Sally."
"- Hi, folks!"
- Good morning!
You know her?
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.
What?
I think I'll stay here for a while.
It's peaceful.
Go home.
It was good to meet you.
Thank you.
"Don't look back, Tony."
"Hey, Tone."
Where are Sid and Michelle?
No idea.
"You're a terrible liar, Jal."
Anybody can see you've got something going on.
- Shit!
- Christ!
What the fuck?
!
Tony!
- What the fuck are you...?
- Shut up!
"- Sid, are you gonna let him?"
"- Tony, I'm objecting to..."
You're always fucking objecting!
Can't you do something?
OK.
"OK, Jesus."
"Tony, what?"
"Are you trying to scare me, because it's not working?"
I love you.
I'm saying it again.
OK?
And you.
"I love you too, you little fucker."
This is wrong.
Is it like I feel with you and Mom?
Is there anyone in particular?
No.
"Well, if there ever is, you just let me know."
I'm always here for you.
"- Okay, Dad."
- Okay.
"- Good night, Mikey."
"- Good night, Dad."
"- I love you, boy."
"- Love you, too."
Oooh!
Tomorrow I'll tell you a bedtime story.

( Glass Shattering )
What the hell?
"Hey, come out here!"
Come on!
"David, forget it."
I'm gonna kick some ass!
( Cat Screeching )
"David, leave Rosie alone!"
She scared the hell out of me.
She's just a cat.
"David, come inside."
So who's out here?
"Huh, Jess?"
Don't start that again.
Wait!
You're not gonna answer me?
I don't know!
In our hearts you are today...
You're thirty three.
The age of Christ.
- Cheers.
Here's to you.
Bottoms up!
I bet you had forgotten.
Call us when you wake up.
Cheers.
Yes.
Psychomot.
It's you.
You are Mister...
Thomas.
Right?
- Yes.
How are you?
I just woke up.
I didn't call you.
Excuse me?
- I didn't call you.
How are we in contact?
It's normal.
Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.
Doctor Sorensen!
Mr Thomas.
Hello.
I imagine you don't recognize me.
There it is!
"It'll soon be a steak, poor ostrich."
Let's scare it off.
-With what?
With these.
Here it comes...
We'll make you run for your feathers.
Senna.
The firefighters said that a cigar started the fire.
I don't buy it.
It was an accident.
Let me make you feel better.
Think.
-No.
"Please, think."
All grown-ups suck.
-Right.
Let me at least hold you.
"I'm hurting, Jemina."
Jemina speaking.
-What are you doing there?
Taking care of this fool.
-Good.
I want to talk to him.
-He's sleeping.
Taisto is in the hospital.
He's about to die.
It's high time to come see him.
I'll come right away.
"-Not you, honey."
"Calm down, Mom."
I've got an idea.
- Yes...
Straight ahead.
Good night!
"Come on, we can't stay herei."
- He says that...
- What does he say?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Jimmy, you can't come here."
Never.
My father...
the war... he's sick.
I brought this for him.
- I see.
- Yes.
"- Pretty, isn't it?"
- Yes.
"But put it away, I can't take it."
My father musn't know.
I have to go.
I need to drop it off.
Wait.
"No, wait, listen..."
"I wanted to say, Jimmy, that I'm very happy when I'm with you."
- But I have to go.
- Wait.
What a lovely butt.
So firm.
It's marvellous.
"It's lovely, very love."
Come!
"Come, yes, like that."
- Oh!
- [Laughing]
- Albert!
- [Claire] Forget it!
Forget it!
- Why?
I need a bigger man.
- Bigger?
- Yeah.
- What do you -
- He's -
- Bigger in what way?
- He's too short for me.
- I need a tall man.
- He's too -
He's too...
He's too short?
When do we take off all our clothes?
"Ah, Helen."
Helen!
[Claire] I don't care what you say.
"Lfhe's good-looking, I don't give him to anybody."
So you mean we don't have a chance around you.
Is that what we're saying?
"- Oh, no."
I don't say that at all.
- Oh.
I take him fast and whisk him away.
- l...
I don't give any other woman a chance.
- I've noticed that.
"You know what, Helen?"
I know.
"- Well, we got 'em."
- Yeap.
- Yours look awesome on you.
"- Yea, so did yours."
"Hey, I know we never really talked about stuff... since that day."
Are we cool?
Yea.
Course.
Precious.
"Hey, you hungry or anything?"
Not really.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
"Yea, screw food."
I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth.
You want me take your bag home?
No?
This better not be Russ.
It's my Dad.
Really?
"I've tried to get the pizza place, but I..."
I pressed his number instead.
Long story.
"Hang on a sec, Phil."
See you Daze!
Hey Dad.
April?
"Are you... uhm, April?"
Hi.
Hi.
I was a friend of your father's.
I just want to let you know that...
Or for whoever's controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Erica!
Unh!
Over here.
"Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
"Hey, Scott!"
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.
Hello?
Over here.
"Quickly, Sheriff!"
The air lock is closing.
"Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding..."
"Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?"
Watch where you're going!
Sorry.

"Good work, Woody."
"Mom, can I play Black Hole?"
"Please, please, please?"
-Andy!
"-Now, we need to find a ship"

-Wait a minute.
"No, Buzz!"
This way.

I just saw it.
-You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive.
And Astro... turf!
-Where is it?
I don't see the...

That's it.
Spaceship!
"All right, Buzz, get ready."
And...
-And the universe explodes!
"-Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket."
Buzz!
Has to run down on fire?
"No, actually."
"He's kind of looking forward to it,"
Because it's sort of like two stunts in one.
"It's a regular fire burn and the stair fall,"
So he wants it for his reel.
So he's kind of looking forward to it.
Is everybody ready?
"Kimberly, are you ready?"
-Ready.

"Hey, sweetheart."
Hi.

Dad got it for me.
That was very nice of him.
Yeah.
I-
"- I know it looks like... well, awesome, but it's super safe."
Dad-

He's visiting from New York University Hospital and is pretty much the most brilliant pediatric surgeon in the country.
Coolio.

He's coming over here.
"Don't say ""coolio."""
"Hello, Dr. Lonsdale."

I have a couple questions
What is it?
You are Mr. Keizo Kanieda?

A search request for a missing person...
A missing person?
It's for Miyu

We know Miyuki Saito lives here
We want to talk to her.
Can we see her?
Please!

Wait a sec
"Um, not enough... natural light."
Thank you.

"Okay, whatever happens..."
- Good luck.
"- Yeah, man, you too."

"Let's meet Julia and her husband, John."
"John, you love your wife a lot, right?"
Just a minute.
All right.
Yeah?
That'll be $16.75.

- Great.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
Do you know this woman?
Are you kidding me?
She's my wife.
No way.
Is she dead?

"- Hold on, hold on."
"We want to ask you some questions, please."
Open this door...
"Shoo, shoo."
"Go on, get..."
"I'm in a band, you see."
And we've got this song.
"And our lead singer, Andrea, she's really great."
And she thinks we could be super mega pop stars just like Livi.
"But only if Livi hears our song, and then she can help us."
Hmm...
Interesting.
"Well, thank you, Mary."
Mia.
Quite.
"I couldn't possibly take it from you, sweetie."
"But, uh, Megan?"
Hmm...
"I like your spirit, Mary."
Let me see what I can do.
"Oh, you'll take the song to Livi?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Livi's a very busy woman.

There was no teamwork.
I never meant to...
You drag them down.
You can't play in a team.
There's no team play in Kung Fu.
But you're teaching them Kung Fu.
No!
I'm teaching them the spirit of Kung Fu.
You know only the form.
This can't be true.
Mr. Iwai is...right.
I don't understand teamwork.
But...
please forgive me.
Let's go!

Do you know where Ryan is?
He's getting in on the 10:30 Ferry.
Wants you to pick him up.
He called.
I guess you were busy.
Got it.
Oh baby.
What's all this?
"Come on, I'll drive."
...just the fact that Jim gave me the case.
"I mean there are five other guys he could've given it to, but, he handed it to me."
Hi baby.
Miranda is insanely jealous.
What's in your pocket?
You haven't listened to a word I've said have you?
"Yeah, five guys..."
Miranda's insanely jealous.
What's in the pocket?
Open it.
It's your mother's old silver chain.
"Ryan, it's beautiful."
"So long, morning!"
Don't let the door hit your tits on the way out!
"See you around, Matt!"
Don't trip on your...

Your... giant dick.
I'm exhausted.
Long day.

"Yeah, real fresh."
"Well, sleep tight."
You too.

Something's broken here.
I'm not saying that it's not.
I...
We don't...see things the same way anymore --

Um...
"He was here a couple of minutes ago, but I know he's going on soon."
"- I was just wondering, is he okay?"
"- Yeah, he seemed fine."
- Tell him to call me after.

All right.
Y'all having fun?
Good.

I'm glad.
"Well, our next performer is Eddie Tennenbaum, and, uh..."
- Whoo!

"Yes, we all love him."
"No, he's not..."
Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of them fancy helicopters."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure."
- You mean it?
"Oh, yeah."
Anything you say.

"Oh, yeah."
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.
Two-three
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."

Nice.

Come on.
Just for fun.

- Hmm?
"- Kissy devil, isn't he?"
Look at him.
- Yeah.
"- Well, they're all cousins."
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm down.
Totally cool.
We can just bypass the whole little coffee thing.
Yeah right.
Kind of awkward yeah...
I know.
Wash?
Hola!
Wash?
No I didn't pee on my hands.
Yo mama.
Hey did you see ZACH?
He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
I'm too far away!
[ Grunts ]
"No, no!"
Look up here!
[ Grunts ]
Hey!
Who's the wiseguy?
She saw me!
She saw me!
"Oh, there's Steven, just flyin' around."
[ Chuckles ]
"No, Amethyst, come back!"
"Wait, can Steven fly?"
"Yeah, I think I remember that."
"No, no, I'm thinking of Lapis!"
"Hey, Steven!"
How did you learn how to fly?
Amethyst!
Go get help!
What?
!
"Ugh, she can't hear me."
"Hey, air-Steve!"
Amethyst!
"I need you to -- dang, too slow."
Better ask quicker.
What'd you say?
"I could really use your assistance dealing with the sudden appearance -- aw, rats."
...of a power which previously was unbeknownst to me which I can't control -- umm.
"Dude, summarize!"
Go get Garnet!
Hmm.
How are you?
Good.
Ow!
Richie!
It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Oh.
Oh.

Oh!

Oh!
Oh!
HE GROANS
Where's the fucking remote?
"Oh, no."
"It's all right, you don't have to go."
"I'm sorry, Norma."
I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.

"What's your name, son?"
God.
I want this baby.
"But it's not that simple, is it?"
"I mean, it might turn out to be... brownish."
"Oh, right."
And is Moz racist?
No.
"That's not the point, is it?"
It's just... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
I'm comin'!
"'Ey, that's what got you into trouble in the first place."
- Hiya.
Is Moz in?
- He's off hunter-gathering.
He's out gettin' some cigs.
- Can I wait for him?
- Who are you?
Craig.
Friends call me Craigie.
Moz calls me Craigie.
I've got a delivery for him.
Really good gear.
He's been asking us to come round for ages.
- Shall I spark up a doobie?
- I suppose that's the least you could do.
Yeah.
- You haven't got a beer?
"- I have, yeah."
"- You two lesbos, then?"
- What?
- I'm bi.
She's bi-curious.
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.
"[Doors close, engine starts]"
That was really cute.
"Oh, stop it."
Kendall.
Ha... nice to see you.
How was San Pedro?
"Wasn't too much traffic, was there?"
What freeway did you take?
"Well played, Castle."
"You beat me, unfair and square."
All right.
Let's get this over with.
Where is she?
Her text said it was important.
I don't know.
"- Let's go, then."
- Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
I don't know.
"Ah, now, Jesus..."
"- No, I do know."
- Well?
I'm not telling.
"Now, look..."
"Jesus, do you hear that?"
Gobshite!
"Now, don't start that."
Just tell us.
- I can't.
- Why not?
"- I just can't, right?"
"- Well, is he married?"
"No, he's not."
"Well, that's something I suppose."
"Ah, Kay..."
"Jesus, stop it, will you?"
"The music getting to you, is it?"
They're inside watching the telly.
"Go on, get in there."
Go.
Get in.
Go on.
Will he marry you?
"No, I don't think so."
"Ooh, the Iouser."
"That's cheatin', that is."
- It's not a game.
"- I know that, Kay."
"I mean, it's his fault as much as Sharon's... isn't it, whoever he is."
Everybody leaves.
"First, my father."
"Monk, don't do this now."
"- Then, Trudy."
Trudy didn't leave you.
Sharona.
"Now, Dr. Kroger..."
I can't blame Natalie for leaving.
"I'd leave me, too, if I had the chance."
"God, I am the king of Garfunkel."
I am oozing Garfunkel.
"She'll be back, Monk."
She just needs time to cool off.
That's right.
She probably feels worse than you do.
She looks pretty happy to me.
"Oh, would you just turn it off?"
Please.
It's just...
It's too painful.
"No, no."
Wait.
Did she just say 15?
I've got four numbers here.
Our next number is 33. 3-3.
"So nice, they named it twice."
Oh.
- My God.
"God, I can't stand it anymore."
All right...
And our final number for $212 million is... 54.
54.
The next departure will be Los Angeles to Chicago.
"Help you, sir?"
"Change, sir."
Sir!
Change.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
"-I've got 'em all, what do you want?"
-You want one?
"Okay, new shooter comin' into the game."
"All right, guys, four."
I got it.
Who wants a hard-ways four?
-Two to one.
-Two to one on the hard ways?
Right.
You got it.
What about you?
Dollar here.
"Okay, roll 'em."
Come on.
Don't touch this money.
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.
"-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night."
"-Honey, gimme some money."
"Come on, we're gettin' lucky."
These guys don't know craps from wheat or somethin'.
Come on!
"No, I'm not giving it to you."
What?
"No, you don't understand."
This is your last chance.
Get out with your hands up.
Here he comes.
He drives like a cop.
Pull up to him.
"Come on, fellas, easy."
My leg!
Something's wrong with my leg.
- Where's Dad?
"- Tommy, listen..."
"He's been shot, Tommy."
The killer got away.
Daddy!
Jesus Christ!
Look who's here.
"- Tommy, sorry about your father."
"- Thanks, Don."
You just couldn't stay away.
Why come to the sentencing?
We've already heard your testimony.
- Uncle Nick.
"- Hi, Tommy."
- How are you feeling?
- I don't know.
- How's the leg?
- Okay.
- I don't want to be here.
- You're a better man than I am.
"Tommy, they got the guy that killed your father."
- What is this?
- His name's Kesser.
He couldn't even lift those women.
-Three deuces.
CHARLEY:
You can't beat that boy.
-Nobody can beat that kid.
"-That's right, Charley."
Nobody ever has.
"You ought to know that, Bill."
"Yeah, I know."
Six.
"Misdeal, isn't it;"
"Oh, have you got six too;"
Five. I could've used another.
HORTON:
"Look, kid, gambling is my business."
Yeah.
And I know my business.
"After this, if I've got six cards, I'll make it known."
Sure.
You bet.
You deal.
-Any of you seen Judge Chamberlain;
"-No, what do you want with him;"
MAN 1 :
His office wants him.
CHARLEY:
Try the bank.
"Forget it, Joe."
He didn't mean anything.
"It's all right, Charley."
"All right, kid, you're the judge."
-Judge of what;
"-Go ahead, deal."
I'm going inside.
You can just stay here and watch for sharks.
OK.
"[Whispering] Yeah, you go."
I'll stay and...
What?
Sharks?
Ariel!
"[Grunts] Ariel, I can't..."
I mean...
"- Ariel, help!"
- [Laughs]
"- Oh, Flounder."
- [Whispers] Ariel.
Do you really think there might be sharks around here?
"Flounder, don't be such a guppy."
I'm not a guppy. [grunts]
This is great.
"I mean, I really love this."
"Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner... [screams] Ariel!"
"[Grunts] Oh, are you OK?"
"Yeah, sure."
No problem.
I'm OK.
Shh!
"Oh, my gosh."
"Oh, my gosh!"
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow!
Cool!
"But, uh, what is it?"
"I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will."
- Piss off

I've just seen Danny.
Yugo Danny.

Happy Birthday.

But I've no wheels.

I've got pussy going.
You'll have to take 10 grams minimum.
- We'll take 20.
If we go now.
- That'll be 2500 in cash.

Then I can't help you.

"Hey, guys!"
Come here!
There's something wrong!
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
He must be having some kind of allergic reaction to the drug.
I ca-

He's dead.
You killed him.
What if he was lying?
!
He wasn't lying!
He gave you the answer!

Okay.
"Handcuffs might seem like overkill, but they're going on."
"They're going on, okay?"
You have the right to remain...

"Daddy didn't let you out, huh?"
Good boy.

You didn't feed Twister.
You didn't let him out.
Peed all over the floor.

I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.

I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.

Your pinky goes on the third fret there.
Hit it.
Hit again.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch...
catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
My name... is Indrid
"Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.

"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
"Gordon, all that..."
It's a Iittle...

Ow.
Well beautiful.
I did not see one like this yet.
"Newer cardboards, Ágika!"
Wow it no.
Not at all.
Our kindest guest humiliates himself with so inferior work.
This can not be.
"Me, not spare, my Mariska."
"Now, when I feel well finally."
"Cardboards, Ágika!"
Here you go.
"If it is for major lord, has desire for him really."
What his blessed hand yes.

I don't want to forget.
"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.
"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."
"- Bye, Quico."
"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.
"Look, the cotton candy man."
Spin it around.
This one.

- Life is expensive these days.
I want a piece of this cloud.
"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.

Nope.
He's real.
And he's really all right?
"No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag."
"Uh, hello?"
He's a good guy.
"Well, he better be."
He is.
He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?

Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."

Help!
What's wrong with you?
I thought you're the masked killer.
You're the biggest coward I've ever seen.
Dry the clothes!
Use both fingers.
Why?
It's a waste of effort.
This is our family secret.
Do it!
It's not practical.
Get it.
Who dropped these money?
Money?
It's mine!
I dropped it!
You dirtied my clothes!
I'll kill you.
You've got the wrong person!

Where do you think you're going?
- Ah Foon.
- What?
"Look, we're friends."
I'm going to make you brave tonight.
How?
You mean...
It's not as bad as that.

You need to hurry.
You're falling behind you know that?
Yes.
Day 12
I've heard that people can stay up for 11 days.
This is day 12.
I've broken the world record.
Where no one has gone before.
This means more than a Cannes Lion award.
"We're born once, so we got to give it our all like this."
I think...
I've reached the apex of work now.
"If Peng could see me now, he would know I gave it my all."
My chest hurts.
It hurts badly.
Body.
Like this.
HE YELLS
"Oh, like that?"
Yeah.
"No, try another one."
No.
No.
No.
No.
You did that one already.
"I know, that's similar but more powerful."
"Try one more. ""Hap hap."""
"""Ninya!"""
Now you're just making up words.
"I'm not, that's Japanese for ""hello."""
It's not Japanese.
Kimaragnas!
She's going to be offended if you do that.
"Rey, hey, hey, hey...!"
I don't...
I don't think we should do the power moves in there.
HE YELLS Konichiwa!
Brilliant!
"OK, good, that's a Japanese word."
Yes.
And one that I'm sure she'll be impressed by.
Yes.
"Let's do this, O'Leary."
"Hello, Philip."
"Hakuna matata, sensei."
Senpai.
We are currently looking into the kidnap of Simon Cowell.

Angie's parked over here in the LTD.
[Russo On Radio] Cute.
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.
"That car's dirty, Cloudy."
We're gonna sit here all night if we have to.
[Shouting]
[Vehicle Approaching]
[Horn Honks]
What time is it?
Ten after 4:00.
- Huh?
- Ten after 4:00.
That's the third time those guys have been around.
- All right.
Let's hit 'em!
Hit 'em!
- [Siren Wailing]
Freeze!
All right.
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
[Sirens Continue]
Get over...
Get over there!
Hey!
Get up there!
Spread those fucking legs!
Now stay right there!
"You move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off!"

I'm going up.
Right.
"Oh, I'm coming now."
[Wind howling]
[Seagulls screeching]
Janet?
- Janet!
-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?
- I can't see it.
- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.
[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?
I don't know.
Do what?
Somers.
Martin Somers.
"I tell you all about it tomorrow, but now I got many people to call."
You be there.
Goodbye.
"Hello, Axel."
Shall I call him back?
No.
I guess not.
He'll be here first thing in the morning.
"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, that."
We'll go to your place.
I'll make you some supper.
Then you have a good night's sleep.
Look.
What is it?
I don't understand.
What does that mean?
I'm going to find out.
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!
What's going on out here?
Why you knock my sign down?
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
- What is this here?
- Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."
Ow!
"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
"Of course, now, they refuse to go to bed on time..."
We would expect you to cook all the meals.
"Wash up, laundry-"
- That's in addition to the baby...
Mommy!
As well as I bought...
"No, no.... ...Mommy made a mistake, but Mrs. Singh is going to take good care of you."
Okay?
"Marva, it's time to say goodbye to your children--"
"No, no, no, no-- Please!"
Please!
Come honey--
Please-- Don't do this.
Come here.
NO!
Sean!
Mommy!
"I love you, I love you."
Let go of her!
Mommy!
"No, they're mine!"
Mommy!
Mommy!
Marva?
Marva!
Are you okay?
I'm so-
- I'm so sorry.
"Well, thank you--"
"Mrs. Field,"
"I promise, I'm not a flake."
I'm very good at sleep-training and I'm an excellent cook.
[WILL LAUGHING]

LOVELACE:
Our alien benefactors... have abandoned us!
They have abandoned us!
SVEN:
Everybody!
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
- I don't believe it.
- I did.
I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!
"Listen to me, Selena."
Listen.

Detective Kelly.
"-Yeah. I remember you, detective."
KELLY:
Come here.
-Should I call Detective Roberts at home?
-You know this isn't cool.
"-Maybe Connie, his wife, will answer."
-You gotta do me a really big favor.
-What's that?
Mike promised to get me money.
I can't get in touch with him--
-That's not how this works.
"-But if I could borrow $20, I promise- l will give him your message."
-l gotta get up. I don't have any money.
-l'm gonna give him your message.
-No.
"No, no, no."
That's not good.
You think I'm only his snitch?
You think that's what I am?
I'm not.
I'm his round-the-world girl.
I'm his whore.
-What the hell's going on?
-You got a visitor.
"Hi, Mike."
-You're not supposed to be in here.
-l haven't seen you for three days.
Idiot.

It carries more fish than penguin that any existed.
In-land.
-And he's amazing ...
Impressive ...
-Sven?

Is anyone down there very special.

Can you take this for her?

"No, she."
"Ali, surrounded by children."
-That is your wife?
-Yes.
Really?
-Yes.
-Your wife?

You're gonna have to come talk to me sooner or later.
Go away!
I can't!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
"I love you, and I don't deserve you, but this is our home."
"This is our home, Jenna, and I'm..."
I'm not gonna leave this porch until you talk to me.
Jenna?
Hey.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sorry.
But I'm moving into Kenny's.
I'm still gonna be his dad.
Okay.

You get to stay by my side.
I feel so privileged.
I'll get it.
"Now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up, and blow that whistle I gave you."
- Hello.

- Hello?
- Hi.
Is this a bad time?
No.
Just hold on a sec.
The music.
I'll be right back.
- Hey.

I did.
You're right.
Sorry.
"- So, what's up?"
- Nothing.
- What about you?
- Same.
"So, what have you been doing?"
"Nothing much, just hanging out, in the park mostly."
- Central Park?
- Washington Square Park.
It's cooler.
It's where David Lee Roth got busted.
Right.
I hope he's got it together now.
Sounds like you got a party going on there.
"- No, it's just me and my mom."
"- ""Abanibi""."
"Right, by Yizhar Cohen."
I-bi lo-bove (I love you)
I-bi lo-bove you-bou...
- Don't you get it?
- What?
"The restaurant's called Yizar, Yizhar Cohen."
There's a restaurant named after Yizhar Cohen?
That explains the hair.
"It isn't a restaurant, it's a fan club."
For Yizhar Cohen?
Why?
Do you speak French?
You look surprised.
Haven't you heard of us?
- No.
- You see?
God knows where he sends us.
"On April 22, 1978, our king, Yizhar Cohen, won Eurovision."

34 years ago in three weeks.
Israel is our mother and Yizhar is our king.
Cheers.
I'll serve you myself.
Eat hearty.
It's all kosher.
"- April 22, 1978."
- What?
That's Shai's birthday.
Why did we come here of all places and they're playing Mom's favorite song?
- She's sending us signs.
"- Yeah, in ""B"" Language"
"- Oh, I get it."
"You're celebrating already, huh?"
You ungrateful pieces of shit!
- He's okay.
He's okay.
- Unbelievable.
- What are you doing here?
- You're bloodsuckers.
All of you.
I hope your 401ks go straight to hell.
Victor.
"Whoa, whoa."
Hey.
"Come here, come here."
Calm down.
You're making a scene.
These aren't your employees.
"- Oh, wow."
You're right.
- Come on.
"Why did you do this to me, Truman?"
Why did you do it?
You think I don't see what's going on?
"I go to jail, and who benefits?"
You.
You prick.
"I thought we were friends, Neil."
"Donnie, what the hell, man?"
I'm here.

"Sensei, sorry to trouble you."
We brought you quite a bit of trouble.
"Ah er, I have some good wine here, have a little."
"I am the team captain, Tezuka."
Captain?
- You're mistaken.
- Tezuka is a third year student.
Yo Tezuka-sensei.
Tezuka-sensei.
- But that o-chibi was quite good today.
"- Yes, he was."
- He scared me a little.
- Um.
"Ah, that was the Nitouryu."
That Nitouryu was not natural.
Not natural?
He learned from his father.
"His father, you said Echizen Nanjiro?"
- You're bothered because of this?
- Eh?
What do you mean?
What is it?
What?
"Sir, I would suggest that you get help before you fly again."
"Oh, I'll never be doing that"
- again.
"But I did it, didn't I?"
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
- I did it!
- You did.
Are you up?
"No, I'm here."
Can I come over?
What can I say?
- Thank you.
You saved me.
- So your apartment's ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
They did a great job.
It's better than it was before.
I should've burned it down long ago.
- Ok.
Ok.
- Ok.
"Well, goodbye."
Goodbye.
- I lost the apartment.
- I know.
I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.
I know that's a lot to ask of an ex-wife.
"David, I think that you should sleep in my basement."
Ok?
Come on.
"She will pay for that, I swear."
The phone.
We have to warn the Ministry.
(Telephone)
Hallo?

Ah.
But I just broke up with Bill...

"""Girls Are Funny, Too"" stuff happening..."
- Right.
- ...and Goldie's actually letting me do a rewrite of one of the sketches.
"Oh, wow."
Congratulations.
"Thank you, so it's just-- man, it's just-- it's really bad timing for me right now."
"Timing, right."
So...
is there any chance we could just be friends?
Of course.
[laughs]
"Yeah, yeah."
"- Okay, good."
"- Yeah, friends."
"- I'll see you later, friend."
- All right.
Oof.
Hey.
"Missed your time, Sull."
"By ten minutes, just put me up next."
- Sorry.
- Who's here?
Booked until 1:45.
"Oh, angel."
You're the best.
You're the best in the land.

- This is the very best.
The very best girl ever in the whole wide world.
"The prettiest, smartest, brightest,"

"- Mom, please."
Oh!

How much?
How much?
How much will you give me for her?
"No, I'm just kidding."
I'm just kidding.
Have some fabric softener.
"Yes, indeed."
Ooh!
I'm gonna get a few of them.
"What, honey?"
What?
"What are you looking at, huh?"
What are you looking at?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
And I started flipping out.
I was moving my foot and hitting my toes with my...
"Oh, that's disgusting."
Let's not talk about it.
Ugh.
Yeah?
"Brave kid, huh?"
"Yeah, brave or stupid."
One of the other.
"How's, uh, how's your proble?"
"He's all right, why?"
Just asking.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just asking.
I've known you long enough to
Know that just asking means
Anything but.
"I'll tell you what, he's a"
"Complete idiot, but he's our"
"Complete idiot, all right?"
"OK, got you."
"OK, OK, what's the nut on the"
"Game, man?"
"What do you want to do, like, 50 bucks a head?"
400 bucks to the winning team?
You got it.
All right.
"Let's get it on, man."
"Yeah, let's get it on."
"What is this, 1977?"
"'77, '78, you're gonna get"

"If you hit the bottle, all"
Out of what?
"- Your words don,t match your lips."
- Neither do yours.
"What,s going on?"

"It,s back to normal."

Get everything off your chests.

- Yes.
Go on.
Just like that?
"well, um... you,re dumb."
"No, you are."
Is that all you can think of?
"No, I couId say..."
"I,ve had enough."
You go out.
"You see people and have fun, while I,m stuck here alone."
Then you come home and get waited on.
Are you kidding now?
"Sure, I laugh all day long."
"And you cry too, right?"
What would you know?
Where's our mom?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
Fine.
"Elias, let's make a deal."

"I said he could stay the night, kid."
It's morning now.
"(SOFTLY) Look, I'll try to come over, okay?"
But there's this weird guy here who's watching me.
What's that supposed to mean?
"I got this big, giant..."
Giant thing out here.

"No, man."
No.
I ain't never-
Is it Joe the barber?
"Joe the barber, right?"
"That's who it is, isn't it?"
"- Aw, don't give us any shit."
What's Joe's last name?
"- I don't know, man."
I never heard of it.
"Well, this was some time ago."
I don't think anybody's seen her since December.
December?

Kiki.
Maku's my grandfather.
He's also an old fool.
"Boy, that's tough swimming."
I don't know what he's trying to prove.
Swimming to Laie Point and back is 1 0 miles.
He do that often?
Every time he feels old.
He's in trouble.
"No, he's not."
Are you crazy?
You nearly drowned.
"Hush, child."
Have you lost your senses?
Is that the way to speak to your grandfather in front of a stranger?
- Not many men can time a wave like that.
Tom Magnum.
- Maku.
"Kiki, go get us some beer."
"Hey, brahda, you married?"
"I know you,II do your best to help."
"You,II also be helping your fellow citizens - and France!"

"Get off her, let go, let go!"
Pang!
I've been waiting for you!
Get him!
Listen.
Spare my life.
"Last time I spared you, you didn't learn."
It's not my idea.
I disobeyed orders.
Who's orders?
Talk!
We're all hired.
Who by then?
"Lun, Lun Sanye."
(groaning)
(whipping)
(going ringing)
The great whip.
Good.
Great whip.
That's some great throwing.
But I'll never be able to do anything as good as he does.
Sanye!
What's wrong?
"Wide-Eye, Tiger-Wang and Playboy, all of them killed by that young kid!"
What?
Where is he now?
"He's out front, fighting like mad with our men."
Let's go.
No.
Like this.
"I thought this makeup thing was gonna be hard enough, but now-- ok."
Like what?
Um...
Your accent.
My accent?
"It's a little thick, honey."
"Ok, well, what the hell am I supposed to do?"
It's the way I talk.
"""Talk."" See?"
"That right there, ""talk."""
So what are you saying?
"After 7 years all of a sudden, my accent bothers you?"
It's not a question of it bothering me.
"I mean, look, are you smart?"
Sure.
Do you sound smart?
[Grunting]
O-ok.
"Um, so what else?"
Your laugh.
My laugh?
Yeah.
Ha!
"Well, I thought people think my laugh is fun."
"Yes, if you think loud, scary noises are fun."
O-ok.
So what else?
What else?
Nothing else.
Come on.
Tell me!
There's nothing else!

Thanks for the hard work.
"See, a straight shot."
I could've stopped him.
"Buzz, I would love to see you try."
"Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater."
"The sooner we move, the better."
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
All this packing makes me hungry.
"What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet?"
Pizza Planet?
"Oh, cool!"
"Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready."

Will Andy pick me?
"""Don't count on it""?"

"Oh, Buzz!"
Buzz Lightyear.
"Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness."
We've got trouble!
-Trouble?
Where?
-Down there.
Just down there.
"A helpless toy, it's..."
"it's trapped, Buzz!"
Then we've no time to lose.
I don't see anything!
"Oh, he's there!"
"Just, just keep looking!"
- I'm clean!
"- If I do, you know what happens."
- Yeah.
I said I'm clean.
Get off!
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass!
Give me a nickel.
Give me a nickel.
Come on!
I told you I'm clean.

This is goddamn full of shit.

Doesn't register.

Or should we get a bottle?
"Oh, definitely get a bottle."
Coffee for me.
"You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you."
Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes.
"No, I mean, I've only got one good eye."
Could we change places?
"Oh, sure."
-Are you okay?
"-Oh, yes, yes."
Fine.
-This is a nice place.
-Yeah.
It's my favorite.
You ever come here with Charlie?

He's a big steak-eater.
I'm more of a fish guy.
"You know, I'm surf, he's turf."
And we're cops.
-You're very cute.
-You too.
All right.
So tell me about yourself.

"They're so crispy, and you add a little salt... (LAUGHS) I just think they're so delicious."
Ooh!
Who is this?
"You're a masterpiece, aren't ya?"
"You're like a Shelly Pfeiffer, you're like a Charlie Theron, or like a Penny Cruz."
Ooh!
You're like a little Angie Jolie.

You gonna be angry 'cause she lied to you again or what?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm angry."
"You know something, Danny, if I'm honest with myself,"
I also understand why she did it.
"I mean, given the circumstances,"
I probably would have done the same thing.
"Yeah, see, 'cause I think that maybe she just didn't want you worrying about her."
Little hard not to now.
Huh?
I think that she is gonna be fine.
She's gonna be fine.
She's a very tough lady.
She can handle herself.
Everything'll be okay.

You gotta stash him someplace.

"Hey, Moe!"
"Hey, Ray."
- Sorry to hear about your nephew.
"- Yeah, he was a good kid."
We were up all night with it.
[ Ray ] I know you need to talk to me.
I'll come in next week sometime.
How's that?

- Too long.
Right.
"- Moe, here, was my classmate at the academy."
Back in the day... before he fell in love with this redhead at I.A. and transferred.
Dr. Ross!
He saved Ben.
-We're his parents.
How is he?
-It's too soon.
-The news said his heart stopped.
-It's going now.
-How's he doing?
-Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
-Blood pH 7.37.
-Thank God for small miracles.
-How's the patient?
-He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
-What's his temp?
-Eighty-five degrees.
-He's not warming up enough.
-Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
-That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
-You're the Attending.

Maybe you are telling the truth.
It doesn't really matter.
I have to go.
Are there any more of you?
No.
I'm alone.
What's this?
Is this a bean?
Can this make a portal?
Not anymore.
It was destroyed like the rest of them.
I wear it as a reminder.
A reminder that you're all killers.

So let 'em wait.
Get rid of the cigar.

That was a new cigar.
You stay here.

Looks like the police!
Police?
Push him out!

- He'll slow down the cops.
I told you he'd be trouble.
"What was that, Karl?"
It's an awful road.
You can't see a thing.

Imagine It!
"- Ah, Tonino!"
What did he do?
- Let's start with changing his undies!
"How cute, grandpa's little boy!"
"He needs a very hard name that nobody has, because if not.."
"A hard name like Antenore, for example."
No.

Why not give him Edmondo?
Agenore.

- l do.
Mommy.
"- 0h, yeah."
"Now, about the accident."
A Muslim woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.
They feed her intravenously?
"- No, Hank."
- What a big word for such a small boy.
(Laughs) I'm a doctor.
0h.
You want me willingly?
Then protect her.
You will be willing in time...
Help me!
Clare!
When you have lost your taste for ultimatums.
"Yes, Do it."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Make your father proud.
I knew it.
I fucking knew it.

"Now, where the fuck do you think you're going?"
To the camp.
He needs help.
Get in.

Clare!
Where are my weapons?
Is this all you have brought me?
- One soldier?
- Let her go.
But she wishes to remain.
She has chosen to stay here.
Is that not so?
Please.
Don't hurt her.
You must go now.
My men will soon return and they are many.
"Oh, but this is very important."
"I'm sure it is, and I want to hear all about it."
"Well, I'd like to start from the beginning."
After breakfast.
But this is very important!
"Now, what would you like?"
"How about some oatmeal and a nice big glass of milk, huh?"
That'll build up your strength.
I'll take a look down this way.
"Oh, hello."
Hello.
Do you have a Nancy Collins listed?
Nancy Collins.
Let me see.
"Cooper, Collins, yes."
Drawing Room B. Right in here.
Thanks.

"Beg your pardon, I must have the wrong..."
Wrong room.
Excuse me.
That's quite all right.
Oh!
"Oh, why, Gretchen."
What are you doing here?
I drove down with Bob.
He was worried about you.
How nice.
–Where are they?
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.
–I won't let you.
Not like this.
–Corrine... –I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.
Vic.
Daddy!
–Hi.
–Daddy.
I missed you so much.
Kiss.
"Hey, Matty."
Give Daddy a kiss.
"Hey, Vic, I really need you in here now."
"–Dad, don't go again."
"–Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
I have to.
"Listen, someone was hurt really bad... and I have to stay here until he feels better."
"But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come and see you again, okay?"
I promise.
I love you.
–Where is he?
–Who?
Fleetwood.
You're packing his goddamn suitcase.
"Now, where is he?"
–I forget.
–Where's your boyfriend at?
–I don't even hear you.
–He just shot my partner.
"Is that how it went, Ray?"

"I'm Dermot, how are you?"
Good.
Good to meet you.
Yeah.
It's your last day.
Is it?
Yeah.
"No, it's not."
"No, shall I..."
"You're leaving, aren't you?"
You what?
"You're leaving and Sleet said I've got to sort of like, you know, just give you a surprise and give you presents for your daughter."
"Well, I'm not..."
There we go.
Wonderful.
"OK, then he's written some words for you."
"Yeah, go on."
"Yeah, this'll be good."
What?
Go on.
"- Oh, thank you."
Smell that?

PHILIP:
"All right, the good stuff."
"Philip, I've, er..."
I got something special for you.
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?
I guess I just sort of assumed it.
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.
"Oh, God."
She can be such a pain in the ass.
"Anyway, here's to us."
Cheers.
Philip.
"Seems like it's just you and me left now, Norm, huh?"
"Oh, hey."
I forgot to tell you.
I saw this the other day.
Hmm?
"The guy you were supposed to do the journalism piece on, that snake?"
It seems he took his own life.
- Jesus.
- Who is it?
Who's that?
IKE:
What's he called?
PHILIP:
"Josh Fawn, the writer."
"I mean, I'm glad he's dead and all, but..."
Dolly!
"Dolly, Hello, I'm David."
"Okay, he's coming with me."
How wonderful to see you!
I'm looking for Alice.
"I have not seen, dear."
Why do not you see?
"Mrs. Munter, is fantastic."
Between.
"All come, not stand there in the cold."
Getoutof here!
No boys allowed!
Female dog!
I am looking for my partner.
"It's a little high, has a ponytail."
It is called Alice.
"No names are used here, friend."
There's nothing to see.
You can switch there.
"Sorry, I said you could change you there."
"Sorry, I'm in a hurry."
"Stockings too, please."
Chupahisballs.

There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home.
"Another stunt like that, cowboy, you're gonna get us killed."
Don't tell me what to do.
Yee-haw!
"Giddyap, pardner!"
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!

Calling Buzz Lightyear.

Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug?
Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off, I have to let everybody take a night off."
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me.
"Mr. Monk, come on."
It's one night.
"Well, then"
I'll guess i'll just have to say no...
Kay.
No kay.
No kay.
Which is it?
"""No"" or ""okay?"""
Nokay.
Noookay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever gonna get.
No kay.
- Nokay.
- I'll do it.
Nokay.
- She looks nervous.
"- I don't care, as long as she's lucky."
- Is it too much?
- You look great.
"Excuse me, new girl."
"New girl, you're off your mark."
- My mark?
"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
"Stay with him, Stoke, stay with him!"
"Oh, it's a high fly ball, folks, right along third-base line."
Palmer is after it.
He's after it.
He's got it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Let me see that cut!
Stoker's through!
He's through!
How many more beatings do you have to take?
Better lay down.
Better than having your brains knocked out.
- Better than having you dead.
- You gotta lay down.
Lay down.
Lay down!
Six!
Seven!
Ten!
Fight!
Let them fight!
What a switch!
Stoker gave him one under Nelson's chin!
- Knocked him right over the ropes!
"- You got him, Stoker!"
"Hold on, Nelson!"
"Stop him, Nelson!"
"You got him, Stoker!"
You got him!
Stoker!
Stoker!
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
"Dimmy, why do you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into a coma.
You're not my mother!
Don't listen.
"Why, Dimmy?"
Damien!
"Dimmy, please!"
Get out.
You son of a bitch!
Take me!

"Pleased to meet you, Sullivan."
I know all about you.
You're okay.
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.
- Where you stopping?
"- A room at my old neighborhood on Dock Street, number 24."
"Well, I'll blow now."
"I'll drop up, say, Monday?"
- Monday?
That'll be fine.
- I'm going downtown.
I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks.
"- See you later, Jim."
Monday.

"Say, why is this called The Floyd Diner instead of Floyd's Diner?"
"Because you're in Floyd, New York."
Who'd have thunk it?
"Floyd, New York."
"Like Clyde, New Jersey."
Could you imagine spending your life in a place like this?
I can.
I grew up in one.
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
There's something special about small-town life.
So what are you doing in New York?
Every Louisiana boy catches politics like a disease.
I didn't know that.
"That's a fact, and I was no exception."
"After law school, I headed where?"
"Floyd, New York."
Washington.
Leapfrogged...
Find him and fix it.
"Yes, sir."
Consider it done.
Good morning.
How are you?
Good.
Excellent.

"Well, that's great."
Can you do it today?
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I have a promotion today."
"And after that happens, then I got it all covered."
"The next time I see you, you better have my money."

"Excuse me, compadre."

"-Some white, too."
Beautiful.
"Okay, boys, let's eat."
"Come on, Johnny, Vinnie."
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
"You got to go on a diet, Vinnie."
Read 'em and weep.
What are you doing?
"Alright, I'll catch you guys later."
"Yeah, you going for a walk in the park?"
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.
-ls there any more?
"-Nope, that's it."
Have a good weekend.
Thanks Henry.
You girls stay right here.
-Hold hands.
-Go right up front.
What are you talking about?
I saw her name on the register.
Jesus Christ!
You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They, uh, stole it right off the street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
- Yeah.
"Where's my car, please?"
- It's right over here.
Oh.
But you're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.

You can do it!
Whoo!
Go.
Please.
Go.
"Hey, Allen."
I'm good.
"I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money."
"Sure, I can hold on a sec."
Seth!
I'm up here!
You get the bus ticket?
You're not going anywhere.
"What are you doing here, man?"
What are you doing with my girlfriend?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nothing.
Tell me.
Or I'll kill you.
Then kill me and quit talking about it.
"Dude, this place is on fire!"
We gotta go!
"Let's go, man!"
Run!
I thought basketball season was over.
"No, this is ESPN Classic."
They play all old games.
It's the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
1986.
The finals.
Game Seven.
You remember watching this.
You were pregnant... you were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
You should have let me break your arm.
Help!
Let go of me!
Help!
- So you're not seeing anyone?
- Nobody regular.
- Why?
- Would you like to?
Maybe.
How about going down to the car?
On your front.
Not anal.
You whore.
You're hurting me.
You bastard.
My pleasure.
I want to report a rape.
- 26000.
- I expected it'd be more.
Thursdays are never that full.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She OD'ed on X.
The ambulance came.
- Which hospital?
- Bispebjerg.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
Hello?
"Hi, mummy."
I'm in a bit of a rush.
"No, my birthday was yesterday."
"Yes, I'm sure."
Now get in there.
Come on.
Enjoy yourself!
(LAUGHS)
"Call me son, yeah?"
"Hi, I'm Philip."
My name is Philip.
- Hello.
- WOMAN:
Hi.
"I know who you are, but it's a real pleasure."
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?
"Well, I've never met him personally, but, um..."
- You've heard of me.
- I've read.
I've read who I think you are.
- WOMAN:
Wow.
"- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?"
"No, should we know who he is?"
"- Yeah, he's one of the..."
- I don't know whether you should...
- I...
I write.
- He's what they call essential.
- A writer.
- Like the profession.
"This guy is like, they teach this guy."
- You know...
"- Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna just go check really quickly on the lord of the manor."
What happened?
- Listen to me!
Yes!
- Listen!
Did you buy it from Pahadganj?
- Yes.
Its Khurana's goods.
- How did you know?
Only Khurana sells such cheap stuff.
Do you know?
"Saying Calvin Klein, he gives us Khurana's goods."
He is a miser!
Calvin Klein doesn't make..
.Such underwear.
How could you say that?
- You look good.
"Ma'am, I am telling you."
Don't say it in public.
This man!
Kills by giving electric shock.
During power cuts he kills by using the generator.
You don't cry.
Ask him.
Shall I tell him what happened on Sunday?
This Sunday or previous Sunday?
Fool!
You!
- Sorry!
Sorry!
Say it clearly!
Pinto!
Pinto!
Gil-Ga...
Gil?
Gil Da Ran?
Da Ran...
Did your wedding get called off?
He said with his own lips that he wasn't my brother-in-law!
Is that why he's not answering my phone calls?
That's because...
Yoon Jae has a situation right now.
He even insulted me!
Stupid!
He pretended he didn't know me.
He totally dissed dad!
-That wasn't Yoon Jae who did that...!
-Then...
Then who is the person I saw earlier?
And who's the one that acted like he didn't know me?
That was Yoon Jae.
"It's over, it's over."
It's over.
Oh my!
"It's our son-in-law, Yoon Jae!"
Did you eat the dumplings?
Do you know what was inside those?
Huh?
Try to guess.
-Meat?
-No...
-Shrimp?
-No!
"Here, watch."
"It wriggles around, and when you catch it, it escapes."
How's Tetty?
Be careful.
"Let's find those parts, okay?"
Okay!
We're going.
It's okay.
I'll do it.
You mean your Mom will...
Thanks for having us.
Um...
It's kinda dark.
I'll walk you home.
Really?
Don't bother.
She lives near me.
"Misaki, let's go!"
"Okay, I'll come back soon."
"Bye, Tetty."
See ya.
An unexpected rival appears...
His chances are good.
Yusuki is on the defensive...
Get lost!
"Ooh, I'm scared."
Why get in the way?
"They're so soppy, it makes me puke."
Really?
Really what?
What're you saying?
Don't you like her as well?
"Childhood friends, blossoming into more..."
No way!
.
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Don't leave me out here.
"- One drink, real quick."
What the hell is he doing here?
"Captain, he's here."
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look... different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.
"Tommy, you made it."
"Good to see you, man."
"Come on, the whole family's right over here."
"- Dad, look who's here."
- He's got Tommy with him.
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.
"- Tommy, good to see you, son."
"- Hi, Uncle Fred."
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.
"This is my new partner, Jo Christman."
"Unfortunately, these are the Hardys."
My Uncle Fred.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
"Tommy, you're too skinny."
- Thank you.
"Yeah, big boy!"
Mmm!
What... what are you watching?
!
Your girlfriend.
She is really talented.
Turn this off!
"Hey, turn it off!"
I cannot believe you!
That's the girl that
I am dating!
How could you do this?
You're a horrible friend!
Horrible!
"Aaron, 100,000 guys can watch Liza Blue online every day, but your roommate can't?"
You are a horrible friend!
Horrible!
That's not her name.
"Her name is Mary, okay?"
Mary!
"Okay, fine."
Mary!
"What are you going to do, man?"
Erase Mary from the entire Internet?
!
"Liza, it's Phillip."
No one can find you on the Internet.
"Your photos, your movies, your website... it's all blocked."
Only one lame ass thing comes up when I Google your name.
Ben?
What are you doing here?
You go.
"Sadhana, go!"
"Vikram, he..."
Turn the car back!
This is Varun.
- How many times do I call you!
Where are they?
- I'm not able to track either of their numbers.
Both numbers are switched off.
- Okay.
Track my number.
- Your number?
Your number?
Why are you talking nonsense?
I said 'track my number.'
Did you?
Yes.
On Perundurai road...
It is showing some location off the main road
You are moving in the right direction.
"Priya, what happened?"
Vikram!
- Why has he stopped the car?
I don't know.
- Where are we?
I've have no clue.
- Priya!
Priya!
- Leave me!
Leave me!
- Leave her!
"Priya, where are you?"
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
-John.
"-Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"Tell me, does Mr. Bourne still drop in?"
"Not quite as often, but often."
"Let me know if he comes in, will you?"
"Oh, there you are, Alec."
-I thought you had to make a phone call.
"-I did, darling."
Nobody home.
I was just asking John about my compact.
"-You remember, I lost it last night."
"-No, I don't remember."
I think the reward will help.
"It's square and gold-ribbed, isn't it?"
That's it.
"Be an angel, John."
Do your best for me.
"Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"All right, darling, I'm all yours."
"-Good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
"Well, good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-John.
-A table?
"No, I'll go to the bar, John."
"Oh, Mr. Bourne, Miss Lorrison asked about you."
Isabel Lorrison?
I didn't know she was in town.
She's in the Candle Room with Mr. Dawning.
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
Maybe it's the bars D‎.
You've also eaten the bars D‎?
‎
- I know that smell well‎. ‎
- I like sweets‎.
"Well‎, but do you know what‎?"
No smell sweet‎.
You better get your sack arrimas farts and sleep tonight‎.

You understand me?
Everything is going to be okay.
"Wes, let me out I feel sick."
You're okay?
"Stay with dad, okay?"
"Stay with him, understand?"
Promise me you'll take care of him.
"Alright boys, come on."

The showis underway.
"Please, get out."

My apologies.

Do you like it?
It's all yours.

Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?

Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.

Um-hmm.

Maybe we should do that.
- Say what?
"- I mean, after Eddie gets better,"

- That could take some time.
"- We're like a team, right?"
- Yeah.
Like Paul and Belkis.
Yeah.
Yeah.

"What, Darlene?"
You learned that word yesterday?
"Fuck you, Darlene, all right?"

"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.
- And my jacket?
- And your jacket.
Okay.
Okay.
We were scared and miserable and we took it out on each other.
Us and everybody else.
That's high school.
But you suffer through that and it gets better.

If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.

Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."

"There you are, my boy."

I've got to go back.
Syd?
Syd...
Syd!
(mace:)what's this?
[âª]
What are you doing?
Leading them back into the maze.
I've got to go back.

"Trask, that way."
Durgin... [âª]
Ugh!

TYLER:
Great.
You wanna help me out with this?
"Not really, no."
"- Hey, Mr. Saltzman."
- Come with me.
We need to talk.
BONNIE:
"All right, show me."
CAROLINE:
Let's reference last year's Miss Mystic Float.
This was what they did last year.
- And it's exactly what we don't want to do.
- Ew.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"So, what are we doing?"
- Southern classic elegance.
- Gone With the Wind?
- How'd you know?
- You channel Scarlett daily.
So true.
[CAROLINE CHUCKLES]
Ugh.
Where's Elena?
She's supposed to be helping.
I don't know.
"Okay, what's the deal?"
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.
You and Elena are fighting.
Spill.

"Chao Fun, if you want to taste delicious food, give me the Sword Book."
Lock him up with crazy girls?
"Then he'll become crazy, too!"
"I never knew what a fierce, filthy fellow His Highness is."
What's the situation inside?
He's exhausted now.
Then!
I have a request!
Jumping Dragon!
Facing the moon!
Falling sun!
Falling sun!
I won't tell you... no!
Shaolin... you're too filthy!
H...
How did you end up here?
I!
Meal!
"Let me go, do you hear?"
You crazy women!
Let me go!
"Don't pull me, let me go!"
Do you hear?
You crazy women!
Remember my strikes!
Use this to save him!
Can't you hear?
Let me go!
Yeah.
Lock down all these doors.
- Do it quickly.
"- Go, go, go!"
- Sir.
- The residence.
Bear with us.
"Sir, we have a tour group on the State Floor."
Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.
Keep the hallways clear.
- Everybody stay where you are.
- My daughter's downstairs.
No one goes anywhere till we lift the crash.
- She's just a little girl.
I gotta get her.
- Step away from the door.
"Keep moving, please."
Everybody.
"Gentlemen, we're on lockdown."
You can't be in here.
- Let's go.
- Sorry?
- We're on lockdown!
- Can't hear you!
You gotta be kidding me.
Movie time is over.
Shut this down!
Let's go.
"Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds."
Silencer.
Let's go.
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Painted Face is back!
I'm scared!
- Get rid of him!
- OK.
"Foon, it was a good idea to come back!"
She's back in my arms again.
"Old pal, let's impress her one more time."
Watch this!
- Are you OK?
"- Yeah, I just tripped."
"Foon, you're overacting."
Painted Face!
We're in trouble!
This is a different guy!
Help!
Help!
- I'm here!
- Let's go!
Come on!

You've been holding my hand the whole night!
Are you crazy?

I've been possessed by a demon!
Exorcism is my forte.

"- Say, if my wife answers, don't tell her."
- I won't.
- I'm getting this as a surprise for the family.
- I'm wise.
- Wait till you meet.
I got the cutest wife and kid you ever saw.
So long.
"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.
- All right.
"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Come on.
How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."
- Why don't you and Buddy go?
Cartridges?
"Certainly, sir."
Any particular make?
"No, as long as they've got gunpowder in them."

"No, no."
"A few rabbits, pheasants, small fry, you know."
"No, no, sir."
Bore.
B-O-R-E.
Bore!
(Laughs)
- Hmm?
"- 12, 20 or 4-10?"
Er...
"Definitely, yes."
"Well, which, sir?"
"Well, the largest you have, surely."
12-bore.
"How many, sir?"
50?
"No, I think you'd better make it a thousand."
- A thousand?
!
- Yes.
But didn't you say a day's rough shooting?
"Yes, I did, er..."
and it may be pretty rough.
"On second thoughts, I think you'd better make it 1,500, perhaps?"
Right.
"That's whisky, gin, sherry, tea, coffee, cocoa - all Mickey Finned."
I seem to have left my keys in the lab.
You're gonna get it.
Who 's there?
Come on!
Stupid antenna.
Invaders from Mars!
Honey?
help!

Stop!

Don't you know better than to wander off at night alone?
What if something happened?
"I'm sorry, Mom."
Don't you ever do that to me again.
I was so scared.
I thought I'd lost you.
You won't believe this.
Something ate our TV antenna.
No!
I'm serious!
"It's not Sputnik, Iike Mr. Stutz thought."
"No, it's a robot!"
"No, really, it is!"
"And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!"
And it eats metal!
Stop it!
Just...

I'm not--
I'm not in the mood.
Come on.

"Tony, why can't I get through to you?"

Be back later on.
Don't worry.

"This is Letha Wedge,"
Commanding you to open your eyes.
"Now, stand up."
We're going to the museum for education and profit.
Tony and I will do a little... sightseeing.
Wait.

"Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army."
I want them dead!

Hold it!
What are you-
"Get in, get in, get in!"
Go!
Keep moving.
Come on.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
You were supposed to go home and write.
Who needs home?
I'm always working anyway.
"I guess we got chapter one finished, huh?"
"Oh, my God!"
- Is this Alex?
Alex Bohemia?

That's great.
Unexpected development.
The whole thing's so scary.
We gotta go!
Come on.
Come on!

Police state that a man and woman were being pursued-
He was in trouble.
"Wouldn't admit it, though."
Always said he had Everything under control.
That he had a lot of money put away.
Enough for a lifetime.
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.
Where is she?
At home.
Where else would she be?
I asked the old lady next door to watch her.
You left her alone with a stranger?
Are you out of your minds?
Don't move.
Hyo-jin.
Baby.
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!

"Ever since we went to his house, my body's been in pain."
I'm burning up.
I'm seeing things.
A man's face comes out of the wall.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Where's your scary boyfriend?
Probably off doing scary boyfriend things.
Mind if I join you?
I love heights.
"From up here, it all just seems so much smaller, you know?"
"I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes I think I see lights out beyond the wall."
"I know they say it's all just wasteland out there, but..."

When do you think is she coming back?
-Wait a second.
-Oh sure!
-Just a minute.
"-Oh my, the foods are delicious!"
You should've tried everything!
When it gets cold it won't be as tasty anymore.
"You like that, right?"
.
Oh my!
I'm really excited for you.
You two can now make a family!
"Oh, don't mind me!"
I didn't see you in the church a while ago.
"It's just, I looked for you."
-My wife is so beautiful.
-You're really such a joker.
-But it's not that.
-Here you go again.
-Oh come on!

"Hey, how about Diana Krall?"
"Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD."
Do you mind bringing it back to him?
Not at all.
I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.
No problem.
"Hey, this is a cool, little CD player."
"Oh, thanks. lt was a gift from your-- lt was a gift."
Perfect.
is there anything else Charlie left behind?
Just me.
My brother's a fool.
No argument here.
-That is a very effective negligée.
-Thank you.
-Was it a gift?
-No.
"-As a matter of fact, I bought it myself."
"-Oh, good."
-How long ago?
-What?
"Well, I was just wondering if Charlie saw it."
"Alan, don't go there."
"Oh, I wasn't going anywhere."
It's just that--
-Nothing.
More kissing.
"-Okay, okay."
What exactly is bothering you?
"Well, it's kind of hard to explain."
- I thought you were happy!
"- Oh, well..."
It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
"No, no, no!"
Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty... really pretty!
- The girl of your dreams.
- Aah!
Remember?
Farewell!

"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
MARIE:
He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.

He gets dressed.
He goes down the stairs.
He makes himself a little bit of breakfast.

It's a martial art.
This is weird.
"What's ""a martial art""?"
Like kendo?
Or karate?
"I've heard about ShaoIin, but..."
I think it's geeky.
It's not!
What do you wear?
I hate ugly uniforms.
Is it practiced outside?
Even the UV creams don't help anymore.
I bought a good moisturizer.
Show us!
"Lovely, no way."
"Hey, no one's here."
Hello?
Hello?
This sushi place is really big.
I'm starving.
"Excuse me, is anyone here?"

My daughter!
- Stop!
Don't hurt her.
Have you brought the money?
Who is that?
!
Who is the that?
!
He is someone I know.
Just give him the money.
They might hurt her.
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?
How much?
- It's not cash.
It's jewellery.
Jewellery?
Are you mocking me?
I asked for cash.
Are you trying to trap me with the jewels?
"Oldie, looks like you don't want your daughter back alive!"
Leave her!
Time out!
Collect her pieces and go!
The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?

Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.

"Well, you maybe."

- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."

Was it her?

- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.

Don't you do this to me.

He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
"Actually, I wouldn't..."
I wouldn't mind if we just cemented over the ocean.
I hate fish.
"Speaking of oceans, who wants to take a dip?"
Oh!
"- Yeah, now we're talking."
- Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to swoop.
I feel like such a man right now.
Oh.
"Guys, you might wanna start small,"
- because I just put a piece in...
- Oh.
- And I'm already buzzing.
- Whoo!
"Is that mint, or is that just, like, coffee?"
I'm buzzing really hard right now.
That's good.
"Oh, my brain hurts a little."
I'm tingling.
We should s'go right now.
S'go!
- S'go!
- Yeah.
Ooh.
[Grunting]
"Yeah, baby!"
"Oh, this song..."
- Actually sucks pretty bad.
Ooh!
Now all we gotta do is find it.
Oh...
"Let's go, Larry."
Very good.
"Yes, here we are."
No one sees us.
"Good, good."
Yes.
"Okay, Larry."
Here we go.
Let's go.
That's good.
Okay.
Oh.
Larry.
"Oh, pardon my vigor."
"Now, Larry, if we meet any other boaters, let me do the talking."
"Hang on, Larry, I'll be right back."
"Don't go anywhere, lover."
Everything will be fine.
"I've got everything under control, Larry."
One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
"Ah, there we are, perfect."
"Okay, Larry, here we go."
"Help me out here, Lar."
Scooch over.
That's good.
Okay.
What?
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Larry."
Of course you'll still be attractive to me after the autopsy.
It's really coming along.
And cute too.
Give it a try.
"Testing, testing."
Hello.
"Argh, I don't believe it."
Tanya's got me detentioned for running in the hall.
"But school's out, everyone's running."
Argh!
Hmm.
Hmm...
"Looks like the dogs took you for a good walk, Mia."
"They're a handful, all right."
Kool Klip alert.
Everyone stay calm.
"Guys, guys, guys-"
Guess who's coming to Heartlake City.
It's...
It's...
Livi.
So gorgeous.
- So fashionable.
- So famous.
Wait.
Wouldn't it be great if she heard one of our songs?
Like that's gonna happen.
"Hey, let's record our new song now."
I've been playing with the lyrics.
"♪ Bring on the lights, set the stage ♪"
♪ In the mood to celebrate ♪
♪ We'll stick together through whatever Hand in hand ♪
♪ Let's live it up ♪
"Yes, to Lázaro Cárdenas."
How long is it going to take?

I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."

Blond hair ― that's all I can tell.
It was in the young woman's left fist.
But she herself had brown hair?
So add that to the poster:
"""Suspect has fine blond hair."""
Take this to the chief.
Room 62.
What's wrong?
What is it?
It's not my fault.
What's wrong?

I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.

It's him I'm worried about.
Hmm...

"Right, right."
It's not my call.
Er...

"- What do you mean, nowhere?"
- It's... nowhere.
- Wait.
"So you haven't been on a real date yet, but you're dating?"
"- Yes, it's been one day."
I might be back of house.
"Wrong gift, then?"
Good luck.
Hena.
Thanks.
"I plan to forget everything that happened here, too."
Goodbye.

"Hello, I'm Ilia, nice to meet..."
Don't turn the light on.
But...
Leave it off.
Okay.
I need to call the office first.
"Sir, would you like a one-hour or two-hour session?"
It's up to you.
"A two-hour session, then?"
Sure.
Great.
"I'm here, it'll be a two-hour session."
"Yes, got it."
Would you wear that eye mask?
I don't like being seen.
This?
Okay.
Will you give me the body shampoo?
Not easy washing you without seeing you.
Let me wash you.
"Is it you, Chong-su?"
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...

When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.

THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT THAT.
SEVERAL YEARS AGO-
"I KNOW, I KNOW."
You seem like you do.
-Cut it out.
-What?
She wants to swim.
-She's afraid to get wet.
-I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
"No, you did not."
"Five, 23, skidoo."
"Hut, hut!"
"[ Grunts, Panting ]"
Oh!
For me?
But I don't know how to drive.
"Oh, pish-posh."
There's a Jaws Of Life in the trunk.

- You're telling me.
[ Man ] Mr. and Mrs. Simpson... your son has clearly been brainwashed by the evil and charismatic Mr. Burns.
Are you sure you can get him back for us?
Absolutely.
"I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed Jane Fonda, you know."
- What about Peter Fonda?
"- Oh, that was a heartbreaker."
But I did get Paul McCartney out of Wings.
You idiot!
He was the most talented one!

You do not love Mr. Burns.
You love Homer and Marge.

N(LAUGHS ) I wouldn't know.
What if I take off your head?
NWill you know then?
(laughing manically)
Stop that.
What a regrettably large headNyou have.
I should very much like to hat it.
-Hat it?
N-Yes.
I need you to go to the top of those stairs up there.
Don't come down until your mommy comes to get you.
- Don't come down?
-Don't come down.
Can you do that?
"Be brave, okay?"
Okay.
Go.
(PANTING)
(GUNFIRE)
(WOMEN SCREAMING)
Hey.
Why are we the only ones awake?
Because we're Divergents.
"Come on, I need your help."
We have to open this.
"Uriah, I need your help."
Go.
ERIC:
Hey!
Look who decided to show up.
It's really good to see you again.
"All right, folks."
Nothin' to be nervous about.
Just a little routine inspection.
Then we can all go back to our business.
Hello.

-Hmm.

"Najim, outstanding, back of the net with that one."
"Oh, we're celebrating killing people, are we?"
Is everyone all right?
Dad?
Najim?
You all right?
"Yeah, he's good."
We're all fine.

I've been shot.

Fresh fish!
Thank you!
- Red!
- Yeah?
- Where's section C?
"- Oh, it's right over there!"
"Right over here, I've got delicious, piping-hot Coney Island red hots!"
"Anybody else, now?"
"Folks, get your red-hot peanuts!"
Five cents a bag!
"Here you are, folks!"
- 2!
5- to-1 on Nelson!
- Will you pass that?
I'll lay you 3-to-1 !
"- Three-to-one, huh?"
- That's right!
"Well, I don't know!"
- What do you want?
- I've seen these guys fight!
"Three-to-one, and I'll give you the draw!"
Here comes Nelson!
"Here he comes, Little Boy!"
Sit down!
You're making too much noise!
"Okay, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Bunny!"
How are you?
SERIOUSLY.
LUCY.
LUCY.
[ SIGHS ] FINE.
GET YOUR DOCUMENTS TOGETHER.
I'LL HAVE MY GUYS DO AN I.D. PACKAGE.
GO SEE EVELYN FIRST.
THANKS.
I SEPARATED FROM DOUG A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I TRIED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER FOR JASPER'S SAKE.
THAT'S OUR SON.
BUT IT WAS HARD ON HIM LISTENING TO US FIGHT ALL THE TIME.
"HE STARTED ACTING UP AT SCHOOL, AND THEN DOUG TURNED ON HIM,"
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.
I'M SURE YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
HE TOOK HIM.
"HE PICKED HIM UP EARLY AT SCHOOL ONE DAY, AND HE DISAPPEARED."
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?
"YEAH, EVERY DAY."
"BUT TECHNICALLY WE'RE STILL MARRIED,"
AND HE'S JASPER'S FATHER.
"SO WITHOUT A CUSTODY ORDER, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING."
"PLEASE, I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE COURTS TO SORT THIS OUT."
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM?
NONE.
"I HAVE NO IDEA, BECAUSE I'VE HARDLY SPOKEN TO HIM IN MONTHS."
DO YOU HAVE PICTURES?
YEAH.
"HERE, THAT'S JASPER."
PLEASE.
LUCY SAID YOU COULD FIND HIM.
I NEED TO KNOW THAT HE'S OKAY.
"I thought you meant ""career"" with a dollar sign."
I think we need more.
"Fireworks, shooting guns."
Maybe we need to get arrested.
"Yeah, that might be a little bit problematic for some of my younger, more impressionable fans."
"I have a lot of those, I'm told."
Hi.
Ashley. (CLICKS TONGUE)
"Oh, my God."
Hi.
- Josh.
- Josh.
Yeah.
- Wow.
How are you?
- I'm good.
How you doin'?
It was...
- Beth's wedding?
"- Beth's wedding, right."
Wow.
Was a fun night.
I'm foggy.
- Good to see you.
"- Yeah, nice to see you as well."
You guys know each other.
"Yeah, we fucking live together."
(CLICKS TONGUE) Nice.
"How you take a punch, Josh?"
- (COUGHS) Excuse me?
- I think we should get into a fight.
For the article.
- Your dad?
- No.
You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
"Tell me, David."
What happened?
If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."
- No.
We can help you.
Shut up.
"Come on, son."
Let's go.
What about John?
Is he with you?
He got caught in the explosion.
"- He's dead, David."
- Shut up!
But you made it out all right?
Come on.
"- David, if you leave..."
- One more word from you...!
Dad!
- Dad!
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.
"- [SUSAN] Ready, OK, open."
"- [LING] Oh, my room!"
My room!
I love it!
"Oh, my god."
Come here!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
I'm calling Bender!
[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
Come to the front desk.
Yes or no?
We're here.
"Fine, we don't have to."
You're leaving?
Not like I'm desperate for girls.
Nice shot.
You suck.
Watch and learn.
"""Hello dear I have to work overnight"""
"""so please take Miki to day care tomorrow."""
Hey.
Feel how hard I am.
Your room's ready.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Here.
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, and this too."
What's wrong?
The cleaning lady...
She looks familiar.
"She's not your neighbor, is she?"
"If she is, we're in trouble."
"Darn, where have I seen her?"
What if we're caught?
"Hey, hey..."
I don't care anymore.
"So you can't pay up, huh?"
Maybe call the police.
She doesn't even have an ID on her.
She can't pay.
"""Atlantis anaduotai."""
"""Atlantis rises."""
We've found the medal.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
What?
Wait.
"Oh, what, you want a photograph?"
Thank you.
That's not what I had in mind.
What?
"Just hang on a second, will you?"
Hello.
What is it?
Uh...
Hm.
What's that?
That's neat.
Neat?
Yeah.
Huh.
At last.
"At last, it's wonderful."
Let's get out of here.
All in good time.
I must take a closer look at this ingenious...device.
Absolutely marvelous workmanship.
Fiendishly clever.
"Eh, what sort of trap do you suppose it sets off?"
No.
Hey.
"I'll entertain any ideas, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
"Condom in the eye, Waterfalls."
She's a classic.
She's a cla...
She's still around.
He has no idea.
He knows.
"No, that's okay if you don't know who Rihanna is, Adam."
"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.
I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.
- Right.
- Excited.
Do... what do you think?
Poker Face.
That's a hit of her's.
One word or two words?
- I don't know.
You don't know me!
Dunston-
- Your mother's work number is just ringing.
Do you have another number for her?
That's all we got.
Sorry--
"I talked to her at lunch, maybe she just--"
Ow!
What you think they're gonna do when they find out mom works outta state?
Think!
Ow!
You don't have to pinch so hard!
Office?
"Oh hi, Mrs. Ray."
Mr. Dunston-
- I'm ready to hear your side of the story--
"Mr. Ray, your wife is on Line 1."
Not now--
She said it was urgent.
Tonight...
"It's you, beyotch."
One more thing--
"Can you sign there, please?"
♪
WHACK!
Dunston!
"You know, but right after that..."
Things became real clear.
"You fight, or be killed."
Dunston--
I started hustling shortly after that.
And here I am.
-Your way!
-Make your way
"Come, Erik."
Let's dance.
-Erik.
-My little one!
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!
"Sure, let's go."
I can't figure this out anyway.
Reinhold's a fine young man.
"We can all be wrong about people sometimes, you know?"
Let's go.
- You go.
I'll be right there.
All right.
See you later.
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
But first we're picking up two guys.
I can't be gone long.
Cilly's waiting.
We'll go get her later.
Good Lord!
She'll be furious!
Henschke?
Henschke.
Isn't Reinhold here?
They all drove off together.
- What about Biberkopf?
- Him too.
What's wrong?
"Why so upset, Miss Cilly?"
They just want to have a little fun.
Nothing wrong with that.
- What's wrong?
- What if Franz messes things up?
We've just gotta help him.
"God, I'm thirsty!"
The boys are waiting.
Taylor.
They abolished slavery.
"Excellent, excellent."
Liam.
There were no executions.
"Yes, that's true."
Joanna.
Men and women were treated as equals.
"That's right, that's right."
"At the back, Sam."
"They believed in peace, not war."
Absolutely right.
"Now can you tell me, what was the Treasure of Atlantis?"
Knowledge.
I can't hear you.
Knowledge.
I still can't hear you.
Knowledge!
Absolutely correct.
Knowledge.
You are all my brightest students.
"All right, come here."
Stand right here.
There.
Tell me you don't hear it.
I don't hear it.
Wait a second.
"Okay, now."
You don't hear that?
I don't hear it.
It's humming.
But I need you outthere.
Itwon't be like the last time.
The war's crippled the Democrats.
I can win.
We deserve it.
"It's ours, Buddy, at last."
Nobody knows that betterthan you.
Frank Nixon's boy.
Do you remember what Mom said?
"""We're not like other people."
We...
"We don'tchoose ourway."""
"We can really change things, Buddy."
We got a chance to get it right.
We can change America.
"Itwas our dream, Buddy, together, always."
"- Do you really wantthis, Dick?"
- Yeah.
"This, above all."
- And then you'll be happy?
"- Yeah, you know I will."
Yes!
I will.
Yeah.
Then I'll be there foryou.
And we are gonna win this time.
I can feel it.
Yeah!
[Laughing]
"You're the strongestwoman I evermet, Buddy."
- Can ljustask for one thing?
- Anything.
-l'll think about it.
"But it'll cost you, Hill."
A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
At least that's what I thought.
"Hello, Henry."
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Come on.
"-Oh no, wait a minute."
-What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--
Karen...
Mom.
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill."
How do you do?
My daughter says that you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'?
What's up?
Here you go.
"-How are you doin', Gino?"
-Good.
How are you?
- I hardly think so.
- Oh.
Let me introduce myself.
"My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and this is Miss Right."
"Oh, congratulations!"
"No, no."
That's her name.
Her name?
"Oh, how do you do?"
Yes...
Would you care for a glass of sherry while you wait?
"Yes, please."
"Er, has Mrs Ransom been a widow very long?"
"Oh, yes."
Many years.
Yes.
"Many, many, years."
Her poor husband died out east in rather mysterious circumstances.
- Oh?
- Yes.
"Drowned, poor fellow."
- Oh!
- Flora was in England at the time.
Oh.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
That may be she.
She's... (Chuckles) She's apt to forget her keys.
Let me do the talking.
"Good morning, sir."
Mrs Ransom?
"She's out but we expect her back, if you'd care to come in."
"Wags, not too far behind with five."
"This time, I'm looking for two answers to get the points."
"Wags, over to you."

I can see femur there...
But I can't see leg...
Thigh...
Thigh...

"No, there's no thigh."
"So, er, clavicle..."
Three points now.
Shoulder is there.
Shoulder.
Shoulder and...
What's the...?
Scapula!
Yeah.
Your answers?
It's shoulder and scapula.
Show me your first letters.
For two points...
"Scapula and shoulder, very well done, excellent."
"Lutrophiles, over to you."
Find...
What have we got?
Minerva and Athena?
"Are they there, though?"
Minerva and...
"Oh, where's Athena?"
Athena...
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)
"- Get that, our kid."
- I don't get calls.
- Further your people skills!
Yeah.
"Oh, right, hang on."
It's for you.
"- Troy, it's for you!"
- It can't be.
- It is.
It's for you!
- I don't get calls.
"Well, you're getting this one."
It's Donna.
Your wife.
Oh.
"Hiya, Donna."
- How's the wife?
- She wants me to move back in with her.
Oh.
"- D'you fancy it, or?"
- Aye.
Suppose.
- Best pack me bag.
- Yeah.
Suppose you best had.
Yes!
See me after the show.
I'll tell you more.
"I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you."
Let's cooperate.
I'll send you out of the country afterward.
They'll never get you.
But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed.
- Mayor!
- Congratulations!
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat please!
"Have a few more drinks, Marshal."
I'll get myself drunk alright.
I've got to see Chiu at the theatre.
- I'll come along.
- Stay here!
"Ah Foon, but..."
But what?
You think I'll die?
What are we?
- Friends.
- Right.
Take revenge if I die.
What are you doing?
This is my family charm.
Take it.

Eun Jo is...Eun Jo is in pain!
Eun Jo?
What happened to Eun Jo?
He seems very sick.
What to do?
What should I do?!
Oh Han Ni calm down.
Calm down and explain it clearly.
What happened to Eun Jo?
He said his stomach hurts.
He keeps throwing up.
Really?
It might be appendicitis.
Write down what I'm about to tell you and act accordingly.
Place him on his side so he doesn't choke on anything.
Keep his body warm.

A CONVlCTlON APPEARED IMMlNENT... (Ruby) AAH!
Japonian martxotik aurrera iristen hasi zitzaizkigu heien antzeko sintomen kontakizunak.
Hasi nintzen susmatzen menturaz osasun kalteak handiagoak zirela telebistetan kontatuak baino.
"Ikerketan hasita, amak galdezkatu nituen, eta ohartu nintzne egoera zinez arriskutsua zela."
Hau martxo bukaera aldean gertatu zen.
Apirila bukatutakoan Japonia osotik hasi nintzen jasotzen hitz egiteko gonbiteak.
"Noan leku guztietan, Txernobylen gertatutakoen antzekoak entzuten ditut."
Haurretan oso antzeko sintomak aurkitzen ditugu.
Zu eta zure taldeak antolatu zenuten Japonian haurrentzako lehenbiziko kontsulta.
Esango diguzu zein izan zen gurasoen erantzuna?
Nola esango nizuke...
"Gure lehen asmoa zen besterik gabe gurasoei aukera ematea Txernobylgo haurrak ikusiak zituzten medikuekin hitz egiteko, lasaitu zitezen."
Baina teléfono deiak ez zitzaizkigun gutxitu.
Ohartu ginen konbidatu genituen medikuak ez zirela aski.
Berehala dei egin behar izan genien mediku boluntarioei.
"Hala ere sekulako jendetzak deitzen zuen, askori esan behar izan genien ez etortzeko."
Ikusten ari garen osasun arazoak ez dituzte erakutsi komunikabide nagusietan.
Baina SOS dei asko jaso dituzue.
Egia da.
Geuk ere begiratu dugu ea zer ari den gertatzen oraintxe.
"Fukushimako osasun kontsultaz eta osasun arazoen zainketa independienteaz egin dugu erreportajea; mesedez, ikusi ondoko bideoa."
"Fukushima hiria, Fukushima probintzian [zentral nuklearretik 60 kilometrora]."
Ekainean ekin zitzaion haurren osasun kontsultari.
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Fukushimako Sarea""ren ekipoak antolatu zuen."
Hasieran 150 haurrentzako behar zuen.
Baina eskariz gainezka zeuden.
"Azkenerako, 500 ume etorri ziren."
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Pediatren Sare Nazional""eko kideek aztertzen zituzten."
Nola dago hau?...
OK?
Ikus'tagun hemen...
OK.
Min egiten dizu?
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
Our good vibes are out for her.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, it doesn't."
BETH HOYT:
Who's the next one?
I just don't want to end up like my mother.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"""Girl, Interrupted."""
TED LEO:
"I would say ""Girl, Interrupted"" as well."
BETH HOYT:
You're both correct.
Points.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
We're going to drink anyway.
BETH HOYT:
You can drink anyway.
"Cheers, yeah."
Cheers because you got it correct.
All right.
I see how this game goes.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
This is not bad for boxed wine.
BETH HOYT:
It's actually quite good.

Call someone to come rescue us.
Quickly.
Hurry up.

"- Hello - Ood, just a minute."
It's me.
What do you want?

"- Why did you call, Che?"

I'm getting cramps.

- Can you hear me?
- What is it?
- Huh?
- What?

"- Can you hear him, uncle Che?"
- Che.
- I'll help you.
I'm still upset with you.
I'll hang up if you don't talk.
No need for the eyes.
- What?
What's wrong with your eyes?
"- Okay, you got it?"
- Ood.
- What?
I laughed at the sight of the scene.
"Aunt, you laughed as well."
"But aunt, he's my father after all."
Though he's a servant's son.
Aunt.. how is uncle Popat?
- Popat.
Popat.. flew away.

"Let it be, there are others."
Others.
Others at this age?
This is the age to enjoy.
What's the name of the other uncle?

Lovers are meant to die.

Ah.
A student at our school left the guy she had a crush on... and supposedly kissed another guy.
"On top of that, it was in broad daylight at school."
How could she?
Dumping someone like Baek Seung Jo.
Dumping?!
That doesn't make sense.
With a completely old looking sunbae.
"Ah, that girl!"
Really!
"Oh, look here!"
If you just leave like this...
Unnie!
Seung Jo came.
He came.
- It seems like Seung Jo doesn't know about it.
- He doesn't.
Oh Ha Ni even kissed Kyung Sunbae.
Ha Ni to Kyung Sunbae...
Kiss?!
"That's right, a kiss."
Oh Ha Ni is really great.
"She even said to him ""Can you do it one more time?""."
"Then, what happens with Baek Seung Jo?"
What do you mean?
Oh Ha Ni dumped him.
Dumped?
What is it you want to say?
"Hae Ra, I..."
It's fine.
I'll just leave for today.
"But, Hae Ra..."

Wow.

listening to my iPod with this fucking thing on my head!
"It also advertises that,"
"""Parents will love what they don't hear""."

Act of God.
Just a second.

You believe that God is present everywhere.
"ln him, him, that madam, him."
God dwells in everyone.
- Yes.
And me?
"Mr. Dinesh, you believe that God dwells in me too."
Yes.
Thank you.
Act of God.
I didn't do it.
God did.
It's 'Act of God'.
God slapped him again.
I didn't do it.
And now God will shoot you..
And you will die.
"Later, will your family get the claim.. ..or will that be 'Act of God' as well?"
"How nice to see you, Georgia."
I was just picking up some onions for my mum.
"Well, you know your onions, don't you, Jas?"
You've been eating organic food for ages.
Cool.

"- Yeah, some mates from London."
Kanji.
- Yes.
How will you fight the case?
That's simple.
"lf your Lord can appear in the temple.. ..from 9-12 and 4-7, then he's free from 12-4."
He can appear in the court at that time.
What do you need?
Tell me.
"Agreement, affidavit, anything you need."
I will make it.
Come with me.
I've high contacts.
Just tell me what you need?
High contacts?
- Yes.
I want to send a notice.
- Come with me.
Come on.
"So, who do you want to serve the notice to?"
'Bhagwan' (God).
"So, Mr. Bhagwan"
Surname?
Surname?
He must have a last name?
"Sharma, Verma, Kapoor, Khanna, Desai, anything."
"Don't know, because we haven't met."
I see.
No.
- You two haven't met?
No.
- That's fine.
What's his crime?
It's been sabotaged.
Someone did this on purpose.

"Take it easy, boy."

Who's there?
- I'll come now.
"See, what Jimmy has done."
I was afraid of this and it happened.
Few of my men have accompanied me.
Send them upstairs.
I'll manage the rest.
"- Okay, sir."
"Sir, he took those tablets again... ...that doctor had warned him not to take."
"Sir, Shreekant called off Jimmy's engagement"
"It'll be like, something that he'll do [INAUDlBLE]."
TED LEO:
And then I will have to kill him.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That's your thing.
BETH HOYT:
"Not that we know if that happens, you know."
It wasn't said here.
"Next comment from YouTube, this is"
"Cee-Lo, String, or Prince."
TED LEO:
"Well, obviously you want to bone Sting because he's all that, the Tantric stuff, you know?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You have a week to spare?
TED LEO:
Exactly.
"Yeah, maybe you don't want to bone Sting, actually."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You do not want to bone String.
TED LEO:
Lose your job.
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, exactly."
TED LEO:
You'd be evicted while you were having sex.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You'd miss so many meals.
I'd kill Sting.
"Exactly, where's the food?"
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I'll wait outside.

Lower the seat some!
Are those brats following us?

I knew it.
You did put a tail on me.
"Yeah, and it wasn't us!"
This couldn't happen from the control room.
Connor:
No one's got access to do that except... except maybe Dr. Niven... but he was down here.
Connor:
The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can sort it out.
Kate:
I...
I don't like it down here.
James:
It's not too far.

Probably a steam valve or something... right?

Probably.
Kate:
How much further is it?
James:
It's not far.
Matt: ...Great.
Matt:
Just as i was starting to get freaked out.
James:
"Look, I'm sorry."
I thought that...
Matt (Interrupting):
Do you know where we're going or don't you?
Amy:
Matt...
I don't get it.
I just don't.

He's not in.
What?
Where is he?
Let's go.
"Lady Bong, Lady Bong?"

We're leaving.
I want to see the Crown Prince again.
Huh?
"Yes, Your Grace."
Only through sincerity do we truly live...
It balances personal relations and is the basic virtue for all...
Prince...
Has all this business upset you?
"Yes, sir."
What happened to the Crown Prince is my fault.
"Okay, I'm done."
It's yours.
Your folks...

I feel like you would just
JULlE KLAUSNER:

"And you kill Pierce Brosnan because, did you see ""Mama"
"Mia?"""
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, that's exactly why."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
There need to be consequences.
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
He needs to pay for that.
And we're going to make him.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Someone does.
BETH HOYT:
You guys got it?
"Go nuts, we're going to be back in a minute."
But first it's a My Damn Channel original video premiere.

He means to say you sing so well.

That's great!
You people chase goons and dacoits... ...and today you were chasing the music?
"Baby, you've yet not seen our talents."
But it's not good to move around freely.
"Yes, I know."
You've got a zero knowledge of music.
I am also a police officer's daughter.
"Every day, they've got only one job."

Kev ?
I think we've come...

Maybe it's time... we start to express ourselves in new ways.
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it ?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
It's your turn.
That's not what I was thinking.
Sex.
It's always about sex.
It's not always about sex.
I just thought it was about sex this time.
"Look, Vicky, love is a term that gets thrown around, and-and people don't mean it."
"When I say it, I want it to be more than words."
- You know ?
I want it to be-- - Perfect.
- Is it hot?
- Yes.
It's very good.
Have some.
No.
I'm full!
Drink it.
"If you don't, it'll expire!"
Give one to your father.

One more day and they'll be bugs.
"Hey, Sunghee, come here."
Now what...
"- Have some milk, too."
- I don't want any...
"Yes, you do."
It's going to expire.
I get diarrhea.
Just throw it out!
Brat.
Throw it out?
Why would you throw food out?
Drink up!
Flip over the kimchi that you've eaten!
Flip it over yourself.
It's too bright.
Wait!

Any story.
What kind of story?
A racy one?
Yes?
I've done the rest of the accounts.
Thank you.
Have a nice weekend.

He... he locked the door.
The pervert!
The perverted bastard!

I can see the state Ms Limmer is in.
I was faster than Rex.

"Strange, that."
Maybe it was the wind.
God doesn't exist down here.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Pablo.
Wake up.
It's a boy.
A boy.
My son.
"Yes, a boy."
Your name will be Pablo.
It's an internal hemorrhage.
We haven't got the equipment here to help.
"We've done our best, but if he isn't operated on within 6 hours, he may die."
There's internal hemorrhage.
Notify the ER.
"Let us take care of him, OK?"
He's going to the ER.
We need your details.
I'm Malena de Luca.
That's my brother.
We came from Barcelona because my father's dying.
He's here!

Kate:
James was going to come meet me for dinner but he told me you guys had to...
Connor:
Oh... sorry.
Kate:
"It's ok, don't worry."
Matt:
And how did James manage to convince you that vending machine food is going to be an acceptable substitute?
Amy:
"Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?"
James:
I told her.
Kate:
I insisted.
Dont you hear?
Go.
He seems to be mad.
Hold on.
Are you scared?
Come on.

"Here, take this rod and bash them all."
I swore to Sai Baba that I dont hit anybody on Thursday.

I'm going to stay at your place for a few days for your punishment.
No.
My husband hates it when you visit.
No he doesn't.
He's just acting like it.
- He really hates it.
- Whatever.
You don't know how much your husband likes me.
Get out.
Bring me a cup of water.
I'm thirsty.
You go get it yourself.
Bring it to me.

You guys are made for each other.
What a show.
Go home and cry!
-What are you throwing out?
- The stew's too salty.
It's burning!
Eat up.
I guess you realize you're mistake?
"Still, the only person I love is you."
"You know that, right?"
"You too, for 3 years!"
- Wait.
-Why?
I have this.
Let's go outside.
Sit!
This is strange.
Take off your shoes.

Let's go inside the car or a motel.
I just want to sit around.
Hey
Wait.
-What's wrong with you all of a sudden?
And it's a miss.
Will takes... down his second target.
He's slightly in the lead of Paul.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:
Missed.
Paul:
"Sheez, I can't see."
NARRATOR:
Looks like he has some problems with his safety classes fogging up.
And it's a miss.
Will has a miss on his third target again.
Let's see how Paul's going to catch up.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:

Patrolman spotted the car.
Graham and Randolph.
They're heading for the waterfront.

Says there are two in the car.
Maybe a hostage?
Maybe a friend.
I kept wondering why Kimble would wanna catch that plane.
He's had plenty of chances to leave the country.
But what will I do in these days?
As God's wish
As God's wish.

He means to say.
As God's wish.

"No, I'm not a girl."
Then what you are?

We'll become blind if you say.
And... ...it seems your hero didn't like my idea.
We too didn't like it.

Yes...
Just a moment.

Everyone with cancer dies.
Why?
Does someone have it?
No...
Mom...
Mom!

He's hanging on.
Trusting lads.
"You always said trusting lads was my problem, Bov."
I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.
This is how you prove your point?
Backstabbing me?
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.
"Just say the word, and I'll do it."
I don't need you for that.
I don't need you for anything anymore.

I had a particularly enjoyable time playing Peter Green.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Peter, Peter Green?"
"I'm sorry, I don't-- which movie was this?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It was a puppetry exhibition I've been curating with small bones of crows I've killed, and the fat boy down the street."
I borrowed it from Amy.
Kate:
"Yep, sure."
Matt:
That's a pretty deep film for a lowly engineer like yourself.
James:
(Laughs)
Kate:
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
James:
He's only messing around.
Matt:
(Crowd noise)
James:
So the accelerator boosts the beam of protons to almost the speed of light.
James:
And then we collide them... here.
James:
And then we detect what's made in the collision.
Amy:
(Sighs loudly)
James:
What's up?
Amy:
I thought I'd got it working!
James:
Got... what working?

[gorilla hoots and chomps]
-Whoa!
That guy doesn't monkey around.
[laughs]
-How did that thing get in here?
-Poor boomerangs.
I don't think they'll come back from that one.
[laughs]
"-Okay, we get it."
Enough.
-I wonder why they didn't give him the slip.

I got this number from the police station.
What's happening actually?
"Nothing, I'm on duty."
Cover your drape.
What?
- No...
Not you.
"Yes, tell me."
Where's Radha?
She has gone to the youth festival.
She's coming back tomorrow. she's fine.
Why are you getting disturbed?
Cover your drape.
I'll tell you after I come to Mumbai tomorrow.
Okay!
"Okay, tell me one thing."
Do you miss me?
"Yes, I do."
Do you miss me?
"Yes, I too miss you a lot..."
That's why... cover your drape.
What's wrong with you?
What are you blabbering?
I'm not going to make it.
"Hey, put him down."
Down.
Let him down.
"Bastard, why did you let him fall off, huh?"
Go drive the ambulance.
Don't stare at me.
- Did you hit my friend?
- I didn't.
I did.
Just get in the ambulance.
Go.
Don't make me hit you too.
Go.
Hurry up.
This is amazing.
How's the sea?
It's alright.
Really?
I was thinking about going.
"Hey, how much are those two bottles of pepsi?"
"Well, it's been paid for."
"The man at that table has paid, sir."
What's this?
He's your next victim.
No way.
This is way too much.
"The last time, I had to put up with that Che."
"It's disgusting, eww..."
Don't get too dramatic.
Hey.
I've always managed.
You have to--
Sick!
You're so sick!
I'm so sorry.
I know.
The doctor said that you're gonna be okay.
He said it's just gonna take a little time.
We're leaving tomorrow.
It's not safe for us here now.
"- You all right, mate?"
- How is he?
He's hanging in.
"So, what now?"
You let Tommy know I want a straightener.
- Tomorrow.
- All right.
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.
"Ike, your mate runs security at Trinity Wharf?"
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him.
Set it up.
Sure.
Come on.
What's going on?
Ben and I are on the noon flight to Boston.
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.
"- You can't do this to him, Shannon."
"- Yes, she can."
She has to.
Then who the hell are you?
I'm...
I was sent by Jun Young-ju.
Jun...
Jun Young-ju
That name sounds really familiar...
Is it you?
Are you her new guy?
"No, I just..."
She sent me...
"Shut up, bastard."
Tell her this.
If she's got something to say.
"Beat it, punk."
What now?
Young-joo wants to breakup.
The excessive violence...
"Get lost, bastard!"
"Get a life, you shit."
-What?
"-Wait, wait..."
I delivered the message.
You heard it?
No I didn't!
Keep your nose out of other people's relationships!
"I don't deal with relationships, only break-ups!"
Go!
Beat it!
"Hey, I didn't hear anything."
Get lost!
"You don't get it, do you?"
"You listen to me, god damn it!"
"Thanks for watching my video, and thanks to Nancy Blachman for giving me the opportunity  to collaborate with Vi, and thanks to Vi for giving me the opportunity..."
"If you haven't seen Vi's version of this video,  press the annotation on my left."
See ya!

"What happened to your voice, mate?"
[laughs]
"-Dude, I'm a kiwi."
I'm from freakin' New Zealand.
-Oh.
"Well, that explains the accent and the boomerangs."
"-I told you, we're bananas."
-Accent?
I don't have a [hiccup] accent.
-What's a hippo accent?
"-It's [hiccup] not a hippo, it's a... [hiccuping]"
"-Whoa, sounds like a Hungry Hungry Hippo."
[laughs]

You look all choked up.
[laughs]

Have you been walking all this time?
Stupid..
"Ugh, again with that!"
Crap...

Why are you hitting me?!
You are pissed off again..
"Ah, hot hot."

Wow...

"Oh, no!"
Get out!

What kind of person is your husband?
A good person!
But we don't love each other.
"My husband's a good person, too."
"He had an affair and so I did, too."
And that's howl ended up like this.
Who is it?
Uhjjoo!

She's recognized a dummy!

Your face has a look of concern.
"Oh, are you finished?"

I cleaned everything.
Good job.
"Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?"
Huh?
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?
You can go home now.
"Yes, Chef."
I'll be leaving.
Okay.
Good work today.
- Get home safely.
- Yes!
"Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature."
No Ri gets fevers very often.
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.
"So, you should have been more careful around him."
"If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?"
I'm sorry.
Please be cautious.
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open."

Ataman!
Help us!
My cow!
My cow!
Ataman!
Those bandits have taken away my last cow.
"What did you expect, you fool?"
Get freedom without paying for it?
Didn't you scream when you gave birth to children?
And you expect to give birth to a new world without pain?
With no pain at all?
I've got small children.
It was my very last cow.
Your last!
"Remember this, silly woman:"
"Today they took away one cow, and tomorrow... they'll give you back ten!"
"- What do you mean, ten?"
- Just that.
Who had all the cows?
Who?
"I'm behind, but I'm thinking, ""You know,"
"I can lash pretty good, and I can lash fast."
"I'm going to catch up."""
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Here he comes, Rob."
Here he comes.
Paul finally made it.
Come on.
Let's go.
You need to get those lashings night and tight.
"Great job, dude."
Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" Done."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Done."
All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.
I really want to win this competition.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, come on, dude."
Paul's almost done.
You got this.
Aw!
Paul:
I got one more to go.
For the middle of nowhere.
You ready?
Come on.
Hey there.
"Hey, we're looking for, um,"
Abby Wilson.
She's not home.
Is there anything I can do for you?
"That's ok, we can come back."
"I'm sorry, but you look so familiar."
"Yeah, Abby's my mom."
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
"Um, you guys want to come inside?"
Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything?
"We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something."
Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.
Good.
"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
I hope nothing is wrong here.
- No.
How long have you planned to stay here?
Now I'm planning to settle down.
Jimmy!
Hey!
What's the reason of my friend's worry?
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
I've gone mad today.
Many girls came in my life and I forgot them.
But this one has impressed me.
Wow!
"Excuse me, Jaikishan!"
- Mr. Berry!
Senior sir has come from Delhi.
Hello!
"- Sir, he's Jaikishan!"
I had told you about him.
Oh!
Congratulations!

"In a short time, you became a hero of our company."
I read your suggestions about Rajdoot motorcycle
I liked it.
- Thank you very much.
"So, mister."
"You got promotion, right?"
I never say anything wrong.

"Aunt, where's Radha?"

Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.

"- Yes, Sire."
Yun.
Father.
"Well, then, what is it?"
I'd like to see the Crown Prince.
He's gone to see the King.
What?
What's your business here?
Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?
lf you come to the U.S.
Make sure you stop by Santa Monica beach!
Mr. Bookworm.

"The sunshine, the beach, the sand, everything in general was good"
None
Everything was wonderful.
I think the MV will come out well.
These shoes are too heavy I can't wear them.
"Ah, so heavy."
"Hey, seriously... stop that!"
You look scared for sure right now.
Take one hand off!
- I can't.
- It doesn't look good.
"Look here, kid."
You have to stand up straight.
Don't do that.
This is really dangerous. or you can do this.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
"Ah, my back."
Shall we go?
"Good, really good."
I think I can do it now.
That's a wrap!
Great job.
Great job.
Lee:
So I got Chili Mac.
Paul:
I got Train Wreck.
NARRATOR:
Both these dishes are time-honored Boy Scout classics.
"The Chili Mac consists of ground beef, chopped onions, diced tomatoes, macaroni, cheese, and water."
"Train Wreck is a one-dish breakfast with bacon, sausage links, hash browns, and eggs, all mixed together with plenty of syrup."
Paul:
I hope you guys like what I make you.
Child #1:
"If we don't like it, you're going home."

Paul:
He has also sent few of yours photographs together.
See!
God!
I look so fat.
Read what he says.
"Dear Damodar, many thanks for your help... you gave me in India."
India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.

No!
Oh no!
NOOOOOO!
(bubble pops) (Twilight screams) (Twilight grunts repeatedly)
(Twilight shakes off confusion) (ponies cheer) Pinkie Pie:
"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight:
"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and  I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
"I mean, that hydra- (theremin music, Pinkie Pie shudders)"
Twilight:
Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie:
That wasn't it.
Twilight:
Huh?
Spike:
What wasn't what?
"Father, I think the water pressure was low."
So..
Father.
Father.
You're fool.
"That's a nice kurta, Kishen."
"Kundan, please leave me alone."
"Bhikhu, take his kurta off."

"No, Kundan, let me go."
Don't tear my clothes.
Mala's gang is here.
We'll deal with you later.
"Bhikhu, let's go."
Mala.
Are you fine?
Are you fine?
Those children stepped on me.
Who are you?

Bye.
Mother is coming.

I want this brother.
That's fine.
Just stop playing with your hair.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...

Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!
Mohit!

But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
Never...
I'm a thief.
A goon... a criminal.
I can commit any crime but not this.
Her love is so pure and I'm full of dirt.
A dirt!
"She thinks I'm Kishan and I'm Jackie, the don."
"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!
- Kishan!
Radha!
I'm an absconding criminal.
"I'm a sinner, Radha."
I'm a sinner.
Applejack:
"What are you talkin' about, Pink?"
Pinkie Pie:
The hydra wasn't the doozy.

I'm still gettin' the shudders!
(Pinkie Pie's voice trembles)
You see?!
There it is again!
"Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened."
Twilight:
Huh?
But I...WHAT?!
(seething) The HYDRA wasn't the doozy?!
How could it not be THE DOOZY?!
What could be DOOZlER than THAT?!
Pinkie Pie:
"Dunno, but if this wasn't it... (Twilight grumbles) (Twilight growls)"
Twilight:
"(resigned) Oh, I give up."
Spike:
"Give what up, Twi?"
Twilight:
The fight.
I can't fight it anymore.
"I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense."
"I don't see how it does, but it just does."
Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
Pinkie Pie:
Y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
Twilight:
"Yup, I guess I do."

Ju:
"Even though I like ""Do you love me?"" and I listen to it a lot."
FlL has something different; it's more unforgettable than DYLM.
"So I love it, every time I listen to it I feel like I'm on the beach..."
I don't know ... it cheers me up.
Jana:

"The only that listened from them were ""The Chaser"", that we like very much."
"""Be Mine"" and ""She's Back""."
"So after ""Destiny"" I'm listening to everything, watching variety shows with them."
Jana:
She became a stalker.
Ju:
Yes.
"I'm now 5% Inspirit, because I'm still a V.I.P , Shawol..."
Jana:
Is that for real?
Ju:
I said 5%!
A bit in my heart!
Jana:
- Look out!
- I can hear someone breathing.
- Where?
- There's nobody there.
"- I tell you, I can hear like an owl!"
"- Hey, Mitrofanova."
"Such an important uncle, and you are making a Babylon of your hair!"
You know what I'm saying?
"- All right, Marat."
Go on.
- Maybe it'll sting through the shirt?
- Off with it!
"- And your pants, too."
"- Oh, come on!"
"- What, you think epidemics leave tan lines?"
"Rash all over, except the butt?"
"- Go on, then!"
"- Come on, guys, can't we do it all together?"
- We can!
- Stings like mad!
"- Come on, guys!"
For the win!
"- Oh, man!"
- Okay...
Interesting.
- Pull!
- And again!
- Raise it up!
- Stretch it out!
- Stop.
That's good.
Tie it.
Go.
Go.
- Who is that imposter?
Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."
- What's wrong with the mic?
Take a look.
- What's wrong with the mic?
Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."
- No.
Where are you going?
- Go.
Get down.
Play it.
- Wait everyone.
Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."
Or was it Russ you really wanted?
30 seconds!
Where's Jessica?
"OK, OK."
I admit it.
"I was dishonest, selfish and wrong."
"Now, can I please just have my stories?"
"Jessica, you're on now."
But the stories!
No time to proof them.
I'll just have to trust you.
"Now, go, all right?"
"We're live, remember?"
"5, 4, 3, 2..."
"Hello, I'm Jessica Fakewiel..."
Wakefield... with the *Oracle On-Air News.*
"So, here we are... our first live broadcast."
This doesn't look good.
"Oh, the news."
"Well, a lot has happened this week."
Bunches.
"And now... with details, my sister Elizabeth."
I should've known.
Go get 'em.
"(Patty) Manny, pick up Liz as she comes in."
"Thank you, Jessica."
Anytime.
"Good morning, Sweet Valley."

Papa.
Get down.
"Papa, we're practising."
Today's 'Janmastami'.
You've your exams tomorrow.
Who will write that?
Get down!
Why do you always stop for religious things?
He'll be absolutely fine.
My son's playing Govinda.
My son won't become Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.
He'll grow up to become a cricketer.
Get down.
Get down.
Come on.
Mahadev.
- Coming.
- Let's go.
- Come soon.
Listen.
Remove the tag of Rs.250 from.. ..all the new idols that we bought.
- Yes.
"Now, watch how I sell it for 10-12 thousand."
And keep one idol from each on display.
- Okay.
Understand?
- Yes.
Come on.
One and only one piece in the world.
This idol appeared from the ground.. - Yes. ..when the temple at Badrinath was being built.
What are you saying?
That's the plan.
Rule the world.
You and me.
Any day.
- Love your hair.
- What?
"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Mitrofanova.
"It's her uncle who's coming, after all."
- Quiet!
- The worst is that tomorrow is Parents' Day!
"- Whatever, they all just come to swim in the sea."
- And his grandma?
- Look out!
"- Back to beds, you lot!"
- You're right.
Kostya's grandma will be here tomorrow.
- Where's my grandson?
Is he putting on weight?
- But he's not here.
Can you imagine what happens next?
"- Hey, guys!"
We need to cancel the Parents' Day!
- Do what?
- Cancel it!
"- Yeah, like you can cancel it."
"- We can claim that, since it's ""Parents' Day,"" only parents are allowed."
- Right.
"- No, seriously!"
"Right now it's grandpas, grandmas, uncles, aunts, and what have you!"
Like they have no other place to go.
- Got it!
I got it!
- What?
- An epidemic!
- What kind?
- Nettle!
- Pull.
- I've got the short one.
Fire!
"Fire!"""
"Kinda defeats the purpose, right?"
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
"I didn't say ""Fire!"", I said ""Fuck!"""
Fuck!
Fuck-fire!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Ass!
You can say anything.
Shit!
Bitch!
Cunt!
Fuck!
Fart!
Fuck!
"Wow, I just shot down a duck by saying ""Fuck!"""
Next is the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker.
This thing is the biggest shit-biscuit I've ever seen.
"You stand on it, and supposedly, you rock back and forth, which controls the D-pad."
The modern-day equivalent would be the Wii Fit.
"The Roll &amp;amp; Rocker is supposed to be compatible with every game for the NES, but I find that it isn't compatible with any of 'em."
"Each game responds differently, but none of them work."
"Adventure Island keeps walking right,"
"Excitebike keeps going down,"
"Skate or Die goes in circles,"
"Kung Fu ducks to the right,"
"Metal Gear does nothing at all,"
Stop giving them money!

"-I'm not racist; I have, like, two black friends."
-Shut up!
-I'm gonna be late for my flight if I don't go right now.
"-All right, have fun in France, man."
"-Oh, by the way, my French cousin's staying over while I'm gone."
-What?
"-Yeah, his name's Pierre."
Bye!
-[gruff voice]:
"'Sup, brother?"
-Pierre?
"-The one and only, brother."
-You don't look very French.
"-You gettin' racist on me, brother?"
"-No, no, I guess I've just never seen a real French person before."
"-Ha-ha, well, we're a fun bunch."
Up high!
Down low.
"Uh... uh... we should go inside like right now, brother."
-We got you now.
"-(Pierre) Macho, macho man"
I want to be... [Nyan Cat ringtone plays]
-Hello?
"-Hey man, how's Pierre?"
"-Uh, he looks and talks like Hulk Hogan."
"-Well, duh, they all do."
Have you never seen a real French person before?
"-Well, I guess not, but, okay, not that there's anything wrong with it, but is Pierre gay?"
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll prepare some mango juice for you.
"That's the problem, Kishen."
You don't have to make mango juice.
Why?
"- I helped you, didn't it?"
- Yes.
So what can you do for me?
Give my life?
"- No, no."
"- Yes, I can give my life."
"No, no, no."
- I will do it.
Kishen.
Listen.
You will have to do a small favour for me.
"Yes, tell me."
Remember Mala.
Mala.
That witch Mala.
"- Yes, that witch Mala."
You will have to.. - What?
I've to treat her to mango juice.
"- No, no, no."
You've to make her.. fall.
She's already fallen quite low.
How much further do you want me to make her fall down?
"No, no, I don't mean literally."
How do I explain to you?
Yes.
You've to..
No.
"- Oh, God."
"He's a singer, sings in two voices."
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these new set of teeth from?
"Kundan, what a surprise."
- Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.
Kishen.
- Mona.
"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
"Just give him the freaking ""malk""."
[Josh]
You guys aren't even saying the same thing.
[Julian]
"We're all saying ""melk"", Josh!"
[Josh]
No!
"You're saying ""melk""!"
"You're saying ""malk""!"
(Yelling versions of milk)
[Josh]
Shut up!
Shut up!
[Donovan]
You better put it down.
[Julian]
"Don't do it, Josh!"
[Josh]
"You're going to shoot me, if I shoot myself?"
That doesn't even make any sense!
[Donovan and Julian]
"Josh, put it down!"
Put the gun down!
(Yelling at each other to put the gun down)
[Josh]
I'm going to kill myself over this!
[Julian]
You're like a brother to me!
Your head is like a brother to me!
(Screaming)
[Josh]
"And then, after that, we pull the trigger."
Hona GurePlaneta-TBk ikusleengandik jasotako emailak.
"Eskatu genienean osasunean nabaritutako aldaketa ez-ohikoak kontatzeko, aste vbtean ia 500 email jaso genituen."
Sudurretik odol jario handia.
Eten ezinezko diarrea.
Eztarria irritatuta.
Neke handia.
"Ez haurrek bakarrik, adin ezberdinetako jende batzuek ere antzeko sintomak aipatzen dituzte."
"Masamichi Nishio doktorea, Hokkaidoko Kantzer Zentroko burua:"
"Diarrea, nekea, eztarriko mina, odola sudurretan..."
"Jende askok baldin badituzte antzeko sintomak, medikuek ohartu behar dute erradiazio dosi apalen síntoma klinikoak direla."
(emaila:
"""Estomatitisa justu istripuaren ondoren"")."
Ez dituzte mesprexatu behar sukarraldi baten sintomak balira bezala.
"""Txernobyl:"
"Hondamendiaren eraginak gizakietan eta ingurumenean""."
Liburu hau The New York Academy of Sciences-ek argitaratu zuen 2009an.
"Egileak hiru aditu dira, tartean Alexey V. Yablokov doktorea, Bielorrusiakoa, Sobiet Batasunean Gorbatxov presidentearen aholkulari zientifiko izana."
"Aztertu zituzten 2004 aurretik plazaratutako 5.000 txosten zientifiko baino gehiago, ondorioztatuz milioi bat jende hilgo zela istripuaren eraginez."
"Kopuru horrek 20 aldiz bikoizten du ofizialki ICRP erakundeak aipatu izan dituen ""4.000 jendeen heriotzak""."
Yablokov doktoreak ohartarazten du sudurreko odola eta guruin linfatikoen handitzea erradiazioen kalteen sintomak direla.
Ofizialki esan da Txernobylek 4.000 jenderen heriotza ekarri zuela.
Baina horretarako oinarritzen dira ICRP bezala industria nuklearrari lotutako erakundeen txostenetan.
"Ez dago garbi nork duen arrazoi [ICRPk ala Yablokovek], baina bistakoa da bien artean sekulako tartea dagoela."
Nola ulertu tarte hori?
"Begira, ICRPk izendatu zuen batzorde bat gorputz barruko erradiazioak ikertzeko, baina desegin egin zuten."
Zergatik?
Batzorde horrek hainbeste urtean behin azterketa bat egin behar zuelako.
"Baina txosten horretan egia kontatuko balute, gorputz barruko erradiazioen arriskuak azalduko lituzkete, eta ezingo lukete jarraitu energía nuklearra sustatzen."
"Jende asko kaltetu baldin baditu barruko erradiazioak, ... iruditzen zait garaia dela kontutan hartzeko erradiazio mota horren kalteak."
"Bideoan ageri denez, Interneten zabalduta zegoen martxotik ari zela zerbait berezia gertatzen."
"Baina orduan istorio horiek hutsalak edo gezurrezkoak ziruditen, zientzialari batzuek berehala esaten baitzuten aldaketok ez zutela zerikusirik erradiazioekin."
Horrelako giroan jende asko ez zen ausartu hitz egitera edo arazo horien zergaitiak ikertzera.
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?
- Who?
Tiger!
"- You will find it in the jungle, sir!"
Where is Tiger singh?
"I don""t know!"
"I don""t know! sir.. his grave is ready!"
- My grave?
Bury him alive!
- I will tell you!
I will tell you!
Tiger singh is in lran!
lran?
"This beauty, o beloved."
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
He plays very well.
"And he seems very friendly. yes, Julio, my best friend is very friendly and"
likes all the girls.
Sorry if I missed some chunks.
I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.
Problem 29.
Let me see if I need to cut and paste this one in.
All right.
"So yeah, I think it's a good idea."
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.
NARRATOR:
It looks like Lee cut himself and he might be bleeding
Lee:
"Slow down, Lee."
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
You got plenty of time.
Broken in small bits.
"If it's big, it ain't going to get cooked."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Yeah, if you got blood in the food then you, you can't serve that, you know."
Lee:
Still bleeding a little bit.
"Now you all, we are ready here."
This...
NARRATOR:
"Hold up, guys."
Hold up.
Lee.
Lee:
You got it.
NARRATOR:
"Looks like you cut yourself while you were cooking there, brother."
Lee:
Yes.
NARRATOR:
Let me see that.
Lee:
Right on top of the thumb.
NARRATOR:
We can't take a chance with blood being in this food and the Cub Scouts eating it.
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.

I'm not a fanatic about it.
I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are.

"but,"
I've been to Charleston.
"Charleston, West Virginia?"
"Yes,"

"Okay,"
"that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway?"
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
"enjoy it, but not for profession, no."
Yeah.
And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good
I gave up.
Yeah.
"Course, my mom thought I was,"
"but, uh, you know,"
"Of course,"
parents always do.
"Oh, yeah,"
"so,"
They're nice that way.
Yes.
"Well, what else can we uh, talk about,"

Yeah.
Yeah.
"So I listen to the radio,"
I like the pop music.
"Oh, yeah."

Uh-huh.
"Um, I,"

Uh-huh.
"And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know,"
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.
Uh-huh.
"Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it's hard to follow.
"Right,"
"and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL."
"Oh, I've never seen that one."
THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
"Okay,"
yeah.
"She,"
"I've seen a, uh, the previews for that."
It's very good.
"It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show."
Uh-huh.

"That's not what, uh,"
HOME IMPROVEMENT.
"Oh, we never miss that,"

"Oh, we think it is, so funny."
Did you catch the Christmas?
"Oh, just part of it"
"I thought it was, you know,"
"and it had such a good story, too."
Uh-huh.
Did you see the end of it?
No.
"IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was."
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Are, you're a real life Trekkie?"
I think so
I really like them.
"I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,"
but
Uh-huh.
"uh,"
"Well, I've gone to, you know, one for real live Trek Convention"
"but,"
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"

"Huh, did you get to talk to him?"
No
It was crowded.
Not in a crowd like that.
Huh-uh.
No.
"It was like, uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours."
Yeah.
Wow.

"That's close to, uh, South Padre."
"Well, uh, South Padre is on down the bend"
Oh Corpus.

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Small island.
Yeah.
"Uh,"
Yeah.
"I, I've been to Port Aransas"
"but, it was when I was a child."
"Oh, okay."
"Yes,"
"because I have relatives who live in Houston,"
"so when would go, and we would go to Port Aransas or then, on down to Corpus or further,"
"yeah,"
like what your talking about.
"Because I was just wondering, we went to Galveston this, this summer, even with all the oil spills and everything,"
"I mean, I was, oh, it was horrible."
Was it bad?
"I well never, ever go back."
"I don't think. Uh,"

"Well, I'd encourage it."
Uh-huh.
"I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California."
Did you?
"And that was, uh, California,"

"Oh, really."

Oh.
"Yeah,"
"see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California."

"I've never actually done any, uh, like tent camping,"
"Uh, that can be a lot of fun, too."
Yeah.
How about you?
"Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping."
Uh-huh.
"This summer we went to, uh, the Smokey Mountain National Park. And, uh, stayed about three or four days in there."
"Oh, how great."
It was wonderful.
"Oh, yeah."
Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable.
Um.
And the days were nice and warm
"and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days."
Uh-huh.
That's great.
"Oh, okay,"
"well,"
My boss listens to that.

Is that the eagle?
Yeah.
"Okay,"
"I know, I know what the eagle is."
"It's not too hard,"
"it's,"
That's not too hard.
You know.
But it's not enough to put you to sleep
"True,"
true.
Which some of the songs on K V I L can.
"Well, of course, being raised on the water I'd never swim in it."
yeah.
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
"Swimming is for swimming, pool."
Yeah.
That's why they call them swimming pools
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's where you swim.
You do not swim in the ocean.
No.
No.
No.
Not anymore.
"I've seen what comes out of the ocean,"
"and I have no desire to share, any space with anything like that."
"But, really, but huge sharks are down there."
Uh-huh.
I mean incredibly large sharks.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night"
Uh-huh.
"it was incredible the size of them,"
Wow.
the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties
Uh-huh.
"and it, you know,"
"so, just strung up,"
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
"yeah,"
"just,"
"my family, uh, didn't like Texas,"
"and I had a chance to, uh, transfer up."
"T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in ."
That's nice.
"So I got an opportunity to transfer back,"
and I took it.
"God,"
that's great.
"Uh, I'm a native Texan."
Uh-huh.
West Texan.
Yeah.
There is a difference.
"Yeah,"
"believe me,"
I know there is.
"I lived in Plano,"
and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano
Yeah.
"but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas."
Everybody else was an import.
"Well, I'm a West Texan."
Uh-huh.
"Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle."
Yes.
Yeah.
A different world from down there.
Yeah.
"So, uh, Colorado's been fun."
But they have a real problem.
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.
"And every time you look at a, look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar."
"But, that is God's country,"
it has to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?"
"Uh, no,"
"they don't,"
"they,"
"the last one, well,"
"the first time I was there, the, the tree was still standing,"
but it has since come down.
Okay.
Yeah.
"But, they are huge."
"If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe inspiring."
"No,"
"so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. Well, New Orleans and, uh, Minneapolis."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"well, there is lots of pretty country further west."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to be trailing out quickly.
Yeah
because there is lots to see
And she really enjoys it.
She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
"and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives"
Uh-huh.
and she's really enjoying herself.
She really likes it.
"Well, that's great."
"Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree."
Oh thanks
Hope you'll like it.
Yeah.
"Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?"
"Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas."
"Right now I'm in Utah, of course."
"Oh, uh-huh"
"So, um,"
"but, my family's there,"
"so,"
"yeah,"
I'd like to go back.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh, base of hospitals."
"Uh, I don't know about Dallas."
I think Dallas is pretty scattered.
Are you in San Antonio?
"No,"
"I'm, I'm in Dallas"
"Oh, okay."
but I'm originally from San Antonio
Um.
"and they've got large medical, uh, center down there."
They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.
"Let me see,"
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"
all right.
"Well, that sounds pretty good."
"Does, uh,"
"I guess the weather,"
does that stay pretty constant there
"or,"
"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"
that's not too bad.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"have you done, uh, any other boating then"
"or,"
"No,"
"I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,"
"but that's all,"
"I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop."
Yeah?
"And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about."
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah,"
"I,"
And we had a different boat every day.
"Okay,"
I'm back on.
Okay.
"Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?"
I watch evenings because I work all day.
I used to watch daytimes.
Uh-huh.
"Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing."
"Oh, so ..."
"And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,"
but now it's mainly evenings.
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?
Yes.
Which ones?
"I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW."
Oh.
Those are the two I like the best.
"Oh, two they're going to change."
"Well, one they're taking,   off."
I know.
"It's going to be history, I know."
I don't know what's going to
"yeah,"
we like L A LAW.
Uh-huh.
"We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,"
but that's kind of young for us.
My husband and I are grandparents.
"Oh, well. Well ..."
"So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,"
but we like L A LAW.
"We like, that."
"Uh, audiology."
Okay.
Fantastic. Uh
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.
Oh really?
"Uh, yeah."
Neat.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"It's, it's an interesting issue."
"There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few"
"and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot."
"I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures"
"but, uh,"
Yeah.
"I just,"
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
Uh-huh.
"So, I think it,"
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what
"Oh, is that right?"
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
Okay.
"Yeah,"
"I, I kind of,"
"yeah, I've heard things about that."
I've heard that they don't mess around very much.
Yeah.
"so,"
"Yeah,"
right.
And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
"Oh, I do, too"
"Oh, I do, too,"
"but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs."
I don't know why.
"I just,"
"if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember."
"Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch."
"But, uh, now I do,"
"before I go to work, I tape my soap opera."
"Oh, yeah."
I watch one
"and,"
"Well, I watch two,"
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
"and, and they lead into each other."
Oh.
And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
"Oh, okay."
"And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl"
"Yeah,"
that's been on for years.
"So it's just, you know,"
"it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years."
"Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them"
"Yes,"
"and I don't have anyone else at home,"
so I have freedom to watch whatever I want.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows"
and I like the comedies
"and you know, and I, I do like good movies."
Uh-huh.
"I prescribed, subscribe to H B O."
Yeah
"well, we,"
So I can get some of the movies.
"Yeah,"
that's a good idea.
"We did have H B O,"
"but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know."
It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests."
I mean
"Oh, yeah,"
"got the bumper sticker, too?"
"Oh, yes,"
"oh, yes."
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they're going to call you up.
Someday.
Yeah
"Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking."
"I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway."
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay
Okay
Have you done this very long?
"Uh, well, yeah,"
"for the last, uh, couple of months."
"Yeah,"
that's the same with us.
Yeah.
"Well, what kind of car would you buy?"
"Well, it's kind of hard to say,"
"uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years."
"We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine"
"Oh, okay."
"and, uh,"
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.
"Well, like I said, good luck to you."
Thanks.
"All right,"
"well, um, take care,"
and maybe we'll meet up again some time.
All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.

Yep.
That would have to be a blast.
"Yeah,"
"it really was, it was great."
"What,"
"well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area?"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"We went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon, again"
"and we stopped at, uh, uh, Las Vegas for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into Malibu in California over on the coast."
Yeah.
"And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, to, uh, Sequoia National Park."
Okay.
"Oh, wow."
"Okay,"
"Big Sur Highway, that's, uh, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, um,"
do you have any pets now?
"Well, we don't right now,"
no.
"We've, uh,"
"I grew up with, uh, with pets."
"My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,  some,  birds,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, right now we don't have anything."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, that,"
What about you?
"a matter of choice, or compulsion?"
"and so,"
"Oh, yeah."
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
"It's, yeah, it's really bad."
Yeah.
"But, uh, it's going pretty well"
"and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,"
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
"I used to belong to a Christmas club,"
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
"Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along"
"and that puts you behind too, you know."
"So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club."
"Oh that's,"
Yeah.
"So I figure, you know, that's going to help some."
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
"That'll,"
"yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"right, you know."
"That'll be good,"
yeah
"most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas"
so.
"Right,"
right.
And I'm
"Yeah,"
"I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,"
"but that was years,"
"Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors."
Yeah.
"Some that, she had to, uh, label everything"
She had to label everything.
Yeah
"because,"
What was she driving?
It was a Cadillac.
Uh-huh.
"And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
and they quit making it.
Yeah.
They rebuilt it
"and it never did, never did run right again."
"Yeah,"
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
Yeah.
"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"
"Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that."
Yeah.
"Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?"
"Uh, the,"
"I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler."
Yeah.
"They,"
The starters are kind of fragile.
Yeah
"and the,"
And there's some Coke
"and you know, just help yourself to anything."
"So it was, it was, you know, the best,"
Wow.
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years.
Just once a week.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
And they stick around for longer.
"Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it."
And I quit you know.
Yeah.
I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
Yeah.
I really liked the little girl and everything
but I thought ...
"She does take up,"
and they do take up a lot of your time.
That ...
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I ...
They're very demanding
Uh-huh.
"Well, and she was really spoiled."
They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
"So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch."
And the mom was a dentist
and then it doesn't sell
and then the bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?"
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple."
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife"
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
so I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
"Well, yeah."
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
"Last week going to the airport,"
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
"But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out"
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
"but,"
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
"So,"
Oh
"and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"With the Bluebonnets out,"
yeah.
It really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live
I'm ready if you are.
Okay.
"Um, where do you stand, uh, on,"
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them."
"Especially  if they go hunting,"
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
"Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,"
I won't have anything to do with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"Well, it certainly was, uh,"
"Maybe you can get,"
"how many,"
have you had very many of these calls?
"Uh, yeah,"
almost ever day.
How wonderful.
Yeah.
"Almost, almost ever single day from when they started it."
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just be so lucky.
"Okay,"
I enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?"
"Yeah,"
"well, I, um,"
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,"
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,"
"and, uh, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden."
"I, I'd hate it, you know."
"and, uh,"
"Oh yeah,"
that's right.
"It, it might have one best picture, too."
Yes
"it did,"
yes
it did.
Yeah.
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
"That was,"
"yeah,"
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
"but, uh."
"Yes,"
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
"Yeah,"
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
Yeah
"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
Oh.
"Is, is the Kmart there?"
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
you better believe it.
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
"That was, that was so funny,"
"he had to,"
or was it Kmart.
Yes.
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
"Right,"
right
"I, I've used that quite a bit"
"and it, and it seems to work real well."
Uh-huh.
"Uh,"
Um.
"And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey"
"and and,"
"Yeah,"
"that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time."
Yeah.
"You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, uh, which I had things like that,"
but I always cooked them ahead of time
"and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it."
Uh-huh.
Have you ever had that?
No.
"What,"
"Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp"
"and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make."
Uh-huh.
The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.
"Oh, I'll bet."
"Yeah,"
"I don't like the can, but the fresh."
Yeah.
You know.
I'll have to try that.
"Yeah,"
that was really good.
"I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,"
"and then I,"
"And your time,"
then you're that much farther ahead
Yeah.
"Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons."
It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
Right.
I've seen them
"and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in"
"and,"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
That's neat.
"I went there,"
we have Home Depot out here.
I don't know if you've heard of it.
I went
and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
Yes.
We have one.
I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
Huh.
"Oh, I'm, I'm sure."
"We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again."
A band saw?
What?
I did it through Adult Ed again.
Uh-huh.
"And the teacher was one of these negative people,"
"oh that's dangerous,"
"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
Right.
He likes to dig around a little bit.
"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
I guess he's enjoying himself.
That's right.
"It's healthy,"
why not.
Yeah.
"He was eating the dirt,"
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
It won't hurt them.
"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
and I turned out okay
"so, don't worry about it."
Just let him enjoy himself
"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
"Well, that's what I've always,"
I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
Yeah.
So you're just the opposite from me.
"You want to go back to that, uh,"
"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are you from Texas?
Yeah.
You are.
"So it's not, you know,"
that's true
"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
"I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,"
"And, uh,"
"I, I, I'm not a morning person"
so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news.
"I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work"
and then at work  I have no time to read the news.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
right.
"Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,"
huh-uh.
No
"But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know."
Uh-huh.
but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
Yeah.
"But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then."
Okay.
It's been nice talking to you Tony.
Nice talking to you.
I'll probably talk to you again.
I had a friend who was in this
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet."
"So, you never know,"
it might this time.
That's right.
"Okay, Tony."
"Yeah,"
"But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that."
"Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"
we like that.
Yeah.
"That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too."
Yeah.
"My son's getting to be a, a real good cook"
"so, uh,"
"Oh, neat."
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
"Oh, wow, that's great"
"Yeah,"
"I like it,"
I like it a lot.
How old is he?
He's eleven.
"Eleven,"
"wow, that's good."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
so
Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning
"or,"
"Uh, not every morning, uh,"
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss
"and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you grew up in Orlando."
Uh-huh.
"That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,"
"Well, that's what I worked on."
"Okay,"
"yeah,"
"must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there."
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
"Well, great."
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
"So, I hate to, uh,"
"I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,"
"but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,"
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
"Where's,"
How do you like Chinese food?
"Oh, we, we do enjoy that."
"Yes, sir."
"Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,"
"we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant"
and then we usually stick by it.
"But do you,  What about you?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food."
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I have a personal computer at home.
It's an A T compatible.
I don't use it very much any more.
I used to use it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Do you own a computer?
"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
"We have two P C at home,"
but neither one do we really own. Um.
Are you leasing them?
"No,"
"both of them are sort of work related,"
"and,"
Loaners from work?
"Yeah,"
"that's the nicer way, right."
Do you work for T I?
"No,"
no.
"Um, I, actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,"
"and my husband's working at Bell Labs,"
"but he's really from France,"
and these computers actually are from France.
What brand are they?
One of them's a Compaq
Uh-huh.

You too.
"Uh-huh,"
thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye now.
Okay.
"What kind of pet do you have, Gail?"
"Well, I don't."
I have children
"Oh, you have children"
I have little children.
"Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets,"
but we've had lots of them in the past.
Have you?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, what have you had?"
"Well, we had a dog before we moved here."
"Uh, and we couldn't bring her with us."
"We came from Colorado,"
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds.
Oh.
"Okay,"
"I've ,"
"Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up."
Uh-huh.
"Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer,"
and he was fourteen years old.
"And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers"
"and before that we had all Dachshunds,"
"and I think my husband wants another Dachshund,"
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
"and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog."
"It's usually friends from church and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring."
Yeah.
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things
and everybody else brings something.
"That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,"
yeah.
"Oh yeah,"
yeah.
Uh.
It's a lot more relaxing.
"I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone."
Well you see all that on T V
and I could never be that person.
Huh-uh.
"It just, uh, I'm just not,"
"well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back."
Yeah
"And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church"
"and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff"
"and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out"
and I don't know how she can do it and be calm
Yeah
"I guess,"
Do you work?
"No,"

Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it, it was heavy when we were there though."
Yeah.
"I didn't see any boats there, though."
"Not, not, not too many, no."
"But, uh, no,"
I just got back from a weekend.
"We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing."
"It was pretty nice,"
"but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff."
Yeah?
"That's a lot of fun,"
"but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,"
they're kind of into it.
"Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats."
"Oh, yeah,"
"I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here."
Yeah.
All right.
"So, where about in Texas is that?"
Is that centrally located
"or,"
"It's, uh, well,"

"Uh, no,"
"what, what major city is nearby?"
Houston.
"Okay,"
and that's south or north of there or something?
"and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,"
"and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon"
and it didn't give me any trouble at all.
That's good.
Yeah.

"You know, I kind of,"
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
Yeah.
"You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway."
"Yeah,"
"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy."
Yeah.
"But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too."
"You driven American cars all,"
"Uh, yeah,"

Our thoughts, passions and dreams (everything that makes us who we are) only have true life as they become HIS to shape and to mould. As we give our heart and our soul to GOD we then walk in the endless riches that are found in intimacy with HIM."""

"Thomas Dolman Shorts was a Canadian sailor, and one of the early captains on the Okanagan Lake. Shorts started the lakeboat service on Okanagan Lake in the Penticton area."
"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."

The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Jain calendar is known as Vira Nirvana Samvat and their year 2501 started with Diwali of year 1974. The Jain business people traditionally start their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:<br>
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया|<br>
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया||
Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.
"On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples across the world. The most important principle of Jains is Ahinsa or non violence, thus they tend to avoid firecrackers during Diwali as they cause harm to living organisms. Diwali is celebrated in atmosphere of austerity, simplicity, serenity, equity, calmness, charity, philanthropy and environment-consciousness. Jain temples, homes, offices, shops are decorated with lights and diyas. Relatives distribute sweets to each other. The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Swetambar jains observe two days of fasting in remembrance of the penance and sacrifice of Mahavira. In temples and homes, devotees sing and chant hymns and mantras from Jain religious texts in praise of the Tirthankar and congregate for a prayer and recite verses from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which contain the last teachings of Mahavira. Jains pay visit to Pawapuri,Nalanda in Bihar on this special day to offer their prayers. The Jain year starts with Pratipada, next day of Diwali."

"William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress."
"Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters."
"Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097."
"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

"Thomas Ellis was the first European settler in the area known today as Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. He was the biggest cattle baron in the South Okanagan area."
"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

They soon discover that Arthur's flamboyant redundancy clashes with Edmond's mediocre melodramatic style as they each develop increasingly ridiculous scenarios for the story. They are joined by Arthur's cleaning lady, also an aspiring writer, whose suggestions seem to be the most promising, but they too eventually bog down in banality."

"Vladimir Semyonovich Golenishchev (; 29 January 1856 – 5 August 1947), formerly also known as Wladimir or Woldemar Golenischeff, was one of the first and most accomplished Russian Egyptologists."
"Golenishchev, the son of a well-to-do merchant, was educated at the Saint Petersburg University. In 1884–85 he organized and financed excavations in Wadi Hammamat, followed by the research at Tell el-Maskhuta in 1888–89. In the course of the following two decades he travelled to Egypt more than sixty times and brought back an enormous collection of more than 6,000 ancient Egyptian antiquities, including such priceless relics as the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, the Story of Wenamun, the Alexandrian World Chronicle, and various Fayum portraits. He also published the so-called Hermitage papyri, including the Prophecy of Neferti, now stored in the Hermitage Museum."
"Having sold his collection to the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts in 1909, Golenishchev settled in Egypt. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he never returned to Russia, residing in Nice and Cairo. In Egypt, he established and held the chair in Egyptology at the University of Cairo from 1924 to 1929. He was also employed by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where he catalogued hieratic papyri. Golenishchev died in Nice aged 90."

In the early 2013 during the preparation for the regular festival an intellectual property rights conflict took place. Among other things it referred to the Jazz May brand. In the media there was a statement on possibility of making two independent festivals. As a result there was the only Jazz May but the main organizer (The Penza State Philharmonic) had to change its logo.

He played his junior hockey with the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) with whom he won the 2014 Memorial Cup Championship."
"In February 2011, Lazar captained Team British Columbia to win the gold medal in ice hockey at the 2011 Canada Winter Games. He broke the tournament goal scoring record previously set by Steven Stamkos (12) and Sidney Crosby's points mark (17) in six games. He was the second overall choice in the 2010 WHL Bantam Draft. Lazar played at the Pursuit of Excellence Hockey Academy before playing in the CSSHL with the Okanagan Hockey Academy during the 2010–11 season. During the 2011–12 season he helped his Edmonton Oil Kings team capture the Ed Chynoweth Cup as the WHL Champions. During the 2012–13 season he played with Team Canada to win a gold medal at the 2012 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, and was an invited participant at the 2013 CHL Top Prospects Game."
"Lazar's playing style had been compared to that of Edmonton Oilers' forward Milan Lucic and former Senators' forward Mike Fisher. At the NHL Entry Draft on June 30, 2013, he was selected 17th overall in the first round by the Ottawa Senators. On September 17, 2013, he signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Senators."
"Lazar made the Senators' 2014–15 opening night lineup and scored his first NHL goal against Jhonas Enroth of the Buffalo Sabres on December 15, 2014. Lazar was given permission by the Senators to represent Team Canada at the 2015 IIHF World Junior Championship in which Canada would win gold. In the tournament Lazar served as the team captain. Following the tournament's conclusion, Lazar rejoined the Senators."
"In the 2016–17 season, Lazar's development with the Senators stalled as his produced 1 assist in 33 games including a demotion to the AHL with the Binghamton Senators. On March 1, 2017, Lazar was dealt at the NHL trade deadline by the Senators along with Michael Kostka to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a 2017 second-round pick and Jyrki Jokipakka."
"On July 14, 2017, the Flames re-signed Lazar to a two-year, $1.9 million contract extension worth $950,000 annually."
"In the 2018–19 season, Lazar after clearing waivers was assigned to play the majority of the year with AHL affiliate, the Stockton Heat. Having made just one appearance with Calgary in the regular season he was not tendered a qualifying offer with the Flames on June 25, 2019, enabling him to become a free agent."
"On July 1, 2019, Lazar agreed to a one-year $700,000 contract with his third NHL club, the Buffalo Sabres."
"Lazar was born in Salmon Arm, British Columbia, but grew up in Vernon, British Columbia. His parents, Dave and Karen Lazar, have three other children, Jenna, Ryan and Cory. Lazar lists Joe Sakic and Ryan Getzlaf as his favourite hockey players growing up."

= = = Corno da tirarsi = = =
"The corno da tirarsi (""pull horn"") is a Baroque brass instrument. Johann Sebastian Bach wrote for the instrument when he was working in Leipzig, and it appears to have been played for him by Gottfried Reiche."
It has been stated that it appears in four Bach cantatas.
"However, it is only called for in three cantatas by name, BWV 46, 162 and 67."
"Its characteristics are debated, but it was most likely a horn that resembled the ""Inventions"" horn of the late 18th century: ""a freely-moving, double (cylindrical) tuning slide positioned diametrically across its circular body"". It may also have been a slide trumpet."
