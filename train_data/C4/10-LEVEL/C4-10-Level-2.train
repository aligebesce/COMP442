"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
"`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '"
"`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '"
"`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone ."
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
"But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was ."
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
"How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !"
"`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !"
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
"Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '"
"` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '"
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
"The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated ."
"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers ."
It was all splendid .
"` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son ."
"And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air ."
"Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !"
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
I suppose you 'll soon be leaving Sampson 's .
He told me he did n't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
"`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I 'll find something if I hunt around lively ."
I almost always do . ''
"He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes ."
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
"`` And here 's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him ."
"Oh , there 's the dinner-bell ."
I 'm awfully hungry .
"Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I do n't know what that means . ''"
"As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them ."
It was a feast to be dated from .
"When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie ."
`` So Mr. Sampson ca n't keep you ? ''
Bertie 's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
"`` No , sir ."
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
"`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow ."
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
"If you like , I 'll try you ."
"You can live here , and go to school ."
"I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I 'll bespeak for you ."
How will that do ? ''
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
"`` Let us go around to the Point , '' she said ."
`` Have you matches ?
No ?
"Emily , get some ."
We must light a bonfire at least .
And bring Father 's glass . ''
"`` It is not a fit night for you to be out , '' said Alan anxiously ."
`` You are sheltered here -- you do n't feel it -- but it 's a fearful storm down there . ''
`` I am not afraid of the storm .
It will not hurt me .
Let us hurry .
It is growing dark already . ''
In silence they breasted their way to the shore and around the headland .
"Arriving opposite Philip 's Point , a lull in the sleet permitted them to see the sunken schooner and the clinging figure ."
Lynde waved her hand to him and they saw him wave back .
"`` It wo n't be necessary to light a fire now that he has seen us , '' said Lynde ."
`` Nothing can be done with village help till morning and that man can never cling there so long .
"He will freeze to death , for it is growing colder every minute ."
His only chance is to swim ashore if he can swim .
The danger will be when he comes near shore ; the undertow of the backwater on the quicksand will sweep him away and in his probably exhausted condition he may not be able to make head against it . ''
"`` He knows that , doubtless , and that is why he has n't attempted to swim ashore before this , '' said Alan ."
`` But I 'll meet him in the backwater and drag him in . ''
"`` You -- you 'll risk your own life , '' cried Lynde ."
"`` There is a little risk certainly , but I do n't think there is a great one ."
"Anyhow , the attempt must be made , '' said Alan quietly ."
Suddenly Lynde 's composure forsook her .
She wrung her hands .
"`` I ca n't let you do it , '' she cried wildly ."
`` You might be drowned -- there 's every risk .
You do n't know the force of that backwater .
"Alan , Alan , do n't think of it . ''"
She caught his arm in her white wet hands and looked into his face with passionate pleading .
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
Then the talk drifted around to Edith 's affairs .
"She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college ."
"`` I do n't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith ."
`` He 's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
"`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself ."
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
"He does n't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse ."
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
"`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine 's dressing table ."
`` And that is what Sid is not .
"He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''"
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
"`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain ."
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you 'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
"He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain ."
"`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat ."
"`` She is a dear girl -- you 'll like her , I know ."
"It 's really too bad I have to go away now , but it ca n't be helped . ''"
"`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned ."
"`` Do n't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''"
"`` Of course I 'll write , but for pity 's sake , Ned , do n't call me Kitty ."
It sounds so childish .
"Well , bye-bye , dear boy ."
I 'll be back in two months and then we 'll have a lovely time . ''
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
"And I love you , Eve . ''"
Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a burnished semi-circle on her cheek .
"`` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that it must have been very delightful in Eden ."
"But we are not really there , you know -- we are only playing that we are ."
And it is time for me to go back .
I must get the breakfast -- that sounds too prosaic for paradise . ''
Murray bent still closer .
"`` Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise , will you kiss me , dear Eve ? ''"
"`` You are very audacious , '' said Mollie coldly ."
"`` We are in Eden yet , '' he urged ."
`` That makes all the difference . ''
"`` Well , '' said Mollie ."
And Murray kissed her .
They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before either spoke again .
"Then Murray said , `` We have left Eden behind -- but we can always return there when we will ."
"And although we were only playing at paradise , I was not playing at love ."
"I meant all I said , Mollie . ''"
`` Have you meant it often ? ''
asked Mollie significantly .
"`` I never meant it -- or even played at it -- before , '' he answered ."
`` I did -- at one time -- contemplate the possibility of playing at it .
But that was long ago -- as long ago as last night .
"I am glad to the core of my soul that I decided against it before I met you , dear Eve ."
I have the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment .
I mean to mail it this afternoon . '' ''
"` Curiosity knows no gender , ' '' quoted Mollie ."
"`` Then , to satisfy your curiosity , I must bore you with some personal history ."
"My parents died when I was a little chap , and my uncle brought me up ."
"He has been immensely good to me , but he is a bit of a tyrant ."
Recently he picked out a wife for me -- the daughter of an old sweetheart of his .
I have never even seen her .
But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there .
"As soon as the ceremony was over , Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel ."
He was going to China .
Father and I came back home .
Nobody knew -- not even Emily .
He said we must not tell Mother until she was better .
But she was never better .
She only lived three months more -- she lived them happily and at rest .
"When I think of that , I am not sorry for what I did ."
Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me .
"I waited , sick at heart ."
But he did not come -- he has never come .
We have never heard a word of or about him since .
Sometimes I feel sure he can not be still living .
"But never a day dawns that I do n't say to myself , ` Perhaps he will come today ' -- and , oh -- '' She broke down again , sobbing bitterly ."
"Amid all the daze of his own pain Alan realized that , at any cost , he must not make it harder for her by showing his suffering ."
"He tried to speak calmly , wisely , as a disinterested friend ."
`` Could it not be discovered whether your -- this man -- is or is not living ?
Surely your father could find out . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , he says he has no way of doing so ."
"We do not know if Captain Harmon had any relatives or even where his home was , and it was his own ship in which he sailed ."
"Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead , but he does not think he is ."
"He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow , one fancy driving another out of his mind ."
"Oh , I can bear my own misery -- but to think what I have brought on you !"
I never dreamed that you could care for me .
I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant -- can you ever forgive me ? ''
"`` There is nothing to forgive , as far as you are concerned , Lynde , '' said Alan steadily ."
`` You have done me no wrong .
I have loved you sincerely and such love can be nothing but a blessing to me .
I only wish that I could help you .
It wrings my heart to think of your position .
But I can do nothing -- nothing .
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
"And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her , and I 'm going to . ''"
`` Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her ? ''
"`` Well , I ai n't going to let anybody else pull it , '' said Davy , doubling up his fists and frowning ."
`` They 'd just better try it .
I did n't hurt her much ... she just cried 'cause she 's a girl .
I 'm glad I 'm a boy but I 'm sorry I 'm a twin .
"When Jimmy Sprott 's sister conterdicks him he just says , ` I 'm oldern you , so of course I know better , ' and that settles HER ."
"But I ca n't tell Dora that , and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me ."
"You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell , since I 'm a man . ''"
"Altogether , Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard , where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves ."
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out .
"Dora submitted calmly to be kissed , but Davy responded to Anne 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement , `` I 'm Mr. Davy Keith . ''"
"At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady , but Davy 's manners left much to be desired ."
"`` I 'm so hungry I ai n't got time to eat p ` litely , '' he said when Marilla reproved him ."
`` Dora ai n't half as hungry as I am .
Look at all the ex ` cise I took on the road here .
That cake 's awful nice and plummy .
"We have n't had any cake at home for ever 'n ever so long , 'cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us ."
And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes .
Catch her !
Can I have another piece ? ''
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice .
"However , she reminded Davy that he ought to say `` Thank you '' for it ."
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite .
"When he had finished the slice he said , `` If you 'll give me ANOTHER piece I 'll say thank you for IT . ''"
"`` No , you have had plenty of cake , '' said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final ."
"Davy winked at Anne , and then , leaning over the table , snatched Dora 's first piece of cake , from which she had just taken one dainty little bite , out of her very fingers and , opening his mouth to the fullest extent , crammed the whole slice in ."
Dora 's lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror .
"Anne promptly exclaimed , with her best `` schoolma'am '' air , `` Oh , Davy , gentlemen do n't do things like that . ''"
"`` I know they do n't , '' said Davy , as soon as he could speak , `` but I ai n't a gemplum . ''"
`` But do n't you want to be ? ''
said shocked Anne .
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
"` Then , ' said Peter , not without grimness , ` step in , if you feel so sure of her , ' and he helped Maimie into the Thrush 's Nest ."
` But why do n't you look at me ? '
"she asked , taking him by the arm ."
"Peter tried hard not to look , he tried to push off , then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow ."
She went to him .
"` What is it , dear , dear Peter ? '"
"she said , wondering . '"
"O Maimie , ' he cried , ` it is n't fair to take you with me if you think you can go back !"
Your mother ' -- he gulped again -- ` you do n't know them as well as I do . '
"And then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out , and she gasped all the time ."
"` But my mother , ' she said , ' my mother -- ' ` Yes , she would , ' said Peter , ` they are all the same ."
I dare say she is looking for another one already . '
"Maimie said aghast , ' I ca n't believe it ."
"You see , when you went away your mother had none , but my mother has Tony , and surely they are satisfied when they have one . '"
"Peter replied bitterly , ` You should see the letters Solomon gets from ladies who have six . '"
"Just then they heard a grating creak , followed by creak , creak , all round the Gardens ."
"It was the Opening of the Gates , and Peter jumped nervously into his boat ."
"He knew Maimie would not come with him now , and he was trying bravely not to cry ."
But Maimie was sobbing painfully .
"` If I should be too late , ' she said in agony , ' O Peter , if she has got another one already ! '"
Again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back . '
"I shall come and look for you to-night , ' he said , squeezing close , ` but if you hurry away I think you will be in time . '"
"Then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth , and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go ."
` Dear Peter ! '
she cried .
` Dear Maimie ! '
cried the tragic boy .
"She leapt into his arms , so that it was a sort of fairy wedding , and then she hurried away ."
"Oh , how she hastened to the gates !"
"Peter , you may be sure , was back in the Gardens that night as soon as Lock-out sounded , but he found no Maimie , and so he knew she had been in time ."
"For long he hoped that some night she would come back to him ; often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the Serpentine as his bark drew to land , but Maimie never went back ."
"She wanted to , but she was afraid that if she saw her dear Betwixt-and-Between again she would linger with him too long , and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her ."
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
"Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner , but all she could think of was the question -- Would Ken come to see her before he went away ?"
She had not heard from him for a long while .
Had he forgotten her completely ?
If he did not come she would know that he had .
Perhaps there was even -- some other girl back there in Toronto .
Of course there was .
She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all .
She would not think about him .
"If he came , well and good ."
It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest .
"If he did not come -- well and good , too ."
It did not matter very much .
Nobody was going to fret .
That was all settled comfortably -- she was quite indifferent -- but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror .
"Jims himself did n't like it , being a methodical baby , accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each ."
"He protested , but his protests availed him nothing ."
"Rilla , as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned , was utterly demoralized ."
Then the telephone-bell rang .
There was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing .
It rang on an average every ten minutes at Ingleside .
But Rilla dropped Jims ' spoon again -- on the carpet this time -- and flew to the ` phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else .
"Jims , his patience exhausted , lifted up his voice and wept ."
"`` Hello , is this Ingleside ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` That you , Rilla ? ''"
`` Yeth -- yeth . ''
"Oh , why could n't Jims stop howling for just one little minute ?"
Why did n't somebody come in and choke him ?
`` Know who 's speaking ? ''
"Oh , did n't she know !"
Would n't she know that voice anywhere -- at any time ?
`` It 's Ken -- is n't it ? ''
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
"Then she came over , sat down beside me , and took me in her arms . ''"
"` Do n't cry , dear little Rilla-my-Rilla ."
"You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to Fred ; and if Leslie West 's son asked you to keep your lips for him , I think you may consider yourself engaged to him ."
"But -- oh , my baby -- my last little baby -- I have lost you -- the war has made a woman of you too soon . '"
`` I shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mother 's hugs .
"Nevertheless , when I saw Fred marching by two days later in the parade , my heart ached unbearably ."
`` But I 'm glad mother thinks I 'm really engaged to Ken ! ''
"CHAPTER XXII LITTLE DOG MONDAY KNOWS `` It is two years tonight since the dance at the light , when Jack Elliott brought us news of the war ."
"Do you remember , Miss Oliver ? ''"
Cousin Sophia answered for Miss Oliver .
"`` Oh , indeed , Rilla , I remember that evening only too well , and you a-prancing down here to show off your party clothes ."
Did n't I warn you that we could not tell what was before us ?
Little did you think that night what was before you . ''
"`` Little did any of us think that , '' said Susan sharply , `` not being gifted with the power of prophecy ."
"It does not require any great foresight , Sophia Crawford , to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over ."
I could do as much myself . ''
"`` We all thought the war would be over in a few months then , '' said Rilla wistfully ."
`` When I look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it . ''
"`` And now , two years later , it is no nearer the end than it was then , '' said Miss Oliver gloomily ."
Susan clicked her knitting-needles briskly .
"`` Now , Miss Oliver , dear , you know that is not a reasonable remark ."
"You know we are just two years nearer the end , whenever the end is appointed to be . ''"
"`` Albert read in a Montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more , '' was Cousin Sophia 's cheerful contribution ."
"`` It ca n't , '' cried Rilla ; then she added with a sigh , `` Two years ago we would have said ` It ca n't last two years . '"
But five more years of this ! ''
"`` If Rumania comes in , as I have strong hopes now of her doing , you will see the end in five months instead of five years , '' said Susan ."
"`` I 've no faith in furriners , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The French are foreigners , '' retorted Susan , `` and look at Verdun ."
And think of all the Somme victories this blessed summer .
The Big Push is on and the Russians are still going well .
"Why , General Haig says that the German officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war . ''"
"`` You ca n't believe a word the Germans say , '' protested Cousin Sophia ."
says he .
`` This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk ; and I hae nae trokings * wi ' night-hawks .
What brings ye here ?
I have a blunderbush . ''
* Dealings .
"`` Is that yoursel ' , Mr. Balfour ? ''"
"returned Alan , stepping back and looking up into the darkness ."
`` Have a care of that blunderbuss ; they 're nasty things to burst . ''
`` What brings ye here ?
and whae are ye ? ''
"says my uncle , angrily ."
"`` I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side , '' said Alan ; `` but what brings me here is another story , being more of your affair than mine ; and if ye 're sure it 's what ye would like , I 'll set it to a tune and sing it to you . ''"
`` And what is ` t ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` David , '' says Alan ."
`` What was that ? ''
"cried my uncle , in a mighty changed voice ."
"`` Shall I give ye the rest of the name , then ? ''"
said Alan .
"There was a pause ; and then , `` I 'm thinking I 'll better let ye in , '' says my uncle , doubtfully ."
"`` I dare say that , '' said Alan ; `` but the point is , Would I go ?"
Now I will tell you what I am thinking .
"I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business ; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever ; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel ' , and a gentleman of better family . ''"
"This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer ; he was a little while digesting it , and then says he , `` Weel , weel , what must be must , '' and shut the window ."
"But it took him a long time to get down-stairs , and a still longer to undo the fastenings , repenting -LRB- I dare say -RRB- and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar ."
"At last , however , we heard the creak of the hinges , and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and -LRB- seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two -RRB- sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands ."
"`` And , now '' says he , `` mind I have my blunderbush , and if ye take a step nearer ye 're as good as deid . ''"
"`` And a very civil speech , '' says Alan , `` to be sure . ''"
"`` Na , '' says my uncle , `` but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding , and I 'm bound to be prepared ."
"And now that we understand each other , ye 'll can name your business . ''"
"`` Why , '' says Alan , `` you that are a man of so much understanding , will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman ."
"My name has nae business in my story ; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull , of which ye will have heard ."
"I have some myself , though you might never suspect it ."
But anyhow I ai n't going to give anything to that carpet .
"Folks are everlasting begging for money here , it seems to me ."
How 's your project of painting the hall coming on ? ''
`` Splendidly .
We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too .
"MOST people gave very liberally , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"Anne was a sweet-souled lass , but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required ."
`` What color are you going to have it ? ''
`` We have decided on a very pretty green .
"The roof will be dark red , of course ."
Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today . ''
`` Who 's got the job ? ''
`` Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody .
He has nearly finished the shingling .
"We had to give him the contract , for every one of the Pyes ... and there are four families , you know ... said they would n't give a cent unless Joshua got it ."
"They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose , although some people think we should n't have given in to the Pyes ."
Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything . ''
`` The main question is will this Joshua do his work well .
If he does I do n't see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding . ''
"`` He has the reputation of being a good workman , though they say he 's a very peculiar man ."
He hardly ever talks . ''
"`` He 's peculiar enough all right then , '' said Mr. Harrison drily ."
"`` Or at least , folks here will call him so ."
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language .
"You 're not going yet , Anne ? ''"
`` I must .
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening .
"Besides , Davy is probably breaking Marilla 's heart with some new mischief by this time ."
"This morning the first thing he said was , ` Where does the dark go , Anne ?"
I want to know . '
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it did n't ... that it went down the well .
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
Sore bested ? ''
returned the knight .
"`` Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard ."
"As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest ."
"Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick ."
"But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought ."
"Selden , a link here at the door ! ''"
"And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street , and , by the red glow of a torch , inspected his new troops ."
He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master ; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant .
"His dash , his proved courage , his forethought for the soldiers ' comfort , even his rough gibes , were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet ."
"`` Nay , by the rood ! ''"
"he cried , `` what poor dogs are these ?"
"Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear ."
"Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends ."
Mark me this old villain on the piebald !
A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly !
Ha !
"Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ?"
"Y ' are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull 's eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . ''"
"`` I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , '' returned Clipsby , sturdily ."
Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw .
"`` Why , well said ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to !"
I will forgive you for that merry word .
"Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . ''"
The knight re-entered the inn .
"`` Now , friend Dick , '' he said , `` fall to ."
Here is good ale and bacon .
"Eat , while that I read . ''"
"Sir Daniel opened the packet , and as he read his brow darkened ."
"When he had done he sat a little , musing ."
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"I should think you ought to be able to , with that imagination you 're always talking of . ''"
"`` But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things , '' said Anne , cuddling Davy ."
`` There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more . ''
"In the end Davy was sent to bed , as usual , there to remain until noon next day ."
"He evidently did some thinking , for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly ."
"Going in , she found him sitting up in bed , with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands ."
"`` Anne , '' he said solemnly , `` is it wrong for everybody to tell whop ... falsehoods ?"
I want to know ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed . ''"
`` Is it wrong for a grown-up person ? ''
`` Yes . ''
"`` Then , '' said Davy decidedly , `` Marilla is bad , for SHE tells them ."
"And she 's worse 'n me , for I did n't know it was wrong but she does . ''"
"`` Davy Keith , Marilla never told a story in her life , '' said Anne indignantly ."
`` She did so .
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I did n't say my prayers every night .
"And I have n't said them for over a week , just to see what would happen ... and nothing has , '' concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone ."
"Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal , and then earnestly set about saving Marilla 's reputation ."
"`` Why , Davy Keith , '' she said solemnly , `` something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day . ''"
Davy looked sceptical .
"`` I s ` pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper , '' he said scornfully , `` but THAT is n't dreadful ."
"Course , I do n't like it , but I 've been sent to bed so much since I come here that I 'm getting used to it ."
"And you do n't save anything by making me go without supper either , for I always eat twice as much for breakfast . ''"
`` I do n't mean your being sent to bed .
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today .
"And , Davy , '' ... Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit ... `` for a boy to tell what is n't true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him ... almost the very worst ."
So you see Marilla told you the truth . ''
"`` But I thought the something bad would be exciting , '' protested Davy in an injured tone ."
`` Marilla is n't to blame for what you thought .
Bad things are n't always exciting .
They 're very often just nasty and stupid . ''
"`` It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well , though , '' said Davy , hugging his knees ."
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"`` For , by my sooth , y ' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty ."
"If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . ''"
"`` For twenty pound , my good lord ! ''"
cried Condall .
`` Here is midsummer madness !
My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . ''
"`` Condall or Tyndal , '' returned Sir Daniel , grinning , `` I will run my peril of that loss ."
"Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . ''"
`` Alas !
"my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , '' said Condall ."
`` Well-a-day ! ''
returned the knight .
"`` Here , then , is no remedy ."
"Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered ."
"Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding ."
"Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y ' are post-haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! ''"
"`` Nay , my right pleasant lord , '' replied Condall , forcing an obsequious smile , `` an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . ''"
"`` Friend , '' quoth Sir Daniel , `` ye will now write two score ."
Go to !
y ' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings .
"Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . ''"
"And Sir Daniel , who was a very merry knight , none merrier in England , took a drink of his mulled ale , and lay back , smiling ."
"Meanwhile , the boy upon the floor began to stir , and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare ."
"`` Hither , '' said Sir Daniel ; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him , he leaned back and laughed outright ."
`` By the rood ! ''
"he cried , `` a sturdy boy ! ''"
"The lad flushed crimson with anger , and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes ."
"Now that he was on his legs , it was more difficult to make certain of his age ."
"His face looked somewhat older in expression , but it was as smooth as a young child 's ; and in bone and body he was unusually slender , and somewhat awkward of gait ."
"`` Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? ''
"`` Nay , now , let laugh , '' said the knight ."
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
`` Five . ''
How Slightly longed to say it .
"He wetted his lips to be ready , but Hook came staggering out , without his lantern ."
"`` Something blew out the light , '' he said a little unsteadily ."
`` Something ! ''
echoed Mullins .
`` What of Cecco ? ''
demanded Noodler .
"`` He 's as dead as Jukes , '' said Hook shortly ."
"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , and the mutinous sounds again broke forth ."
"All pirates are superstitious , and Cookson cried , `` They do say the surest sign a ship 's accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ''"
"`` I 've heard , '' muttered Mullins , `` he always boards the pirate craft last ."
"Had he a tail , captain ? ''"
"`` They say , '' said another , looking viciously at Hook , `` that when he comes it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ''"
"`` Had he a hook , captain ? ''"
"asked Cookson insolently ; and one after another took up the cry , `` The ship 's doomed ! ''"
At this the children could not resist raising a cheer .
"Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners , but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again ."
"`` Lads , '' he cried to his crew , `` now here 's a notion ."
Open the cabin door and drive them in .
Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives .
"If they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none the worse . ''"
"For the last time his dogs admired Hook , and devotedly they did his bidding ."
"The boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them ."
"`` Now , listen ! ''"
"cried Hook , and all listened ."
But not one dared to face the door .
"Yes , one , Wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast ."
"It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for the reappearance of Peter ."
She had not long to wait .
"In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they could find ."
"First signing them to hide , Peter cut Wendy 's bonds , and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , `` Hook or me this time . ''"
Hook wetted his dry lips .
"` Ay , ' he said , ` that 's the fear that haunts me . '"
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm .
"` Smee , ' he said , ` this seat is hot . '"
He jumped up .
"` Odds bobs , hammer and tongs I 'm burning . '"
"They examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in their hands , for it had no root ."
"Stranger still , smoke began at once to ascend ."
The pirates looked at each other . '
A chimney ! '
they both exclaimed .
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground .
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood .
Not only smoke came out of it .
"There came also children 's voices , for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering ."
"The pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom ."
They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees .
` Did you hear them say Peter Pan 's from home ? '
"Smee whispered , fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew ."
Hook nodded .
"He stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face ."
Smee had been waiting for it .
"` Unrip your plan , captain , ' he cried eagerly ."
"` To return to the ship , ' Hook replied slowly through his teeth , ` and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it ."
"There can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney ."
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece .
That shows they have no mother .
We will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids ' lagoon .
"These boys are always swimming about there , playing with the mermaids ."
"They will find the cake and they will gobble it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous 't is to eat rich damp cake . '"
"He burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , but honest laughter ."
"` Aha , they will die . '"
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"So, when the Lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his mother."
"""Now,"" said he, ""I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort of food I please."""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but seeing is believing, and I shan't believe it till I see it."""
"So the Lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
"""Well,"" said the Lad ""there's no help for it but to go to the North Wind again;"" and away he went."
So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.
"""Good evening!"" said the Lad."
"""Good evening!"" said the North Wind."
"""I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,"" said the Lad; ""for, as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny."""
"""I've got no meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"So the Lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before."
"Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the Lad had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the two."
"Next morning off went the Lad; and when he got home to his mother, he said:"
"""After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but I shan't believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."""
"""Ram, ram! make money!"" said the Lad; but if the ram made anything, it wasn't money."
"So the Lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."
"""Well!"" said the North Wind; ""I've nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its a stick of that kind that if you say: 'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say: 'Stick, stick! now stop!'"""
"So, as the way was long, the Lad turned in this night too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep."
"Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the Lad bawled out:"
"""Stick, stick! lay on!"""
"So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:"
"""Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram."""
"When the Lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:"
"""Stick, stick! now stop!"""
"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost."
THE THREE PRINCESSES OF WHITELAND
"Once on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for the King's table. One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. Do what he would however he tried with bait and angle there was never a sprat on his hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:"
"""If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough."""
"So the man answered boldly, ""Yes;"" for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. After that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, ""I bear a babe under my girdle."""
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said, ""That must be the fruit; go and gather it."" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, ""Come with me to my room while I open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat me."""
"""No,"" said King Dantal; ""remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to eat you."""
"Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor."
"Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him sadly, ""Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."""
"King Dantal answered, ""It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly."" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again."
"Then Laili said, ""Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"""
"""Oh!"" said Prince Majnun, ""I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them."" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs."
"After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden."
"""We must go into that garden and see it,"" said Majnun."
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked man."" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, ""Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you to seize me."""
"""What nonsense,"" said Majnun. ""I believe he is a very good Raja."
"Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away."""
"""Well,"" said Laili, ""it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed."" Now Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow."
"Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said, ""Why did you kill my husband?"""
"""Because I want to take you,"" he answered."
"""You cannot,"" said Laili."
"""Yes, I can,"" said the Raja."
"""Take me, then,"" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch."
"Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and said, ""What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had slept for years!"" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by Laili's horse."
"""What's that?"" said Majnun."
"""That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."""
"""Who killed him?"" asked Majnun."
"""I did,"" answered Laili, ""and it was I who brought you to life."""
"""Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,"" said Majnun."
"""No,"" said Laili, ""for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm."" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, ""Jump up on the horse, then, and go far away with the groom."""
"""What will you do,"" said Majnun, ""if I leave you? I cannot leave you."""
"""I will take care of myself,"" said Laili; ""but this man is so wicked, he may kill you again if you are near him."" So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili."
"Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace."
"There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and angry. ""How lucky for you that you have such a wife,"" he said."
"""Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; ""for,"" said King Dantal, ""Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."""
"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal"
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""
Loving Laili
"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof muslin there was no time to make the frock and Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe."
"Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous."
"There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun."
"The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests in the flowering hawthorn hedges."
"Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew."
"""Oh, I want to go home,"" said Effie."
"""Don't be silly,"" said Harry. ""Surely you haven't forgotten about the Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."""
"""And are we,"" asked Effie ""deliverers, I mean?"""
"""You'll see,"" said her brother, and on they went."
"When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they walked right in but St. George was not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St."
"George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast."
"""How ever can we wake him?"" they said. Then Harry spoke to St."
"George but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice."
"Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: ""Oh, dear, good, kind St. George, please wake up and help us."""
"And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself and said: ""What's the matter, little girl?"""
So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head.
"""It's no good,"" he said, ""they would be one too many for poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair fight one man one dragon, was my motto."""
"Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew his sword."
But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.
"""I can't do anything,"" he said. ""Things have changed since my time. St."
"Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort of weather have you been having lately?"""
"This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but Effie said patiently, ""It has been very fine. Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been in this country."""
"""Ah, I guessed as much,"" said the Champion, thoughtfully. ""Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find the taps."""
St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.
"""Good night, very sorry I can't help you,"" he said, yawning behind his marble hand."
"""Oh, but you can,"" cried Effie. ""Tell us what taps?"""
"""Oh, like in the bathroom,"" said St. George, still more sleepily. ""And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't good night."""
And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.
"""We shall never find the taps,"" said Harry. ""I say, wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"""
"Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. ""We didn't meet any the size of the dining room as we came along,"" she said. ""I daresay we shall be quite safe."""
"So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for him."
"""We might hide in the church till it is dark,"" he said, ""and then """
"said the stranger, in his sweetest way; ""but who is the Moth who is punishing him that queer-looking one with a crooked feeler?"""
"""Sir,"" said she, moving farther from him, ""he is a friend of mine, and I do not think it matters to you if he is queer-looking."""
"""Oh!"" said the stranger. ""Oh! oh! oh! You have a bad temper, haven't you? But you are very good-looking in spite of that."" There is no telling what he would have said next, for at this minute Miss Cecropia's friend heard the mean things he was saying, and flew against him."
"It was not long before this stranger also was punished, and then the Moth with the crooked feeler turned to the others. ""Do any of you want to try it?"" he said. ""You must understand that you cannot be rude before her."" And he pointed his right fore leg at Miss Cecropia as she sat trembling on the branch."
"""Her!"" they cried mockingly, as they flew away. ""There are prettier Moths than she. We don't care anything for her."""
"Miss Cecropia's friend would have gone after them to punish them for this impoliteness, but she clung to him and begged him not to. ""You will be killed, I know you will,"" she sobbed. ""And then what will become of me?"""
"""Would you miss me?"" he asked, as he felt of one of his wings, now broken and bare."
"""Yes,"" she cried. ""You are the best friend I have. Please don't go."""
"""But I am such a homely fellow,"" he said. ""I don't see how you can like me since I broke my wing."""
"""Well, I do like you,"" she said. ""Your wing isn't much broken after all, and I like your crooked feeler. It is so different from anybody else's."" Miss Cecropia looked very happy as she spoke, and she quite forgot how she once decided to go away from him. There are some people, you know, who can change their minds in such a sweet and easy way that we almost love them the better for it. One certainly could love Miss Cecropia for this, because it showed that she had learned to care more for a warm heart and courage than for whole wings and straight feelers."
"Mr. Cecropia did not live long after this, unfortunately, but they were very, very happy together, and she often said to her friends, as she laid her eggs in the best places, ""I only hope that when my Caterpillar babies are grown and have come out of their chrysalides, they may be as good and as brave as their father was."""
THE BEES AND THE KINGBIRD
"There was in the forest a great hollow tree where for years a swarm of Bees had made their home. To look at it in winter, one would never guess what a store of honey was sealed up within, but in summer the Bees were always passing in and out, and it was indeed a busy place. Then the Workers had to gather honey and build the cells and look out for the Queen-Mother's many babies. The Queen-Mother had so much care of her eggs that she could really do nothing but attend to them. After they were ready in their cells, the Workers took care of them, and tucked in a lot of bread for the babies to eat when they were hatched. Then there was the bread-making to be done also, and all the Workers helped bring the pollen, or flower-dust, out of which it was made."
"The Drones didn't do anything, not a thing, not a single thing, unless it were taking care of the Queen when she flew away from the tree. They had done that once, but it was long ago, before she had laid an egg and while she was still quite young. They were handsome great fellows, all black and gold, and if you didn't know about them, you might have thought them the pleasantest Bees in the tree. Of course you would not care for them after finding how lazy they were, for people are never liked just because they are fine-looking."
"The Drones always found some excuse for being idle, and like many other lazy people they wanted the busy ones to stop and visit with them. ""What is the hurry?"" they would say. ""There will be more honey that you can get to-morrow. Stop a while now."""
"But the Workers would shake their brown heads and buzz impatiently as they answered, ""We can get to-morrow's honey when to-morrow comes, but to-day's honey must be gathered to-day."""
"Then the Drones would grumble and say that they didn't see the sense of storing up so much honey anyway. That also was like lazy people the world over, for however much they scold about getting the food, they are sure to eat just as much as anybody else. Sometimes lazy people eat even more than others, and pick for the best too."
"On cloudy days, the Workers did stay at home in the tree, but not to play. They clung to the walls and to each other and made wax. It took much patience to make wax. When they were gathering honey there was so much that was interesting to be seen, and so many friends to meet, that it was really quite exciting; but when they made wax they had to hang for a long, long time, until the wax gathered in flakes over their bodies. Then it was ready to scrape off and shape into six-sided cells to hold honey or to be homes for the babies."
One sunshiny morning the Queen-Mother stopped laying her eggs and cried:
"""Listen! did you hear that?"""
"""What?"" asked the Workers, crowding around her."
"""Why, that noise,"" she said. ""It sounded like a bird calling 'Kyrie!"
"K-y-rie!' and I thought I heard a Worker buzzing outside a minute ago, but no one has come in. I am afraid "" and here she stopped."
"""Of what are you afraid!"" asked the Drones, who, having nothing to do but eat and sleep, were always ready to talk about anything and everything. The great trouble with them was that if you once began to talk they did not like to have you leave and go to work."
"""Why,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I don't want to alarm you, but I thought it was a Kingbird."""
"""Well, what if it was?"" said a big Drone. ""There is only one of him and there are a great many of us."""
"""Yes,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""but there may not be so many of us very long if he begins to watch the tree. I have lived much longer than you and I know how Kingbirds act."""
"This was true, for Queens live to be very old, and Drones never live long because they are so lazy."
"""Well,"" said the big Drone, ""we must find out about this. Just fly around and see if it is a Kingbird,"" he said to a Worker. ""We must know about things before we act."""
"""Suppose you should go,"" she replied. ""I have my leg-pockets full of pollen, and it ought to be made into bread at once. I never saw Larvæ so hungry as these last ones are."""
"""I only wish that I could go,"" said the big Drone, limping as he got out of her way; ""but my fifth foot just stepped on my third foot, and I can hardly move."""
THE UNDECIDED RATTLESNAKE
"It is not often that one of the Forest People has any trouble about making up his mind, but there was one large Rattlesnake who had great difficulty in doing so. She lived in the southern edge of the forest, where the sunshine was clear and warm, and there were delightful crevices among the rocks in which she and all her friends and relatives could hide."
"It seemed very strange that so old a Snake should be so undecided as she was. It must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. If that were so, one should indeed be sorry for her."
"Still even that would be no real excuse, for was she not old enough now to train herself? She had seven joints in the rattle on her tail and an eighth one growing, so you can see that she was no longer young, although, being healthy, she had grown her new joints and changed her skin oftener than some of her friends. In fact, she had grown children of her own, and if it had not been that they took after their father, they would have been a most helpless family. Fortunately for them, their father was a very decided Snake."
"Yes, it was exceedingly lucky for them. It may not have been so good a thing for him. His wife was always glad to have things settled for her, and when he said, ""We will do this,"" she answered, ""Yes, dear."" When he said, ""We will not do that,"" she murmured, ""No, dear."" And when he said, ""What shall we do?"" she would reply, ""Oh, I don't know. What do you think we might better do?"" He did not very often ask her opinion, and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him."
"Now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family, and it happened here as it would anywhere. He grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time, and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. Most people thought him a very devoted husband. Perhaps he was. It is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way."
"One night Mr. Rattlesnake did not return to their home. Nobody ever knew what had become of him. The Red Squirrel said that Mrs. Goldfinch said that the biggest little Rabbit had told her that the Ground Hog had overheard Mr. Crow say that he thought he saw somebody that looked like Mr. Rattlesnake chasing a Field Mouse over toward the farm, but that he might have been mistaken. This was all so uncertain that Mrs."
Rattlesnake knew no more than she had known before. It was very trying.
"""If I only knew positively,"" she said to her friend, Mrs. Striped Snake, ""I could do something, although I am sure I don't know what it would be."""
"Mrs. Striped Snake tried to help her. ""Why not have one of your children come home to live with you?"" she said pleasantly, for this year's children were now old enough to shift for themselves."
"""I've thought of that,"" answered Mrs. Rattlesnake, ""but I like a quiet life, and you know how it is. Young Snakes will be young Snakes."
"Besides, I don't think they would want to come back."""
"""Well, why not be alone, then?"""
"""Oh, it is so lonely,"" replied Mrs. Rattlesnake, with a sigh."
"""Everything reminds me so of my husband, and that makes me sad. If I lived somewhere else it would be different."""
"""Then why not move?"" said Mrs. Striped Snake, briskly. ""I would do that."
"Find a nice crack in the rock just big enough for one, or make a cosy little hole in the ground somewhere near here. Then if he comes back he can find you easily. I would do that. I certainly would."""
"She spoke so firmly that Mrs. Rattlesnake said she would, she would to-morrow. And her friend went home thinking it was all settled. That shows how little she really knew Mrs. Rattlesnake."
"The more Mrs. Rattlesnake thought it over that night, the more she dreaded moving. ""If he does not come back,"" she sighed, ""I may marry again in the spring, and then I might have to move once more. I believe I will ask somebody else what I ought to do."""
"So in the morning she began to consult her friends. They all told her to move, and she decided to do it. Then she could not make up her mind whether to take a rock-crevice or make a hole in the ground. It took another day of visiting to settle that it should be a hole in the ground. A fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home, and on the fifth day she began work."
"By the time the sun was over the tree-tops, she wished she had chosen some other place, and thought best to stop and talk to some of her friends about it. When she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin, which had been growing tight and dry for some time. This was hard work, and she was too tired to go on with her home-making, so she lay in the sunshine and admired her beautiful, long, and shining body of reddish brown spotted with black. Her rattle had eight joints now, for when a Rattlesnake casts the old skin a new joint is always uncovered at the end of the tail. She waved it quickly to see how an eight-jointed rattle would sound. ""Lovely!"" she said. ""Lovely! Like the seeds of the wild cucumber shaking around in their dry and prickly case."""
"One could not tell all the things that happened that fall, or how very, very, very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. She changed her mind more times than there are seeds in a milkweed pod, and the only thing of which she was always sure was eating. When there was food in sight she did not stop for anybody's advice. She ate it as fast as she could, and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so, she kept them to herself."
"When winter came she had just got her new home ready, and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other Snakes."
"They coiled themselves together in a great mass and slept there until spring. As the weather grew warmer, they began to stir, wriggling and twisting themselves free."
Two bachelor Snakes asked her to marry. One was a fine old fellow with a twelve-jointed rattle. The other was just her own age.
"""To be sure I will,"" she cried, and the pits between her nostrils and her ears looked more like dimples than ever. ""Only you must wait until I can make up my mind which one to marry."""
"""Oh, no,"" they answered, ""don't go to all that trouble. We will fight and decide it for you."""
"It was a long fight, and the older of the two Snakes had a couple of joints broken off from his rattle before it was over. Still he beat the other one and drove him away. When he came back for his bride he found her crying. ""What is the matter?"" said he, quite sternly."
"""Oh, that p-poor other b-bachelor!"" she sobbed. ""I b-believe I will g-go after him. I think p-perhaps I l-love him the b-better."""
"""No, you don't, Mrs. Rattlesnake,"" said the fine old fellow who had just won the fight. ""You will do no such thing. You will marry me and never speak to him again. When I have lost two joints of my rattle in fighting for you, I intend to have you myself, and I say that you love me very dearly. Do you hear?"""
"""Yes, darling,"" she answered, as she wiped her eyes on the grass, ""very dearly."" And they lived most happily together."
"""He reminds me so much of the first Mr. Rattlesnake,"" she said to her friends. ""So strong, so firm, so quick to decide!"""
"The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Mrs. Goldfinch did not dare leave her nest to make calls, lest the cold raindrops should chill and hurt the four tiny birds that lay curled up in their shells."
"At last the weather was warm and sunshiny, and Mrs. Goldfinch and some of her bird neighbors went to call on Mrs. Mourning Dove. They found her just coming from a wheat-field, where she had been to get grain. ""Oh, you poor creature!"" they cried. ""We have heard all about it. Your poor babies! How sorry we are for you!"""
"Mrs. Mourning Dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. ""What do you mean?"" she cooed. ""My babies are well and doing finely. Won't you come to see them?"""
"Then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. ""Why,"" they chirped, ""we heard that your eggs had fallen through your nest and had broken and killed the tiny Dove babies inside. Is it true?"""
"""Not a word of it,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove. ""The nest is all right, and the eggs were not broken until my two little darlings broke them with their sharp beaks."""
"""Here they are,"" she added, fondly. ""Did you ever see such pretty ones?"
"See him open his bill, the dear! And did you ever see such a neck as she has? Mr. Mourning Dove thinks there never were such children."""
"""But do you feel perfectly safe to leave them in that nest?"" asked the Oriole politely. ""My babies are so restless that I should be afraid to trust them in it."""
"""That is what people always say,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove, with a happy coo, ""and I fear that I am a rather poor housekeeper, but it runs in our family. Mr. Mourning Dove and I have raised many pairs of children, and they never rolled out, or tumbled through, or blew away, and I do not worry about these. I shall never be thrifty like you good builders, perhaps, but I'm sure you cannot love your little ones any more than I do mine. It was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard I was in trouble. I think I have the best neighbors in the world."""
"When her callers went away, they could not say enough about Mrs."
"Mourning Dove's pleasant ways, and her gentle, well-behaved children."
"""It is too bad she is such a poor nest-maker,"" the Vireo said, ""and I understand now what she meant when she told me that they sometimes used old Robins' nests for their young. She said they flattened them out and added a few twigs, and that they did finely. I thought it very queer in them to do so, but perhaps if I had not been a good builder I should have done the same thing."""
"""Perhaps we all would,"" the others agreed. ""She certainly is a very pleasant bird, and she is bringing up her children well. Mr. Mourning Dove seems to think her perfect. We won't worry any more about her."""
THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID
Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a very brave family. That is the best thing that you can say about them.
"To be sure, they dress very handsomely, and there is no prettier sight, on a fine winter morning, than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from branch to branch, dining off the acorns on the oak trees, and cocking their crested heads on one side as they look over the country. They are great talkers then, and are always telling each other just what to do; yet none of them ever do what they are told to, so they might just as well stop giving advice."
"The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all, and if one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out. This always has been so, and it always will be so. If it could be winter all the time, the Blue Jays could be liked well enough, for in cold weather they eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others. It is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. Then they live in the thickest part of the woods and raise families of tiny, fuzzy babies in their great coarse nests. It is then, too, that they change their beautiful coats, and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are growing they are not at all pretty. Oh, then is the time to beware of the Blue Jays!"
"They do very little talking during the summer, and the forest people do not know when they are coming, unless they see a flutter of blue wings among the branches. The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then."
"They are doing sly things, and they do not want to be found out."
The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food.
"Father and Mother Blue Jay spend all their time in marketing, and they are not content with seeds and berries. They visit the nests of their bird neighbors, and then something very sad happens. When the Blue Jays go to a nest there may be four eggs in it; but when they go away there will not be any left, nothing but pieces of broken egg-shell. It is very, very sad, but this is another of the things which will always be so, and all that the other birds can do is to watch and drive the Jays away."
"There was once a young Blue Jay in the forest who was larger than his brothers and sisters, and kept crowding them toward the edge of the nest. When their father came with a bit of food for them, he would stretch his legs and flutter his wings and reach up for the first bite."
"And because he was the largest and the strongest, he usually got it."
"Sometimes, too, the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. He was a very greedy fellow, and he had no right to take more than his share, just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell, or because he grew fast."
"This same young Blue Jay used to brag about what he would do when he got out of the nest, and his mother told him that he would get into trouble if he were not careful. She said that even Blue Jays had to look out for danger."
"""Huh!"" said the young Blue Jay; ""who's afraid?"""
"""Now you talk like a bully,"" said Mother Blue Jay, ""for people who are really brave are always willing to be careful."""
"But the young Blue Jay only crowded his brothers and sisters more than usual, and thought, inside his foolish little pin-feathery head, that when he got a chance, he'd show them what courage was."
"After a while his chance came. All the small birds had learned to flutter from branch to branch, and to hop quite briskly over the ground."
"One afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. The father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them; but the foolish young Blue Jay wanted a chance to go alone, so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead, and then he started off another way. It was great fun for a time, and when the feathered folk looked down at him he raised his crest higher than ever and thought how he would scare them when he was a little older."
"The young Blue Jay was just thinking about this when he saw something long and shining lying in the pathway ahead. He remembered what his father had said about snakes, and about one kind that wore rattles on their tails. He wondered if this one had a rattle, and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. ""I am a Blue Jay,"" he said to himself, ""and I was never yet afraid of anything."""
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words. “But what didst thou say to the church-door?” “To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words."
“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”
"“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.” “I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.” He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?” “I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.” “Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.” She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. “Thou art the true bride,” said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.” When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.” She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.” Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“Kling, klang, gloria."
Who sits within this tower?
"A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced."
"Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"
The Lion and the Crane
The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.
"The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, ""What ails thee, friend?"" He told him why. ""I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me."" ""Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat thee; only save my life."" ""Very well,"" says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, ""Who knows what this fellow will do,"" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking ""I will sound him,"" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:"
"""A service have we done thee       To the best of our ability,     King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!"
"What return shall we get from thee?"""
In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:
"""As I feed on blood,       And always hunt for prey,     'Tis much that thou art still alive       Having once been between my teeth."""
Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:
"""Ungrateful, doing no good,       Not doing as he would be done by,     In him there is no gratitude,       To serve him is useless."
"""His friendship is not won       By the clearest good deed."
"Better softly withdraw from him,       Neither envying nor abusing."""
And having thus spoken the crane flew away.
"And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: ""Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself."""
"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....

FULLARTON automatically gazing at CLARE while he talks with

MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course--the only thing is that----

CLARE.  Haggle?  [She shakes her head]  What have I got to make terms

"CLARE.  No, Dolly; even you don't understand.  All day and every day"
"--just as far apart as we can be--and still--Jolly, isn't it?  If"
you've got a soul at all.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  It's awful, really."

"eye in the wood, and Norburn followed her. Not knowing whether to be"
"glad or sorry, she made no effort to escape, and was silent while"
Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man
was dead.
"""It's at the prospect of being a free man to-morrow,"" he answered, with"
"a smile. ""You know, Cincinnatus was very happy."""
"""But you're not like that."""
"""No, I suppose not. Say it's----"""
"""Never mind."""
After a pause she made another attempt.

Both foot and hand go cold:

REQUIES.
O IS it death or life
That sounds like something strangely known
"In this subsiding out of strife,"
This slow sea-monotone?
"A sound, scarce heard through sleep,"
Murmurous as the August bees
That fill the forest hollows deep
About the roots of trees.
"O is it life or death,"
"O is it hope or memory,"
That quiets all things with this breath
Of the eternal sea?

"Crane thing, I'm sure you realized that our talk was ... well, the words"
were put into my mouth. I felt the same way about the oaf as you did.
"But sometimes, in the line of duty, old man ... well, I know you were"

"""I'm pretty good at that."""
"""I knew we understood each other."""
"""Is that what you called about?"""
"""Yes, but I've got a little tip for you. They want to see you upstairs."

"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"""He'll take offense,"" the lawyer murmured, considering the matter."
But Solem urged him on:
"""I don't think so. Anyhow, you were the first one to talk about it."""
"""Everybody here will know, and I'll be prevented,"" said the lawyer."
"""We can go at dawn,"" said Solem."
In the end they came to an agreement.
"""You won't tell anyone?"" the lawyer said to me."
*       *       *       *       *
The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"
"climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street, and out into the"
night.
Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.
It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.
"Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below him,"
blinking her thousand eyes....
He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?
"insects.  Each of these bright frail, growing things had life and"
individuality like herself!
The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"
"""I came to see Gustav.  He's not up yet, it seems.  I thought I would"
"speak to you first.  Can we talk?"""
"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"
"""Of course!  Here?  Or in the drawing-room?"""
Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""
"A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated"
herself where she could see Betty and the baby.  Rosek stood looking down
"at her; his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his"
spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
"""What is it?"" she said."
"""Bad business, I'm afraid.  Something must be done at once.  I have been"
"trying to arrange things, but they will not wait.  They are even"
"threatening to sell up this house."""
"With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:"
"Under our feet as we walked in the night,"
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze
In the magical light;
"And the moon was a silver fire,"
"And the stars were flickers of flame,"
Golden and violet and red;
"And the night-wind sighed my desire,"
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said
In her ear her adorable name.
"But her heart would not hear what I heard,"
"The pulse of the night as it beat,"
"Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,"
In its murmurous repeat;
"She heard not the night-wind’s sigh,"
"Nor her own name breathed in her ear,"
"Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,"
"A speechless, a clamorous cry:"
“Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?”
"O heart, she will hear, by and by,"
"When we part, when for ever we part."

"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—
"and a little below the forty-five latitude ring?"""
"""Yes."""
It was a small round disc no more than an inch in diameter.
"""We think that may be a response."""
"Wilson said, ""You mean a target? Possibly one of the lifeships?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I'll have a scooter go out and see. What's its spacial position?"""
"The tech took another look. ""I'd say eighty-one plus longitude and"
"forty-three latitude."""
"""From what?"" demanded Wilson."
"""From ship's axis, sir."""
"""Distance?"""
"""Oh, about half a parsec."""
"Wilson groaned. ""Haven't you determined any spacial attitude?"""
"""Attitude, sir?"""
"""The angle of the ship's axis with respect to the stellar positions."
So you've a blotch out there at half a parsec. It's an inch or so in
diameter. Have one of your juniors run off some trig on the calculator

"tensed at first, but relaxed almost immediately because the warmth of"
"that honest affection made her feel less alone and cold, in the depths"
"of uncharted space. Some of the worry and concern was erased, at least."
She stretched warmly as he rubbed her forehead with his cheek.
Then he sat up and looked down at her. He put his hand on her cheek
"gently and said, ""We'll be all right, kid."""
"""Eight days,"" she said in a hoarse whisper."
"He nodded solemnly. ""Every hour means they must be coming closer and"

"“I heard the thrush,” replied John. “He said, 'Any old thing! Any old"
thing!' ”
He mimicked the bird's note. Stella laughed. “That's just what he
said--as though a sea in a land of death or the English Channel was all
the same to him. I suppose it was.”
"“It must be good to be a thrush,” said Risca. “There 's a _je m'en"

“Where did you learn that?”

There was a silence; then the little voice in the rug called out:
"""Say, what's your name?"""
"""Dick,"" whispered the man behind the curtains."
"""So long, Dick!"" drowsily."
"""So long, Girl!"" dreamily."
"There was a brief silence; then, of a sudden, the Girl bolted upright in"

There was no mistaking then--no need to contrast her feeling of anxiety
of a few moments ago lest some other woman had preceded her in his

Sir Gilders Persimmon shuffled into the room; and Pangbutt went to meet
the old baronet.
"“Lady Persimmon coming to-night, Sir Gilders?” he shouted into his ear;"
the old man shook his head.
"“Sorry,” bawled Pangbutt into his ear; “Sir Gilders, allow me to"
"introduce Mr. Fosse, who, I need not tell you, is the well-known"
critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is to
appear in a few days--you must win his favour to your poems.”
The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:
“Eh?” said he--“borrow? Why borrow?”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” cried Fosse, getting very hot--“I did not say"
borrow--I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.”

The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.

"And as the ""old man"" was engaged in keeping his balance, he made no"

"""Quite so,"" nodded Kilshaw."
"""And this."""
"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"
"lines, briefly recording that Mrs. Benyon had left her home secretly by"
"night, in her husband's absence, and could not be found."
Kilshaw nodded again.
"""It doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""I knew all this. I was in Mr."
"Benyon's confidence."""
"""Perhaps you can tell us how he lived?"" hazarded the Superintendent,"
with a shrewd look.
Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.
"""The inquest is fixed for to-morrow. The more we know now, the less it"
"will be necessary to protract it."""
"""I have been helping him lately,"" admitted Kilshaw; and he added, ""Look"

"necessary."""

"The monk waited until the waiter was gone, and then said in a hard"
voice:
“His Eminence the Cardinal sent me to bid you not to present yourself
"anywhere again, giving his name.”"
"“What? What does this mean?” asked Cæsar, calmly."
“It means that His Eminence has found out about your intrigues and
machinations.”
“Intrigues? What intrigues were those?”
“You know perfectly well. And His Eminence forbids you to continue in
that direction.”
“His Eminence forbids me to pay calls? And for what reason?”
“Because you have used his name to introduce yourself into certain
places.”
“It is not true.”
“You have told people you went to that you are Cardinal Fort’s nephew.”
"“And I am not?” asked Cæsar, after taking a swallow of coffee."
"“You are trying to make use of the relationship, we don’t know with what"
end in view.”

“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably

In fact she could not have been very familiar with it for it took
"several minutes before she returned. Meanwhile, Kennedy, who had been"

“No.”
“They are worth looking at.”
Cæsar contemplated the central obelisk. It is set on top of a rock
"hollowed out like a cavern, in the mouth of which a lion is seen."
Afterwards they looked at the fountains at the ends of the square.
"“The sculptures are by Bernini,” explained Kennedy. “Bernini belonged to"
"an epoch that has been very much abused by the critics, but nowadays he"
is much praised. He enchants me.”

"although each had expectation in his eye, none looked overjoyed to see"

Rippley laughed:

all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:

And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"
question.
"""Senator, have you gotten any reaction from the people of your state on"
"the revelations contained in your speech?"""
"""There has been very little time, but telegrams have been pouring in."""
"""What is the reaction?"""
He came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it
on the after capstan.
"""I guess I'll have a boy,"" said Jones.  ""'Ere, you scum, send me"
"Billy.""  And Billy came aft."
"""I releases you temp'ry without bail,"" said the skipper fiercely, ""so"

When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the
"hill, followed by the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He"
"found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the crest, and heard them talk."
"""Say, Johnny French,"" said old Jones, ""if you wants war, prepare for"
"peace.  Who's the captain?"""
"""Sapristi!"" said the French captain."
Jones nodded.
"""Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault, if relyin' on the"
discretion of ambassadors ain't a fault: and maybe you can swaller
the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in.  And is your

"""Nom de Dieu----"" began the Frenchman, but Jones waved his hand with"
dignity.
"""Call yourself what you like, but 'ave you got anythin' in the way of"
"a marlinspike or a splice bar as'll open this yer case?"""
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"""For me?"""
"""For you and every one. I have hurt so many. It has all been my fault."
I would give ten lives if I had them to see the harm undone. But that

The hand within her own tightened in its clasp.
"""Is it ever helpless, though?"""
"""I can't give the dead life--I can't give back a man's faith, can I?"""
The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""
"""Yes, I see you do. Do you despise me? What does it matter if you do?"
It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.
"Lois, I couldn't help hearing what Captain Nicholson said to you. It"
explained what you said to me about building on the ruins of the past.
That was what he did--he built a beautiful palace on me--and I wrecked

"""Have you really failed him?"""

"White flashes dance along the deep,"

It turned in an unquiet sleep.

The buffets of the sea’s wild play.

The sails that fly before the squall.

BRIGHT light to windward on the horizon’s verge;

A vast unfurrowed field of windless green;
The stormy shadows flicker on the track
Of phantom sails that vanish and emerge.

"ROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate."
Born 1682. Died 1722.
If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the
number of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should
"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"
"""Charmed to see you in London, _mon confrère_,"" said he. ""Have you yet"
"discovered your man?"""
"""I am hard at his heels,"" the detective answered, his eyes searching"

"But Slyne's expression was one of ingenuous simplicity. He bowed, as if"
with deep respect.
"""I caught a glimpse of some one most amazingly like myself, one day on"
"the Faubourg St. Honoré, as I was passing through Paris,"" he mentioned"
reflectively.
"""Thanks,"" returned Dubois. ""It was he, no doubt. And--he's in London"
"now."""
"Slyne did not wince, even at that."
"""He was dining at the Savoy to-night,"" said Dubois indifferently. ""How"
"does your own affair progress?"""
"""_Assez bien_,"" Slyne answered in an even voice. ""I have followed my"
"quarry home and am awaiting developments."""
"""You will be in London for a little, then?"""
"""For the next week or ten days, I expect,"" Slyne lied with perfect"
aplomb.
"""We shall meet again, in that case,"" declared the detective, glancing at"
"Sallie; and, ""_Au plaisir de vous revoir, monsieur_,"" Slyne returned"
"""How about covering the door? I think it's time we got down to business"

"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."

"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""
"""Fine."" Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief. ""We'd like to do a"

Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"

Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"

Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:

"The duke paused a moment, as if endeavoring to bring order into the"

there was something about the latter's personality which he could not
reconcile with his previous acquaintance.
At last Francesco's worldly habit flashed upon him.
"""What of the Cross?"" he flashed abruptly."
"""There is blood upon it!"" retorted Francesco."

to prevent further lapse.” And he seated himself on the other side of
Jessica and glared defiantly at Boswell.
“Mr. Severance and Mr. Dedham!”
"Severance entered hurriedly. “I am so glad to hear—ah, Boswell! Trent!”"
“How odd that you should all find your way here the very first evening
of your arrival!” And Jessica held out her hand with a placid smile.
"Miss Decker was more nervous, but five seasons were behind her. “Ah!”"

reunion!”
“Charming beyond expression!” said Severance.

"to get ashore at about ten o'clock, they discussed the question as to"
whether the Crozets were English or not.  It was settled by old
Mackenzie.

"_Of ""Miss Billy"" the critics have written as follows:_"

"""Stop press--Latest news and appointments,"" he read. ""The Admiralty"
has approved of the following transfer. From R.N.R. to R.N.:
"Lieutenant Terence Aubyn, to date 3rd of June, 1915."""
For a moment Terence looked incredulously at the torpedo-lieutenant.
"""Torps,"" he knew, was fond of a practical joke, but if he were"
playing a prank it was carrying the game a little too far.
"""Here you are,"" continued Oswestry, noting the expression on"
"Terence's face. ""Read it for yourself."""
"""It's worth getting this,"" said Aubyn, indicating the position of his"
"wound. ""All I want now is to be afloat again."""

"worry--you'll have a look-in before The Day comes. By Jove, Aubyn,"

"fête----"""
The crunching of boots upon the gravel path caused both officers to
turn. Standing at attention was a Marine orderly; behind him a
telegraph boy.
"""Congratulations pouring in already,"" remarked ""Torps."""
Terence took the buff envelope and opened it.
"""Great Scott!"" he exclaimed brokenly, and without another word he"
handed the telegram to his companion.
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
"ONE little cab to hold us two,"
"Night, an invisible dome of cloud,"
"The rattling wheels that made our whispers loud,"
As heart-beats into whispers grew;
"And, long, the Embankment with its lights,"
"The pavement glittering with fallen rain,"
"The magic and the mystery that are night’s,"
And human love without the pain.
"The river shook with wavering gleams,"
Deep buried as the glooms that lay
"Impenetrable as the grave of day,"
Near and as distant as our dreams.
A bright train flashed with all its squares
Of warm light where the bridge lay mistily.
"The night was all about us: we were free,"
Free of the day and all its cares!
"That was an hour of bliss too long,"
Too long to last where joy is brief.
Yet one escape of souls may yield relief
To many weary seasons’ wrong.
“O last for ever!” my heart cried;
It ended: heaven was done.
I had been dreaming by her side
That heaven was but begun.

There was a titter.
“Sharles ze Foorst--risen from ze dead!” announced Rippley.
“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"
beginning to move at last. This _is_ going to be a unique night.”
“Hush!”
"They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon the room."
"Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He roused:"
"“Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the guests"
arriving--all the clever fellows that have made the world a
delight--and with them come the dear dead companions that worked with
"us, and sang with us, and drank with us--in Paris.... I know them--they"

"""Come, come!"" the father said. ""I've got to go to Scotland, just a short"
"trip. And when you come home from the mountains, I'll be there, too."""
"""Scotland? What are you going to Scotland for?"" the children asked."
He twisted round and nodded to us.
"""These women! All curiosity!"" he said."
But none of his family laughed.
He continued to us:
"""I was telling my wife a story about a rich man who was curious, too. He"
"shot himself just to find out what comes after death. Ha, ha, ha! That's"
"the height of curiosity, isn't it? Shooting yourself to find out what"

"“Because I remember that I must die, and then I shall not come back"
"to see Rome. She will be here still, century after century, full of"

“And your religion?”

“Yes. Do you like that type?”
“She has a lot of character. She looks like one of the women that would

He left the matron and darted back into the room.
"“I'm sure there must be something you would like me to bring you,” he"
whispered. “Don't be afraid. Any mortal thing.”
The child's lips twitched and she looked nervously from side to side.
“What is it? Tell me.”
"“Oh, sir,” she pleaded breathlessly, “might I have some peppermint"
bull's-eyes.”
"When Herold returned to his dressing-room after the first act,--the"
piece for which he had been rehearsing had started a successful
"career,--he found Risca sitting in a straight-backed chair and smoking a"
pipe.
"“Hallo, John! I did n't know you were in front. Why did n't you tell me?"
"It's going splendidly, is n't it?”"
He glowed with the actor's excited delight in an audience's enthusiastic
"reception of a new play. His glow sat rather oddly upon him, for he was"
"made up as a decrepit old man, with bald wig, and heavy, blue patches"
beneath his eyes.
"“No, I'm not in front,” said John."
"“I see now,” smiled Herold, glancing at his friend's loose tweed suit."
No clothes morning or evening ever fitted Risca. Herold called him “The
Tailors' Terror.”

"“By Pegasus?” sneered Aubrey, raising ironic eyebrows."
Lovegood laughed:
"“No--by omnibus,” said he. “Let us all be winged asses to-night. Fosse"
has not secured a government monopoly.”...
From the great doorway:
“Mistair and Mrs. Nezzerbie Gomme!” announced Rippley; and as the pair
"were greeted by all near them, Rippley stepped to the head of the great"
"stairs, and going up to a pompous man as that worthy set foot on the"
"topmost step, he said to him confidentially:"
"“I say, mister, would you mind running down the stairs and telling the"
fellar with the red hair that I want him?”
Sir Tankerton Wollup swelled slowly:
"“Pooh--pooh!” said he, drawing himself up; and he strutted to the door."
“Poof--poof!” said Rippley. “Giddy old thing!”
"He glanced over the balustrade down to the next landing, and caught"
Doome’s eye:
“Beelzebub!” he growled--“the whole town’s coming to this silly
"theatrical affair.... I say, we ought to go and see that Andrew"
Blotte’s mixing the hats thoroughly. Hullo! There’s Anthony Baddlesmere
"just arrived. Wait, I’ll come down. I want to see him.”"
"overlooking any bets, but I do admit that Miss Hemingway is a bit more"
"important to me than any of the rest."""
"""No, I suppose no one could blame you for that. Just keep it up,"
"Wilson."""
"""Sure,"" Ted said wearily. ""After all, this is a black and white job I'm"
"on. Either we'll be successful--or we won't."""
"""Luck."""
"""Spaceman's luck, Admiral."""
Wilson went back to his brooding....
Charles Andrews came back into the salon with a brisk air. He
"flexed his arms, took a deep breath, and mopped his forehead with a"
handkerchief. He sat down beside Alice and smiled at her warmly.
"""That thing is a wonder worker,"" he said, breathing deeply. ""Nothing"
"like exercise to make a man feel fine and fit."""
"Alice looked up at him with some amusement. ""Mr. Andrews, tell me. Are"
you the kind of man who opens the window on a winter morning about six
"o'clock, and takes deep lungsful of icy air?"""
"""Not quite that bad, my dear. Not quite. But brisk living does keep a"
man sharp and hard. I daresay I acquitted myself well on that pedal
"generator despite my fifty years."""
"""No doubt."""
"""I don't borrow."""
"""Ingeborg!"" said he, pretending playfully to whimper."
"""What is it?"""
"""Nothing. Can't I say 'Ingeborg' to my own wife?"""
"""I'm not your own wife,"" she said, getting up."
"""Pish! We were man and wife last night. It says so in the visitors' book."""
"She was silent at this. Yes, last night they had been man and wife; that"
"was to save getting two rooms, and travel economically. But she had been"
very foolish to agree to it.
"""'Miss Torsen,' then?"" he whimpered."
"And to put an end to the game, she paid for both of them and took her"
knapsack on her back.
They walked again. At the next stop she paid for them both without
"discussion--for the evening meal, for bed and breakfast. It grew to be a"
habit. They walked on once more. They reached the end of the valley by the
"sea, and here she revolted again."
"""Go away--go on by yourself; I don't want you in my room any more!"""
The old argument no longer held good. When he repeated that they saved
"money by it, she replied that she for her part required no more than one"
"room, and was quite able to pay for it. He joked again, whimpered,"
"""Ingeborg!"" and left her. He was beaten, and his back was bent."
"Suddenly he flung in upon us with a great noise, his colour high, his"
eyes glittering. His first action was to throw his feathered hat on
"one chair, and himself into another."
'I've seen him!' he said. 'Himmel! he is a clever fellow. He will
"worst you, cousin, yet--see if he does not. Oh, he is a clever one!'"
"'Who?' my lady said, looking at him in some displeasure."
"'Who? Tzerclas, to be sure!' he answered, chuckling."
"'You have seen him!' she exclaimed, rising."
"'Of course I have!' he answered. 'And you will see him too, one of"
these days.'
"My lady looked at me, frowning. But I shook my head. He was not drunk."
"'Where?' she asked, after a pause. 'Where did you see him, Rupert?'"
"'In the street--where you see other men,' he answered, chuckling"
"again. 'He should not be there, but who is to keep him out? He is too"
"clever. He will get his way in the end, see if he does not!'"
"'Rupert!' my lady cried in wrathful amazement, 'to hear you, one would"
suppose you admired him.'
"'So I do,' he replied coolly. 'Why not? He has all the wits of the"
"family. He is as cunning as the devil. Take a hint, cousin; put"
yourself on the right side. He will win in the end!' And the Waldgrave
"rose restlessly from his chair, and, going to the window, began to"
whistle.
"""I don't know. I'm not a spaceman, responsible for the lives of three"
"people--at a hundred clams an hour."""
"""Some day I'm going to shove those hundred fish down your throat."""
"""Do. And I'll spit 'em back at you!"""
Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.
"""I'm not afraid to work,"" he said in a hollow voice."
"""Prove it,"" she replied flatly."
"He got up, left her there, and went below."

Wilson sat in the Information Center and eyed the search grid glumly.
"It stretched stereoscopically out in the room, a lot of its vacant"
"network of gleaming white lines frosted over with white shading, to"
mark where the search had covered.

a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
"""--what?"" fell from the Girl's lips, her face pale and set."
"""Are you deaf?"" demanded Rance; and then, emphasising every word, he"
"rasped out: ""The fellow you've been polkying with is the man that has"
"been asking people to hold up their hands."""
"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:
"""You don't believe it yet, eh?"""
"""No, I don't believe it yet!"" rapped out the Girl, laying great stress"
"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""
"""That's what gits me,"" fretted Sonora. ""He didn't."""
"""I should think it would git you,"" snapped back the Girl, both in her"
look and voice rebuking him for his words.
It was left to Ashby to spring another surprise.

handled casually.
Wednesday 10:30 A.M.
"An armoured van with V.C.S., Ltd. lettered on its side pulled up to the"
black marble front of Moscow Narodny Bank's financial trading branch on
Saint Swithins Lane. Everything was on schedule.
"""They're here."" Eva was watching from the narrow window. Saint Swithins"
"Lane down below, virtually an alley, was so narrow it could accommodate"
"only one vehicle at a time. Across was Banque Worms, its unicorn"
"insignia staring out, its lobby chandeliers glowing. Nobody there even"
bothered to notice. Just another armored truck interrupting the view.
Then three blue-uniformed guards emerged from the cab and approached
"the rear doors from both sides, .38's in unsnapped holsters."
"""Mr. Vance, they had better have the money, all of it."" Vera stepped"
over to the window and followed Eva's gaze down.
"""It'll be there."""
"""For your sake I hope so,"" she replied as she turned back."
"""Just hang around and watch,"" Vance said."
"Just one more day, he told himself. One more lousy day. We'll have"
not nearly so good as we thought it. The illusion is the sweet thing.
Don’t break the butterfly.
Tell him also that both of you have much of my heart.
"Yours,"
NOLL.
P.S.--I am tired of myself. I am off to find Betty.”
Noll sealed the letter and wrote a third--to the concierge:
"“MADAME,"
I am called away to England. Mademoiselle Madelaine Le Trouvé has
been good enough to take charge of the rooms until madame and
myself return. Pray give the enclosed to your little ones ‘from the
Englishman who knows how to laugh.’
"Agréez, etc.,"
OLIVER BADDLESMERE.”
"He stole to where Madelaine slept, and on the chair by her bed he put"
her letter and some banknotes.
"He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his large"
"leather kit-bag, and carried it to where the candle gave light. From"
"the walls he took down the portraits of Betty and one or two trinkets,"
and very carefully wrapped them up. They too went into the bag.
"over it, and charging on and on and on through the darkness."
"To the foot of the hill and across the bottom, and up the opposite"
"slope. I do not know how far we had sped, when Steve's voice was"
"heard, calling on us to halt."
"'Pull up! pull up!' he cried, with an angry oath. 'It is a false"
alarm! What fool set it going? There is no one behind us. Donner und
Blitzen! where is Martin?'
"The horses were beginning to flag, and gladly came to a trot, and then"
to a walk.
'Here! I panted.
"'Himmel! I thought we had ridden you down!' he said, leaving my lady's"
side. His voice shook with passion and loss of breath. 'Who was it? We
"might all have broken our necks, and for nothing!'"
The Waldgrave--it was his stirrup I had caught--turned his horse
round. 'I heard them--close behind us!' he panted. There was a note of
"wildness in his voice. My elbow was against his knee, and I felt him"
tremble.
"'A bird in the hedge,' Steve said rudely. 'It has cost some one dear."
Whose horse was it struck him?'
No one answered. I left the Waldgrave's side and went back a few
"paces. The women were sobbing. Ernst and Jacob stood by them,"
breathing hard after their run. I thought the men's silence strange. I
looked again. There was a figure missing; a horse missing.

"He returned on board the wreck of the _Potluck_, and in company with"
"a bottle of brandy strove with the situation, while the crowd and"
"their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons."

"""But they seems to be a good many more of 'em than us,"" suggested the"
crowd.
"""Come to that,"" said Hart, ""it's the on'y just ground we 'as to go"
"for 'em.  For if they was on'y ekal numbers, it'd be cowardly to"
"whack 'em, and I for one would be on the side of just goin' down"

"The ""old man"" staggered up with a sheet of paper in his hand."
"""Have you done it, sir?"" asked Simcox.  ""Let's hear it."""
"""Yes, read it out,"" said Lampert, with half a sneer, which the"
skipper did not notice.
The crowd gathered round as the captain squatted on a rock.
"""On board the British barque _Potluck_, belonging to the British port"
"Liverpool; owners, McWattie & Co.; Captain Abednego Jones."
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir----"""
"""Never!"""
Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""you think!  No, that is impossible!""  He walked twice"
"very quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said"
"sharply: ""Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work."""
Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
"""Nice old chap!"""
"At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid.  Going to do the"
"music-room that morning, she had ""found the master sitting on the sofa,"
"holding his head, and groaning awful.  He's not been at home, ma'am,"
"since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do.  I ran"
"for cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am,"
"I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and"
he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
"go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am.  So I didn't know what to do."""
"Gyp, pale to the lips, said:"
"""Wait here a minute, Ellen,"" and went into the dining-room.  Winton"
"followed.  She turned to him at once, and said:"
"""Oh, Dad, what am I to do?  His brain!  It would be too awful to feel I'd"
"brought that about."""
Winton grunted.  Gyp went on:
"""I must go and see.  If it's really that, I couldn't bear it.  I'm afraid"
"""You needn't believe _me_,"" he answered her. ""Ask Mr. Jobling. He'll"
"tell you."""
"Mr. Jobling coughed importantly. ""I'll tell you all I know myself, Lady"
"Josceline,"" he promised her, and proceeded to repeat in part what he had"
"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"
"long."""
Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.
"""And before that--?"" he suggested, politely patient."
"""Before that she was--what she still is so far's I'm concerned--Saleh"
"Harez, my adopted daughter."""
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his
"room, I know."""
"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""
"""In case,"" Kilshaw read, ""of my death or disappearance, please deliver"
"this parcel to Mr. Kilshaw, Legislative Assembly, Kirton."""
"""I'm sorry to say, sir,"" said the Superintendent, ""that the detective"
sergeant conducting the search took upon him to open this packet in the
presence of one or two persons. It ought to have been opened by no one
"but----"""
"""Myself."""
"""Pardon me, but myself,"" said the Superintendent, with a slight smile."
"""Owing to the inexcusable blunder, I'm afraid something about what it"
"contains may leak out prematurely. Those pests, the reporters, are"
"everywhere; you can't keep 'em out."""
"""Well, what does it contain?"" asked Kilshaw. He was annoyed at this"
"unsought publicity, but he saw at once that he must show no sign of"
vexation.
"""That, for one thing,"" and the Superintendent handed Kilshaw a"
"photograph of two persons, a young woman and a young man. ""Look at the"
"back,"" he added."
"Kilshaw looked, and read--""My wife and M."""
"""That's the deceased's handwriting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And you know the persons?"""
"""I've no doubt about them. It's the Premier--and--and Mrs. Medland."""
Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
"Next instant he was sprawling on the floor, with Dex rolling"
"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"
thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.
*       *       *       *       *
"The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled"
"helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex"
gazed at each other.
"""What the hell?"" said Dex."
"He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of"
"moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the"
control room.
"""Say!"" he sputtered, rubbing his head. ""Say, what _is_ this?"""
"Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the"
"atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. ""God knows what it"
"is,"" he said with a shrug. ""Somehow, with our passing into the red"
"area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all."""
"""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's"
"gravity?"""
"Again Brand shrugged. ""I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as"
"mine."""
"He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."
"for the disapprobation of the Kirton mob, they held that in high scorn."
"""They'd cheer burglary, if Medland did it,"" said one."
"""Well, he wants to, pretty nearly,"" added a capitalist."
"""But the country will take a very different view. Puttock'll rub it into"
"all his people: _they_'ll not vote for him. What do you say, Coxon?"""
"""I think we shall beat him badly,"" said that gentleman, as he rose and"
went out.
"Captain Heseltine soon followed, and was surprised to see Coxon's figure"

"""Hang the fellow! What does he want here?"" asked the Captain."
"Mr. Coxon asked for Lady Eynesford. When he entered, she rose with a"
newspaper in her hand.
"""What a shocking, shameful thing this is!"" she said. ""What a blessing it"
"is that the Government was beaten!"""
Coxon acquiesced in both these opinions.
"""I never thought well of him,"" continued the lady. ""Now everybody sees"
him in his true colours. And it's you we have chiefly to thank for our

"Coxon murmured a modest depreciation of his services, and said,"

"Here lost and gone poor Robin lies,"
"He trembles, lingers, falls and dies."
"He's gone, he's gone, forever lost,"
No more of him they now can boast.
"Poor Robin's dangers all are past,"
He struggled to the very last.
"Perhaps he spent a happy Life,"
Without much struggle and much strife.

The prolonged gloom of the main theme is somewhat lightened by the
speculative optimism of the last verse.
"Life, transient Life, is but a dream,"
Like Sleep which short doth lengthened seem
"Till dawn of day, when the bird's lay"
Doth charm the soul's first peeping gleam.
"Then farewell to the parting year,"
Another's come to Nature dear.
"In every place, thy brightening face"
Does welcome winter's snowy drear.
Alas! our time is much mis-spent.

For we on Wisdom should be bent.

“Good.”
"They saw the model of an ancient galley which was in the same hall, and"
went out through the church into the garden planned by Piranesi.
"The woman showed them a very old palm, with a hole in it made by a"
hand-grenade in the year ‘49. It had remained that way more than half
"a century, and it was only a few days since the trunk of the palm had"
broken.
"From the garden they went, by a path between trees, to the bastion of"

of a beautiful spring sunshine....
"XVIII. CÆSAR BORGIA’S MOTTO, “AUT CÆSAR, AUT NIHIL”"
_THE BORGIAS_
The next day was one of the days for visiting the Borgia Apartment.
"Cæsar and Kennedy met in the Piazza di San Pietro, went into the"
"Vatican museum, and walked by a series of stairs and passageways to the"
Gallery of Inscriptions.
"Then they went down to a hall, at whose door there were guards dressed"

"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the
orders cutting you down--a matter of routine--I had to follow through.
"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"

"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"
"sprayed charm through the phone like perfume from an atomizer. ""But if"

"""Oh, I wouldn't think of quoting you, old man,"" Taber replied in a"
kindly voice and put down the phone.
He sat back and closed his eyes. Three people dead. One person maimed.
Blood in the streets.
Good job well done.
“Poor great men!” exclaimed Cæsar. “Their statues serve only to
"decorate a public garden.” “They had their lives,” replied Laura, gaily;"
“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the
horizon; on the Janiculum the statue of Garibaldi rose up gallantly into
"the air, like a bird ready to take wing."
"“When I look at Rome this way,” murmured Laura, “I feel a pang, a pang"
of grief.”

told him that she knew already.

Born in 1716 at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. Sent while quite young to

age of 14 was taken from school and apprenticed to a breeches-maker. No

It was all so confused that I do not know how it happened. I think it
was Muller who opened the safe.
"“There is the new yellow bag,” cried Moulton, “from Schloss’ own safe."
Open it.”
"McLear had taken it. He did so. There sparkled not the real gems, but"
the replica.
"“The devil!” Moulton exclaimed, breaking from Winters and seizing the"
old bag.
He tore it open and—it was empty.
"“One moment,” interrupted Kennedy, looking up quietly from the counter."
"“Seal that safe again, McLear. In it are the Schloss jewels and the"
products of half a dozen other robberies which the dupe Muller—or

THE GERM LETTER
“Did you know that this man was alive when you married me?” he asked in

"“No,” cried Yvonne. “How could I have married you? I thought he had been"
dead nearly three years.”
“What proofs did you have of his death?”
"“A friend sent me a number of the Figaro, with the announcement.”"
“Was that all?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne."
"“Do you mean to tell me,” he insisted, “that you married a second time,"
having no further proofs of your first husband’s death than a mere
newspaper report?”
"“It never occurred to me to doubt it,” she replied, opening piteous,"
innocent eyes.
The childlike irresponsibility was above his comprehension. Her apparent
insensibility to the most vital concerns of life was another shock to
him. It seemed criminal.

"Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took"
over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me--and a
girl besides--she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
husbands in the one place they're still to be had--the planet
Venus--and you know I'll be in trouble.
"Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into."
"Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled"
out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.
"""I think I _tried_ to fight."""
"""Of course, you did. The disgrace was mine. I acted like a child. I"
should have realized that something extraordinary had happened. But I
"nursed my miserable little ego like a three-year-old."""
"""How could you know? My cruelty to you--"""
"""Don't talk like that! I knew about the ninth android, and I met the"
tenth one in front of your apartment that second morning. I should have
"associated. Brent Taber did, otherwise we might both be dead."""
"""It's all over now. It doesn't make any difference."""
"""No, it doesn't make any difference."""
"She looked at him in silence for several moments. ""You've changed,"
"Frank."""
"""Yes, I guess I have. I guess we all grow up eventually. We all face"
"reality and live with it."""
"""Frank--I think I'm going to cry."""
He could not turn his eyes in her direction. He looked straight ahead
"but his voice was soft. ""Go ahead, Rhoda. I understand."""
"They were silent for a time, then Rhoda began to cry quietly into her"
handkerchief. After a while even that sound was stilled.
He turned to look at her. She was standing beside the bed. He almost
"reached out and took her hand, but drew his own back at the last minute."
"""You have a learned eye, Dr. Vance."" He smiled again, glancing down to"
"admire the rough, cracked surface of the rim. ""The experts disagree on"
"the age, some saying very early seventeenth century, but I think your"
"assessment is correct. In any case, just handling it always soothes my"
spirit. The discipline of the samurai is in a _chawan_ like this. And
in the _cha-no-yu_ ceremony itself. It's a test I frequently give my
Western friends. To see if they can grasp its spirituality. I'm pleased
to say that you handled the bowl exactly as you should have. You
understand that Japanese culture is about shaping the randomness of
human actions to a refined perfection. That's what we really should be
"discussing here this afternoon, not the world of affairs, but I'm"
afraid time is short. I often think of life in terms of a famous Haiku
by the poet Shiki:
_Hira-hira to
Kaze ni nigarete
Cho hitotsu.

"""Sounds more like your new airplane,"" Vance observed, then translated:"
A mortal butterfly
Fluttering and drifting
"thought nothing of it. But this morning, when Buster, my prize"
"Pekinese, who had been with me, sitting on my lap at the time, and"
"closer to the letter even than I was, when Buster was taken suddenly"
"ill, I—well, I began to worry.”"
"She finished with a little nervous laugh, as people will to hide their"
real feelings.
"“I should like to see the dog,” remarked Kennedy simply."
"“Miss Sears,” asked her mistress, “will you get Buster, please?”"
The nurse left the room. No longer was there the laughing look on her
face. This was serious business.
"A few minutes later she reappeared, carrying gingerly a small dog"
basket. Mrs. Blake lifted the lid. Inside was a beautiful little
"“Peke,” and it was easy to see that Buster was indeed ill."
"“Who is your doctor?” asked Craig, considering."
"“Dr. Rae Wilson, a very well-known woman physician.”"
"Kennedy nodded recognition of the name. “What does she say?” he asked,"
observing the dog narrowly.
"“We haven’t told anyone, outside, of it yet,” replied Mrs. Blake. “In"
"fact until Buster fell sick, I thought it was a hoax.”"
“You haven’t told anyone?”
“Only Reginald and my daughter Betty. Betty is frantic—not with fear
"""Eh, what?"" said the astounded Simcox."
"""It's addressed to you, Simcox,"" said the skipper blandly."
"""Why?"" asked Simcox."
The skipper shook his head impatiently.
"""I thought you'd 'ave knowed, Simcox.  You're the hambassador, and"
"you've to communicate this to 'em."""
"""Oh, go on, sir,"" said the crowd."
The skipper resumed:
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir, you'll be so good as to be so kind as to"
communicate the contents of this 'ere letter to them French of the
"wreck we don't know the name of, and tell them to clear.  For there"
ain't no reasonable grounds for supposin' this ain't a British
hisland (seeing that mostly all hislands is) and they've by comin'
"'ere first got and taken possession of the best bit of it, which"
"can't be allowed, as it's contrary to law in such case made and"
"purvided.  So you'll inform 'em it ain't goin' to be put up with, and"
"they must evacuate immejit and resume the _statues quo_----"""
"""What's that?"" asked Simcox."
"""It's Latin, you unutterable ass,"" said the skipper, with a look of"
Myre went suddenly dumb....
"Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was wetting his"
"lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre’s yawing should give"
"opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man, the deaf old"
gentleman asked him:
"“You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?”"
"“No, Sir Gilders--I said that the man who does not play whist is laying"
up a sad old age----”
The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”
"But she herself owned this to be as inartistic as it was unintentional,"
"stamping her foot with annoyance at the mischance. Indeed, she"
"apologized most handsomely; for, said she, pathetically, when she had"
got it she did not know what to do with it.
It was an anticlimax.
She threw down the whip and said he might now go home.
He now went home.
There is little reason to doubt that the horsewhipping by Gaston
Latour’s sister hastened Mr. Myre’s desire to start the great
renaissance of the English drama.
As he stood before the mirror in his rooms at his hotel and shaved
"off the remains of his drooping moustache by the candle’s light, and"
"soothed the aching bumps that were risen upon his face, he sniffed"
loudly through a swollen nose--he had very tender places--and decided
to go to Rouen until the hair grew.
CHAPTER LXXXIV
_Which has to do with Blue Blood and a Jade-handled Cane_
The duel got upon the town.
"""Why?"""
"""Because it is a mystery, and in all probability she will endeavour to"
preserve the secret.  She must not see the Countess before we question
"her."""
"""Is she yet conscious?""  I asked in eagerness."
"""Yes; but at present we must put no question to her."""
"""Thank Heaven!""  I gasped.  Then I added, fervently grasping my friend's"
"hand: ""You cannot realise, Dick, what great consolation this is to me!"""
"""I know, my dear fellow--I know,"" he answered sympathetically.  ""But may"
I speak to you as a friend?  You won't be offended at anything I am
"about to say, will you?"""
"""Offended?--certainly not.  Our friendship is too firm for that, Dick."
"What is it you wish to say?"""
"I saw that he was uneasy, and was surprised at his sudden gravity."
"""Well,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation, ""you'll forgive me for"
"saying so, but I don't think that in this affair you've told me exactly"
"the truth."""
"""What do you mean?""  I inquired quickly."
"""I mean that when you parted from her this afternoon you were not"
"altogether good friends."""
"""You are mistaken,"" I assured him.  ""We were as good friends as ever"
"PHILLIPS, WILLIAM."
Born at Lower Shadwell.
"Boatswain in the _King Solomon_, a Guinea merchant ship. This ship, while"
"lying at anchor in January, 1721, was attacked by a boatful of pirates"
"from Bartholomew Roberts's ship, the _Royal Fortune_. The captain of the"
"_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his"
"crew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the"
rest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips
"eagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was ""very forward"
"and brisk"" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores."
"At his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners"
"did, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were"
"offered to him on a dish, on which lay a loaded pistol beside the copy of"
the articles.
"Found guilty and hanged in April, 1722, within the flood marks at Cape"
"Coast Castle, in his 29th year."
"PHIPS, RICHARD."
"An English soldier who deserted from Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine, in 1689."
"Wounded by a bullet in the head at Tarpaulin Cove. Taken to Boston Prison,"
where he died.
"PICKERING, CAPTAIN CHARLES."
"""Yes."""
"""Much?"""
"Kilshaw leant forward and answered, almost in a whisper,"
"""Five hundred on Friday night,"" and in spite of himself he avoided the"
Superintendent's shrewd eye. But that officer's business was not to pass
"moral judgments. Law is one thing, morality another."
"""Then the thing's as plain as a pikestaff. This Gaspard got to know"
"about the money, and murdered him to get it. We needn't look further for"
"a motive."""
"""I suppose all this will have to come out? I wonder if Gaspard knew who"
"Benham was?"""
"""It's not necessary to suppose that, unless we believe all Evans says."
"Certainly, if we trust Evans, Gaspard hinted designs on some one before"
he could have known Benyon had this money. Could he have known he was
"going to have it?"""
"""Benyon may have told him I had promised to help him."""
"""Well, sir, we must see about that. We shall want you at the inquest,"
"sir."""
"""I suppose you will, confound you! And I should think you'd want a"
"greater man than I am, too."""
The Superintendent looked grave.
(IN ABSENCE.)
I PASSED your street of many memories.
"A sunset, sombre pink, the flush"
"Of inner rose-leaves idle fingers crush,"
"Died softly, as the rose that dies."
"All the high heaven behind the roof lay thus,"
"Tenderly dying, touched with pain"
A little; standing there I saw again
The sunsets that were dear to us.
I knew not if ’twere bitter or more sweet
"To stand and watch the roofs, the sky."
"O bitter to be there and you not nigh,"
Yet this had been that blessed street.
"How the name thrilled me, there upon the wall!"
"There was the house, the windows there"
"Against the rosy twilight high and bare,"
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!
"Days that have been, days that have fallen cold!"
"I stood and gazed, and thought of you,"
Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.
"So, sad and glad, your memory visibly"
"Alive within my eyes, I turned;"
"And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,"
"Tenderly questioning, on me."
in restoring Monsieur to a normal temper.
"""We've simply got to make him laugh,"" I whispered to Tommy. ""It's a"
"matter of principle now!"""
"""Then wait till we have supper, and get him soused,"" my confederate"
"cautiously replied. ""That'll do it. But you'd better not drink much,"" he"
"added. ""How are the nerves this evening?"""
"""I've almost forgotten them,"" I answered."
But Tommy was persistent at times. Unknown to me he was now preparing a
report to wire the Mater.
"""Sleeping better?"" he asked."
"""Lots."""
"""Lying to me?"""
"""A little,"" I laughed outright. ""But honestly I'm in heaps better"
"shape!"""
"""Oh, I've seen you improving from day to day, but we want to put it over"
"right. So don't hit the asphalt too hard tonight."""
And in all justice to myself and my friendship to Tommy I really did not
intend to. What place was it that some one said is paved with good
intentions?
Leaving the Opera House we mixed with the laughing tide that flowed
"along the Prado, and by the merest chance--destinies of nations, much"

The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"

By J. Hunter Holly Author of THE GREEN PLANET
"It came plummeting out of the sky--a soundless, streaking, purple glow,"
"moving faster and faster until it ripped at the trees, crashed through"
them and struck sickeningly against a hill. Momentarily it flared
"brightly, then went out."
"It was not long after that the murders began--strange, inexplicable"
"deaths, all the victims found with their heads crushed as if their"
skulls had exploded outward.
"The trail of victims lead from Arkansas to Tennessee, to Kentucky,"
Illinois and Michigan--sixteen unrelated people who had only one thing
"in common: All of their brains were withered, as if sucked dry of their"
contents ...
"And somewhere wandered an evil stranger from another planet, his"
"personality expanding, his brain power increasing, preparing for the"
inevitable encounter that could make him master of the world!

"(_c_) In all other languages, under the name following the prefix, with"
cross-references whenever the name has been commonly used in English
"with the prefix, as _Del Rio_, _Vandyck, Van Ess_: e.g. _Gama, Vasco"
"da_, _Goethe, J. W. von_."
"But when the name is printed as one word, entry is made under the"
"prefix, as _Vanderhaeghen_."
(_d_) Naturalized names with prefixes are to be treated by the rules of
the nation adopting them.
"Thus German names preceded by _von_, when belonging to Russians, are to"
"be entered under _Von_, as this is the Russian custom. So when Dutch"
names compounded with _van_ are adopted into French or English (as _Van
Laun_) the _Van_ is treated as part of the family name.
"Prefixes are _d', de, de La_ (the name goes under _La_ not _de_),"
"_Des, Du, L', La, Le, Les, St, Ste_ (to be arranged as if written"
"_Saint, Sainte_), _da, dal, dalla, dalle, dai, dagli, del, della,"

"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"
"told you, Everard?”"
"Captured in South Carolina in 1717. Tried at Charleston, and convicted of"
taking the _Turtle Dove_ and other vessels in the previous July. Hanged in
"June, 1717."
"MOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER."
"A notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two"
ships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal
"Fortune_, being one of his chief men or ""Lords."" Taken prisoner, and tried"
"at Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28."
MOORE. Gunner.
A gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous
"crew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,"
"and Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on"
"the head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in"
"killing this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he"
was hanged in London.
"MORGAN, CAPTAIN."
"This pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Little is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French"
"pirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several"
Danish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of
"their plunder and separated into two companies, the English following"

"me. Yes, madam, you may wince,' he continued bitterly, 'for you shall"
still be my wife; and when you are my wife we will talk of that.'
"'Never!' she said, with a brave face; but her heart beat wildly, and a"
mist rose before her eyes.
"He laughed. 'My legions are round me,' he said. 'Where are yours?'"
"'You are a gentleman,' she answered with an effort. 'You will let me"
go.'
'If I do not?'
'There are those who will know how to avenge me.'
"He laughed again. 'I do not know them, Countess,' he said"
"contemptuously. 'For Hesse Cassel, he has his hands full at Nuremberg,"
"and will be likely, when Wallenstein has done with him, to need help"
himself. The King of Sweden--the brightest morning ends soonest in
"rain--and he will end at Nuremberg. Bernhard of Weimar, Leuchtenstein,"
all the fanatics fall with him. Only the banner of the Free Companies
"stands and waves ever the wider. Be advised,' he continued grimly."
"'Bend, Countess, or I have the means to break you.'"
'Never!' she said.
"'So you say now,' he answered slowly. 'You will not say so in five"
"minutes. If you care nothing for yourself, have a care for your"
friends.'
"'You said I had none,' she retorted hoarsely."
“And there are superior things which are good for nothing.”
"“Will you come and take a drive with me, philosopher brother?”"
“Where?”
“Let’s go to the Villa Borghese. The carriage will be here in a moment.”
“All right. Let us go there.”
"A two-horse victoria with rubber tires was waiting at the door, and"
"Laura and Cæsar got in. The carriage went past the Treasury, and out"
"the Porta Salaria, and entered the gardens of the Villa Borghese."
The morning had been rainy; the ground was damp; the wind waved the
tree-tops gently and caused a murmur like the tide. The carriage rolled
slowly along the avenues. Laura was very gay and chatty. Cæsar listened
to her as one listens to a bird warbling.
Many times while listening he thought: “What is there inside this head?
"What is the master idea of her life? Has she really any idea about life,"
or has she none?”
After several rounds they crossed the viaduct that unites the Villa
Borghese with the Pincio gardens.
_FROM THE PINCIO TERRACE_
They approached the great terrace of the gardens by an avenue that has
busts of celebrated men along both sides.
Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."
"""What the blazes--"" A man ran forward. Two others came at his heels."
"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."
"""The _Arabella_--adrift out there--Sidney's on it--oh--_help_! And then"
Lavender slipped into the strong arms that reached out to catch him.
"""Quick, the _Sally_! She's at Rockman's!"" Captain Davies ran toward"
"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"
"could guess their intention, three men had jumped into the big motor"
boat and had swung her free of the wharf.
"""What the hell--"" shouted an ugly voice after them, but the _Sally_"
only chugged out into the darkness of the bay.

"""Look, Sid--light! It's--it's--morning!"" Mart's voice came in a thin"
whisper. For a long time the girls had lain huddled against the
"taff-rail of the boat, too weary and disheartened to even talk."
Sidney lifted her face to the tiny streak of light that gleamed palely
in the east.
Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola had fallen into a sleep
"""I still should know you,"" answered Frances."
"""Not I!"" exclaimed Bettina."
"Presently Lilly came in, and I presented him to Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise"
and explained the presence of Frances and Bettina by saying:--
"""A friend of ours in France has asked Mistress Jennings to render what"
"aid she can to Monsieur l'Abbé, and she is here at my request to receive"
"his commands."""
"""It is good!"" exclaimed Lilly. ""She has the king's ear if any one has,"
and the ear is very close to the mind. What may I do to serve Monsieur
"l'Abbé?"""
"""If I may see you privately---the baron and me--I shall tell you how you"
"may serve me,"" answered the Abbé."
"The Abbé and I excused ourselves to Frances and Bettina, and went with"
"the Doctor to the room which he called his observatory, where we came to"
the point very quickly:--
"""I want to buy Dunkirk for my master for the sum of one hundred thousand"
"pounds,"" said the Abbé, by way of starting the consultation."
"""But London has already offered that sum,"" returned Lilly, ""and stands"
"ready to pay more."""
"""In payments,"" suggested the Abbé."
"""Yes,"" returned Lilly. ""But I see no way of bringing the king to accept"
"the sum you offer unless--unless Mistress Jennings can persuade him."""
"board H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he"
"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.

THE POWER OF EVIL
"""You might call it a fight,"" Elizabeth said, ""but they never actually"
"laid a hand on each other."""
"Dr. Carew stared at her in puzzlement as she went on. ""They threw every"
"hard thing in the room at each other, without ever touching anything. It"
"was like some ghastly, murderous game. A clock flew through the air like"
"a cannonball, straight at Joseph's head, and some unseen force seemed to"
stop it. For a second it hung there and trembled in the air--_with
nothing under it_; then it turned and flew like lightning at Quincy; he
barely dodged it.
"""Finally a vase did find its mark and Quincy fell to the floor. Joseph"
"stepped over him and came toward me. I ran, slamming the door in his"
"face, locking him in. He laughed evilly and called after me, 'Why waste"
"time running away, Elizabeth? I'll come to get you, and you won't be"
"able to resist me now!'"""

The Girl turned upon him with eyes flashing and retorted:
"""Well, it's my throat, ain't it?"""
"""Well I'll be!--"" The Sheriff's sentence was left unfinished, for Nick,"
"quickly pulling him to one side, whispered:"
"""Say, Rance, the Girl's cut up because she vouched for 'im. Don't rub it"
"in."""
"Notwithstanding, Rance, to the Girl's query of ""How did this Nina"
"Micheltoreña know it?"" took a keen delight in telling her:"
"""She's his girl."""
"""His girl?"" repeated the Girl, mechanically."
"""Yes. She gave us his picture,"" went on Rance; and taking the photograph"
"out of his pocket, he added maliciously, ""with love written on the back"
"of it."""
"A glance at the photograph, which she fairly snatched out of his hands,"
convinced the Girl of the truthfulness of his assertion. With a movement
"of pain she threw it upon the floor, crying out bitterly:"
"""Nina Micheltoreña! Nina Micheltoreña!"" Turning to Ashby with an abrupt"
"change of manner she said contritely: ""I'm sorry, Mr. Ashby, I vouched"
"for 'im."""
The Wells Fargo Agent softened at the note in the Girl's voice; he was
about to utter some comforting words to her when suddenly she spoke
Perhaps--perhaps we may have doubted the man somewhat over-hastily. But
"as for me, I will answer for La Giralda."""
"""For me,"" said El Sarria, sententiously, ""I will answer for no"
"woman--save only Dolóres Garcia!"""
Concha looked up quickly.
"""I also am a woman,"" she said, smiling."
"""And quite well able to answer for yourself, Señorita!"" returned El"
"Sarria, grimly."
For the answers of Ramon Garcia were not at all after the pattern set by
Rollo the Scot.
CHAPTER XXVII
THE SERGEANT AND LA GIRALDA
The dust-heat of the desolate plains of Old Castile was red on the
horizon when the Sergeant and his companion started together on their
"strange and perilous mission. Would they ever return, and when? What"
"might they not find? A Court deserted and forlorn, courtiers fleeing, or"
"eager to flee if only they knew whither, from the dread and terrible"
"plague? A Queen and a princess without guards, a palace open to the"
plunder of any chance band of robbers? For something like this the imp
of the deserted village had prepared them.
"Cap'n Davies lifted the box. ""It's pretty big to be diamonds but it"
looks suspicious like! And you're sure it wasn't there before? That it
"ain't the property of that summer boarder of Miss Green's?"""
"Sidney's face was flaming with excitement. ""Oh, I'm _sure_! The other"
stuff was there but there wasn't any box under it. If I hadn't been so
excited listening I'd have realized I was sitting on something
"different. Can't we look inside?"""
"""We won't take the time to look at anything now, mate. We'll get"
ashore. I reckon by this time there are folks strainin' their eyes for
"a sight o' you--"""
He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him and toward the _Sally_.
"Saunders lifted the girls into the smaller boat, then took the box."
"""To Rockman's. Quick as you can make it,"" snapped Cap'n Phin."

"""YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER"""
Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.

"no, Mr. Kennedy. Don’t ask me to go anywhere to-night. I am—I am in no"
condition to go anywhere—to do anything—I—”
"“But you must,” said Kennedy in a low voice."
“I can’t. Oh—have mercy on me. I am terribly upset. You—”
"“It is your duty to go, Mrs. Moulton,” he repeated."
“I don’t understand.” she murmured. “A pawnbroker’s?”
"“Come,” urged Kennedy, not harshly but firmly, then, as she held back,"
"added, playing a trump card, “We must work quickly. In his hands we"
found the fragments of a torn dress. When the police—”
"She uttered a shriek. A glance had told her, if she had deceived"
"herself before, that Kennedy knew her secret."
"Antoinette Moulton was standing before him, talking rapidly."

"""_Shush_, Ferdinand, this is serious!"""
"It was. I heard the Captain say, ""I'm not carrying a weapon, Brown."""
"""Then _get_ one,"" Butt's low, lazy voice floated out."
"""No, thanks. You're as handy with that thing as I am with a"
"rocketboard."" The Captain's words got a little fainter as he walked"
forward. Butt growled like a gusher about to blow.
"""I'm counting on your being a good guy, Brown."" The Captain's"

"Just about this time, events in the lifeboat went down to a mumble. The"
top of my head got wet and I looked up. There was sweat rolling down
the Second Assistant's forehead; it converged at his nose and bounced
off the tip in a sizable stream. I twisted out of the way.

"""I am a soldier,"" answered Vaviloff, with a modest air."
"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"

"""Just so."""
"""Good!  You have the law on your side, and will, of course, win your"

"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"

I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was

"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"

"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
again.

"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"

hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.

Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"ever played.  The Chopin polonaise in A flat, that song of revolution,"
"which had always seemed so unattainable, went as if her fingers were"
"being worked for her.  When she had finished, Monsieur Harmost, bending"
"forward, lifted one of her hands and put his lips to it.  She felt the"
"scrub of his little bristly beard, and raised her face with a deep sigh"
of satisfaction. A voice behind them said mockingly:
"""Bravo!"""
"There, by the door, stood Fiorsen."
"""Congratulations, madame!  I have long wanted to see you under the"
"inspiration of your--master!"""
Gyp's heart began to beat desperately.  Monsieur Harmost had not moved.
"A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled."
Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
"""To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart.  Ho--what a lover!"""
Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
"""You brute!"""
"Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as"
if to take him by the throat.
"The old man drew himself up.  ""Monsieur,"" he said, ""you are certainly"
"drunk."""
"Gyp slipped between, right up to those outstretched hands till she could"
And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"
"phone. ""Captain?.... That's right, Brent Taber ... No, right, here in"
Manhattan. There's been a little trouble. You'd better come over
"personally."""
"""No, it is not.  It has been destroyed."""
"""Why?""  I asked."
"""For some mysterious reason known to Yolande.""  Then, turning quickly"
"again to me, she placed her hand upon my arm in deep earnestness,"
"saying: ""Tell me, is your love for her absolutely and entirely dead--so"
"dead that you would not care to perform her a service?"""
Anderson's strange and startling story flashed through my mind.  I made
no reply.
"""Remember the affection you once bore her,"" she urged.  ""I am a woman,"
"m'sieur, and I presume to remind you of it."""
I needed no reminder.  The recollection of those sweet idyllic days was
still fresh as ever in my memory.  Ah! in those brief sunny hours I had
fondly believed that our love would last always.  It is ever the same.
Youth is ever foolish.
"""I should have loved her now,"" I answered at last, ""were it not for one"
"fact."""
"There was a mystery which had ended our love, and I saw now an"
"opportunity of clearing it up.  ""To what fact do you refer?"""
"""To the reason of our parting."""
"""The reason!"" echoed the Countess.  ""I have no idea whatever of the"
"reason.  What was it?"""
I held my breath.  Would it be just to tell her the truth?  I wondered.
go....
"As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that led into"
"the tavern of _The Golden Sun_, a young woman in black came languidly"
"down the stairs, and he held the door open for her to pass in."
The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled with
"pleasure, seeing him."
They entered and stood together--a song was being sung--and as the last
"chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm; and he left"
it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll received from the
faded poets and frequenters of the place. She was very beautiful--but
her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed a dizzy tendency to cling to
"his arm, as though she feared to fall. He found a table, and made her"
sit down beside him.
"“Madelaine,” said he--“you look as if you wanted food.”"
She sighed sadly:
"“Ah, yes--for years,” she said."
He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they were
"being brought, he asked her:"
"“What became of you, Madelaine--after the old widow Snacheur was"
killed?”
She sighed sadly:
"goin'."""
"He bowed her out of the room, and then, snatching up his hat and cane"
"with very visible annoyance, included the others in a curt nod of"
farewell and made off himself.
He passed her before she had closed her own door--and would gladly have
paused there.
"""You won't forget me, will you?"" she heard him ask eagerly from behind"
her. But she did not delay to answer that question.
"A few minutes later, Slyne knocked at her door and entered, followed by"
the other two men. He had brought with him the papers which Mr. Jobling
"had prepared. Mr. Jobling carried an inkstand, and Captain Dove a"
decanter of brandy. Slyne seated himself at the table and waved Sallie
back to her chair by the window.
"""We're going to talk business for a few minutes,"" he told her, ""and then"
get everything settled in writing--to keep you safe.
"""Fire ahead now, Dove. You want to know--"""
"""Is Sallie really--"""
"""_I_ don't know anyone of that name now. D'you mean Lady Josceline?"""
"Captain Dove glared at him, and then at the lawyer, and then at Sallie"
herself.
"""Is that really who I am now, Jasper?"" she asked, a most wistful"
inflection in her low voice.
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""
"""Not much chance we're interested. This money has been turning up around"
"Times Square."""
"""The other's a man--quiet, no trouble, pays his rent right on the dot"
every week. John Dennis his name is and he doesn't look like no
"counterfeiter."""
"Taber took a forward step. ""What's his room number?"""
"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."
"And we, alike from each remote,"
"The world that works, the heaven that waits,"
"Con our brief pleasures o’er by rote,"
The favourite pastime of the Fates.
"We smoke, to fancy that we dream,"
"And drink, a moment’s joy to prove,"
"And fain would love, and only seem"
To love because we cannot love.
"Draw back the blinds, put out the light:"
"’Tis morning, let the daylight come."
"God! how the women’s cheeks are white,"
And how the sunlight strikes us dumb!
EMMY.
"EMMY’S exquisite youth and her virginal air,"
"Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,"
"Come to me out of the past, and I see her there"
As I saw her once for a while.
"Emmy’s laughter rings in my ears, as bright,"
"Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook,"
"And still I hear her telling us tales that night,"
Out of Boccaccio’s book.
"There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall,"
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
on his face.
"The girls surged forward when they saw him, scattering the crew to one"
side. They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a
dying whale.
"""M-m-m-m! Are all Venusians built like that?"""
"""Men like that are worth the mileage!"""
"""_I want him!"" ""I want him!"" ""I want him!_"""
Sis had been let go. She grabbed my free hand and pulled me away. She
"was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles"
of fury popping in them.
"""The cheap extroverts! And they call themselves responsible women!"""
"I was angry, too. And I let her know, once we were in our cabin."
"""What about that promise, Sis? You said you wouldn't turn him in. You"
"_promised_!"""
She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get
"to Venus on foot. ""I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me."""
"""My name is Ford and I don't understand."""
"""Your name is Ferdinand and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl."
"It doesn't become you. In just a few days, you'll forget all this and"
"be your simple, carefree self again. I really truly meant to keep my"
"word. From what you'd told me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a fundamentally"
decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the
hymns and some of the Gospel Songs. Some of the numbers in the Gospel
"Songs section of the _Hymnary_ might well be classified as hymns, e.g.,"
"Nos. 441, 444, 447, 458, 463, 468, 470, 471, 472, and 492. Either words"
or music meet the generally accepted standards of a hymn.
12. Women Hymn Writers.
There have been no outstanding women composers of church tunes but some
"of our finest lyrics have been contributed by women, as the following"
list from the _Hymnary_ will show:
_German_

CHAPTER XVII
ERASMUS AT BASLE
1521-9
Basle his dwelling-place for nearly eight years:
1521-9--Political thought of Erasmus--Concord and
peace--Anti-war writings--Opinions concerning princes and
government--New editions of several Fathers--The
"_Colloquia_--Controversies with Stunica, Beda, etc.--Quarrel"
with Hutten--Eppendorff
It is only towards the evening of life that the picture of Erasmus
acquires the features with which it was to go down to posterity. Only at
Basle--delivered from the troublesome pressure of parties wanting to
"enlist him, transplanted from an environment of haters and opponents at"
"Louvain to a circle of friends, kindred spirits, helpers and admirers,"
"emancipated from the courts of princes, independent of the patronage of"
"“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s sake,” said Severance. “It is"
enough to have read them.”
"“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed Teddy, “if you could have been at the"
"yacht race! Such excitement, such—”"
"“To change the subject,” said Trent, with determination in his eye,"
"“Mrs. Pendleton, did you receive all the marked papers I sent you"
"containing my speeches, especially the one on Jesuitism in Politics?”"
"“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose"
own egotism was kicking against its bars. “You did not think my book too
"long, did you? One purblind critic said—”"
"“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said Severance, rising abruptly. “Good"
"evening,” and he bowed to Miss Decker and to the men. Jessica rose"
suddenly and went with him to the door.
"“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”"
"she said, as she gave him her hand. “This may be unconventional, but _I_"
choose to do it.”
He bowed over her hand. “Mrs. Pendleton will only have set one more
"fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”"
"As he left the room by one door, Jessica crossed the room and opened"
another.
"“Good night,” she said to the astounded company, and withdrew."

"voice. ""The Swabian dynasty is no more."""
"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.
including every reference necessary to enable the searcher to find what
"he wishes without delay or confusion, the mistake of overloading the"
index with useless entries.
"Use ink, as pencil entries often become illegible."
"Write plainly, and do not try to economize space in preparing the copy."

PROCEDURE
"Having settled upon a definite plan, the indexer seats himself at a"
"""When it gets dark I'm coming out to the _Arabella_ and stay all night."
Maybe they'll come back and I'll find out why. That fellow said
something 'bout Rockman's not being safe. They'll learn the _Arabella_
"isn't safe either!"""
"""But Lav, I'm coming with you!"""
"""You can't. And this isn't any work for a girl to get mixed up in."""
Sidney drew herself to her full height.
"""Lavender Green, if you think you're going to lose me _now_ you're"
mistaken. I guess we went into this in a sort of partnership and it's
going to hold. I found out just as much as you did! And if you come out
"to the _Arabella_, _I'm_ coming, and Mart, too, if she's home."""
Lav still hesitated.
"""Aunt Achsa won't let you. How'd you get away?"""
"This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she thought of a ""way."" This"
was Wednesday night and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night she
was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney might go with her. From
Truro Miss Letty was going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think
Sidney wanted to see Cap'n Davies again. She explained all this
"breathlessly to Lavender. ""This is important enough to warrant a fib."
And when it's all over Aunt Achsa will understand. Let's go home now
"and find Mart."""
Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney's right to share with him his
night's vigil at any cost. Again they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.
"""Another thief crep' into camp,"" coldly observed the Girl almost"
simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"
"thief."""
In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"
peg on the wall.
"""Ever sample one o' our mountain blizzards?"" she asked as he slipped on"
"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty
"feet from here."""
Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:
"""You say you believe in Fate. Well, Fate has caught up with you--you got"
"to stay here."""
"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"
"is big, and should be muscular, but he is soft from lack of exercise."
"Yet he'll attempt to stay there longer than I did, I guess."""
"""No doubt."""
"He eyed her sharply, not missing her repetitious dry reply."
"""Which, incidentally,"" he said, ""gives me my first chance to speak with"
"you alone since we took off from Earth."""
"""That's so. But--"""
"""Miss Hemingway, you are an exceedingly brisk young woman, attractive"
"and intelligent. May I ask if you have ever taken a lover?"""
"""Why, no."""
"""Never considered it?"""
"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"
"first--"" when he noted the fading amusement in her face and glibly ad"
"libbed--""to congratulate you on your choice of young men? The space"
commodore to whom you bade farewell in Chicago was an up and coming
"man, I'd assume."""
"""Proceed, count."""
"""Monsieur le Comte Hamilton begs me to say that he was called away from"
"London early to-day on the king's business, but that he will return"
in four weeks. When he returns he will do himself the honor to send
"me again, asking you to name a friend, unless you prefer to apologize,"
"which no gentleman would do in a case of this sort. You said, I am told,"
"that Monsieur le Comte lied. If you admit that he did not lie, of course"
"you admit that you did. So, im-pos-si-ble! There must be to fight!"""
"""Do you know, count, the cause of my having given Count Hamilton the"
"lie?"" I asked."
"""I did not inquire,"" he answered smilingly. ""To me it was to carry the"
"message."""
"""George Hamilton is your friend, is he not?"" I asked."
"""Yes, but far more, he is the friend of my king, and will make entreaty"
"with my monarch for my return to France,"" answered De Grammont."
"""It was because of Count Hamilton's insulting reference to his brother"
"that I used the ugly word,"" I returned."
"""A-ah, that is different!"" Then recovering himself quickly: ""But I"
undertook the mission. It is to finish. Monsieur George Hamilton? My
friend? My king's friend? If it had been known to me! But you have the
"message of 'Sieur le Comte."""
"After a short silence he said, ""When Monsieur le Comte Hamilton returns,"
"I shall ask him to relieve me of this duty."""
“I fled.
“And now you have found me.”
"She had turned, hastily, to leave the room. Kennedy blocked the door."
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"
"on the first floor of a five-story tenement, the quick entry into the"
place by one of Muller’s keys.
Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered
"Schloss’ safe. Kennedy tore it away, regardless of the alarm which it"
must have sounded. In a moment he was down before it on his knees.
"“This is how Schloss’ safe was opened so quickly,” he muttered, working"
feverishly. “Here is some of their own medicine.”
He had placed the peculiar telephone-like transmitter close to the
combination lock and was turning the combination rapidly.
"Suddenly he rose, gave the bolts a twist, and the ponderous doors swung"
open.

"TUCKER, ROBERT."
Of the Island of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at"
"Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not"
"defended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still"
"deemed it ""a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward."" We"
understand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded
"themselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the"
"famous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the"
"Court of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and"
all but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.

"Fraulein Max, singled out by that merciless finger, sprang forward,"
her face mottled with surprise and terror. For a second she hesitated.
"Then she rushed towards her friend, as if she would embrace her."
'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"

"The Dutch woman recoiled with a cry of pain, and sobbing wildly went"
back to her place. The general laughed harshly.
"'You hold with me, sweetheart,' he said. 'Discipline before"
everything. But you have not my patience.'
"She looked at him--angry with him, angry with herself, her hand to her"
bosom--but she did not answer.
"'For you must allow,' he continued--his tone and his eyes still"
bantered her--'that I have been patient. I have been like a man
"athirst in the desert; but I have waited day after day, until now I"
"can wait no longer, sweetheart.'"
'So you tamper with my--with that woman!' she said scornfully.
"“H’m, h’m!--yes. Pills.”"
“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all slept
"in attics. And really, it’s quite the _fashion_ to go on the stage"
now.... Who’s the fright in the post-office red?... Oh! is it?... Lady
"Margaret’s son has gone on the stage.... Gerty, do you know who that"
"dark creature is? with the Italian-looking person.... Oh, yes; and the"
"young fellow is getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have"
"a gentleman on the stage--besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly"
"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other
"day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise him in"
the street. It’s so nice for the young fellow to be with such a
"of a foreign compound name has been used alone, as _Merle d'Aubigné_"
(index under _Merle_ with a cross-reference from _Aubigné_).
"In French, a forename is sometimes joined to a surname by a hyphen. In"
"such cases make the entry under the family name, with a cross-reference"
"from the forename: e.g., entry, _Rochette, Désiré Raoul_;"
"cross-reference, _Raoul-Rochette, Désiré_. See _Rochette_."
"(_c_) In foreign compound names of women also, although the first part"
"is usually the maiden name and the second the husband's name, the entry"
"should generally be under the first, with a cross-reference from the"
"second[51]: e.g., _Rivé-King_, with cross-reference from _King, born"
Rivé_.
Index surnames preceded by prefixes:
"(_a_) In French and Belgian, under the prefix when it is or contains"
"an article, _Le, La, L', Du, Des_; under the word following when the"
"prefix is a preposition, _de, d'_: e.g., _Des Essarts, Du Cange,"
"La Fontaine, Le Sage, L'Estoille_; but _Charlevoix, P. F. X. de_;"
"_Estrées, Mme d'_."
"_La_ and _Le_ are often, _Des_ is usually, and _Les_ is almost without"
"exception printed as one word with the name following, as _Lafontaine,"
"Lesage, Lesdiguières_; _de_ and _d'_ are sometimes so printed; when"
"they are, enter under the _D_: e.g., _Debucourt, Decamps, Delisle_; but"
"_Bucourt, A. de_, _Camps, C. de_, _Lisle, J. de_."
"(_b_) In English, under the prefix, no matter from what language the"
"name is derived, with cross-references when necessary: e.g., _De"
"Quincey_, _Van Buren_."
"""Why do you stop? Why don't you go on--finish your search--only don't"
"ever speak to me again."""
"At that, Rance became conciliatory."
"""Say, Min, I don't want to quarrel with you."""
Turning her back on him the Girl moved over to the bureau where she
snapped out over her shoulder:
"""Go on with your search, then p'r'aps you'll leave a lady to herself to"
"go to bed."""
The Sheriff followed her up with the declaration:
"""I'm plumb crazy about you, Min."""
The Girl shrugged her shoulder.
"""I could have sworn I saw--I--Oh, you know it's just you for me--just"
"you, and curse the man you like better. I--I--even yet I can't get over"
"the queer look in your face when I told you who that man really was."" He"
"stopped and flung his overcoat down on the floor, and fixing her with a"
"look he demanded: ""You don't love him, do you?"""
Again the Girl sent over her shoulder a forced little laugh.
"""Who--me?"""
"The Sheriff's face brightened. Taking a few steps nearer to her, he"
hazarded:
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""
THE POLICY OF THE _POTLUCK_.
"Concerning the permanent and immutable characteristics of ships, the"
unhappy man who has never had his limited range of vision broadened
by a trip in a sailing ship must of necessity know little.  He
"for the disturbance, but are themselves badly mauled. Then the Pardoner"
"and the Friar go off amicably together. There is no allegory, no moral;"
merely satire on the fraudulent and hypocritical practices of pardoners
"and friars, together with some horseplay to raise a louder laugh. The"
fashion of that satire may be judged from the following exchange of home
truths by the rival orators.
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to parting pardoners?--"
"_Pardoner._ What, should ye spend on these flattering liars,--"
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to these bold beggars?--"
"_Pardoner._ As be these babbling monks and these friars,--"
_Friar._ Let them hardly labour for their living;--
_Pardoner._ Which do nought daily but babble and lie--
"_Friar._ It much hurteth them good men's giving,--"
"_Pardoner._ And tell you fables dear enough at a fly,--"
"_Friar._ For that maketh them idle and slothful to wark,--"
_Pardoner._ As doth this babbling friar here to-day?--
_Friar._ That for none other thing they will cark.--
"_Pardoner._ Drive him hence, therefore, in the twenty-devil way!--"
"_The Four P.P._ (? 1540), similarly, requires no more than a palmer, a"
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"

"‘What does this mean, Pa?’ cried I."
"They gathered themselves up, shamelessly--laughed--ye gods, twittingly,"
"at _me_! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself into comfort in his"
"clothes, slapped me upon the back:"
"‘Horace, my son----’"
"‘Don’t be familiar, Sir Pompey,’ said I. ‘You are speaking to the heir"
to a baronetcy.’
The baronet laughed vulgarly:
"‘Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,’ he said--‘allow me to introduce to you"
"Horace, my son--at least, my reputed son.’"
"Bows, chassées, and greetings."
"‘Horace--the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and Master Oliver"
Doome----’
The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with mighty hand that
near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.
He dug me in the ribs:
"‘The rogue’s been married this seven years,’ cried he; ‘and now he’s"
"signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and you’re just in"
"the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs--only--look here,"
"Horace, you must, like Doome, sign a bond not to touch the business"
arrangements--you and he would wreck the counting-house in six
months....’
"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"
"Lon-don!"""
Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.
"""Oh, _Lav_,"" cried Sidney. She leaned far over the side of the boat."
"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."

"saying that. Just take it from me again, both of you, that you'd better"
"not be so slow again in telling me--"""

"Captain Dove nodded, most emphatically. ""I'll send word to Brasse and Da"

"He left the room after Mr. Jobling, and Slyne, in the doorway, looked"
"back at Sallie, the reassuring smile on his lips belied by his cold,"
calculating eyes.

For it was obvious that the drinking was going to begin.  The French
"captain served the liquor out in a small glass to every one, and"
presently some of his melancholy disappeared.  He gave an order to
"one of his men who brought two more glasses, one for the English"
"captain, and one for himself."
"""I looks towards you,"" said Jones."
"""À votre santé,"" cried the Frenchman.  ""Monsieur, vous êtes un homme"

"""I don't savvy, but I dessay you means well,"" said the captain."
"""Now, if I'd thought to bring along the signal book we might 'ave 'ad"

"He pointed to Hart, and though two of the Frenchmen, who had black"
"eyes, remonstrated against the deed of mercy, Hart was unlashed and"
given a drink.
"""Here's to you, old cocklywax,"" said Hart, with a scrape of his leg."
"""I bears no grudge, not me."""
"But Marion wouldn’t be stopped. “No, mother, you spoil father, and it’s"
not right. You ought to be stricter with him. He’s very naughty.” She
"laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror."
"Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating"
"voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said—even if it"
"was only “Jam, please, father”—it rang out as though she were on the"
stage.
"“Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?” asked Charlotte,"
beginning to rock again.
"“I’m not sure,” said Old Mr. Neave. “I’m not sure. I didn’t see him"
after four o’clock.”
“He said—” began Charlotte.
"But at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some"
"paper or other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair."
"“There, you see,” she cried. “That’s what I mean, mummy. Yellow, with"
touches of silver. Don’t you agree?”
"“Give it to me, love,” said Charlotte. She fumbled for her"
"tortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab"
"with her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. “Very sweet!” she"
crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. “But I
shouldn’t have the train.”
“Not the train!” wailed Ethel tragically. “But the train’s the whole
point.”
"“Here, mother, let me decide.” Marion snatched the paper playfully from"
"to record,--Cleopatras of cats, whom age could not wither, and whose"
"infinite variety custom could not stale,--and there was the approaching"
marriage of Arachne with a duke to report. And he told her of his
"gay, bright life in London and of the beautiful Belinda Molyneux, an"
"imaginary Egeria, who sometimes lunched with the queen. The effort of"
"artistic creation absorbed him, as it always had done, under the spell"
of Stellamaris's shining eyes. The foolish world of his imagination
"became real, and for the moment hung like a veil before his actual world"
of tragedy. It was in the nature of a shock to him when Stella's maid
entered and asked him if he could speak to Mr. Herold outside the door..
"“Tell him to come in,” said Stellamaris."
"“He says he will, Miss, after he has seen Mr. Risca.”"
Risca found Herold on the landing.
“Well?”
“Well?” said John.
“What has happened? How did she take it?”
"John looked away, and thrust his hands into his pockets."
“I 've not told her yet.”
Walter drew a breath. “But you 're going to?”

A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's

But the butcher of Tortosa could be as simple and direct in his methods

"""Will you give it to me?"" he said, still admiring it as it flashed upon"
his finger.
"Etienne looked at the general calmly from head to foot, Concha all the"
time frowning upon him to warn him of his danger. But the young man was
"preening himself like a little bantam-cock of vanity, glad to be"
reckless under the fire of such eyes. He would not have missed the

were being weighed in the scales of destiny.
It was Francesco who spoke.
"""How you have suffered!"""
"She crept very close to him, smiling up at him with the old-time smile"
through tear-dimmed eyes.
"""It counts for naught now! Are not you with me?"""
The sky burned azure above the tree-tops. Transient sunshafts quivered
"through the vaulted dome of breathless leaves, as slowly Francesco and"
Ilaria strode towards the camp of the Duke of Spoleto on the
sun-bathed hillock above the Nera.
The End.
"let a lady go to bed?"""
One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as
"if to take extra precautions to bar out any intrusion, and with eyes"
that blazed she yelled out:
"""Come out o' that, now! Step out there, Mr. Johnson!"""
Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.
"""You came here to rob me,"" at once began the Girl, but her anger made it"
impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.
"""You lie!"" insisted the Girl, beside herself with rage."
"""I don't--"""
"“It has confirmed me in my idea, which I had lost for a few days.”"
“What idea is that?”
"“That we must not defend ourselves in this life, but attack, always"

“Yes.”

“Good.”
They went down in the carriage to the Priory of Malta. They knocked at
"the gate and a woman came out who knew Kennedy, and who told them to"
wait a moment and she would open the church.
"“Here,” said Kennedy, “you have all that remains of the famous Order of"
Saint John of Jerusalem. That anti-historic man Bonaparte rooted it
"out of Malta. The Order attempted to establish itself in Catania, and"
"afterwards at Ferrara, and finally took refuge here. Now it has no"
"property left, and all that remains are its memories and its archives.”"
“That is how our descendants will see our Holy Mother the Church. In

"“Among the San Blas Indians, who are at a far higher level of"

REVENGE IN AN ALIEN WORLD
When Gail Loring chose Bill Drake to be her husband--in name only--for
"the duration of the flight to Mars, she didn't know that she had just"
signed his death warrant.
"Jealous Dr. Spartan, leader of the expedition, swore to get revenge and"
force Gail to share his maniacal plan for power.
"Bound together in space, five men and a woman strained against the"
powerful tug of twisted emotions and secret ambitions.
But all plans were forgotten when they landed on the Red Planet and
"encountered the Martians--half animal, half vegetable, with acid for"
blood and radar for sight.
"Jimmie told his chum of the arrival of Gilroy, and then the two boys"
hastened toward the camp.
“The outlaws were discussing the advisability of taking all the boys
"into their care,” Ned said, as they hustled along, “so I’m afraid"
they’ve been there and taken the lads by surprise.”
CHAPTER IX
IN QUEST OF INFORMATION
"Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and Jimmie, Jack, Frank and"
Harry sat for a long time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked himself into a collection
of blankets at the rear of the cave and was sound asleep.
“What do you think Jimmie had in his mind when he went away alone?”
asked Harry. “He merely had some plan to carry out.”
"“Oh, he’s always going off alone,” Jack answered."
“Some day he’ll go away alone and won’t be able to get back!” Frank put
in. “He won’t always be able to get out of his scrapes.”
"“Pretty foxy boy, that!” Jack declared."
"“What strikes me as being singular,” Frank suggested, “is that Jack’s"
father never said a word to him about this land business.”
"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
Index under the highest title:
"British and foreign noblemen, with cross-reference from earlier titles"
"by which they have been known, and, in the case of British noblemen,"
"from the family name: e.g., _Chesterfield, 4th Earl of (Philip"
"Dormer Stanhope)_. _Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)_."
"Cross-reference from _Stanhope_. _Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroi, Duc"
de_.
Authors should be put under their names. The definition of a name is
"""that by which a person or thing is known."" Noblemen are known by their"
"titles, not by their family names."
In the few cases in which the family name[50] or a lower title is
"decidedly better known, index under that and cross-reference from"
"the title: e.g., _Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam_; _Robert Curzon,"
"14th Baron Zouche_; _John Napier, Baron of Merchiston_; _Horace"
"Walpole, 4th Earl of Oxford_; likewise the military nobles and"
"princes of the French Empire: e.g., _Lucien Bonaparte, Prince de"
"Canino_; _McMahon, Duc de Magenta_."
Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be treated by the following
rules. In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries above her
"own rank she takes her husband's title in exchange for her own,"
if below her own rank she keeps her own title.
(_a_) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.
"That is, she is Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness, etc. In indexing,"
"say _Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness_; not _Brassey, Annie"
"(Allnutt), Lady_."
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"give?"""
"Serious as was Johnson's predicament, he could not suppress a smile. In"
a surprisedly calm voice he told her to say that she had gone to bed.
The Girl's eyes flooded with admiration.
"""Why, o' course--that's it,"" she said, and turned back to the door and"
"called through it: ""I've gone to bed, Nick! I'm in bed now!"""
The barkeeper's answer was lost in another loud howl of the blast. Soon
"afterwards, however, the Girl made out that Nick was endeavouring to"
convey to her a warning of some kind.
"""You say you've come to warn me?"" she cried."
"""Yes, Ramerrez . . .!"""
"""What? Say that again?"""
"""Ramerrez is on the trail--"""
"""Ramerrez's on the trail!"" repeated the Girl in tones of alarm; and not"
waiting to hear further she motioned to Johnson to conceal himself
"behind the curtains of the bed, muttering the while:"
"""I got to let 'em in--I can't keep 'em out there on such a night . . ."""
He had barely reached his place of concealment when the Girl slid back
the bolts and bade the boys to come in.
"Headed by Rance, the men quickly filed in and deposited their lanterns"
"on the floor. It was evident that they had found the storm most severe,"
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""

"While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball,"
"As the midnight hour drew near,"

"One fresh bud in a garland withered and stale,"
"She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told"
Tale after shameless tale.
"And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled,"
"Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun,"
"And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child,"

"Here, after all one’s wanderings!"
"But, Emmy, though we meet,"

"For, is this Emmy that I see?"
A fragile domesticity
"""Well?"" she interrogated."
"""Well, we was sure that you was in trouble,"" put in Sonora. ""My breath"
"jest stopped."""
"""Me? Me in trouble, Sonora?"" A little laugh that was half-gay,"
"half-derisive, accompanied her words."
"""See here, that man Ramerrez--"" followed up Rance with a grim look."
"""--feller you was dancin' with,"" interposed Sonora, but checked himself"
instantly lest he wound the Girl's feelings.
"Whereupon, Rance, with no such compunctions, became the spokesman, a"
grimace of pleasure spreading over his countenance as he thought of the
unpleasant surprise he was about to impart. Stretching out his stiffened
"fingers over the blaze, he said in his most brutal tones:"
"""Your polkying friend is none other than Ramerrez."""
"The Girl's eyes opened wide, but they did not look at the Sheriff. They"
looked straight before her.
"""I warned you, girl,"" spoke up Ashby, ""that you should bank with us"
"oftener."""
The Girl gave no sign of having heard him. Her slender figure seemed to
"have shrunken perceptibly as she stared stupidly, uncomprehendingly,"
into space.
"""We say that Johnson was--"" repeated Rance, impatiently."
And Gyp thought: 'How wonderful of him not to have asked a single
question.'
"The cab stopped at the Bury Street door.  She took his hand, put it to"
"her cheek, and got out.  He said quietly:"
"""Do you want the dogs?"""
"""Yes--oh, yes!  He doesn't care for them."""
"""All right.  There'll be time to get you in some things for the night"
after I come back.  I shan't run any risks to-day.  Make Mrs. Markey give
"you tea."""
"Gyp watched the cab gather way again, saw him wave his hand; then, with a"
"deep sigh, half anxiety, half relief, she rang the bell."
XVII
"When the cab debouched again into St. James' Street, Winton gave the"
"order: ""Quick as you can!""  One could think better going fast! A little"
red had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids
had a keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did
"when a fox was breaking cover.  Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could,"
he would stand by her in it as a matter of course.  But he was going to
"take no risks--make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary."
"He had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely"
determination and resource which makes many Englishmen of his class
"""Sid, I haven't played square,"" Lavender suddenly blurted out,"
"flushing. ""We promised to tell one another if any one of us found out"
"anything and _I did_--and I didn't tell!"""
Lavender's admission faded beside the fact that he knew something.
"""Oh, what?"" Sidney cried."
"""I wasn't going to tell you. I thought you didn't care anything about"
"the pirates any more. And the laugh's sort o' on me, anyway, because I"
"thought we were all crazy to suspect Jed Starrow."""
"""Tell me quick, Lav,"" commanded Sidney, quivering with excitement."
Lav leaned against the rail. To tell his story meant confessing his
state of mind.
"""I guess I've been sore because you and Mr. Dugald fooled 'round with"
those new folks. Jealous. I get that way lots of times--all hot inside
because I'm different. And I go off somewhere alone and stay there
"until I fight it down."""
"""I know, Lav. Aunt Achsa told me. Did you go to the dunes?"""
"""One night I did. Stayed there all night. But one evening I went out on"
the breakwall. There's a place out there where the rocks are piled so's
to make a cave. I used to play there a lot when I was a little kid. I
crawled into it. And I hadn't been there very long when I heard
somebody talking--two men. They were up close so's I heard everything

"address given in the letter, he found that his brother had gone out not"

"Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized"
a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"
floor anxiously.
"Presently he dropped in a chair before a rough deal table, on top of"

IN WHICH A MUTINY IS THREATENED
"Even after they were miles down the Sound, Boyd remained at his post,"
sweeping the waters astern in an anxious search for some swift harbor
"craft, the appearance of which would signal that his escape had been"
discovered.
"""I won't feel safe until we are past Port Townsend,"" he confessed to"
"Cherry, who maintained a position at his side."
"""Why Port Townsend? We don't stop there."""
"""No. But the police can wire on from Seattle to stop us and take me off"
"at that point."""
"""If they find out their mistake."""
"""They must have found it out long ago. That's why I've got Peasley"

"speed for her. Once we're through the Straits, I'll be satisfied. But"
"meanwhile--"" Emerson lowered his glasses with a sigh of fatigue, and in"
the soft twilight the girl saw that his face was lined and careworn.
"The yearning at her heart lent poignant sympathy to her words, as she"
together in the room where Yolande was lying.
"""This is a most curious case, my dear Trepard,"" began Dick, speaking in"
"French--""a case of coma, which I have mistaken for death;"" and,"
"continuing, he briefly explained how the patient had been found in a"
state so closely resembling death that he himself had been deceived.
"The old Frenchman placed his hand upon her heart, and, withdrawing it,"
said:
"""She's breathing now."""
"""Breathing!""  I echoed.  ""Then she is recovering!"""
"""Yes, old fellow,"" Dick replied, ""she is recovering--at least we hope we"
"shall save her.""  Then, turning to his colleague, he raised her hand and"
"pointed to the finger-nails, asking: ""Do you notice anything there?"""
"The other, adjusting his pince-nez, bent and examined, them one by one."
"""Yes,"" he answered at last.  ""A slight purple discoloration at the base"
"of the nails."""
"""And upon the lower lip does anything strike you as peculiar?"""
"""A yellow mark,"" he answered, after carefully inspecting the spot"
indicated.
"""And there?""  Deane asked, touching the mark upon the neck."
"""Very strange!"" ejaculated the elder man.  ""It is a most unusual case."""
"Thus died a monster of cruelty, who would, had he lived to-day, have been"
confined in an asylum for lunatics.
NEAL.
A fisherman of Cork.
"Mutinied in a French ship sailing from Cork to Nantes in 1721, and, under"

and became a pirate.

"life he bought him a captaincy in the Militia and a fine farm, where young"
"Nelson married and settled down. Buying a schooner, he used to sail to"
Halifax with cargoes of potatoes and fruit. He seems to have liked these
"trips in which he combined business with pleasure, for we learn that on"
"these visits to Halifax he ""was very wild, and drank and intrigued with"
"the girls in an extravagant manner."" Getting into disgrace on Prince"
"of exhaustion. She stirred now with a little cry. ""What is it?"""
"""It's morning--daylight. See--there--"""
"""Oh--h!"" Pola whimpered. ""Is that all?"" She clung to Sidney in fresh"
"terror. ""If we're going to die--I'd rather not _see_--"""
"""Hark,"" cried Mart, suddenly leaning forward. ""Don't you hear"
"something? Girls, that's a motor boat! I _know_! Quick. Let's signal!"
"Yell! Wave something! _Anything!_"" She sprang to her feet, leaning her"
body against the rail for support as the boat rolled in the heavy sea.
"She cupped her hands to her lips and shouted lustily. ""Come on, girls!"""
she commanded.
"""Maybe it's the pirates,"" wailed Pola."
"""I don't care if it is! I don't care _what_ it is!"" And Mart and Sidney"
lifted their chorus.
"Out of the mist that lay over the surging water a small, gray object"
gradually shaped. The chug-chug of an engine now came distinctly to
their ears. After a little they could make out the forms of two men
standing. And then someone shouted faintly.
"Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face, clung to Sidney."
"""Girls,"" she whispered, ""We're going to be saved! And I'll never forget"
this night--never. Or you two. Or what you've done! Or what you _are_.
"And I'm never going to get over being ashamed of myself!"""
Sidney had some solemn resolutions of her own shaping in her heart but
the moment gave her no time to pronounce them.
"""Am I he who slew Raniero Frangipani?"""
"""Courage!"" said the duke."
"""My blood is as water, my heart as wax. Death and destiny are over my"
"head!"""
"""Speak not to me of destiny and look not to the skies! I have closed"
my account with Heaven! In himself is man's power! You have broken the
crucifix! Now trust your own soul. So long as you did serve a
"superstition had you lost your true heaven!"""
"""And yet--"""
"""You have played the god, and the Father in Heaven must love you for"
your strength! God does not love a coward! He will let you rule your
"destiny--not destiny your soul!"""
"""Strange words--"""
"""But true! Were I God, should I love the monk puling prayers in a den?"
Nay--that man should I choose who dared to follow the dictates of his
own soul and strangle Fate with the grip of truth. Great deeds are
"better than mumbled prayers!"""
The horseman in the valley had swept at a gallop through a sea of
"sun-bronzed fern. His eyes were full of a restless glitter, as the"
"eyes of a man, whose heart is troubled. He sprang from the saddle,"
"and, leading his horse by the bridle, bent low before the twain."
"""Tidings, my lord!"""
leaned far back in his arms.
"""No,"" was the man's truthful answer."
"""Oh, how glad I am! Take me--ah, take me I don't care where as long as"
"it is with you!"" cried the Girl in an ecstasy of delight."
"""So help me, God, I'm going to . . .!"" promised Johnson, his voice"
"strained, tense. ""You're worth something better than me, Girl,"" he"
"added, a moment later, ""but they say love works miracles every hour,"
that it weakens the strong and strengthens the weak. With all my soul I
"love you, with all my soul I--"" The man let his voice die out, leaving"
"his sentence unfinished. Suddenly he called: ""Why, Min-Minnie!"""
"""I wasn't really asleep,"" spoke up the Girl, blinking sleepily. ""I'm"
"jest so happy an' let down, that's all."" The next moment, however, she"
was forced to acknowledge that she was awfully sleepy and would have to
say good-night.
"""All right,"" said Johnson, rising, and kissed her good-night."
"""That's your bed over there,"" she told him, pointing in the direction of"

One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy at
"Charleston on November 8th, 1718, and found ""not guilty."""
"NONDRE, PEDRO."
"Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. At the time of execution"
it was observed that he was covered with the marks of deep wounds. On the
"scaffold he wept bitterly. An immensely heavy man, he broke the rope, and"
had to be hanged a second time.
"NORMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"Served under Morgan in 1670, and after the fall of Chagres Fort, Norman"
"was left in charge with 500 men to hold it, while Morgan crossed the"
"isthmus to attack Panama. Norman soon ""sent forth to sea two boats to"
"exercise piracy."" These hoisted Spanish colours and met a big Spanish"
"merchant ship on the same day. They chased the ship, which fled for safety"
"into the Chagres River, only to be caught there by Norman. She proved a"
"valuable prize, being loaded with all kinds of provisions, of which the"
garrison was in sore need.
"NORTH, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL."
"Born in Bermuda, and by profession a lawyer, Captain North was a man of"
"remarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great"
"notoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written"
"“_Allons d’ici_,” she whispered, turning a terrified glance around."
The man raised his hat to his companions and signed to her to come. He
"was a handsome, careless, dissipated-looking fellow, with curly hair and"
a twirled black moustache; short and slightly made. He wore a Tyrolese
hat and a very low turned-down collar and a great silk bow outside
his waistcoat. There was a devil-may-care charm in his swagger as
he walked--also an indefinable touch of vulgarity; the type of the
_cabotin_ in easy circumstances.
"Yvonne, more dead than alive, followed him through the deserted _salle"
"des jeux_ on to the quiet bit of verandah, and sank into a chair that he"
"offered. She looked at him, still white to the lips."
“You?”
"“Yes,” he said laughingly, “why not? It is not astonishing.”"
"“But I thought you dead!” gasped Yvonne, trembling."
"“_A la bonne heure!_ And I seem a ghost. Oh, I am solid. Pinch me. But"
how did you come to learn? Ah! I remember it was given out in Paris. A
"_canard_. It was in the hospital--paralysis, _ma chère_. See, I can only"
"just move my arm now. _Cétait la verte, cette sacrée verte--_”"
"“Absinthe?” asked Yvonne, almost mechanically."
"He nodded, went through the motions of preparing the drink, and laughed."
"“I had a touch lately,” he went on. “That was the second. The third I"
shall be _prrrt--flambé!_ They tell me to give it up. Never in life.”
"""Wouldn't it be a good idea to call him again? It's rather important!"""
"""Oh, you think we shouldn't have gone out in a storm like this? I've"
"been dreadfully uneasy!"""
"""No danger at all,"" I declared, with affected indifference, adding: ""The"
"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"
where the door had swung back showing an empty bunk.
"""Why, he's up, after all,"" she glanced over her shoulder at me."
"""I believe he is,"" I idiotically affirmed."
"""But where?""--this more to herself."
"""Hiding, maybe,"" I ventured, taking a facetious squint about."
"""Hiding?"" she asked, in mild surprise."
"""Er--playing a trick on us! He's a funny old dog at tricks!"""
"""Funny old dog?"" She drew slightly away from me. ""Do you mean my father,"
"Mr.--er?"""
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""
"commented Sonora, still smarting under the Girl's reprimand."
"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"
"we've got him,"" said Rance, triumphantly. ""But the last seen of"
"Johnson,"" he went on with a hasty movement towards the Girl and eyeing"
"her critically, ""he was heading this way. You seen anything of him?"""
The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."
"""One o' our dollar Havanas! Good Lord, he's here!"" he muttered to"
himself.
"""Rance is right. Where was he goin'?"" was the question with which he was"

"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""

"her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed."
"“Don’t you understand?” said Maxwell, restively. “I want you to marry"
"me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a"
minute when things had slackened up a bit. They’re calling me for the

The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with
amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she
"smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about"
the broker’s neck.

stars appeared and disappeared.
We drew our breakfast and packed up our belongings. All was confusion in
the hut.
"We paraded, the roll was called, and as the day began to dawn we marched"
off.
"We passed down the main road in long, swaying columns of fours. We left"
the woodyard behind us and hoped it would be destroyed--how we hated the
place for the dreary months we had spent there! The westward stream of
"refugees had ceased, but an eastward stream of French infantry and field"
artillery thronged the roads. The artillerymen were mostly tall and
powerfully built. The infantry were nearly all elderly men of poor
physique. They looked desperately miserable. We exchanged greetings:
"""It's a good war!"""
"""C'est une bonne guerre!"""
And then we broke into song:
"""Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, _Oh_ it's a lovely war!"""
"The French did not sing, but we, who were escaping destruction, passed"
from one song to another:

_CORNERS OF ROME_
"They went back to the carriage, and having crossed through the centre of"
"Rome, got out in front of the Farnese Palace."
"“I will be out inside of ten minutes,” said Kennedy."
The Farnese Palace aroused great admiration in Cæsar; he had never
"passed it before. By one of the fountains in the _piazza,_ he stood"
"gazing at the huge square edifice, which seemed to him like a die cut"
from an immense block of stone.
"“This really gives me an impression of grandeur and force,” he said to"
himself. “What a splendid palace! It looks like an ancient knight in
"full armour, looking indifferently at everything, sure of his own"
worth.”
"Cæsar walked from one end of the _piazza_ to the other, absorbed in the"
majestic pile of stone.
Kennedy surprised him in his contemplation.
“Now will you say that you are a good philistine?”
"“Ah, well, this palace is magnificent. Here are grandeur, strength,"
overwhelming force.”
"“Yes, it is magnificent; but very uncomfortable, my French colleagues"
tell me.”
companions?”
"“All we know about it is that they’re not here,” replied Jimmie."
"“There are altogether too many bears in this forest,” suggested Gilroy."
“The lads may have encountered some of them.”
“That’s a fact!” laughed Jimmie. “Perhaps we’d better go out and see if
we can find a group of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.”
"“This is a serious matter,” Ned interrupted. “Judging from our own"
"experiences, the boys may be having a bad time of it.”"
“The outlaws are none too good to commit murder!” Jimmie asserted.
CHAPTER XI
THE DEVIL’S PUNCH BOWL
"“See here, boys,” Frank Shaw suggested, as the three boys moved on"
"through the forest, almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,"
"“this will be a fine story for Dad’s newspaper. ‘Captured by Bold, Bad"
"Men; or, Why Little Frankie Didn’t Get Home to His Beans’! That would be"
"a fine title for the story, and I’ll ask Dad to print a picture of three"
boys wandering through a jungle surrounded by a bunch of cheap skates
that no decent dog would bark at.”
“Keep still!” whispered Harry. “What’s the use of stirring these people
up? We’re in no shape to scrap with them!”
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my
"family--never!  It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!"""
Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"
and the sound of her words:

CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.
"Asiatic countries. We are said to be the successors of the Tartars, at"

"'I am sure,' added Baron Suyematsu, in a final word, 'that Europe will"
"soon find its fears about the ""spectre of Japan"" are all ill-founded."

hope to see her colonies in the same frame of mind. I hope the

THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and
spoke.
"""He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know,"
"your turn will come next,"" sobbed Greca. ""Oh! Why does not The Great"
"White One strike these monsters to the dust!"""
She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was
dragged roughly away.
The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into
place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and
the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind
to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray
desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he
would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.
CHAPTER V
_The Torture Chamber_
"Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the"
arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the
"procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching"
Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his
mouthpiece.
“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
religious music.
"“Spain is the place for all that,” said Kennedy. “Here in Italy the"
"Church ceremonies are too gay. Not so in Spain; at Toledo, at Burgos,"
"there is an austerity in the cathedrals, an unworldliness....”"
"“Yes,” said Cæsar; “unhappily we have nothing left there but"
"ceremonies. At the same time, the people are dying of hunger.”"
"They discussed whether it is better to live in a decorative, esthetic"
"sphere, or in a more humble and practical one; and Susanna and Kennedy"
stood up for the superiority of an esthetic life.
As they left the hotel Cæsar said to Kennedy:
“Allow me a question. Have you any intentions concerning Mrs.
Marchmont?”
“Why do you ask?”
"“Simply because I shouldn’t go to see her often, so as not to be in the"
way.”
“Thank you ever so much. But I have no intentions in relation to her.
She is too beautiful and too rich a woman for a modest employee like me
to fix his eyes on.”
“Bah! A modest diplomat! That is absurd. It is merely that you don’t
take to her.”
“No. It’s because she is a queen. There ought to be some defect in her
face to make her human.”
"“Now, now,” said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs. “Chuck it,"
Blotte--you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker.... Lor!” he
"yawned, “this is precious slow.” He yawned again: “Paul Pangbutt’s a"
"confounded long time, ain’t he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!”"
"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily
"locks,” he cried--“no more grease-spots on dingy grey tablecloths that"
hide their offences under smiling napkins!... To-night I shall be
waited upon by the gods.... Never again the boiled potato; never again
"the homely bun, damn them!... This is the night of life--a night for"
"music and gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain----”"
"Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:"
"“Stop it, Blotte. Aren’t you well, old man?”"
Blotte laughed:
“Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives to-night. And I
go off--to sup with the gods.... The world has forgotten Andrew Blotte.”
"Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:"
"“I say, boys,” said he--“as it’s to be a unique night, and Blotte"
"about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the morning----”"
"Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:"
"“Oh, yes,” he growled--“I shall be in the papers to-morrow. Have no"
fear of it.”
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"
being told in that room--”
"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
Rays of the afternoon sun in a glimmer across the trees;
"Glittering moist underfoot, the long alley. The firs, one by one,"
"Catch and conceal, as I saunter, and flash in a dazzle of gold"

At I wait for my love in the fir-tree alley alone with the sun.

incidentally illustrate the moral attitude of the dreamer.
A lady narrated the following dream immediately on awakening: 'I had

had come in great agony to my husband with her shoes and watch-chain. He
"promised to help me, and while I was wondering what could be done for"
"the benefit of the woman's family, some one came in and announced that a"
"lecture was about to be given on the beauty of nakedness. I then went,"
with several prim and respectable ladies of my acquaintance [the names
"were given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who--so far as appearance"
"is concerned--was a well-known Member of Parliament, then entered and"
"gave a most eloquent address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc."
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason people are shocked at
nakedness is that they usually only see unbeautiful bodies which repel
"them because they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand, and"
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
"Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come before the name), as"
"_Hon., Mrs., Rev._, etc., should in the heading be placed before"
"the Christian name (as _Smith, Capt. John_), and suffixes as"
"_Jr., D.D., LL.D._, after it (as _Channing, James Ellery, D.D._)."
"Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name, as _Derby,"
"Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of_; but British courtesy titles (i.e.,"
"those given to the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede,"
"as _Wellesley, Lord Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)_. In"
"other languages than English, French, and German the title usually"
"precedes the forename; as, _Alfieri, Conte Vittorio_. Occasionally a"
"French nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames; as,"
"_Gasparin, Comte Agénor de_."
_Lord_ should be replaced by the exact title in the names of English
"noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay should be entered as _Macaulay, 1st"
baron_. _Lord_ in the title of Scotch judges follows the family name;
"as, _Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord_."
"The title Baronet is given in the form _Scott, Sir Walter, bart._"
"Patronymic phrases, as _of Dedham_, follow all the names; but they must"
immediately follow the family name when they are always used in close
"connection with it, as _Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe_; similarly"
"_aîné_, _fils_, _jeune_, as _Dumas fils, Alexandre_; _Didot fils,"
Ambroise_. Latin appellatives should not in general be separated from
"their nouns by a comma; as, _Caesar Heisterbacensis_."
"The name of a king's wife should be written thus: _Charlotte, Queen,"
"consort of George III of England_. _Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of"
Henry VIII of England._
"Andrews said scornfully, ""Without a doubt, a man of your age and build"
"could wipe up the lifeship with me."""
"Norton chuckled. ""Don't count on your age being good protection,"
Andrews. You may push me far enough to make me forget that you're a
"decrepit old man who has to buy what your physique can't get you."""
"""Now see here!"" roared Andrews."
*       *       *       *       *
He was stopped short by Norton who took one long step forward to grasp
"him by the coat lapels. Andrews' face went white, because he was"
looking into the face of dark anger. Norton's other hand was clenched
"in a large, tight fist. He eyed the older man sourly for a minute, then"
shoved him backward to collapse in a chair.
"""What are you trying to do?"" sneered Norton. ""Make me mad enough to"
clip you so you can yell 'Foul!'? I know as well as you do that the law
doesn't even recognize taunts and tongue-lashings as contributory to
"assault."""
"Alice got up from her couch and stood between them. ""Stop it, both of"
"you!"" she cried. ""Stop it!"""
"Norton's anger subsided. ""All right,"" he said to Andrews. ""Now that"
"we've all had our lungs exercised, I'll go below and pedal that"
"generator. Alice, you can have the bathroom first. Andrews, you take it"
"with what she leaves. Is that okay?"""
"""Aren't you the hard-working little Boy Scout?"""
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"
astounded to attempt an answer to the questions hurled broadcast by the
"new-comers; then Marsh levelled a trembling finger at him and cried,"
hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"
"arrested."""
The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""

"83,672. He could not understand why men went to Japan and Canada instead"
of coming to India on better terms. It was a mystery to him. He thought
it was either sheer ignorance or the spread of the commercial spirit.

"a rule, keen and anxious to learn; he could not wish for better"
students.

PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.
"calmly, and added, with a sigh, ""I have no doubt he would have landed"
"you in rather an awkward fix ... had we not taken pity upon you."""
"""Ah!""  And the angry soldier raised his hand.  ""There are two of them"
"...  One of them discovered it, the other wrote the petition, the"
"accursed reporter!"""
"""Why the reporter?"""
"""He writes for the papers ...  He is one of your lodgers ... there they"
"all are outside ...  Clear them away, for Christ's sake!  The robbers!"
They disturb and annoy everyone in the street.  One cannot live for
them ... And they are all desperate fellows ...  You had better take
"care, or else they will rob or burn you ..."""
"""And this reporter, who is he?"" asked Petunikoff, with interest."
"""He?  A drunkard.  He was a teacher but was dismissed.  He drank"
everything he possessed ... and now he writes for the papers and
"composes petitions.  He is a very wicked man!"""
"""H'm!  And did he write your petition, too?  I suppose it was he who"
discovered the flaws in the building.  The beams were not rightly put
"in?"""
"""He did!  I know it for a fact!  The dog!  He read it aloud in here and"
"boasted, 'Now I have caused Petunikoff some loss!'"""
"""Ye--es...  Well, then, do you want to be reconciled?"""
"""To be reconciled?""  The soldier lowered his head and thought. ""Ah!"
"This is a hard life!"" said he, in a querulous voice, scratching his"
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
"He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to Ffolliott, a"
faint smile flickered over his worried face:
"“Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been domestic"
difficulties--my butler has gone sick.”
The guests were arriving fast.
“Mistair Maupassant Fosse!” bawled Rippley at the door.
"The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and tripped"
across to his host.
"“A nickname they have for me,” he said--“a nickname....”"
"Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig on one"
"side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he was going to"
sup with the gods; and he was gone.
Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into the studio.
"Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of"
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he heard his
"thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:"
“D’you know--I feel such an ass----”
Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:
"“Never mind,” said he absently--“it can’t be helped. Make the best of"
it.”
"""But the police?"" queried Boyd."
"""Oh, I squared them easy. It's you they want. Yes, sir, I _worked_."""
"Again he scanned their faces anxiously. ""I'm a scullery-maid."""
"""What?"""
"""That's what I said. I've rustled garbage-cans till the smell of food"
"gives me a cold sweat. I'm as hungry as a starving Cuban, and yet the"
"sight of a knife and fork turns my stomach."" He wheeled suddenly upon"
"Alton Clyde, whose burst of shrill laughter offended him. ""Don't cry."
"Your sympathy unmans me."""
"""Tell us about it,"" urged Cherry."
"""What's the use?"" he demanded, with a glare at Clyde. ""That bone-head"
"wouldn't understand."""
"""Go ahead,"" Boyd seconded, with twitching lips. ""You look as if you had"
"worked, and worked hard."""
"""Hard? I'm the only man in the world who knows what hard work is!"""
"""Start at the beginning--when you were arrested."""
"""Well, I didn't care nothing about the sneeze,"" he took up the tale,"
"""for I figure it out that they can't slough me without clearing you, so"
"I never take no sleeping-powders, and, sure enough, about third"
"drink-time the bulls spring me, and I screw down the main stem to the"
"drink and get Jerry to your fade--"""
"“You are bothering me and preventing me from drinking my coffee,” he"
"said, with exquisite politeness, and touched the bell."
"“Be careful!” exclaimed the monk, seizing Cæsar’s arm with violence."
"“Don’t you touch me again,” said Cæsar, pulling away violently, his"
"face pale and his eyes flashing. “If you do, I have a revolver here with"
"five chambers, and I shall take pleasure in emptying them one by one,"
"taking that lighthouse you carry about for a nose, as my target.”"
“Fire it if you dare.”
Fortunately the waiter had come in on hearing the bell.
"“Do you wish anything, sir?” he asked."
"“Yes, please escort this clerical gentleman to the door, and tell him on"
the way not to come back here.”
Days later Cæsar found out that there had been a great disturbance at
the Altemps palace in consequence of the calls he had made. Preciozi
"had been punished and sent away from Rome, and the various Spanish"
monasteries and colleges warned not to receive Cæsar.

"“My dear Cæsar,” said Kennedy, “I believe it will be very difficult for"
"should be hastily sent away by his friends, what her father had"
"condemned her to, what manner of man he was; he must seem to destroy or"
impair the perfect sweetness of memory wherein she held her mother.
"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""
"""Who?"""
"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"
"mind, dear, you mustn't mind. Oh, you didn't think it would make any"
"difference to me, dear, did you? What do I care? Mrs. Puttock may care,"

"'It should be in this direction,' Steve said, with an accent of doubt."
'But I cannot see. We shall have the horses down.'
"'Let me go first,' I said."
"'We must not separate,' he answered hastily."
"'No, no,' I said, my teeth beginning to chatter. 'But are you sure"
that there is an eyot here?'
"'I did not go to it,' he answered, scratching his head. 'But I saw a"
"clump of willows rising well above the level, and they looked to me as"
if they grew on dry land.'
"He stood a moment irresolutely, first one and then another of the"
horses shaking itself till the women could scarcely keep their seats.
'Why do we not go on?' my lady asked in a low voice.
"'Because Steve is not sure of the place, my lady,' I said. 'And it is"
"almost impossible to move, it is so dark, and the osiers grow so"
closely. I doubt we should have waited until daylight.'
"'Then we should have run the risk of being intercepted,' she answered"
feverishly. 'Are you very wet?'
"'No,' I said, though my feet were growing numb, 'not very. I see what"
we must do. One of us must climb into a willow and look out.'
We had passed a small one not long before. I plashed my way back to
"confidence, all these fellows take themselves too seriously to-day."
Look at Rippley! he’s utterly uncultured--he hasn’t an aitch in his
composition.”
Gomme nodded:
"“But there isn’t an aitch in composition,” he said demurely."
"“N-no.” Fosse stammered, becoming nervous. “But he can’t even pronounce"
the names of the ancients whose gods he models!”
Gomme smiled:
“No--but he can model ’em.”

The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
"""They was here first,"" said Lampert obstinately."
"""But the hisland is British ground,"" urged Simcox, ""and where our"
flag flies no Frenchman can have the best.  We gives 'em liberty to
"trade, and they can take what's left.  What for have we always beat"
"'em if we're to give in now?"""
"""Continuosity of foreign politics is my motter,"" said the skipper."
"""With continuosity and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'"
"this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and evacuate.  I shall send"
"hin my hultimatum this very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be"
"hambassador."""
Simcox looked anxious.
"""Well, captain, I was thinking it would be judicious policy to send"
in the Dutchman.  It will remind them that Europe is more or less
"agin them, and to have a Dutchman here will make 'em think twice"
"afore they elects for war."""
The skipper shook his head.
"""No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the surface, but takin' deeper"
"thought it ain't.  It would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy."
"We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin' anythin' unpleasin'"
more'n askin' for our rights.  And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to
remind 'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat 'em.  And
moreover it's accordin' to no tradition I've heard of to send a
"furriner as hambassador.  No, Simcox, you shall go.  I'll draw up the"
"hultimatum at once."""
ever-increasing recklessness--began presently to possess us. Once or
"twice I had to check the foremost, or they would have outrun the rear;"
"and this kind of race brought us gradually into such a state of alarm,"
"that by-and-by, when the line came to a sudden stop on the brow of a"
"gentle descent, I could hardly restrain my impatience."
'What is it?' I asked eagerly. 'Why are we stopping?' Surely the road
is good enough here.'
"No one answered, but it was significant that on the instant one of the"
women began to cry.
'Stop that folly!' I said. 'What is in front there? Cannot some one
speak?'
"'The Waldgrave thinks that he hears horsemen before us,' Fraulein Max"
answered.
In another moment the Waldgrave's figure loomed out of the darkness.
"'Martin,' he said--I noticed that his voice shook--'go forward. They"
"are in front. Man alive, be quick!' he continued fiercely. 'Do you"
want to have them into us?'
"I left my girl's rein, and pushing past the women and Fraulein, joined"
"Steve, who was standing by my lady's rein. 'What is it?' I said."
"'Nothing, I think,' he answered in an uncertain tone."
"I stood a moment listening, but I too could hear nothing. I began to"
argue with him. 'Who heard it?' I asked impatiently.
"'The Waldgrave,' he answered."
"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS."
Sailed with Colonel Edward Morgan to attack St. Eustatius and Saba
shot out just as the door opened behind Slyne's back and a voice
announced:
"""M. Dubois."""
CHAPTER XV
THE LAW--AND THE PROFITS
Sallie saw how Jasper Slyne's face blanched at sight of that very
"untimely intruder, whose keen eyes seemed to take in the situation there"
at a glance.
"Mr. Jobling had fallen backward into a convenient armchair and, with"
"both hands clapped to his nose, was moaning most piteously. Captain Dove"
"was standing over him, with features inflamed, in a very bellicose"
"posture and glaring at the new-comer, toward whom Slyne had turned"
inquiringly.
"""You're--looking for some one, M. Dubois?"" Slyne asked, in a tone of"
"polite surprise, which, Sallie knew, was assumed."
"""A thousand pardons,"" returned that individual. ""I am indeed looking for"
"some one--whom I thought to find here. I had no intention, however, of"
"intruding upon a lady--"" He bowed profusely to Sallie. ""It may be,"" he"
"suggested, ""that I have mistaken the number. Is not this the suite 161?"""
"""One hundred and sixty,"" Slyne told him, and evidently did not think it"
"“I know you are an angel—oh, hang it! You do make me feel as if you"
_were_ my mother.”
"“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I shall believe that you are a tyrant.”"
"“A tyrant? I? Horri—no, I wish I was. What a model of propriety you"
are! I never should have thought it—I mean—darling! you were always
"such a coquette, you know. Not that I ever thought so. You know I never"
"did—oh, hang it all—but if I let you have your own way in this"
unreasonable—I mean this perfectly natural whim—you might at least
"promise to marry me in a month. And, indeed, I think that if you are an"
"angel, I am a saint.”"
"“Well, on one condition.”"
“Any! Any!”
“It must be an absolute secret until the wedding is over. I hate
"congratulations, and if we are going to have a sensation we might as"
well have a good concentrated one.”
"“I agree with you, and I’ll never find fault with you again. You—”"
Miss Decker almost ran into the room.
"“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr. Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother"
"has one of her terrible attacks, and I must ask you to stay with her"
while I go for the doctor myself. I cannot trust servants.”
“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy. “I’ll bring him back in a quarter
of an hour. Who shall—”
The staff-paymaster spoke seriously. The man was heart and soul in
"his work, and his mental horizon was bounded by official forms and"
other red-tapeism connected with the accountant branch of H.M.
Service.
"""By the by,"" interposed Oswestry, ""Staggles ought to be recommended"
"for the V.C."""
"""What's that, Torps?"" asked Barracombe. ""Our staff-paymaster the"
"V.C.?"""
"""What for?"" inquired the staff-paymaster innocently."
The commander entrenched himself behind a double number of an
illustrated periodical.
"""For bringing Mephisto in out of action,"" he replied with a chuckle."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE FOILED AIR RAID.

THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the
west.

"""Sure."""

"""Oh, I fixed that up long ago. I am going to bunk with the steward."""
"""Well, why in the world didn't you let us know you were coming?"""
"""Say, don't kid yourself. You knew I couldn't stay behind."" Fraser blew"
"a cloud of smoke airily. ""I never start anything I can't finish, I keep"
"telling you, and I'm going to put this deal through, now that I've got"

"much good to myself or anybody else, but I like you and I want to stick"
"around. Maybe I'll come in useful yet--you can't tell."""
"Emerson had never glimpsed this side of the man's nature, and it rather"
surprised him.
"""Of course you can come along, old man,"" he responded, heartily. ""We're"
"glad to have you."""
To one who has never witnessed the spring sailing of a Northern

and said:

If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."

"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:

We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"

Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"

Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:

Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.

"hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning, ran lightly up the wharf"
toward her mother.
"Sidney's eyes followed her, devouring her dainty clothes, the"
"tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled pumps. Pola--the Pola she had"
"carried enshrined in her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She"
"had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere, had planned just what it"

had turned a shoulder upon it.
Mart's laugh behind her roused her.
"""Who's Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her just in time--we might a"
"hurt the doll-baby!"""
"Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. ""She's a friend of mine,"" she cried, in"
"a voice she made rough to keep the tears from it. ""And she's _not_ a"
"doll-baby."""
"""All right--go and play with her then--she's crazy about you, I guess."""
"And with that Mart swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in the"
air.
Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide her humiliation and her
"""Yes, yes; that's nothing!  Don't cry--don't cry!"""
"Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but"
still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down.  Gyp felt
"paralyzed.  The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of"
mutton--creeping!
"At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving"
"for sugar-plums, murmured:"
"""It's you he--he--really loves all the time.  And you don't love"
"him--that's what's so funny--and--and--I can't understand it.  Oh, Mrs."
"Fiorsen, if I could see him--just see him!  He told me never to come"
again; and I haven't dared.  I haven't seen him for three weeks--not
"since I told him about IT.  What shall I do?  What shall I do?"""
His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
"crawl back to a man who had spurned her.  Unconsciously, she had drawn"
"herself up and pressed her lips together.  The girl, who followed every"
"movement, said piteously:"
"""I don't seem to have any pride.  I don't mind what he does to me, or"
"what he says, if only I can see him."""
Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity.  She said:
"""How long before?"""
"""Three months."""
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"
Sam Doolittle start for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
"a blow for Sam didn't waste steps. ""'Tisn't likely Letty Vine'll _go_"
"to Truro tonight."""
"""But I'll _see_ if she's going, anyway,"" Sidney had cried and had raced"
"off, a sweater over her arm."
"""I wish I could tell her how very important it is and then she'd"
"understand, but I can't for maybe she wouldn't understand,"" Sidney"
thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
But the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him.
"From this day they became friends, and the ""creatures that once were"
"men,"" seeing them together, said: ""The teacher is friendly with Tyapa"
...  He wishes his money. Kuvalda must have put this into his head ...
"To look about to see where the old man's fortune is ..."""
Probably they did not believe what they said.  There was one strange
"thing about these men, namely, that they painted themselves to others"
worse than they actually were.  A man who has good in him does not mind
sometimes showing his worse nature.

"When all these people were gathered round the teacher, then the reading"
of the newspaper would begin.
"""Well, what does the newspaper discuss to-day?  Is there any"
"feuilleton?"""
"""No,"" the teacher informs him."
"""Your publisher seems greedy ... but is there any leader?"""
"""There is one to-day....  It appears to be by Gulyaeff."""
"""Aha!  Come, out with it.  He writes cleverly, the rascal."""

"would go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit"
large sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had
"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"
girls.
For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"
"built himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from"
"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.
"TOMKINS, JOHN."
Of Gloucestershire.
Hanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's
crew.
"TOPPING, DENNIS."
"He shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company"
with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"
"Sawney."""
"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"
their ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of
Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."
"SCOT, ROGER."
"occasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab"
"village, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,"
"as, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by"
"a treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this"
"cold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:"
thus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable
"man, who had always been the natives' best friend."
"NORTON, GEORGE."
"One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the"
Star Tavern at Boston.
"NUTT, JOHN."
One of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the
_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.
OCHALI. Barbary renegade.
In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.
"ODELL, SAMUEL."
"""My lord,"" she said, kneeling at his feet, ""God save and comfort"
"you!""--"
The man's brow was twisted into furrows. His right hand clasped his
"left wrist. He looked over the woman's head into the woods, and"
breathed fast through clenched teeth.
"""Speak!"" he said."
"""My lord, the woman lives!"""
"""I can bear the truth!"""
The anchoress made the sign of the cross.
"""She came to us here in the valley, my lord, tall and white as a lily,"
"her hair loose upon her neck. Her feet were bare and bleeding, her"
"soles rent with thorns. And as she came, she sang wild snatches of a"
"song, such as tells of love, and of Proserpina, Goddess of Shades. We"
"took her, my lord, gave her meat and drink, bathed her torn feet, and"
"gave her raiment. She abode with us, ever gentle and lovely, yet"
"speaking like one who had suffered, even to the death. And yet,--even"
"as we slept, she stole away from us last night, and now is gone!""--"
The woman had never so much as raised her eyes to the man's face. Her
"hands held her crucifix, and she was ashen pale, even as new-hewn"
stone.
"""And is this all?"""
The man's voice trembled in his throat. His face was terrible to
"""Solem has gone now,"" Josephine replied."
"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.
Why should I listen to him still pleading with her?
"""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow."""
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"
"Gunner on board ""Blackbeard's"" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on"
"November 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant"
Maynard.
"MULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet"
played havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New
England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"

Tennyson and read aloud the idyll of Lancelot and Elaine. And the
"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.

"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"
"theological works dear to the hearts of his sect. I gave him the box,"
telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.
George translated it thus:--

"But Slyne was already beyond the doorway, fumbling with a last button."
"""If you believe I've come here to talk simply for the sake of talking,"""
"said he with sombre magnificence, ""I needn't waste any more breath on"
"you. Good-bye."""
"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.

ABERDEEN: THE UNIVERSITY PRESS
[Transcriber's Notes:
This book contains a number of misprints.
The following misprints have been corrected:
"to have been particularly active in helping to take a Dutch merchantman,"
"the _Gertruycht_. Hanged in chains at Cape Coast Castle in April, 1722, at"
the age of 23.
"SWAN, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."
"SWITZER, JOSEPH."
Of Boston in New England.
"Tried for piracy at Rhode Island in 1723, but found to be ""not guilty."""
gilded by my father's abundant generosity.
We sat late after dinner. Somewhere in the hall Bilkins hovered with
glasses and tray to be on hand when the whistles began their screaming.
In twenty years he had not omitted this New Year's Eve ceremony.
"""Your wound never troubles you?"" my mother asked, her solicitation over"
a scratch I had received ten months before not disguising a light of
pride that charmed me.
"""I've forgotten it, Mater. Never amounted to anything."""
"""Still, you did leave some blood on French soil,"" Dad spoke up, for this"
conceit appealed to him.
"""Enough to grow an ugly rose, perhaps,"" I admitted."
"""I'll bet you grew pretty ones on the cheeks of those French girls,"" he"
chuckled.
"""Pretty ones don't grow any more, on cheeks or anywhere else,"" I"
"doggedly replied. ""Materialism's the keynote now--that's why I'm going"
"back to work, at once."""
"""Oh,"" the Mater laughed, ""don't think of your father's stupid office,"
"yet!"""
"""There's nothing left to think of,"" I grumbled."
"""Isn't there?"" he exclaimed. ""What'd you say if Gates has the yacht in"
"commission, and you take a run down to Miami----"""
"unveiling, I am too thrilled.”"
He kept button-holing Pangbutt:
"“Too thrilled to--er--I am thrilled, sir, thrilled, as indeed is"
"Charlotte--oh, ah, yes--Charlotte!” He searched about behind him for"
"the little old lady, who moved up to his side. “Oh, ah, yes--there"
"you are, Charlotte! Allow me to introduce Mr. Pangbutt, our host."
"May I ask, sir, if Mr. Anthony Bickersteth has yet arrived? No?..."
"How fortunate! How very fortunate!... Charlotte, I am becoming quite"
excited.”
Pangbutt led them to chairs.
Two richly-dressed ladies of an age that discovers as much as is
"concealed by considerable dressing, hesitated at the door; and one,"
taking a last amused glance over her shoulder at some incident that
"passed upon the stairs below, tittered, and, turning, swept the room"
with keen regard through her raised lorgnettes.
“How amusin’! how absolutely amusin’!” she crooned. “I like literary
and artistic people _so_ much.”
"“Yes,” said the other, “they are _so_ different to one’s own class...."
And actresses _dress_ so well!”
"She flung back an elaborate head of jewels, and whispered something to"
the lady of the lorgnettes.
The lady of the lorgnettes laughed:
“Really?” said she
And
"""Far, far from Ypers,"

and all the other songs familiar to every soldier in the British army.
We marched all day along straight roads running in between flat fields
and past ugly little villages. As we grew tired and footsore our
rollicking spirit abated and the singing died down.
Towards nightfall we halted in a large meadow with a pond in one corner.
"Several lorries loaded with tents were waiting for us. We unloaded them,"
"pitched the tents, crept into them, and went to bed."
The rumble of the cannonade sounded faintly in the far distance.
"""I reckon it's a bloody shame to let the other Tommies and the"
"Frenchies...."""
The voice seemed to die away into a drawl as weariness overcame me. I
"continued to hear the sound of words for a little while, but they"
with uneasy feet on the lopsided deck.
"""They're standin' upon the 'ill as thick as pea-sticks,"" said one of"
the boys.
"""Speak hup,"" roared the skipper."
The crew shoved old Mac in front.
"""We've revolved the notion up and over,"" said Mac, ""and we've come to"
"the conclusion, sir, there ain't nothin' to be got by sendin'"
"ignorant men like we on such errands."""
The skipper hiccupped angrily.
"""Who asted you to think?  But I ain't the man to press unwilling"
"lubbers into goin' aloft, _I_ can lead the way.  Go into the"
"fo'castle, you dogs, and consider yourselves under arrest.  Go!"""
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, ""but we're all in our own custody, so we"
"are.  Now what's the old man goin' to do?"""
They watched him from the fo'castle as he staggered into his own part
of the ship.
"""I'll be my own hambassador,"" said Jones.  ""I'll show 'em 'ow to work"
things with dignity; I'll show that ass Lampert what's o'clock.  What
"you wants in such cases made and provided is tact, and go, and"
innerds.  Innerds is the chief need.  Why fight if palaver'll do?
Where I was wrong was to send a galoot like Simcox.  But what could I
"do but work the best with the tools I 'ad?  If I'd gone myself, we'd"
"'ave made peace afore there was a row."""

"a Dictionary Catalogue,""[49] prepared for library cataloguing. Such"
"portion as applies to book indexing has been freely drawn upon, adapted"
and added to from the present writer's experience.
ARRANGEMENT
"When, under a single entry, there are both subject-references and"
"references by folios only, place the folio-references together at the"
"end of the entry, following the subject-references."
"Arrange entries according to the English alphabet, whatever the order"
of the alphabet in which a foreign name might have been entered in its
original language.
"Arrange German names spelled with the vowels ä, ö, ü as if spelled ae,"
"oe, ue, but retain the form employed by the author."
"When the same word serves for several kinds of entries, the order"
"should be as follows: person, place, subject, title: e.g., (1) _Brown,"
G. F._ (person). (2) _Brown Village_ (place). (3) _Brown-tail Moth_
"(subject). (4) _Brown Family, the_ (title)."
"Forenames precede surnames: e.g., _Francis I_ precedes _Francis,"
Charles_.
"Brand laughed. ""Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward"
"a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old"
"boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately."""
*       *       *       *       *
"Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. ""The red spot! That's where Coblenz and"
"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"
"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!

MAQUILLAGE.
"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,"
"Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,"
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light
"Gracile and creamy white and rose,"
"Complexioned like the flower of dawn,"
Her fleeting colours are as those
"That, from an April sky withdrawn,"
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.

"THE pink and black of silk and lace,"
Flushed in the rosy-golden glow
Of lamplight on her lifted face;
"Powder and wig, and pink and lace,"
And those pathetic eyes of hers;
"""Do you remember Pancorbo?"" said Ramon Garcia."
"Rollo could not hear the answer, but he caught the outlaw's next"
question.
"""And have you forgotten El Sarria, who, having a certain Miguelete under"
"the point of his knife, let him go for his sweetheart's sake, because"
"she was waiting for him down in the valley?"""
"The sentry's reply was again inaudible, but Rollo was fully awake now."
"Ramon Garcia had not abandoned hope, and why should he? When there was"
"anything to be done, none could be so alert as Rollo Blair."
"""I am El Sarria the outlaw,"" Ramon went on, ""and these are my"
"companions. We are no traitors, but good Carlists to a man. Our papers"
"are----"""
"Here the words were spoken so low that Rollo could not hear more, but"
the next moment he was nudged by Ramon on the leg.
"""Write a note to Concha Cabezos, telling her to bring the papers here at"
"once if she would save our lives. You are sure she is faithful?"""
"""I am sure!"" said Rollo, who really had no reason for his confidence"
except the expression in her eyes.
"He had no paper, but catching the sentry's eye, he nodded across to"
where Etienne was still diligently rolling cigarettes.
"""Alcoy?"" he whispered."
"The sentry shouldered his piece and took a turn or two across the floor,"
"""A man always says, 'who was the first one?' but the girl says, 'who'll"
"be the next one?'"" she returned, as she carefully laid the roses in her"
bureau drawer.
"""But the time comes when there never will be a next one."""
"""No?"""
"""No."""
"""I'd hate to stake my pile on that,"" observed the Girl, drily. She blew"
up each glove as it came off and likewise carefully laid them away in
the bureau drawer.
"By this time Wowkle's soft tread had ceased, her duties for the night"
"were over, and she stood at the table waiting to be dismissed."
"""Wowkle, git to your wigwam!"" suddenly ordered her mistress, watching"
her until she disappeared into the cupboard; but she did not see the
Indian woman's lips draw back in a half-grin as she closed the door
behind her.
"""Oh, you're sending her away! Must I go, too?"" asked Johnson, dismally."
"""No--not jest yet; you can stay a--a hour or two longer,"" the Girl"
informed him with a smile; and turning once more to the bureau she
busied herself there for a few minutes longer.
Johnson's joy knew no bounds; he burst out delightedly:

Your bandages will be removed today.
Can you please be clear?

Are you able to see?

Well.
Take this.
What is this?
- It's a calendar.
Read it.
And this is a diary.
"Dear, I just want you to begin a new life."
And record each moment of your life in this diary.
Okay?
"Yes, mom."
I will write.
Anything else?
"And yes, tell Pia I miss her a lot."
"Yes, mom."
"Mumbai, yeah!"
Come on.
"Coming, Pia."
Two minutes.
And how is it going in Jaipur?
Everything is fine.
Jaipur is still the same old Jaipur.
How are mom and dad?

Very good.
Yeah?
- Excuse me.

Two hours ago he was my boyfriend.
You will never change.

"I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, SAM."
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU FOUND HIM SO QUICKLY.
THAT'S AMAZING.
MY FRIEND SAM MAY HAVE BRUISED
"A COUPLE OF FEDERAL STATUTES ALONG THE WAY,"
BUT NOTHING A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA CAN'T SMOOTH OVER.
"WELL, HE WON'T GET IN TROUBLE?"
WE FOUND HIM.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.
IS THAT LOADED?
YEAH.
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA BRING THAT WHEN YOU GO GET JASPER, RIGHT?"
IT'LL BE FINE.
TRUST ME.
THIS IS IT?

I've really missed you over the years.
Me too.
You know you're the only person I was ever able to talk to.
After Jesse...
Why didn't you contact me when you came back ?
"You know, no bullshit, Pru."
Just the real reason.

A friend ?
"Yes, Slade, a friend."

He didn't seem too good the other night.
"Yeah he's fine, considering."

"-Hey, what's happening to you?"
-Are you okay?

"Wait, I think I know it."
-Doc Migs proposed to you?

-Yes!
And...she accepted my proposal.

How are you?
"The last time we e-mailed each other, you said you have a boyfriend, it's Ryan, isn't it?"
We've broken up.

"That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?"
"Oh, yes."
- Yes.
Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.
Wait!
Wait.
My ankle.
Don't you think you ought to look at that?
No.
"No, your ankle's all right."
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.
- That stops the circulation.
That's bad.
"- There, you see?"
You did find something.
"You are my doctor, aren't you?"
- Holy crap.
I knew it was you.
I haven't seen you in years.

"Hey, don't listen to everything this guy tells you."
You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round.
"Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes."
- Ass... hole.
"- Yeah, asshole."
"Okay, don't listen to anything he says."
He's a real creep.
Come here.
And... you're married.
I know.
"I keep looking down at my hand like, ""What the hell?"""
"And, um... you're living in a big house out in Gladwynne now?"
It's crazy.
It's got nine bathrooms.
Really?
Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.

-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.
"Well, I think you should."
I told Regan that was holy water.
I sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently.
It's tap water.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK THAT.
THEN GO TO MOBLEY FOR ME.

What's he playing at?
Yesterday was my birthday.
My 20th.
My parents couldn't be fucked to even phone.
They're on business in New York.
But they sent me this.
So the bar's free tonight.
Unlisted number
"Hi, mum!"

"Hi, Hanne."

"Wait, right..."
Coming.
No.

Here it comes.

- Bingo.
I love that.
I love that so much.
That gets a huge...
People will really laugh at that too.
That lipstick on the windshield thing took us a long time.
I know.
I know it.
Yeah.
- I had to be in a very specific spot.
- Yes.
"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...
- Food.
"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.
I have TS.
"Look, uh ..."
Apparently Chan again began distribution.
Muhbirlerimden called me one.
"Chan, followed up to the stadium."

The man went in and out 6 times.
The man is terrible.
I better come here soon.

Cute.
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.
"The car's dirty, Cloudy."
We're gonna sit here all night ifwe have to.
What time is it?
Ten after four.

That's the third time those guys have been around.
"All right, let's hit 'em."
Hit 'em!
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
Stay right there.
"Ifyou move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off."

Turn around.
Who's the boss here?
Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?
What are you doin' here?
AND A TROUBLED BUT GIFTED SON --
"WELL,THAT WOULD BE MOTIVATING."
ENOUGH ABOUT ME -

"NO,I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT."
"YOU KNOW,I DON'T THINK"
THAT WE SHOULD WASTE ALL YOUR HARD WORK.
WHAT SAY WE SPLIT THE FEE?
YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE HE IS.
I WILL DO ALL THE REST.
IT'S EASY MONEY.
"EVELYN,I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS,"
BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY.
COME ON.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO TO PERSUADE YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MIAMI?
"APART FROM YOU,OF COURSE."
THE CHEAP LABOR.
"YOU KNOW,I CAN GET A KID OFF THE STREET"
TO DO A HIT FOR ABOUT A GRAND.
"WELL,IF I FLIRT WITH HIM A LITTLE."
"SAY,NOW,ISN'T THAT LUCY?"
LUCY!
"MICHAEL,I AM SO SORRY."
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
"YES,IT IS."
YOU TAUGHT ME BETTER THAN THAT.
I'M SO STUPID.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THOROUGH.
I'VE GOT GUYS HEADED TO HER HOTEL RIGHT NOW.
IT WON'T MATTER.
-I saw our future.

"He said ""Sven go through there fast!"""
I'll go with you.
But he lacked fly.

-What is this?
-It is amazing.
"-Seriously, never saw it."
Do not.

"Brothers and sisters, behold the power of Sven."
On that day I made an oath.
Sven ...
I
I promise to use my powers only for good things.
"For eternity all the time, to create ... eter a new ..."
Is there no end to the power of Sven?
-Will you marry me!
"No, marry me!"
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!
What jokes ...
"But if I love some, who love girls."
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?
"Someone, either."
No one.
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
"Look, you give her an inch, she takes a mile."
I think we should stop.
"Oh, babe."
Come on.
Not now.
-I'm sorry.
-No.
You're right.
I....
I didn't....
Sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
-You should be with her if you want.
-I don't want to.
I wanna be with you.
-I want you to be with her.
-I can't be with her.
-Why not?
-She's Sam's girlfriend.
They're about to break up.
It's obvious.
-She's throwing herself at us.
"-She's throwing herself, I can't do it."
Jane....
"Look, I've done some weird shit in my life, and I'm glad I have because I have enjoyed 99 % of it, but I'm not screwing my son's girlfriend and I won't lay there and watch you do it."
"Oh, who's gonna know?"
I'll know.
-Hey.
What took you so long?
-Sorry.
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lin."
Mr. Lo Keung called.
He has something important to tell you.
His number and address are here.
Can you swim?
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
Are you scared?
"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?
- Do I know you?
"- No, I don't think so."
"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
- I'm Sarah Walker.
- It's nice to meet you.
You too.
So...
Holly?
"Oh, um..."
- I have no idea where she is.
- OK.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Rebecca.
Um...
Do you have a minute?
Could I talk to you?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"
No.
"That's what people do when they love each other, isn't it?"
I'll never forget you.
Go to the hospital now.
- You'll come and see me?
- I guarantee it.
- Now I suppose you want some time off?
- A day or two.
Well...
Take Thanksgiving.

"Chris, can't do what?"
"- Jenna, please."
"- Can't do what, Chris?"
- You should just talk to Michael.
"Talk to him about what, Chris?"
What the hell are you talking about?
"Listen, don't ask me any more questions, please."
He should be telling you.

Hands up or I'll blow you to fucking hell!
-What the fuck?
-Get on the floor!
Now!
Who the fuck are you?
-You bitch!
He has a child.
"I know, but, come on, you've seen them together."
She's sort of lost her mind.
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault.
It's just...
I don't know.
I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.
"God, what's happening?"
Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Hi!
- I got this!
I don't need it!
"- Oh, my God!"
- My God!
"Oh, my God."
My top is totally clinging.
You can see everything.
"Don't worry, I promise I won't look."
Then I'll be insulted.
"- Well, I don't want to offend you."
"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.
Where am I going?
Very thoughtful of him.
What did you say?
What a spectacular rise!
As of now you have made $120.000.
Congratulations.
Shall I sell?
Let's just hang on for a while.
I'll be back shortly.
Is Mrs. Ryan in?
"No, she isn't."
She's expected.
"Well... may I ask who's calling, please?"
Clementi Sabourin.
And may I ask who you are?
"Why, I'm Mrs. Ryan's secretary."
Oh.
Have you worked for Mrs. Ryan long?
A few months.
Why?
I'm an investigator.
For whom?
For myself.
I'm the prying kind.
"Tell me, my dear."
Where do you come from?
I'm from Texas.
"Oh, yes, I've heard of it."
"Well, may I say that Mrs. Ryan has found herself a most attractive secretary."
"Thank you, sir."

"You off, then?"
Oh.
"Er... yes, if you're sure you're all right."

- It's Adam's decision.
Are you having a laugh?
"Look around, George."
I'm a pig in shit.
- Adam.
- Sorry.
Hm.
"- Right, I'll show you to the door."
"- No, no, that's OK, we can find it."
"Of course, yes."
Like tracker dogs.
- Um... excuse me?

"- No, come on."
"Cheers for bringing me here, though."
Look after him.
We don't need you to tell us that.
OK?
See you.
- Shall I feed the boy now?
"- Oh, not yet, Seven."
We're going to make a night of it.
"After all, Adam's finally where he belongs."
Do you work every day after school?
That's gotta be tough.
"Um, no, just three days."
My moms don't want me to work any more than that.
- Moms?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- It is.
"Oh, don't worry, I'll grab that."
"Oh, thanks."
See you soon.
"Oh... down the street, I'm telling you."

"- A hundred dollars, yo!"
"- Oh, my God!"
Who do you think it was?

The Piston Cup...

"Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look in Dinoco blue?"
Dinoco blue!
"In your dreams, Thunder."
"Yeah, right."
Thunder?
"What's he talkin' about, ""Thunder""?"
"You know, 'cause thunder always comes after lightning."
Ka-ping!
Ka-pow!
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

Right in the lens.
"- Show me the bolt, baby!"
"- Smile, McQueen!"
"- Show me the bolt, McQueen!"
"Damn it, Reid."
"I said, ""Don't take the vest off."""
Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.
This is going to probably sting a little bit.
Whoa.
Did you see that?
I knew it.
I knew it.
"Hey, look."
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got the chip.
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...
Not yet!
Turn it on.
Turn the chip on.
Excuse me?
"- Get off the train, Reid."
"- No, no, something's wrong."
Get off the train.
- Get out of there.
- Why isn't he moving?
How many shots would it take to move in?
Two.
First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.
-No.
"I'll go alone, I'll go alone."
"-No, I'll go with you."
"-No, I'll go by myself."
I'll go.
"No, I also have to get something."
"The recipe, so I can cook for you."
I'll go with you?
.
"Fine, it's up to you."
And tomorrow's your birthday!
You're already 28 years old!
What would you like me to cook for you?
It's up to you.
-No!
"Just tell me, I'll cook it for you."
-Anything.
What?
Anything you want.
"Sorry, I can't come later."
Joy said she's coming with me.
Okay then.
I'll find a way.
I really need to see you.
Yes...okay.
I'll just call you.
Yes.
Who were you talking to?
You heard it right?
"I was talking to mommy, I just asked how she's doing."
-Are you sure?
.
"Parfitt, you met."
Rising partner.
Delighted to have you on-board.

So what do you think?
Hm...father leaves a bad taste.
Dunkin says it's good though.
Aa..make him an uncle?

"No, it's Eric."
Either.
"Girls, what are they like?"
"Shy, quiet."
Really hardly spoke.

They both quite.
Not if they want them in our dialogue.
How old are they?
Thirty.
Ah!
Marvelous.
- Eddie.
Search him!
"Eddie, what's with the security?"
It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
Not with a tomboy like that.
Get on.
Hold tight.
"Yeah, I know."
What's up?
Dad?
Something wrong?
Well...
How do you tell someone...
It doesn't matter.

They're mad at you.
Why?

"HAPPY HOLIDAYS,DWIGHT."
BUT DO NOT OPEN IT TILL CHRISTMAS.
YOU ARE SO PATHETIC.
HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE YOU?
THREE HOURS?
"FIVE MINUTES,ACTUALLY."
I AM A BLACK BELT IN GIFT WRAPPING.
"YEAH,NO SUCH THING."
THEY DON'T GIVE OUT BLACK BELTS FOR THINGS THAT ARE STUPID.
"WELL,I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT"
'CAUSE I'M GONNA TAKE IT APART IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
I THINK IT'LL TAKE YOU A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THAT.

"IF I CAN SKIN A MULE DEER IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES,"
I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CUT MY--
Who's the murderer?
Speak.
You've got the wrong person!
I've got to go!
Cross-eye!
"Yes, Marshal!"
Have you got all the masked opera singers?
Every single one of them.
What about him?
We missed him.
- You fool!
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Wait here!
Wait here!
What are you doing?
Shut up or be arrested!
I can lock you all up!
Is this an uprising or what?
- What's going on?
"- Yes, Marshal!"
Stupid.
What about my loss?
If you find any one suspicious.
Let me know.
You'll get paid for it.
They're all crooks!
The murderer is connected with the opera troupe.
Keep your eyes open for me.
Yes?
There's a newcomer who acts strangely...
"Mr. Chiu, it's your turn."
I'm coming!
You got character.
I don't make this offer to just anybody.
"Sarge, I got a great-lookin' gal to go home to... not to mention my wife..."
so it just ain't in the cards.
Igor.
Another glass of cheer.
You think you got it rough?
Look at that guy.
"- ## [""Harbor Lights""] - [Sighs]"
"Boy, he looks terrible."
What's his story?
"He got a ""Dear Maxie"" letter."
- Says he's got nothin' to go home to.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.
And...
- And...
"- That's it, pal."
Get it off your chest.
Tell Joey all about it.
Yeah.
"You're right, Joey."
Who are you?
[ Laughter ]
Don't know.
"I just picked that out of thin air, too."
"Right, right, right."
Plaid buttoned-down interior.

Maybe.
Um...
Yeah.
He's a keeper.
You'd think sensible...
He's a keeper.
...Good dancer...
"He's a great guy, great dancer, kind of suave, knows his way around a kitchen."
Fun at parties.
"""Knows his way around a kitchen""?"
Was that a fat joke?
[ Laughter ]
No!
You could have said anything.
A kitchen?
No.
That was like sexy chef.
"Oh, is that what it was?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"Your lap... fast, slow?"
How did it feel?
"When you got out of the car, you thought, ""that was..."""
Slow.
Slow?
Yes.
This!
I'll kill you if you don't take your hands off me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Do you hear?
Don't hold my hand!
Let me go!
"Fierce, crazy women!"
What are you doing?
Nothing!
Distribute the meals!
Yes!
Meal!
Meal!

Come on!
Come on!
Jun-kit!
"Although you saved me,"
Shaolin caused my master's death by my hand.
Why do you say that?
The Shaolin persuaded His Highness to get our 8-divine Sword Book.
- Shaolin wouldn't do such a thing.
Where is it?
Where's what?
"Look, when I get through working you over, you'll tell me where it is."
Or do you want to talk now?
"All right, I'll talk."
"Well, talk!"
How's Mama?
(GRUNTING)
This way.
I don't know what you're mad at me for!
"I didn't do anything to you, and I didn't do anything to your wife!"
No one ever double-crossed me.
No one living.
What do you want from me?
I know you have that diamond.
I put it in your pocket myself.
There's nothing in my...
Is this what you want?
"All right, here."
I don't want it.
Are we friends now?
BOB:

Excuse me.
Duty calls.
"- Ah, yeah."
"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, that."
"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."
- Remixes of what?
"- Shut it, Gollum."
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
Remixing?
DJ Troy?
- Them's the words.
Now make sense of 'em.
"""Exhibit A""."
Will you stop getting 'em out your bag?
It looks like a cannibals' picnic round here.
"- Who have you remixed, then?"
- Me.
"- Yeah, you."
"- No, me."
I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."
"""Troy's Noise""."
Sounds French.
It's not just rhymes.
"In a half-hour, it's done."
Here he is.
Stay in the car!

Stop it!
Why'd you screw me?
Stop it!
"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.
And their next stunt.
They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.
Choose.
"OK, let's have it."
I know two of 'em:
Francis Horn and Robert Boulanger.
They're squatting in St Ouen.
On Captain Glarner St.
- Don't you say hi?
- I hadn't seen you.
- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.
You got friends now?
Come on.
This is true.
"This is true, Roldy."
Ooh wee
"- Man, this is so not like me."
- Yeah.
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
"Better, faster, stronger."
Nice.
"Man, I've never used a sick day before."
"I'm taking a whole week off from work here, man."
"And in less than eight hours, we're gonna be in Amsterdam."
- This is nuts.
This is nuts.
"- I know, dude."
"It's gonna be exactly like Euro Trip, only it's not gonna suck."
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.
Dude.
"Dude, this chick's giving me such a boner, it's awesome."
Thank you.
You ruined the moment.
"She's all yours, buddy."
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
"No, that's--"
Enjoy.
Just a minute.
Fuc--
"Hey, hey."
Let me in.
What are you doing?
You suppose-a something else.
-What are you doing here?
-I come lookin' for some hand soap.
I don't have any hand soap here.
You got anything in the kitchen I could use?
Go use the station john.
I'd just get it dirty.
I'll tell him to get you some the next time he goes in.
Sorry to bother you.
You want a cup of coffee?
"Yeah, thanks."
"A nice place you got here, Mrs. Papadukis."
Papadakis.
"Oh, yeah."
Sorry.
Papadakis.
"What are you, Greek or somethin'?"
What...do I look Greek to you?
No.
Thanks.
So what do I call ya?
I guess you can call me Cora.
"A man, every man, needs to have a home."
"-You travel, huh?"
-Sure.
It's okay.
"But you know, the time come...."
The time come!
"Close the door, it is windy."
"Cora, give the man some wine."
-It's in the cupboard if he wants it.
"-Nice coffee, Missus."
Access granted.
"All right, Project Cadmus."
Genetics lab here in D.C. That's all there is.
"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?
We didn't come for a play date.
[SIR ENS WAIL ING]
-Help !
-Get us down!
Stay put.
We will get you out.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Whoa-
- Unh.
It's what's-his-name.
Flash Boy.
Kid Flash.
Why is that so hard?
So smooth.
Does he always have to run ahead?
We need a plan.
We--
-Robin?
Are you OK?
"You, of all people, drive me home!"
- To ease my guilty conscience.
"- Oh, dear."
Everybody else was completely drunk.
Theo?
Go to sleep.
As the moisture flowed into droplets...
- Slaving away again?
- What?
What are you doing?
Surprise.
I moved out of my apartment.
- You agreed.
- I told you.
I had to talk to Laura first.
It's her house.
- But there's so much space here.
- Yeah...
But you're not very easy on her.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
"You don't like Laura, and you don't try to hide it."
That's mutual.
Exactly.
"A great basis, huh?"
Shit.
- You aren't pleased.
"- Yes, I am."
"Yes, I am."
Really.
"I'll talk to Laura later, OK?"
Ooh!
Hey!
"Ooh, what a lovely...cocoa tin lid!"
It doesn't matter what it is.
It's...
It's symbolic.
It's meaningful.
"Oh, meaningful."
The only thing I know about cocoa is it's very good at bedtime.
-
"- Language, Julie!"
-
- Morning!
"Packet of Jelly Tots, please."
I wouldn't stand too near the assistant manager.
You might get a nipple in the eye!
-
- Doesn't he like you dressed like that?
-
- I'm not dressed unless I wear a pinny.
I'm not giving in this time.
-
- I think you look terrific!
-
- You do?
-
- Thanks!
-
- Hey!
I'm over here!
Really?
Do you really think I look terrific?
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.
"I hate this, John."
I absolutely goddamn hate this.
How was Chicago?
What did he say?
He wouldn't see me.
Shit.
You all right?
It's cold.
"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
♪ Whoa ♪
♪ I'm letting go. ♪

(sighs)
Hey.
Hey.
Left you a couple messages.
Everything okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I heard about today.
I'm sorry I wasn't there to help.
"No, it's all right."
Are you sure everything's okay?
No.
"Chin, there's something I need to tell you."

-There is no need.
"You, too, Tegan."
"You, too."

And the murder of innocent Earth people.
-Earth people?

-Aunty Vanessa?
-Yes.
"I'm so sorry, Tegan."

No problem.
She's a good dancer.
"Yes, she is."
I'm sorry we made a mess.
"Oh, no, don't worry about that."
"So, what do you think about Shannon?"
"Well, l-- l think that she's--"
"She has good instincts, but she's, um-- she's at least a grade behind, and she can-- she has a way with the truth."
[chuckles]
"A way with the truth, right."
"Listen, if you're asking me if it's too..."
Too late?
"It's never that, Mr. Fallin."
Never.
Never that.
"So, you want to-- you want to stay?"
- Yes.

Good.
Thank you.
"She's, um-- she's really excited about this dance."

She's really excited.
Do you want to call me Dad or Jim?
Dad.
I think Dad's nice.
Yeah.
And you?
"Um, are you Samantha or Sam?"
He and his men are the front line.
He's in charge of this.
Whether you like it or not.

They're taking off.
The SUV's are leaving.
Very slowly.
I see them.
They just passed us.
Let 'em leave the area.
Guy and Bernie tail the SUV's.
"We tail Horn, Boulanger, the chick."
We only hit 'em at the warehouse.
I repeat: don't hit 'em here!
The SUV's are stopped at the entrance.
- Horn and the chick are out.

Armed to the teeth.

What would have happened if you hadn't showed up.
"Sorry, sorry."
Shiv.
Nice to meet you.
It feels as if we go way back.
Me?
"No, people generally feel so."
But it isn't so.
"So, why are you being so intense?"
"Okay, we are childhood buddies."
Happy?
We are childhood buddies.
Happy?
Okay?

"Say, what'd you see at the power station?"
"Huh, tiger?"

"How big is this thing, ranger?"
Been in the forest lately?
Hey.

Champ?
Slugger?
"Hey, cowboy?"
Where you goin'?

You know you won't jump.

It's a log.

- Fawlty!
"What are you talking about, you silly little man?"
What is going on here?
"I ask him for my room, and he tells me the manager's a Mr. Watt, aged 40."
No.
"No, no."
Faw-lty.
"""Faulty""?"
What's wrong with him?
"It's all right, Mrs. Richards."
He's from Barcelona.
The manager's from Barcelona?
"No, no, no."
He's from Swanage.
- And you're in 22.
- What?
You're in room 22.
"Manuel, take these cases up to 22, will you?"
"Very nice stay, Mr. Fawlty."
"Ah, glad you enjoyed it."
"Polly, would you get Mr. Firkin's bill, please?"
When will we see you again?
"Oh, not for a few weeks."
"You're not by any chance a betting man, Mr. Fawlty?"
"Er... well, I used to be."
Only there's a very nice little filly running at Exeter this afternoon.

"-How do you do, again?"
-Where's the rabbit?
How is it you're being so great big?
"She ain't great big, this is how she normal is."
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.
"No, she drank the pishsalver to get through the door, recall it?"
"Oh, yeah."
-Where's the rabbit?
-BOTH:
Over theres.
-MALLY:
What are you doing here?
-I'm rescuing the Hatter.

Shoo!
"-What is it, McTwisp?"
-I know where the sword is.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The sword's hidden inside.
"Be careful, Alice."
I know that smell.
(SNORING)
I'm not going in there.
Look what that thing did to my arm.
"Dear, oh, dear."
Why haven't you mentioned this?
It wasn't this bad before.
Come on.
"Should I help him along, Dad?"
"You know your dad, God bless his Irish soul..."
He was...
How shall I put it?
He was sort of killed.
Tell Tommy who killed his dad.
Tell Tommy.

Let me go.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
Stop or I'll shoot!
"- Vince, no!"
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
I never meant for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
"But it's over now, because we're going in... together."
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
"Come on, shoot me."
You couldn't do it before.
You just don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.

- I don't understand.
- Dead.

Want me to carry it?
Come in.
It's kind of you to host me.

"It's moth balls, Mom puts them everywhere."
"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...

"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."

He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.

Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.

"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"You know, he loved you like a son."
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."

"What's this, Chinese?"
How about you?
I'm fasting.
"Say, isn't that strange  to practically fast into one's own death?"
It's just a question.
- Very tactful.
"Yes Dad, very nice."
Right to the point.
What did I say?
Are you hard of hearing?
I've just about had enough.
Shut up!
I won't listen to this crap any more.
It's a good thing when new people come to us.
"You could be a bit nicer, especially to her."
I think so too.
And you shut that thing off!
"Alright, fine."
- Bon appetit!
Thanks.

You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
- You the owner?
"- Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like somebody's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?
Where you going?
Don't know.
"We both keep our mouths shut, they may never know it was us."
- What are you doing?
The cat.
The composer's dead.
Okay.
Shit!

Abby?
What?
Is this usual for your...

She's building a nest.
We do it during molting and breeding.
"- I know, it looks..."

No offense.
"Trust me, it's a good sign."
Can I ask you something?
"Is everyone here, all the workers, are they... what you are?"
"No, a few are human, scientists like you are."
- They're here of their own accord.
- Lucky them.
I'm sorry I had to bring you here like this.
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my family.
- My kids.
- You have children?
Two.
Six and eight.
They live with my ex.
You?
You have any little ones?

feel that way.
I thought sometime you might want to come over and meet my sons.
Can we do that right now?
"Now as in ""now""?"
Yeah.
"Oh, good."
You're here.
You have to clean all this up.
Come on.
Come on.

Do whatever you normally do.
Just be kids.
That's great.
Is that gonna fit in there?
"No, I don't think so."
Maybe you can put it in there.
I guess not.
"It looked like it would fit, but I guess not."
Wait.
Wait.
I'll kill you!
What's the matter with you?

Then I'll bring him to you.
"Mr. Weng, if it pleases you..."
I will beg.

It nearly crashed into me.
"At the last second, I swerved."
It was all so sudden.
There were these lines... like a snake.
Where?
Like waves.
"What are you looking at, you idiot?"
I can't remember!
"- Hi, Christine?"
- Hi.
"- Hi, it's Ken."
How are you?
I'm good.
Sorry it took me so long to call you back.
"Hey, but you're here."
That's amazing.
- Yes.
"- So listen, uh, do you have any plans for lunch?"
Lunch?
No.
"Well, my daughters are fixing me lunch."
Why don't you come over?
"Uh, I don't want to impose."
You're not imposing.
How about I pick you up around noon?
Noon?
Okay.
"All right, I'll see you at noon."
- All right.
- Bye.
Noon.

"Oh, go ahead."
I've got to go back up to my room.

We suspect a gas leak.
We discovered four adult bodies in the debris.
We assume two were the residents.
We don't know about the other two.
"Ma'am, do you have any idea who they might be?"
"No, I don't."
I see.
What about Mikey?
I saw him go in there.
We did find the skeletal remains of what appears to be a 10-year-old child.
Are you sure?
I'm very sorry.
You're sure?

"Well, you did say today, Mr. Hawkins."

"Well, we have to cancel the order then."
Yes.
"No, no, 5:00 will be fine."

"Polly, Brenda can't start till Monday."
Would you mind doing the rooms until then?

I could do with the money.

Don't call us sidekicks.
Not after today.
Sorry.
First time at the Hall.
I'm a little overwhelmed.
You're overwhelmed.
Freeze was underwhelmed.
Why isn't anyone ever just whelmed?
Oh.
Maybe that's why.
"Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, Kid Flash."
Welcome.

He was breathing.
"Yeah, I hope so."

This house is cursed.
You the owner?
"Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like someone's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
You're okay.
Disappointed?
Where are you going?
Don't know.
We both keep our mouths shut.
They may never know it was us.
What are you doing?
You're giving me a ride.
I don't know what happened.
I do not know why the house burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
What are you doing?
Tell him that it's in the petrol tank!
Petrol tank!
It's my diamond!

I have bought the car!
Its mine!
I had come for the diamonds!

- Home to a hot drink.
We don't want you getting pneumonia.
Good night.
"Good night, sir."
"Come along, my darling."
Don't call me darling!
I'm sorry.
I should have thanked you for saving my life.
Half a crown?
Let's go.
Call or fold.
Make a decision.
- Can we try to finish?
- I'm 40 light.
You mind?
- What?
"- No, there's no going light in my game, pal."

It's more for you if you win.
Doesn't cost you if you lose.

You deserve it.
"Hey, I was a fan."

You know what?
I must have forgotten my debit card.

Hello.
Hello.
"Oh, my God."

What?
"Just do it, you little turd."

"What, you think I'm gonna tell on you?"
"Luke, Luke, look at me, look at me."
"I don't care how many people you've killed, okay?"
"As long as it's not me, and as long as it's not Paul."
"Now come on, cut us free."
Have you enjoyed what you've seen?
I hope you're satisfied!
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should have stepped in when Chris went for you but this...
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I saved him.
Cut him down.
Not after what I went through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
"Charming, my husband, he used to wake me when I cried out."
He'd light a candle.
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.

Why don't you try to sleep?
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.

You want me to read you a story?
Or I could actually...
I could make one up.

- So we meet again.
- Your challenge is acceptable.
Prepare for battle.
- I want to come home.
"- Hey, turn it down, man."
- You turn it down.
- I want to come home.
- Move.
You there?

- Do you remember when Carmichael won 24 motos?
"Like, before you were even born?"
"And the midnight screening of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" at the Cinedome."
I can't.
I have a curfew... at 11:00.
So?
"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
When's your curfew?
I don't have one.
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
For how long?
Couple of weeks.

"Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."

"HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great."

I guess.

The new owners will move in next week.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
"I want to help you, but I don't know how."
I don't want to leave.
You could remarry.
"I can't live with anybody, I am a weird man."
So many years have passed.
"- Yes, madam, 30."
"Can you please leave me alone, Beto?"
"Yes, madam."
"Hello, Too."
"Fine, and you?"
I am calling to ask you for a favour.
Can you get a job for Beto?
"Yes, we all feel the same."
"Yes, I'll do that."
Of course.
I send you a kiss.
Bye.
One moment.
We'd better go.
Hello?
"Hey, Lupe!"
Why?
Right.
Can't someone else go?
"Yeah, good enough."
-And What do you think caused it?
Trafficking in war.
"The League-Z has dangerous friends, there will be revenge."

I have employees there!
I do not know how many.
Lars!
She was missing?
-14-15 Years.
Eurasian appearance.
Where is she?
-Estava Here.
Who would be interested in harming you?
I have no idea.
You heard what happened in Mysen?
-With Ferrymen?
-What Your relationship with them?
I have nothing to do with it.
A girl was rescued.
It has something to do with you?
Nita?
It's okay.
Yes.
She must have cracked our plan!
Everything's gone!
Don't unnecessarily get tensed.
We have to catch her now.
That is important.
Okay.
Go...
Stop.
- Why are you stopping the car?
Who are you?
- Quick.
"- Sadhana, go."
I'm a cop.
We are in a hurry chasing an accused!
I'm a cop.
- This person is seriously injured!
It's an important case.
At least tell us where the hospital is.
It's within a kilometer.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go fast!
"Is everything okay, Alphonse?"
Yes.
But you keep following them properly.
"Madam, speed up."
Please.
What's happening there?
Nothing.
You keep tracking.

"I thought maybe, underneath your whole I-could-give-a-crap-bad-boy thing that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like, the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
You spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool but it's just an act.
"We both know that you're just a sad, lonely little kid."
"And I feel sorry for you, Dean."
"You feel sorry for me, huh?"
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know anything about me.
I save lives.

Mario!
- Quirino!
"Mario, you're already out?"
"Damn, that sucks."
"No, I mean I'm glad."
"Hi, Tonino."
- What did you do?
Nothing.
A classic case of mistaken identity.
I'll get a lawyer right away.
- A lawyer?
Are you crazy?
"I'll defend myself, instead send me some goodies."
"Bye, cutie."
- Let's go.
- Remember: no lawyers!
Bye.
"- Croquettes, cigarettes and sweets!"
Poor guy.
- Are you sure that it's a case of mistaken identity?
"Who knows, it happens a lot."
Just look at me.
"By the way, Counselor, we're going to have rename Tonino."
Why?
- Too many Tonino De Santises.
"True, it can happen."
- He's right.
No!
"No,that's perfect."
Hmm?
Yeah.
Hey!
Hi!
"Oh,sorry."
Do you know your friend here is a pervert?
"A $60 Brazilian wax and he's grossed out, but yet Neosporin and scabs are apparently really enticing."
"Baby,I would do you if you had Bella's mole."
I just don't like it when you mess with yourself.
"You guys,you have to come tonight."
You have to.
Johnny's got a gig.
"And you're thinking if he meets your friends,he'll dump you."
"No,I'm thinking it'll make him happy and I want to be supportive."
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Come here.
Hmm?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Whoo-oo!
I hope he sings that song about star-shine.

- Yeah.
"Well, maybe someday I might."
- Not yet.
- Not yet.
It's not my time yet.
[Vocalizing]
"You could come in with me... with I, uh -with all our guys."
They'd like you.
But I would like you.
[Chuckling]
Murray's on the way.
You get it?
I got it.
Of course not.

Thank you.
You boys are expensive to feed.

Especially you.
"Come on, give."

Half of that.
"D'Artagnan, this came earlier."
Porthos!
It's a letter from Treville.
"We have to meet General Verdet's aide in Bourgogne, and escort him back to Paris."
He has news from the front.
What now?
"No, not now, go to sleep."
The war will wait.
"Wait, check you out."
"Girl, you ain't all churchgoing goody two shoes."
Look at that frumpy old church.

"Where were you, huh?"
Tough guy?
No.

Where am I?
Who are you?
"Aw, c'mon, no games."
It's been a long day already.
Whose cigarette is that?
"Oh, Mary save us!"
They're repulsive.
Pamela.
"I'm not Pamela, I'm Sister Mary Maude."
What's with the Irish accent?
- I don't know.
"- Oh, you're a nun?"
With an MA in classical languages.
"Oh, I get it!"
The old split personality defence.
Classic.
- I don't know what you mean.
- She's lying.
All Right.
Would you also like to test me Greek?
"- This is not gonna work, Pamela."
- Stop calling me Pamela.
"Pamela, Pamela."
Pamela.
"Have another cigarette, Pamela."
Whoo!
Thirsty.
"Who's thirsty, Pamela, or Mary Maude?"
Someone else was here?
What happens next?
You start spitting pea soup or does this table levitate?
I wanna drink.
"Come on, sweetie."
Let's go outside.
Come on.
Come.
Mama!
- Mama!

Oh...
"- God, you're big."

I missed you so much.
"- Welcome home, soldier."
Ha-ha-ha.
"- Hi, Daddy."
Come on.
God.
"You know Mama love you, right?"
"Well, promise me you'll never go away again."
Mama's not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
"Hey, is that a big-boy tooth I see in there?"
"I twisted it 134 times, and then it came out during all-school assembly."
Oh.
Hm.
- What did the tooth fairy bring you?
"- A bow and arrow, a new pair of Converse, $1.50 and a Monster Flashlight."
- All under your pillow?
"- Well, I got the best tooth fairy in town."
Sounds like it.
Pour your own.
How did you get all that stuff under his pillow?
"Well, I picked up a few tricks from the other moms."
What about Wicklow?
When you disgraced yourself running round half naked?

- Go on.
Please.
"I can't, Tommy."
"Jesus, it's been years."
Course you can.
You've a gorgeous voice.
Please.
For me.
Not like that.
Do it properly.
Like you did in Wicklow.
"Now, go on."
"You're a menace, Tommy Cassidy."

And Bobby's gotthe magic like a goddamn rock star.
They climb all over each other justto touch his clothes.
He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Hmm.
Lfthings remain as they are.
He's got the anti-warvote.
"Or he'll steal it, like his brother."
"Bobby's a mean little son of a bitch, Edgar."
He had the I.R.S. Auditmy mother when she was dying in the nursing home.
Why my place of origin?
Somewhere else ok?
"Up to you, just be 500m away from Lisa."
"Michael,"
I know what you're thinking.
You want me to stay away from Lisa cos you are not confident.
Good morning Mr. Lin.
Morning.
Breakfast is ready.
Thanks David.
It's my duty.
Good morning Mr. Mak.
You didn't drown?
"No, thanks for your concern."
You're such a dog.
Really?
It's my duty.
Go to hell!
Goodbye.
You don't like him?
I don't like you too.
Just 3 weeks.
"After breakfast, I'll change and set off."
Going home to nap.
Call me later.
I don't like to sleep.
What if you fall asleep during investigation?
Wake me up.
Hey!
What?
Driving 2 cars is a waste?
Expect me to sit in your car?
"It won't be so bad, believe me."
Good night.
The fish will be pleased.
That's the third in a week.
They'll get the texts down there.
Where can I phone from?
Do you have a mobile?
"Well, me and mobiles..."
There's a phone kiosk over there.
"It's my office, but you can use it."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"Sophie, it's Mum."
No.
I'm still at the office.
"Yes, I know it's late."
Tomorrow lunchtime?
OK.
I'll collect him.
You can count on me.
Yes...
"Lots of love, darling."
You too...
Wait.
Wait.
It's...
It's unpredictable.
I'll...
It blocks sometimes.
- There.
- Thank you.
- Sure you're all right?
"Really, really fun."
- What are you do...?
- We're just getting into it.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, this has been a good hang, but I think it's time to bye-bye."
"- Oh, that's... that's it?"
- Yeah.
Where do your serving spoons go?
Second drawer to the left.
"Thank you, Doctor."
I really love bonding with you.
Next time let's not dwell on Matt.
"You know, he's gone."
Who the hell have you been talking t...?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Uh, hanging out with my sisters?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, thought I'd give it a try."
Was worried it might be weird.
Turns out I'm right.
How are you... how are you doing?
Fine.
You?
Fine.
Also.
Great.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
(sighs)
"I came in here to yell at you, and, uh, now I'm just sad."
YOU'RE DOING THE BEST THING.
"BELIEVE ME, I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."
"I'VE STAYED, AND I'VE LEFT."
SOMETIMES LEAVING IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
"IT MUST BE LONELY, WHAT YOU DO."
I COULDN'T LIVE THAT WAY.
"IN MY LINE OF WORK,"
I CAN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GET TOO CLOSE.
WHAT IF YOU MET SOMEONE...
AND THERE'S A SPARK?
WOULD YOU IGNORE IT?
COULD YOU?
"I WOULD, UH..."
CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE JOB DONE.
I GOT TO HEAD OVER TO DOUG'S.
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.
OKAY.
"WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG, SAM?"
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR TOUCH?
I DIDN'T KNOW DOUG WOULD HAVE A NINE-PIN DIMPLE LOCK --
"YOU KNOW, THE NEW KIND, THE KIND I HAVEN'T PRACTICED ON?"
"OKAY, MY FINGERS ARE BLEEDING NOW."
THERE'S SOME PAIN INVOLVED.
"YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE AROUND HERE"
WITH BARS ON ITS WINDOWS.
I WONDER WHAT DOUG WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT.
"COME ON, BABY."
THERE BETTER BE SOMETHING GOOD IN HERE.
THERE WE GO.
GOT IT.
LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH.
I'VE WORKED WITH LESS.
Get the fuck off me.
-Get off of Jacob.
Get off him.
I was supposed to protect him.
She's taking him to houston.
Fuck that bitch.
"Come on, man, get up."
Let's get outa here.
[TV baseball game].
You finished?
Yeah.
Alright.
I saw your probation report signed on your bed.
Mr. Dominguez said that you'll be back at Barker sooner than you thought.
I'm real proud o'you.
'You hear what I said?
Yeah.
What?
"I don't know, you just ...."
You look like her sitting there.
We made a great team didn't we?
The four of us.
[Plate on kitchen table].
[Washing dishes].
[Jacob takes keys]
[Lawn sprinklers].
"Hey Wes, get up."
Come on.
What are you doing here?
"Hurry up, pack your things let's go."
Why?
We're leaving.
- Be good.
- Enjoy Colorado.
- I will.
"All right, peace out, Mom."
- Bye.
- Bye.
[Sighs]

Waitress:
"Here you go, ma'am."
- My first Denver omelet.
- Yeah.
"Well, when in Rome."
"You know, I think it was actually invented in New York City."
Oh.
Okay.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
[Sighs]
"Hi, this is Ken."
"I'm out right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get..."
Could I get the check?
"Say, I was wondering, if I checked out a day early, would I still get all my Extended Rest rewards points for the entire stay?"
I can look into that for you.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
- Watch your step here.
- I will.
"Those plants, they don't look nice anymore."
- They're okay.
"- Hey, where are we going, anyway?"
"- Uh, I'm gonna take you to the doctor."
Unless they've got a special job like you.
"- What about the navy, Billy?"
"- I've been thinking about the navy, but..."
"- Well, I can't swim a stroke."
- Then the air force is out.
- Why?
"- Well, you haven't got wings, have you?"
"- Take these over, love."
- Thank you.
"- All the best, love."
- Thank you.
- All the very best.
- Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Mrs Rose?
"David, darling."
I think I'd better go and get changed.
- Can I help?
"- No, you can't."
"Well, my boy, when do you join your squadron?"
"Tomorrow, sir."
A Spitfire.
I saw her yesterday.
Lovely kite.
There we are.
"Mama, I'm so happy."
"Oh, darling."
- He is a lovely boy.
- Isn't he.
Darling...
"Off you go, Emma."
Both of you.
No.
No more talking.
No more lies.
No more lies ever again.
"Nice, but you still have your training wheels on."
Ada!
"Ada, come here."
At least I can still see the road.
Come on.
- Detonator.
- No.
There's no time.
Bo!
Don't leave me.
"Come back here, you bitch."
"- I'm here, baby."
- Okay.
Okay.
Bo.
Stay back!
What's going on?
What the hell just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
Thought I'd be extra crispy for sure.
As if I could get rid of you that easily.
"Hey, Bo."
"I'm not like Jenny, am I?"
I'm not too clingy or anything?
You make me want to be a better Fae.
Go seduce a yak.
My God.
Mass destruction and two dead Furies.
"If it's the chocolates that Saeko-san loves the most, then all the more."
"The confectionery school's graduation exam is today, right?"
Yeah.
"Well, since my family has a cake shop..."
I think I'll be fine.
"Rather, I can finally show my performance."
Performance?
Eh?
What?
"- Ah, nothing."
"Ah, hey."
Can we meet on the 14th?
Valentine's day.
I'm a bit busy on the 14th...
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Well, that's right."
"A guy shouldn't be asking you out on that day, right?"
Sorry.
"Then, the 13th?"
- That's fine.
"Ah, thank goodness."
"Then, the 13th."
- Yeah.
"Then, on the 13th."
Yeah.
- Yeah.
"I'll text you later, okay?"
Bye bye.
"- Yeah, bye..."
I feel like I've been casually rejected...
"Oh, that's right."
The place was bad.
Your answers?
Beaufort and...
I heard you say it.
"Beaufort and Bath, that's what you said."
Yes.
"So, Beaufort is there..."
Show me your first letters.
"And presumably, Bath..."
But that doesn't work.
That doesn't work.
You haven't found the right answers.
I'm going to throw it over to Araucarians for a bonus point?
We think it's Beaufort and Minton.
"Beaufort and Minton, show me your first letters."
Let's see if you're right?
I know you're not.
It is Beaufort and Badminton.
ALL:
Oh!
"Oh, it's so obvious now!"
"The Badminton Horse Trials, of course."
The Horse Trials are held on the estate every year.
Araucarians.
Reveal the hive.
Wojtyla?
Erm...
No.
"Too obvious, isn't it?"
Or is Ratzinger...?
No.
"Yes, Ratzinger's in there."
Is he in there?
Next!
You better catch them for me!
What are you doing here!
Line up!
Go!
Line up!
Line up!
Shut up!
You're all useless!
I'm so mad!
Next!
Put down your hands!
It's so embarrassing!
Like a piece of cardboard?
Looks like she hasn't had enough nutrition
"Even though it's a bit flat, but on a closer look"
It's actually not bad.
"Throw at her, it's funny!"
Really?
"Thanks, Master Zhou!"
"Master Zhou, keep on playing!"
"Thanks Master Zhou, thank you!"
"She got it again, throw at her, quick!"
"Master Zhou, come on!"
Stop!
Get off!
Get off!
Are you blind!
"Sorry, sorry!"
Open the door!
Boss!
Open the door!
"Mummy, can I have my room back?"
Of course you can.
"Come on, darling."
Get out of the bath.
Do try not to cross-question him.
I'm not cross-questioning.
It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is.
I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
"Better, thank you."
I'm Henry Baker.
Hello.
I'm Lucy.
Lucy Rose.
- How do you do?
- This is my husband David.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Have some hot soup.
Thank you.
- Bread?
"- Yes, thank you."
"Can you tell me the time, please?"
It's ten to nine.
Ten to nine?
- Help yourself to cider.
"- No, thank you."
Thank you.
Good night.
Danny.
Nope.
"Miss Telford, I'm afraid the elopement's off."
Who are you?
Paul Drake.
I'm a private detective.
You can't stop me.
You've no right to.
I'm 21.
No.
That isn't the reason.
Your aunt--
Your diamonds have been stolen.
No one can leave till the police get here.
I don't care about those old diamonds--
"Merle, let's go back to the house."
"Merle, my dear child..."
"Olivia, your aunt--"
Mr. Drake told me.
Somebody stole Grandmother's diamonds.
"But it doesn't matter, Uncle Howard."
"I'm afraid it's more serious than that, Merle."
Your Aunt Olivia is dead.
She's been murdered.
"You warned her, didn't you, Cousin Julian?"
You said somebody would cut her throat.
[Gina] Just a minute.
Messenger service.
Package for Miss Lenore Adams.
All right.
Thank you.
"Go ahead, 7 Mary 4."
We found the baby food.
It has been eaten by an infant.
We're in Tapia Park on Malibu Canyon Road.
We'll need our copter to get the baby out.
The canyon is all jammed up.
"Negative, 7 Mary 4."
The CHP helicopter is halfway to Palm Springs on a blood run.
Sheriff has a chopper out of Malibu.
Let's get it!
"10-23, 7 Mary 4."
This is CHP to Station B.
- How's it going?
- Hang in.
I'm trying to get a chopper.
"7 Mary 4, negative on the sheriff's helicopter."
It's at Aero Bureau in Long Beach.
Its ETA would be 20 minutes.
"7 Mary 3, contact UC paramedics and advise victim eight months old, weighs 20 pounds."
Ingested approximately three ounces of pudding within the last 10 minutes.
Respond with instructions.
- 10-4.
- My baby.
What can we do?
They'll tell us.
"Hey, you know, he's cute."
What's his name?
- Henry.
- Henry?
"You know, I got an Uncle Henry."
Looks just like you.
- L.A. 15. 7 Mary 3.
"Master Huang, here's to you."
Thanks.
Help yourself!
I can help myself!
Make yourself at home!
I'll never be Master Huang's student.
Forget it!
We're still friends.
I'll help you.
I've got it.
What?
You...
"You saved a girl last time, right?"
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.
I don't want to do it!
You must win my master's sympathy.
I see!
Let's do it.
Master...
What's wrong?
Someone just raided the bank.
Mousy went and fought them.
He was outnumbered.
What's happened?
He was badly beaten up.
Where were the police?
They've all disappeared.
Mousy is righteous.
"Take him as your student, please."
Mousy!
He can't even stand straight.
I'll treat you in a special way.
"Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?"
Lay off of that stuff.
"I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught."
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry.
"Don't do that, kid, will you?"
Waste of time.
Come on.
I'm sor...
"I mean, ok."
Attaboy.
"You'll smarten up with me, all right."
Yes?
Washington?
"Ok, put them on."
"Yes, yes, speaking."
What?
"Yes, where?"
But what about my...
Oh.
Yes.
I'll be here all the time.
What?
"Nothing about Paul yet, darling."
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
"He wasn't with them, either."
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
"Apparently, not everybody's favorite."
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age!
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the Gold Rush numbers are 25, 52, 7, 32, 10, and 17."
"So, that's it for now."
Keep playing lotto!
You'll thank me later.
"""You'll thank me later""?"
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
Yeah.
You were great.
I don't know what happened.
I just...
I got so nervous.
You were great.
It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Great job.
"Thank you, Mr. Monk."
It was fun.
Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.

Have a tendency to be a big dumb daddy?
I would never say that because you let me live here.
"But because you said it, oh yeah!"
Now look Miley.
Jesse... that guy your dad just mentioned.

I guess you're right.
Of course I'm right!

"IF IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER OATH,"
YOU'D BETTER STAND ON IT YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
"HE MEANS IF THE OLD MAN DIDN'T KILL HER,"
IT'S LIBEL.
LIBEL!
YOU COULD BE SUED.
ANY NEWSPAPER THAT USES YOUR WIRE SERVICE
COULD BE SUED.
"WELL, WHAT KIND OF A WIRE SERVICE ARE YOU RUNNING, ANYWAY?"
"I KILLED IT, DIDN'T I?"

"Hey, stella!"
You quit that howling down there and go to bed!

Alright.
"I'm sorry about that, Guv."
I'll catch up with you next time.
Alright?
Thanks.
Yeah.
(phone ringing)
Mum!
Ev!
"How are you, love?"
Have you found Uncle?
"Yeah-- yeah, but there's people living in his house!"
Oh Ev...
(crying)
"Oh, come on, mum!"
Really?
"That's not helping, isn't it?"
"Of course, it's just that--"
"Okay, look, mum, what's happening with the appeal?"
"Well, Mr. Irving filed it--"
Yeah.
He said likely another 6 to 8 weeks.
"Mum, this is not going to work!"
It's not going to work!
I'm getting light here.
"I mean, it's like $100 U.S. a night."
"I mean, I just can't afford it."
But you're not there on holiday!
You can't afford that!
You need to find another place!
"Okay, yeah, where?"
Drink rakia.
- He does not like.
You have to make it fast.
"Look at me, my friend."
"Look, like that."
"Do it, do it, and after that you will feel better."
You do not like it?
"- Yes, it's very good."
Then I drink it.
And the country is 'hello'.
"Belgium, your country, is 'hello'."
"Half and Half,  or..."
- Maybe.
Maybe.
And what...
What did you find out?
Is Turkey closer to Europe?
I think so.
I think  that...
- And US?
You do not want to.
"You want Turkey, right?"
"- No, well... well..."
But how?
And when?
- It depends...
We've heard these bullshit for centuries.
"Well, at least ten years, okay?"
And it never happened.
We are about to sneeze this exquisite Serbian pork.
"Lady Louise, a gift for you."
She's a little...
- No.
Who's all this pizza for?
"Pepperoni, pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
You must love it.

Bought enough for a year.

So you knew.
Yeah.
Wash me.
Wash me.
Make my body clean.
Maybe it won't come off... but wash me.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We'll call it even.

You're under arrest.
What's going on?
Are you really police?
"Those handcuffs are fake, but we need to talk to you."
Where's Yasuo Ikezawa?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
"I'm not lying, we broke up ten years ago."
No way for me to know.
Why should I trust you?
It's been 15 years since that day.
"How are you, Captain?"
Am I intruding?
"Sure, it's after midnight."
Where are you?
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.
On a leave.
Wasn't a jailbreak.
I gotta see you fast.
"Tonight, I can't."
You'll regret it.
"Meet me in 1 hr at ""Swann's""."
Same again?
"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
Understood.
"Yankee, can you see it?"
Yes.
Do it!
Dropping hellfire.
Started!
Shit!
"How's that, bastard!"
You draw his attention!
"Ram, shoot!"
Shut up!
The GONKU is now inoperative.
Every one.
Good job.
What happened?
Hey!
As expected... it's underground.
Let's work.
Here is today's crucial moment.
"Good night, this is Tokyo Rose."
Your jokes are hard to understand.
Receiving you clear.
Yankee.
From now on we will split and start the search.
Ram and Male search east side.
Ok.
We will turn to the west.
Understood.
Are you going to search with Male's RC?
Right?
It's just for precaution.
I know...
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.

You're okay.
I love you so much.
The president.
He shot him!
He shot him in there.
"Look, I need you to listen to me."
"There's an air strike coming, I need you to run."
I need you to run as far and as fast as you can possibly go.
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.
Okay.
You gotta go for me.
"Now, go."
Hundreds of people seem to be running toward the White House.
"They've been told to evacuate too, but they're climbing the fence."
"Okay, we have confirmation."
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"

Let me speak to him.
"Hold on, I'll go and see."
Founé!
Put Sissoko on the phone.
Who is it?
Zangué?
What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
-No!
Is it wrong?

-I called her because she's my friend!
-Because Bela is your ex!
I don't care!
What does it have to do with this?
"Remember this, you can't leave the house"
-if I'm not with you.
-What did you say?
.
I'm not leaving?
.
That's not going to happen!
What?
Are you smothering me now?
.
Is that it?
-Is that what you want to happen?
.
-No.
I'll make sure you're not cheating on me
"That's why wherever you will go, you'll have to bring me along!"
"If you want to know, fine!"
If you're always like that...
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I'm really going to leave you!
-Give that to me!
Give it!

I marked it with the laser!
It looks like we finished the job.
"Male, life check."
All green.
Male.
System check.
It made me run...
All green.
Let's start.
Understood.
Dropping one.
"Yeah, come... 4 seconds until impact... 3... 2 1"

"Anyway, I thought you'd Iike a bedtime story or something."
I've got some really cool ones.
"Mad Magazine, very funny."
"The Spirit, very cool."
Boy's Life?
"Oh, here."
This guy is Superman.
"Sure, he's famous now..."
... buthestartedoff justlike you.
Crash-Ianded on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"That's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not Iike you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.
Superman.
"You're hungry, aren't you?"
But I don't have any metal here.
Just follow me.
"Pick me up, okay?"
"Okay, now, march!"
"Oh, yeah."
That's RockweII.
"Nice place, huh?"
rockwell?
"Yes, I was born right down there."
rockwell!
"Anytime, anywhere, just call beauty."
-Only call.
-Right.
"Let puppies, time to go home."
"Come on, Erik."
"Come on, children."
"-We are lost, is not it?"
"-Atticus, we are not lost."
The land of emperors should be right here.
"You are crazy,"
I'm sure the land of emperors is there.
Not here.
My God!
"Then, no!"
"Look, someone got out."
"They saw, I knew there was a way out."
"-Friend, how we get out?"
I do not know.
-I am trying to get.
"-Mano, Mano!"
"-Hey, Dad!"
"-Atticus, my good boy"
-See you all well.
What happened?
A huge iceberg came tumbling and rolling and here we are.
This is terrible.
"Nothing that would not to give way, baby."
-Mama!
-I told everyone to relax.
-For he knew they were good.
-Where's Mommy?
Has anyone seen the glory?
"I-I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess."
Just lucky.
You guess.
Listen!
"There's no fix, okay?"
Is it an owner?
Huh?
No!
I swear!
"Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?"
"Look, okay, okay!"
I have a source!
I have a source.
It's reliable.
I can't explain it.
It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.
(GRUNTING)
Can't you just ride my bets?
Yeah.
"Just make the same bets I do and-I know what ""ride"" means."
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
You are such a piece of shit.
"I hope you enjoyed the peep show, Jasper!"
I'll... take that.
"- Finn, this is-"
- IVAN:
I was just leaving.
"- Hey, guess what."
- They want Lily to skip fifth grade.
"Traditionally, the person who says ""guess what"""
also gets to say the what.
Wait a second.
Lily's smart?
- Look.
"- I mean, there's proof of that?"
- Yeah.
Right there.
- Yes.
Huh.
"They asked Alex to skip a grade, too..."
"- It's not a competition, Claire."
- ... but we felt... that it would be too much stress to have her with kids so much older.
- Good for Lily!
- Yeah.
"I just always thought she was, you know..."
- So did we.
Yeah.
- Us too.
Yeah.
- How was your big night with Javier?
- (groans)
I overindulged.
- Booze or burgers?
- Booze.
"I drank so much, I had an angry slap fight"
- with what turned out to be a mirror.
- (chuckles)
Gloria:
Do I hear my Manny?
Fitz.
You get started on the windows.
Okay.
And you get to work on the potty.
Thank you.
"And you know neither one of us is ever going to get to bang her, right?"
You have no patience.

She goes through my pockets some nights.
"Oh, absolutely."
Which horse?
"- Uh, Dragonfly."
- When's it running?
"No, it ran today."
I won that on it.
Oh.
"Well done, old boy."
"No, could you keep it?"
"No, I couldn't do that, very decent of you..."
"No, could you keep it just tonight?"
"It's Sybil, you see?"
Secret.
"Ah, a present."
"Sort of, yes."
Don't mention it.
Mum's the word.
I'll get it from you in the morning and bank it.
"Understood, old boy."
Cheers.
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"Good morning, Mr. Fawlty."
"Good morning, ladies."
Hello.
Fawlty Towers.
Watt!
I didn't say anything.
Have you called the police yet?
"Excuse me, I'm trying to take a telephone call."
Have you called them yet?
Yeah.
"Cigar, pal?"
"Oh, thanks, pal."
(COUGHING)
It's a cigar!
It's a real cigar!
"What did you think it was, Wilbur?"
W-What did I think it was?
"Oh, I..."
I thought it was a candy cigar.
My daddy always gave me candy cigars.
Candy cigar?
Yeah.
Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."
I don't think it's the same.
We must be positive.
Pal.
I feel awful.
I got some medicine that'll fix you right up.
How do like your Scotch?
Plain or with soda?
On the rocks.
On the rocks?
"Oh, on the rocks is what my daddy always says when he orders that nasty whiskey."
I can't make up my mind about you.
Let me feel your muscle.
You need to be strong now.
Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.
And I can't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together.
"Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore."
I just wanna feel safe again.
(TRIS SOBBING)
ELECTRONIC VOICE:

Four.
You're here.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I am."
You're here.
- Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Secure the hallway.
All right.
It's all right.
All right.
"Okay, I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna get out of here, okay?"
"-No, you're gonna hurt yourself."
-Don't have a choice.
One...
"-Okay, okay."
"-...two, three."
"Now go, go, go."
Ryan?
"Ryan, are you okay?"
"Yeah, yeah."
-You?
-Yeah.
"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Hey, Ryan."
"Sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God,"" because usually, I'm very good in a crisis."
But I started thinking about if anything happened to you.
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay.
We're both okay.
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.
We might encounter all sorts of crises when we're away together at college or--
"Oh, my God."
Is that blood?
I faint at the sight of blood.
"-Oh, no, no, no."
It's just glitter.
Okay.
-Taylor.
Taylor.
Call when you get tired of it.
Shit!
May your hands wither away!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Nina's out, I... it's her mother."
"Right, Maria Vasilyevna."
See how it turned out!
And who are you?
Ghena?
From her work?
"I'll tell her, I will."
All right.
Mom!
"What is it, for God's sake?"
"Oh, my little fish!"
My honey!
I've missed you so much!
You've grown so big!
You know what I brought you?
There's a basket under your pillow...
"Grandma, why have you got such a big nose?"
Why big?
A regular nose.
I'm big and my nose is big.
It's interesting...
"The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left."
How did you like your granddaughter?
She's grown up!
They grow so fast.
"- Mom, get away."
- I'll show you 'get away'!
"Don't yell, I beg you!"
"Uh, yeah."
Sure.
Hi.
I know.
Brian's here.
Relax.
"All I said was ""Hi""."
Are you gonna bite my head off if I ask you how you are?
"I had a great time in Bali on my non-honeymoon,"
- and tomorrow I start working.
- That's good.
But Brian is here.
"Yeah, well, wasn't that how you guys planned it?"
"Adam, who are you blaming here?"
Marjorie or Brian?
I'm not blaming anybody.
"I'm just... trying to move on with my life, Nicole."
That's all.
"Yo, Adam."
Get your scrawny ass in here.
I need somebody I can beat.
"I'm sorry, Nicole."
I gotta go help a friend.
- Whoa.
Sorry
- Excuse me.
"Hey, honey."
Guys and video games--
- What's the chick equivalent?
- I don't know.
Pedicures?
Let me smell you.
Come here.
I wish you wanted to go out.
I am out.
I don't live here.
"Oh, I adopted a cat."
I know.
You send me pictures.
I send them or I sent them once?
"- Oh, more than once."
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.
You have a little situation there.
With your...
Oh.
I love him.
You should love a human.
I just don't want him to be one of those exes I have to see every few years.
You know?
He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.
- Should I do anything?
"- No, no, no, just look that way."
There you go.
Smile.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Think of something funny.
Nice.
There you go.
It's me.
Work it.
Work it.
"Classic, but not a comedy."
Get them here!
"Wait a minute, sir-500 coppers!"
Four hundred-just 400 a string!
Just 400 coppers a string!
Damn it!
Three hundred!
Two hundred!
I'm generous today!
Now I'm mad!
One hundred a string!
A hundred coppers!

Not even a hundred!

Don't leave!
Don't go!
They're free!
They're all free!
They don't cost a cent!
Come here and have some!
Come on-eat as much as you like!
Bastard!
What?
Why are you ruining my business?
You're trying to take my business away?
What do you want to do?
Me?
To beat you!
You'd beat someone!
?
What a hard bean curd!
Bean curd!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.
LADY!
"LADY, YOU CAN'T BE BACK HERE."
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT OF HERE NOW.
"SORRY, I JUST WANTED TO SHOW MY BOYFRIEND -- GET OUT OF HERE NOW."
SHE'S PREGNANT.
PREGNANT?
IT WORKED.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
MY SHOE.
THEY CLASHED WITH MY DRESS ANYWAY.
"YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING..."
WE COULD DO SOME VACATION-Y THINGS
"WHEN WE GO TO D.C., YOU KNOW?"
MAKE THE MOST OF OUR TRIP.
WHERE'S MY LOCKPICKS AT?
"YOU KNOW, MAYBE A FANCY DINNER ONE NIGHT,"
TAKE IN SOME OF THE SIGHTS.
I'M GONNA CONFRONT A MAN WHO TRIED TO HAVE ME KILLED.
IT'S NOT A WEEKEND GETAWAY.

IT WAS RIGHT HERE.
"FI, THE THING ABOUT D.C. --"
IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED BACKUP.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'D RATHER HAVE SAM.
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE I HAVE A HARD TIME FOCUSING WHEN I'M IN HANDCUFFS.

"- Hi, Camilla, it's me."
- Anna!
- You sound so close.
Are you back?
"- No, I'm way too busy here."
"Yeah, doing great."
- I just wanted to check.
- Don't worry about us.
We're fine.
Everything is fine.
- What's up?
You sound strange.
- I can't talk now.
He's here.
- Johan?
In your room?
- No.
"Oh, good."
So who's there?
Are you still fooling around with Albert?
No.
- A new lover?
- No.
And my other tenant?
Is he seeing someone too?
I bet you're building a little love nest.
"I mean, separately."
"No, I don't think he's seeing anyone at the moment."
I just really miss that bastard.
- Johan?
"- No, for Christ's sake!"
It's really cheating!
"It hurts, it hurts."

"- Hi, Zoheireh_"
"- Hi, God bless you, what have happened?"
- Shirou hasn't come home yet.
- He hasn't?
He came to give the cradle and left on the evening.
- He Iefl?
- Yes.
Where has my little son gone?
Maybe to a friend's house or
He has no friends here.
Ow!
"- Why don't you sleep, my daughter?"
- I can't sleep.
Mommy?
What?
"- What is it, sweetie?"
- Nothing!
Who is it?
Who is it?
"Kheder, I think I know who he is."

- It's Bashirou!
- Shush!
What a lowlife - where's Dan Lipsom?
"Johnny Yu, that's Baltimore football!"
What are you still whining about?
I thought you'd be happy we have a team again.
"- Yes sir, right away!"
"Back so soon, you're not dumb this time!"
What?
What happened?
Take it out!
What are you doing?
Fat Pat?
- Take him to toilet and get the 'Beast'!
- Yes Sir!
"Don't do that, I'm against violence!"
I'm against violence...!
"Boss, I can't find it!"
I don't believe!
Did he hide it there?
Not here...!
To hell with you...!
Fat Pig!
"- Boss, he calls you Fat Pig!"
- You want us to beat him up?
No need!
"I'll help him to this drink, and he'll curse no more."
There's no poison!
I don't want to take...
"Here you are, $1.00 please!"
What the hell do you want?
Want some water?
Alright?
Feeling better?
It's poison!
Damn it!
Couldn't find the American and the Jew's dead.

How's the non-violence assembly going?
"Shoving a kid's arm into a Cuisinart is not a ""healthy display of anger."""
The kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?
Which only comes from a pissed-off spirit.
It's gotta be ghost possession.
-That's pretty rare.
"-Yeah, but it happens."
"They get angry enough, they could take control of a person's body."
"So, what, we got a ghost in the building?"
"OK, hurry up."
Come on.
Why did you leave the key in the car?
You look fine.
God loves you for a liar.
Daylight never saw such a ruin!
But you've put on weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.
You look good.
Blanche!
"Yes, you do, or I wouldn't say it."
But watch your figure.
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"I haven't put on an ounce in ten years, Stella."
I weigh what I weighed... the summer you left Belle Reve...

What's wrong?
Internal bleeding and head injuries.
- How did it happen?
- A car accident.
"- Shit, I don't know if I can..."
"- Sure, you can."

"Ooh, you like that?"
"Huh, what about here?"
"Oh, work it."
Work it.
You better tag me in all these photos.
"Ok, I like that."
Oh.
Hey.
"No, seriously."
I can't find Drew.
I'm sure he's just finishing getting ready.
"Seven, you ever think about marriage?"
Do I ever think about marriage?
"To who, you?"
No.
Never.
No.
"Do you ever think about, you know having a family."
Kids?
"Yeah, I mean I want to."
Do you ever think about marrying a guy?
Maybe.
If they ever make it legal.
Or if I ever move to Canada.
Right.
"What about you, Dale?"
Do you ever want to get married?
"Excuse me, Dale?"
Hi.
We're gonna close the front doors now.
"Yeah, Lila, she does."
That's good.
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?
Cheryl Ann.
"Oh, that's right."
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.
What's her name?
Bonnie.
How old is she?
Eight.
"You don't like talking with me about your family, do you?"
"No, Lila, I don't guess I do."
I don't blame you.
I got something for you.
Where you going?
"Don't shoot me, officer."
DALE:
What the hell are you doing now?
Can I turn on the light?
No.
I put it in here so it wouldn't get stale.
Can we leave this open so we can have some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
Here you go.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.

You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It's in September.

What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.

"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."

Hey.
I totally wasn't waiting for you.
My sister's car got towed.
Right.
Johnny!
"What's up,brother?"
"- Good show tonight,man."
"- Thanks,brother."
"- See you tomorrow,Johnny."
- Johnny.
"Yeah,the show was great."
"Your musical tastes have changed a bit,huh?"
"Oh,yeah,I guess you can't really sing along to the new stuff,huh?"
"I don't sing,remember?"
- Yeah.
I do.
- I noticed you're rocking the eyeliner now.
What's up with that?
"What,you don't like it?"
I dig it.
"It's just,I..."
"I admire that you can do the ""in the eye"" thing."
It makes me look like Boy George.
"Yeah,well,uh  you never needed any help drawing attention to your eyes."
"So,how's..."
"It was good to see you,Bella."
- Oh.
Okay.
- Take care.
Bye.

You're gonna be okay.

"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.

One dark and windy night.
A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.
I'm not a virgin!
You scared me!
"Robin darling, I need you!"
What?
I need you!
Me...too!
- l need you now!
- Now?
You mean right here?
But the bed's a little small!
"If you don't go to rescue Yoyo, he's done!"
Rescue Yoyo?
I wouldn't do that!
People hold cars in high esteem.
They show certain signs of concern when they lose them.

-Martin!
-I love you!
"One moment, the boss has a meeting."
I'm asking for sick leave.
Immediately.
Now before the symposium?
You've gone crazy!
And what about the report?
Do you have the report for me?
-Well...
"-Yes, or no?"
-No?
-I'm sorry.
It'll be all right.
Sorry.
-Yansky!
-Good bye!
"Martin, what's going on?"
You won't even look at me?
You have a nice hat.
"Yes, yes, Doctor Yansky."
"Decent, truthful,"
"responsible,"
So send him to a psychiatrist.
Life is beautiful.
-I know.
-So what's missing in your life?
It's not missing.
It's excessive.
The one from Sophia?
"- No, why?"
"Okay, never mind."
Thank you.

Hi.
"- Danny boy, how are you?"
I'm good.
Thank you.
"Did you guys call my office to pull,"
Sophia's voicemail off my machine?
Maybe.
We do that.
I'll look into it.
"Oh, and by the way, tox came back on her."
OD'd like I said.
- Okay.
We got a statement from the neighbor.
Russian woman.
A real character.
"- Yeah, I saw her last night."
"She said she saw a man stop by at the vic's early in the day, but no sign of a struggle."
"My gut says they were either shooting up together, or he was a dealer."
- She give a description?
Vague.
She said it was a white guy.
Big.
Really big.
That's it?
- That's it.
- Your wives.
- Yeah.

You failed at marriage.
- Twice.
Someone gave you a third chance.
- I didn't do drugs.
"Frank, all I'm asking, as a colleague, as a friend..."
And it's still no.
What are you doing here?
You're not on graveyard.
A friend was admitted so I thought I'd stick around.
Everything OK?
Think so.
I hope so.
- Cup of tea?
- Green.

"Alright, alright!"

Griff...

Sit down.
I need money.
"I got into some trouble with some guys tonight, and, uh, they say that if I don't pay them tonight, I..."
- We have to call the police.

"Sandy, the police won't, just..."
It's better if...
I hate to ask.
You want me to beg?
You want me to beg from you?
- OK.

"OK, Sandy, I'm begging."
I am begging from you Sandy.
"I need some money so please, could you give me some money?"
"Sandy, I'm scared, I am scared,"

She seemed fine.
That's important.

"You see, because last year when I came from Blitzen, Washington to Los Angeles, it cost $26.40."
"Now it doesn't seem fair to go from Los Angeles to Blitzen, Washington for $31.10, so I think something's wrong."

"Pretend I'm a girl, okay?"
I mean  pretend I'm her.
Amanda.
He's into me.
Awesome.
I knew it.
- Who's this now?
- Alex.
It's totally clear to me now.
He's Watts.
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?
-He's....?
"-Yeah, he's fine."
Yeah....
-Absolutely.
-Good.
ALICE:
"I was trying to remember, actually, the last time I saw Stephen and Phillipa."
I think it must have been Aunt Ena's funeral.
-I presume he's still working on the Advertiser?
-I don't know.
-Deputy news editor there or something.
"-Something like that, yeah."
"Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
And she still...
-does whatever she does in the City somewhere?
"-Yeah, I think so."
"-Yeah, that's right."
-Right.
And I suppose....
How old would Julie be now?
"Fourteen, I suppose, she must be."
"Fourteen, yeah, God."
"It makes you think, doesn't it?"
-Yeah.
-Certainly does.
"Oh, yes, how could I forget?"
I managed to get you some samples off the Givenchy counter.
-You didn't!
You little angel.
-Ysatis.
"Which I know you always wear, come rain or shine."
(Rachel) You don't have to do this.
Call for backup.
They'll kill you.
John?
I'm Armant.
Where's the little girl?
"Well, how do I know you've actually got what I want?"
Thank you.
Okay.
Let the little girl go and I'll take you to it.
I'm scared.
"Listen, listen."
"I want you to go with Rachel, okay?"
"Yes, go with Rachel."
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lord grant me the wisdom and the strength to do what must be done.
[bell tolling]
You gotta be shitting me.
It's inside there?
This little girl was right all along?
"Well, c'mon."
Let's go to church.
"Good afternoon, Father."
You look a little lost.
May I help you?
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."
[low beeping]
"Ah, what a beautiful sound."
[fast beeping]
"Of course, my son."
Congratulations my dear!
"Dad, you really have a good taste."
Another one?
"Well Dad, I really want me and Joy to be just like you."
It was so sudden.
"Just come home, please?"
"You're his first love, you know."
He only met that Joy because you left for Canada.
"Please Bela, just come home please?"
.
I really don't want Joy to be my sister-in-law!
She's not on the same level with my brother.
"Come on Ara, you've already pre-judged the person."
But it's true!
"I'm right, am I not?"
Right?
I'll just get back at you.
"Oh my, will you fix that quickly?"
"Make it fast, come on!"
-Hey here!
-Come on!
-What is it?
-Hey hey hey!
Why weren't you here last Monday?
-She's right.
-Doc Migs treat us pancit.
Ouch!
-I just did something important.
-Important?
Where did you go?
.
Mike!
"mike, look out!"
"oh, please, no."
"oh, no, please leave us alone."
We haven't done anything.
"Billy, no."
Billy!
"Billy, run!"
"Run, Billy, run!"

Mom!
Are you okay?
"[whispers] It's okay, baby."

One good squeeze and it'll come apart in your hands!
It's not as easy as that.
I've t--t--tried.
Granville!
Fetch a d--d--dry cloth!

- Did M--Mrs Gillespie come for her bread?

"- Aye, yesterday, about tea--time."
There's no p--pattern to the movements of that woman.
She's very irregular for someone that buys s--so much Ex--Lax!
Does it matter when she comes?
Does it matter?
D--Does it matter?
Course it matters!
"Wait, the Chemical Brothers?"
I don't think...
"Oh, you've heard of them."
"Wait, wait, wait, look."
"- Look, look, look."
"- Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"The Chemical Brothers, okay."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, they have their own Wikipedia article, and everything."
Wow.
"Now, they're real brothers, right?"
"- Well, I would hope so."
- [Laughing]
"Well, this is nice."
"Very impressive, huh?"
"- Yes, it is."
It's cool.
- Very nice.
- That's cool.
- I am done with my tomato cutting.
"Oh, thank you, Christine."
We're just gonna throw those in the salad.
- Okay.
- And let's eat.
- It's time to eat.
- 'Cause we're hungry.
"- Yeah, I'm hungry."
- And I'm saying the blessing this time.
"Daddy, don't be too long winded this time, please."
"Make it two minutes this time, two minutes."
Okay?
Ken:
Sofie isn't here.
"Try her at home, right?"
'Bye.
Fuck.
I want these.
This is another kind of wine.
A Tenuta Sant'Antonio.
It's a highly complex wine with lots of hints including tobacco.
Tobacco?
Does it come in white too?
Hey!
- You should have let me pay.
- You're killing him.
"Hi, mum."
I just wanted to remind you that it's my birthday.
It's ten where you are so I expect you're shopping.
Give me a buzz.
I miss you.
Here's to Simon.
Cheers.
- I love Cristal.
"- Simon, you're a darling."
"Happy 20th, buddy."
Let's party!
- I didn't bring a present.
- None of us did.
- He didn't tell us.
- I'm just glad you all came.
This rocks.
Where did you get it?
Yugo Danny.
It's hard-hitter blow from Columbia.
Stop.
Fresco.
"Hold up, hold up."
I do something wrong?
Nah.
I'm saying I want the whole thing tonight.
Oh.
Wow.
You cool with that?
Yeah.
Yeah?
"I don't want to see shit, a'ight?"
You won't see nothing.
Okay.
Damn.
(Gasping)
Damn.
Can I ask you something?
What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.
Whatever.
"- Angel, come on."
Are we going?
- Yes.
"- Come on, let's go."
"Come on, Mike."
Reply to the phone.
- Will not Answer?
- Do you have to move this bear herey Hery?
- My mother had given me.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
"Beautiful, is not it?"
- What's the problem?
- I do not like this place.
"This is only temporary, okay?"
Just for a two nights.
Remember?
"Soon, not whisper their home."
"Who knows, maybe one of those pools."
"First, a few need to handle the job, okay?"
"Then they whisper very, very far away."
- Really?
- Yes.
- You know what?
I am sure that Bella liked here.
"- No, I did not like."
Is that right?
Let us ask him then.
"It's beautiful, Bella?"
See?
Complacent.
Really?
Seven years and not once.
Cool.
And how about you and Gary?
What?

Doesn't matter.
I still know she doesn't hate you.
How?
I'm a daughter too.
Vi?
She left.
Where did she go?
To get more bullets.
"Listen carefully, Daisy."
"When she comes back,"
I need for you to be the one to put me down.
It's very important.
Why me?
"Cause you and me are friends, right?"
"- I guess, but..."
- Will you promise me that?
- I can't.

You promise me.

"I said I would, didn't I?"
I have something to show you.

Mom wrote down the names on the intercom.
"Esposito, CoppoIa, Wang, Ahmed, Beretta, Capuozzo."
"They're almost all from the deep South, I'd forget it."

- I'm Vivienne.
How are you?
Okay?
- [Ida] I'm fline.
You're not feeling too great.
"Well, I came to tell you that in the Poslun's auditorium... there is a picture of Alderman Herb Orliffe and his family... from about 1960, it says."
- [Ida] My goodness.
- Yes.
So when you're feeling well -
- I can get dressed...

- They probably want to film that.
"- Well, thank you very much."
"You think you can make me happy, Murray?"

"I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same."
We are not the same!
Understand?
"Now, get out."
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
"When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome."
You know what they said?
"""You're history. """
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
"Daddy, stop it!"
"Daddy, no!"
[Ariel sobs]
"Ariel, I... [sobs] Just go away."
Poor child.
"Poor, sweet child."
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were something we could do.
But there is something.

Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.

"Why, that's..."
I couldn't possibly.
No!
Get out of here.

Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.

"- No, that meeting I f elt good about until our second meeting, which I f elt bad about."
"Well, Dan, ther e's r eally no need to f eel bad about any of our meetings."
That's easy f or you to say.
You don't r emember any of our meetings.
It was 10 seconds in an elevator.
"Yeah, but you've seen me on TV."
When have I seen you on TV?
I'm Dan Rydell.
And we'r e back to the starting gate.
Good evening.
"From New York City,"
I'm Dan Rydell alongside Casey McCall.
"I'm that Dan Rydell -- ""Sports Night."""
Oh!
"I've never seen ""Sports Night."""
Don't you work f or CSC?
"I work f or Continental Corp, so I do work f or CSC, but I'm an analyst."
They don't make me watch the show.
[ Laughs ]
Ther e ar e people who watch it voluntarily.
I'm sur e ther e ar e.
It's a good show.
"Yeah, I like the part wher e you said your names."
-
- We do mor e than that.

"It's all right, mother."
I'm home now.
"Oh, yes, yes, I know, darling."
"No, I'm all right."
"Oh, my dear!"
"Hi, dads."
I'm here.
"Oh, son!"
That's a boy.
You all right?
"- Yeah, but I have to sleep."
Leave him alone.
"Oh, it's all right, Joe."
"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"
Let's get this coat off.
"You two must have had some experience, huh?"
Yes.
"Here are your pajamas, darling."
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?
Whas the matter?
"What does ""off season"" mean to you?"
Thas the big question...
Pretty bleak place...
Isn't this comfy?
Not even a lump of sugar!
But there's lots of toilet paper super-soft.
Interested?
Isn't that touching...
Daddy...
Mommy...
Jacqueline...
Poor Jacqueline all alone with her folks.
Thas Jackie's bed...
Look what she left us...
Isn't that cute?
How old do you think she is?
I don't know.
"Thirteen fourteen, at the most..."
"No, she's much older."
Much!
At least sixteen...
Take a whiff...
Les see...
You're right.
"Oh, my God..."
At least...
A real young lady...
Like she just took them off a minute ago.
Jacqueline!
"Hey, Jacqueline!"
Jean-Claude.
I think Joe there is the answer to that question.
"Let this thing lie down, John."
Understand?
"Thank you, John."
"Bob, look at this:"
"""Man thrown in prison for eloping with his sister-in-law. """
I'll be.
I wonder what he did.
Put down the paper and play.
It's cold.
"Nolt boy got killed, Tom."
- Who's that?
"- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt."
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
"That's what I shoot, a.45-.60."
"Shoot what, Tom?"
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
"He's dead, too."
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
-Yes.
He tries to buy their freedom.
Why would he do that?
He lives a good life in Malaysia with his wife and children.
How do you know?
"William, have you had contact with him?"
I had to do something.
-Oh my God.
No.
It is you.
You asked him to come here.
10.2 million euros.
That is the price for Karine?
"He killed her, he hit her head against the stone until it cracked!"
Finally.
It was not him.
Tonje saw him somewhere else.
The alibi was a joke!
We all know it!
Try to think ahead.
Think of the responsibilities we have.
Here you can not ask me.
Never.
Never.
Hey dear.
"God, so good to see you."
-Oh?
Has it been good?

Great.
"Great job, everybody."
Thank you.

"Good day, sir."

And the pIaster--!
"Hey, you hens!"
-Cut out that cackling in there.
-You can't hear us.
"- No, because it happened before I knew him."
- Oh.
- So he didn't think of telling me.
- All right.
- But I was angry.
All right.
Down here - There are a lot of pictures over here.
- Right in the front.
"- Oh, upstairs?"
- I think so.
- Not here?
No.
"- No, not here."
- All right.
The front of the building - in the front.
Hmm.
"Well, do you know which way, Ida?"
Maybe over there?
I'm not sure.
- I don't know.
All I know is that when you come in.
- This is the front entrance here.
- It has to be here.
- So let's have a look.
"Ida, there's no pictures here."
"- Well, it is somewhere here."
"- Okay, let's turn around."

"I'M SORRY,IT'S THE LARGEST ONE I HAVE."
I WILL NOT BE THE BIG GUY IN THE TINY HAT.
THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS PARTY I'M THROWING
AS HEAD OF THE PARTY PLANNING COMMITTEE.
"THE THEME IS ""NIGHT IN MOROCCO."""
THIS ISN'T YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S CHRISTMAS PARTY.
"UNLESS,OF COURSE, SHE'S FROM MOROCCO,"
IN WHICH CASE IT'S VERY ACCURATE.
"HEY,PHYLLIS,"
DO I NEED THIS INVITE TO GET INTO THE PARTY?
- YES.
- AWESOME.
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS PARTY EVER.
ANGELA...
"YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THIS FOR THE PARTY,RIGHT?"
IT'S NOT OUR THEME.
IT'S THE NATIVITY SCENE.
ALL RIGHT...
"YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CAMEL,"
"- SHEEP,ELEPHANT."
- HEY.
AND THE NORTH AFRICAN KING CAN STAY.
EVERYTHING ELSE GOES IN THE DRAWER.
I AM NOT GONNA JUDGE PHYLLIS FOR DESECRATING CHRISTMAS.
"THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO WILL,THOUGH."
AND PHYLLIS JUST STUFFED HIM INTO A DRAWER.
I NEED YOU TO GET RID OF THE TREE.
- BUT--
Concentrate.
Pardonme.
Can I point out your heart rate just increased?
Yeah.
"Well, it should have cos there's a huge crazy spider."
You see a spider?
- You don't... you don't see that?
- No.
Don't...
Don't walk.
Don't...
Holy shit!
"Tough guy like you, scared of spiders."
"Yeah, I'm just not fond of them."
It's worked out you're an arachnophobe quickly.
It's probing for weak spots.
God damn it.
Fucker!
Yeah!
Um...
Okay.
"Yeah, well, yeah."
Whole lot more realistic than the gopher game.
It's good.
It's good graphics.
"It's good, uh..."
Yeah.
Weak sauce.
- What is it?
- Just...
Nothing.
Nothing.
(laughter)
- Fuck?
What the fuck?
How did you do that?
- I didn't do that.
It just happened.
"- Come on, what do you think--"
- Don't fucking touch me.
"Now, just tell me how you did it."
How the fuck did you do that?
Horace:
"Hey, it's a trick."
Horace Sr:
"Tell him it's a trick, please."
Horace:
It's a trick.
- I don't know any tricks.
I just watch nature happen.
- Nature?
You fucking freak!
What?
"My eyes didn't see that, all right?"
What did you do?
What happened?
"- It's all right, Pete, it's a trick."
He's doing-- Show him the trick.
- I don't know.
Horace:
Show him the trick or we need you to go.

I didn't know you were a friend of the family.
"Hey, I didn't put him there."
I'm tryin' to find the guy who did.
"Mm, sorry, I don't know why I said that."
That's okay.
"I probably can't get anything out of him anyway, huh?"
I don't think so.
Dalton.
"Uh, I-I'm sorry I'm so sarcastic."
"Well, that's okay."
I guess we've both had a long day.
"Hey, you hungry?"
Yeah.
What kind of food do you like?
Anything.
"Like, you want a picnic?"
Ha... are you serious?
"Sure, why not?"
"Why not, indeed."
Cheers.

YOUR FATHER SEEMS TO THINK HE'LL GO FAR
IF HE CAN HANDLE THE PRESSURE.

"OH, HE'S JUST SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS MOTHER, THAT'S ALL."
"MM, WELL, I THINK HE'S INTIMIDATED"
BY THE SIZE OF MY REPUTATION.
HMM?
HOW ARE YOU TWO DOING?

"THINGS ARE A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT WE'RE GREAT."
"WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT."

"UH, YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT."
THANKS.

"UH, MY MOTHER DIED FROM LIVER CANCER."
"BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS A HEAVY SMOKER AND BIG DRINKER."
"Yeah, yeah, it's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Can we talk about this on Monday?
"No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.

"Oh, yeah!"
Holla at your boy!

WAITRESS:
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hyo-jin?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Whoa.
Yikes.
Good luck walking that one off.
"Noah, buddy."
Hey.
Can you hear us?
"Man, you think he knows we're here?"
"Well, I hope so."
You know how much I hate doing nice things for people if no one sees.
Oh.
Hey.
I put that there.
He stole my wink.
Every time.
"Well, I guess I better do it again."
Whoa.
Hey.
Ah...
"Well, if you want to get credit, man, let's sign his cast and get up out of here."
"Ooh, ooh."
You know what we should do?
"We should sign it all over, with different dates, and then he'll think we came back a bunch of times."
What?
"Oh, hi."
Who are you?
Hey.
"Um, we're Noah's friends, Ben and Fitz."
- We came a really long way to visit.
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, that is so sweet and thoughtful."
It is.
Isn't it?
I found it.
It's on the floor.
You should be nicer.
"Eat a D, Nancy."
Sorry about that.
"Dude, that was so embarrassing, man."
"Dude, we suck."

I took it right out before I gave it back.
"I knew we had it, man!"

"- Way to go, dude."
"Ooh, gets you all..."
"adrenaline, endorphins."
- I know.
- It's like a drug.
I know.
"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.
"We need to get cleaned up, man."
We're less than an hour away.
"Going out for a few hours, Viv."

He's just on a call.
"So, the IRA agreed to an Offer and Compromise, on your tax case."
The IRA?
The... the IRS.
"You'll have to pay a penalty, we can deal with all the specifics later, but you have some un-cashed checks in your file."
You should take a look at those.
Thanks.
I'm not gay.
You asked whether I was gay?
Yes... two years ago.
I know.
I wanted to answer.
"I'm not gay, I'm flexible."
Okay.
Flexible.
Good.
"And, uh..."
"Lana Delaney, this FBI agent, that's... flexible?"
Yeah.
"More importantly,"
I am a Harvard-educated medical profsional with 14 years of clinical experience of trauma and depression.

"Hey, what ever happened with that guy?"
What guy?
The... the heart guy.
"The one you really liked, but he was married and his wife was your patient."
What was his name?
Noah.
"Yeah, Noah."
So why should I care?
Fuck.
-What?
"-He missed the punch, fucked up--"
"Mickey, could you keep that to yourself next time, let him play through?"
Let me talk to him.
Sorry.
Yeah.
"It's not there, but that's a direction."
-It's okay?
-Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
-Truthfully?
"-No, lie to me."
"Yeah, truthfully."
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
"I don't know what I mean, exactly."
I just....
"I mean, l--"
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in exactly....

"Yes, it's been a long time."

"No, you're not."
So stop comparing yourself to him.
You have no reason to.
You have everything you everwanted.
You earned it.
I have never felt this way.
I would have never known if I hadn't met you.
I'm soaring!
You know you totally get me.
It's weird.
You are so my type.
Mysterious.
"Stylish, cool."
"A little crazy, but not bad."
This is the kind of boy I wanted.
But this...
"Actually before I met him, I didn't know what I wanted."
Now it doesn't listen to me.
It belongs to him.

Bloody Henry Faber.
"My hero, he was."
Bastard.
Even wounded in the war.
Medals on his chest.
"Anyway, what do you want me for?"
These are photographs of German military graduation classes.

Take your time.
"- I am looking for Faber, aren't I?"
- Yes.
That's him.
That's him.
That's Faber to the life.
And look.
"Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of German intelligence."
"And right behind him, his young student - the Needle."

I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...

I'm from connecticut.
Mayflower stock.
I was taught that my prince would come.

We aren't even married yet and he's already cheating on me.
I know.
I know.
"And I really don't need you to defend him right now, okay?"
I'm not.
There's nothing to defend.
It's despicable.
He did an awful thing.
"It's not an awful thing, Mom."
It's an unforgivable thing.
Unforgivable?
What do you want?

I want you to be the Dauphin's familial guardian.
It's a yellow school bus.
"I heard it on the radio, but I ain't seen no school bus."
Thank you.
"You kids, now, give me this."
"All right, get in back."
Stay back there.
You stay up here.
Leave your brother alone.
- Give me that.
"- Excuse me, sir."
What do you want?
I'm looking for a yellow bus.
"All right, give me that squirt gun."
"Look, all I'm looking to do is get out of here."
- Get up in the front.

"Yellow school bus, have you seen one?"
Thank you.
Are you sure you didn't see a school bus?

He's coming.
Done.
"Hey, will."
We found your phone.
"Oh, awesome, thanks."
"Oh, no."
"What, is something wrong?"
"It's just this girl, Stephanie,"
I have to break up with.
What?
She's kind of psycho and we dated a couple months.
Now she thinks we're engaged.
"Yeah, because you proposed to her."
Were you spying on my phone?
Ugh...
"Oh, honey, yes."
And that's how I found out you were engaged.
And I went crazy so I texted back.
Simón.
Thank you.
I fucking appreciate that.
Who copped his wire?
Some fucking mayate.
He's dead.

Hey.
Is this from Vimy Ridge?
It is.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Say again.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Occasionally.
I can let myself in.
Mam might be asleep.
I'll just see you in.
What's this?
Herbert Kirkby.
From the choir.
Has he done something wrong?
"No, no."
"With it being late, I thought I'd see him to the door."
Right.
Yes.
"Very good, then."
"Baker did very well, as they all did."
The concert.
"He killed Germans in this, Mam."
Very nice.
"You go in, Baker, you chump."
"Sorry you missed it, Mrs Baker."
You'll perhaps manage for a future occasion.
Right.
"You won't be too cold, will you?"
No.
We're in the sun.
"We won't be sitting long, will we?"
"Now, lunch."
"Excuse me, sir?"

We burned Barry's bones.
-What the hell?
"-Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just gotta go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
-What?
-Check it out.
"Martha Dumptruck, Revenge of the Nerds, Hello Kitty."
-They all rode the same bus.
"-Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"That would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."

"Look at how close those seats are next to like, home plate."
Check it out.
"What's the matter, you don't like the baseball no more?"
"It's okay, I guess."
"Just okay, huh?"
You wouldn't understand.
"Okay, then tell me, Mike."
"Talk to me, make me understand."
You don't like baseball no more?
"Fine, I get that."
"What do you like, Michael?"
Football?
Basketball?
You like school?
"Oh, I love it."
(Angela giggling)
"But we haven't the book, have we?"
"And I don't suppose you know it from memory, do you?"
I know.
I know what we like.
You must sing for me.
No.
"Oh, no, not that."
- Why not?
- Not that.
Not in good voice?
"- It isn't that, sir, but..."
- But it's such a pretty song.
"- Please, not tonight."
- Yes.
Sing it gaily.
- I can't!
"Truly, I can't!"
- Sing it with deep compassion then.
Or loving kindness even.
"- Sing it moodily, sing it with..."
- I can't!
You hear me?
Sing it!
Sing it!
Smile when you sing!
Be happy!
Be gay!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
Can't you see it's all wrong?
You're my girlfriend!
And you're my best friend.
"- Tony, I love her."
"- No, you don't."
"OK, maybe I don't."
He loves Cassie.
And you love me.
That works.
- We work.
- Why now?
It's too late.
"It's always been there, Michelle."
It just took a while.
I need you.
You can't have her.
It's wrong.

"You're done with work, right?"
Wanna come over?
Maybe not... tonight.
"Oh, why?"
"Oh right, sorry..."
I haven't been giving you spending money lately.
What's wrong?
Take it.
I just... can't do this tonight.

I call him Ramon.
"Hi, Ramon!"
What?
Hi!
I can't hear you.
What?
What's going on?
I'd really rather not discuss it.
Not discuss what?
When a person says he'd really rather not discuss it...
Is it about the show?
No.
"So, then...?"
"Believe it or not, some things are not your concern."
"Well, tell me what it is, and I'll see if I agree."
"Is it, like, something serious?"
I'm not having this conversation.
"Yeah, we are."
Come on.
I care.
Tell me.
No!

-Were you scared?
Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
"I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it."
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
"Oh, hi, Bo."
Hi.
"I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock."

Rose could regulate the speed of her descent.
"Yeah, and she could control how fast she fell."
That's what I said.
"Steven, try falling a little faster."
"I can't figure out how, and it's taking forever to reach the ground."

"No, no, do not close the lid."
"- No, later, later."

You'll have it bursting all over the place.

- Fully clothed?
"Well, I couldn't go in in the nude, could I?"
"Well, could I?"

"- Well, fall into bed."

"Actually, we'll have two strawberry milkshakes, extra whipped cream."
We couldn't find you anywhere.
"You know, finally, your mom stayed up top, and I took the elevator all the way down to the ground floor."
"And I got out of the elevator, and there you were, reciting the alphabet, in French, to, uh, the security guards at the CN Tower."
"And you were little, too."
You couldn't have been more than five.
Not scared though.
"Nah, not one bit."
Heh.
Take your time.
Thank you.
Oh.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Heh.
"My, uh, wallet was in my jacket."
"Oh, no way."

And hear a symphony.
"Albert Hall, sir?"
"Well, I sort of hoped that..."
What makes you say...?
"So you'd like to go out, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.
Don't hurry.
Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"

You might read to me.

"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
- Stop it!
Ugh!
[glass shatters] [coughing] [panting]
"Oh, no."

I guess I'm on my own.

You're all right.

(all laughing)
"Hey, listen, you poor souls, no use renting a room."
"You three guys can stay with me here, all right?"
"Well, thanks, Bilko."
Dancing isn't something you forget.
"I promised a dance to Betty, the second one after intermission."
Do you mind?
"No, not if you promised it to her."
"- Well, I'll see you around, okay?"

"Rodney, it's beautiful."
"Here we are, snug as peas in a pod."

Who could she have meant?
What's wrong?
Yikes!
W-Wha...?
What...?
!
You had a frown on your face.
Worried about something?
"Well, this physical is so unexpected..."
It's strange that it's happening when Dr. Kazamaki's away.
I know...
But Ms. Tamahara did check on it...
The Commander probably has his reasons.
Is that so...?
"It's a pain, but..."
We've got to do it.
Hey!
Wait a minute!
What's with that string?
Don't touch me there!
Penalty...?

"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi."
He checked out.
"Oh, God."

"You don't understand, sir."
(STAMMERS) It ate my car.
GENERAL:
And you saw this happen?
"No, I didn't actually see it."
It went off into the woods.
"So, you don't have any evidence?"
"But, but, sir, I've got an eyewitness!"
An eyewitness with a concussion.
This thing...
This thing is a menace.
(STAMMERS) It tore up the power station.

"So, how are you two doing?"
"You know, Dick, there's more privacy in the back ofthe..."
"No, Trini, we're fine here."
Okay.
"Hell, Kennedy just pissed Cuba away to the Russians."

How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.

What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
-We're fine.
We were ambushed.

I wanted to talk about Ryan.
"Yeah, I know, it's cool."
We don't need to discuss it.
"Well, I think we do."
"I mean, I know you're upset, your mother and I are upset."
But our responsibility is... is to our family.
"Yeah, that's okay."
"No, I get it."
"I mean, this is a person's life we're talking about and we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities."
There's no need for sarcasm.
I'm not being sarcastic.
"Well, it's hard to tell sometimes."

I'm going to skew your son everyday in my jail.
Day-night.
I'll make him suffer slowly.
I'll pressure him to death.
Every time he breathes...
I'll file new charges against him.
I'll make his life hell but won't kill him.
Because people are mistaken about death.
I'll be in touch!
"Hey, you."
Come here!
You got a lighter?
What the fuck you think I have arms for?
You're free to go now.
- You want a smoke?
- Yes.
"Henry, Akan's already started."

I don't know.
Because I'm...
Stuck here.
Yeah.
There's something here.
It's from my team.
This means the new moon.

- And this?
It means they can only hide five men.
You and four more.

It's the best chance we have.
It's your call.
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.
Good.
Gun.
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.
I can help.
What do you know about guns?
You aim and squeeze and your target dies.
How do I know I can I trust you?
You don't yet.
What's going on?
These men have experience training soldiers.
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"- Sir, they're gonna be fine."
- They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
"- Well, I'm not gonna let it."
Let's go.
"- But my wound, Gina."
"- Sir, with your brain and my body-- and my brain-- we make one unstoppable unit."
"Now climb aboard, sir."
And let's go.

That was funny.
Dad!
Hey!
Looks like TV.
Can I use your phone?
The phone's over here.
Where are your parents?
I only have one.
A father.
He's in the T onapiya Wetlands.
What's that?
"Well, this was all once the T onapiya Wetlands."
"He's trying to save the last five acres, but he won't."
Why?
No money.
"He teaches science by day, and, I don't know, tries to save the wetlands by night."
"I admire him, but I pity him, too."
You pity him?
"Well, yeah, his goals aren't realistic."
That's him.
You'll be able to do it now.
- What?
- Go to law school.

Any word from Beth?
"She's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be..."
Sister's what?

"You said ""funeral."""

Who'd he give it to?
Shalom.
"So, I got assigned Rautavaara's ""Piano Sonata No. 2""..."
"- You know, ""The Fire Sermon""?"
"- Yeah, it's wonderful."
Sounds like a piece of cake for you.
Are you kidding me?
- It's the hardest in the canon.
- We'll get together later.
Who's that?
That's Miles.
He's a junior.
"He studies guitar and composition, and he deejays in Chinatown on the weekends."
He's cute.
"Yeah, he's okay."
"Oh, my God."
He's looking over here.
What's wrong with him looking at you?
I don't want him to see me in this.
This outfit is stupid.
You'll freeze to death.
Here.
No.

We'll swap.
So I will transfer you my energy.
I will transfer my karma.
Here is my karma on you.
Jason!
You have a great aura.

You could do this with your partner at home.
Sure.
Let's ride this energy out!
Keep your chin up.
Yep.
"Yes, this fire has just started."
And we will not put it out.
What is he doing?
I don't really know that pose.
"Okay, now we go into the happy baby pose."
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Please regard me.
I'm sorry?
"Please, allow me."
To do what?
Regard me.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
"You are doing fantastic, my dear."
Do you think I'm bad?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
How can you be sure?
I know.
You're good.
"Well, since I'm good, can you get me a bowl to fetch milk?"
"When I go to the fields, I'll find one."
I want it now.
It will only take two minutes.
I'm late.
I have to go.
That lady will find you one.
Go on.
"Mim Hamideh, hello."
Do you have a milk bowl for the engineer?
"Yes, by the window."
All right.
She says to bring the bowl back.
I have to go.
Off you go.
May God give you pride.
May God give you good health.
May God give you a long life.

What do you want?
Milk?
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Aren't we going back?
"We still have some time, right?"
For what?
I want to be with you a bit longer.
When he comes...
He'll take a while to get back.
Let's just go somewhere.
Where?
Anywhere.
Let's just look for a place.
"Ah, here."
They don't even have a front desk.
Isn't it the one outside?
Is it?
Let's try the second floor.
They're all empty.
No one's here.
This is crazy.
"- No, please don't."
- I think I'm going crazy.
Be patient.
Let's meet in Seoul.
He'll go nuts if he finds out.
But I want to have you.
So bad.
- Really?
"- Yes, really."
For real.
"Then, strip."
Everything?
"- Elizabeth, how are you doing?"
- Fine.
Good.
"Well, we'll catch up downstairs."
- I heard rumors.
"- All true, I'm afraid."
The one face I missed seeing in Recovery.
"I'm so sorry, Robert."
"What, about my arm or about not being there?"
- How are you healing?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
You?
Any sensory function yet?
Nope.
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
- Dr. Corday.
How was London?
- Good.
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had.
- So I hear.
- How's Ella?
- Fine.
- Is it nice to be back?
I'm off to the ER.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
"Well, good luck."

I'm having a fun time in this place.
"And, Wayne, can you tell me how much you make in a fiscal year?"
WAYNE:
Katy!
It's impolite to talk about your money.
He's no slouch.
Okay.
Touche.
"Well, I'm about to begin your story."
"Where maybe one is ""too hard."""
"Maybe one is, um..."
- But in the end...
"- Yeah, you lost him."
He seems...
He seems nice.
Do you live...
Do you live in here?
"So, what did you think of Goldilocks and the Three Dates there, Wayne?"
Ready to fall in Goldi-love?
Or Goldi-lust?
You won't be Goldi-laughin' when I break your Goldi-legs.
Dim the Goldi-lights?
Nights of your Goldi-life?
Use your Goldi-language.
Make her Goldi-laugh.
"- Yes, that's it."
It says:
"""At the foot of the mountain."""
"Hello, why are you late?"
- Why are you late?
- You've been waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Who told you to wait?
My uncle.
"I see, your uncle is..."
Mr Hashemi Masti.
It's a long way to your village... lt's not far!
Not far?
What do you think of your village?
"I've lived here since I was born, I know it."
We're your guests then?
Yes.
Do I turn left here?
- You were waiting for us then?
- Yes.
Since two p.m.
I've been waiting since school finished for the day.
My uncle said:
"""My friends are coming."
"Bring them to the house."""
- Did he say why we've come?
- Yes.
But you mustn't tell anyone.
- All right.
- Good boy.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for lost treasure."
Good idea.
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.
"Look, I have to debrief Chappelle."
"I'll see you in a minute, okay?"
"Dad, I know about your drug problem."
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"

Don't worry.

Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.
"I think that you're incredibly attractive too, Sara."
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
I think about you.
Trust me.
A lot.
How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.
Do you think about having sex with me?
Yeah.
How?
How do I think about having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me going down on you?
Yeah.

I think about how you'd taste.
I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
-Do you resist me?
-No.
-Do you give yourself over?
When did this happen?
When you were with her.
Christ.
Why didn't you beep me?
"Hey, John, you were in Milwaukee."
"Look, I've got a patroleo with her."
Who?
Crowe?
"Aw, Jesus, Tommy."
I told him to call me... if anything happens...
anything at all.
Let me ask you something.
"You believe her, don't you?"
"Yeah, sure, I believe her."
"Tommy, could you take over for Crowe through tonight... just till I get my head fucking straight here?"
"Good morning, Miss Brody."
Where's John?
He's working.
You'll be safe with me.
"Well, can you tell me when he'll be available?"
No.
No message.
Miss Brody!
It's Detective Ridgely.
Is everything all right?
Did you get my messages?
I've been calling you... and calling you.
Are you OK?
Where's Ridgely?
Ridgely?

CONDUCTOR 2:
He must be around here someplace.
Hello.
Goodbye.
The train hasn't stopped.
He couldn't have gotten off.

What's happening is that this is a great song.
"I'll be out here if you need me, Jess."
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
"Yeah, like he'd ever have a job."
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
"Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV."
"- I miss you, Jess."
- Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
"- Oh, that's not healthy."
- I told you to water the plants.
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, you know it's not my thing."
I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?
- Oh!
"- Oh, what a mess."

"- Jess, take your shoes off!"
We keep an Asian household.

What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?

Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.
"I know, man, it's a great feeling."
"I mean, things are looking up."
This has got to be the beginning of some good stuff for us.
You know?
It's got to be.
"I'm so happy for you, man."
"Thanks, man."
How's the club?
It's great.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I got more money than I know what to do with.
That's the way it should be.
"Yes, sir."
Oh.
We're smiling.
Must've been when we first landed.
Yeah.
You know who's in that picture?
You and me.

"I'm sure it will, at times."
And at times I'm sure I'll be exhausted and angry and think I've made a total mess of my life.
I'll be there.
"You will, won't you?"
Even if I get confused and strange and horrible.
"Yeah, I'll do my best."
"I will, too."
"Connie, we're gonna have a baby."
I know.
That's great.
LUC:
I'm... (STAMMERlNG)
I'm going to be a father!
You're going to be an aunt!
(CONNlE laughing)
"Girls,"
I think you should come upstairs.
I'll be right here.
"You will, won't you?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
"That's very, very good."
Commander.
What is it?
A group of people escaped the blockade.
What?
"Hey, leave Dr. Cicchirini out of this."
He's my boyfriend.
He's an asshole.
"He may be an asshole, but he's my..."
What are you making me say?
"Okay, fine."
"Make the call, but first you should know I did it for you."
Sandro!
"You mean... the Addison's disease,   the fake kidnapping..."
you did that for me?
Yes!
"Meaning,   I'm so important to you that ..."
... that you ...
Yes...
"God, it's cold."
Stop!
"Stop, please!"
"I'm Dr. Cicchirini, can you give me a lift?"
"Hey, slow down."
What happened to you?
I've been robbed!
"16,600 liras, my girlfriend..."
"- Give me a ride, I can't go any farther."
"- Come on, get in."
"My God, what a terrible experience."
Mother of God...
That's the truth!
- What is it?
"- I'm not sure, but that's a serious stench!"
- And it's getting worse!
"- God, yes..."
What a stench!
Who's your favorite player?
"Who's your favorite player, Ben?"
"Hey, come on!"
Who's your favorite?
- Mark Grace.
- Mark Grace?
What?
Are you nuts?
Shawon Dunston's the man.
Best shortstop in the game.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Next season I'll take you to Wrigley Field.
"Come on, stick with me!"
Stay here.
I'll take you to Wrigley Field....
"Come on, damn it!"
We'll get a couple of dogs then we'll compare Grace to Dunston.
All right?
There you go.
"Hey, stay up!"
Stay awake!
Keep your head up.
Keep your head above water.
All right.
"All right, so you think that you know a lot about baseball, do you?"
Come on.
All right.
Ask me a question.
Come on.
Ask me a tough one.
Let's go.
Stay with me.
"Jesus, baby."
I was talking to that man.
Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.
- Can you focus on me over here?
- Yeah?
Burying you.
It's like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...
"Henry, stop dicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
Chop Chop.
Shh.
"It's me, Jimmy."
Move.
"Oh, shit."
Those pigs are here again.
Psst!
Don't compromise my lab.
Let them leave.
There's some cyanosis in his fingers.
- Heart rate...
- 185.
I've gotta tube him.
Scope!
"- I'm here, what's up?"
- Sudden acute respiratory distress.
Looks like trauma to the neck.
Obstructed airway.
- Kid's circling the drain.
- I need the endoscope.
- What?
Why?
"- This temp airway the cops put in,"
I can't take it out.
I gotta intubate through it.
Damn it!
- What's yours for?
- I can't...
No landmarks.
- O2 sats down to 88.
"- Hurry, Jerry!"
- There's too much swelling!
- We don't have time.
"OK, hold on, I think I got it."
ET tube.
- OK great.
Let's get ready...
"- No, sorry."
It's totally closed.
- Heart rate up to 190.
- He needs an airway now.
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!
[Footsteps]
"Yeah, that's great, yeah."
(moaning)
Mr. Cheng?
Mr. Cheng?
"Mr. Cheng, what troubles you?"
Nothing.
"If nothing, why are you out here alone?"
I'm resting.
"I can't see, but I can listen."
"You never say much, or even laugh."
Right.
I am troubled.
Everyone has some worry.
"You mean, you have troubles?"
Naturally.
Mother's dead.
"I just have an aunt, she is kind, but that's all."
"Actually, you should worry about your eyes."
It's no use.
"Oh, no."
"If you go to the city, find a foreign doctor, maybe you'll see again."
(gasps) Really?
It's the only chance.
Sure.
But where do I find the money?
"Don't worry, when I'm finished here, I'll take you."
Thank you!
"Mr. Cheng, thank you."
[Aunt] Xiao-Mei!
Yes?
[Aunt] The sheriff is leaving.
I'm coming.
You trust them more than me.
I trust you enough to be honest about this.
Look at this place.
"Locks, cameras everywhere."
You obviously think someone is watching you.
"But as soon as something bad happens, you point the finger at me?"
How do you know you haven't been hacked or broken into?
Have you even considered that?

In school today.
"You know, it is so not OK to"
Slap your classmate in the
Middle of class.
I'll handle it.
She's out of control.
"Hey, I'll handle it."
I like uncle Johnny.
He's so nice.
He never gets mad.
He never yells at us.
And he never does that thing
That daddy does where he would
"Say something and then, like, a"
"Few seconds later, he'd have to"
Explain that he didn't mean what

"Oh, you mean sarcasm."
Yep.
I have the package.
"Ground floor, through the library and down the stairs."
- The library.
We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
"- Walker, I say again we are coming to you, we are on the move."
In the library.
- Shit.
I'm empty.

"Run, run, run!"

"I was, um, I was just..."
You were with someone in here.
"No, I wasn't."
Who was it?
Skip?
I said I was alone.
"Okay, okay, fine."
I just thought I heard a man's voice.
"Come on, the meeting's started."
Let's go.
"Hello, my name is Skip, and I'm an addict."
"Hi, Skip."
Uh...
I was in love... with a bottle.
"We slept together, we worked together, and... we got fired together, and, uh...if--if booze was..."
"my demon, then, uh... 12 Steps To Recovery has... has been my angel of mercy."
"It didn't happen overnight, and, uh..."

NARRATOR:
He was brought across in 1228.
Preyed on humans for their blood.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Was that...?
Was that a conscious choice?
- I'm gonna dig into you.
- I think so.
- I think I remember being...
- I love Switzerland.
I think I remember saying it.
It's just...
"Like, yeah."
Well...
"Of course, those aren't gonna work."
And then Andy said a lot of funny stuff here.
He gave that guy a lot of funny names like Cheddar and...
What were the...?
The names were:
"Switzerland, Steinbrenner."
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
T-Bone.
"- T-Bone, yeah."
- Michael.
- And he said a lot of funny stuff.
- Your tighty whities are visible.
Yeah.
Kat made me have the most uncomfortable meeting with Andy Samberg.
- I didn't mean to.
I was so 7th grade and embarrassed.
I didn't mean to.
You were gonna meet him that night or you weren't.
"I was like, ""Oh, Andy's here?"
"Selena, I don't want to wait that long."
I want to marry you now and become a lawyer too.
"Honey, don't cry."
It's nothing to cry about.
"Please go, Ted."
Just go.
Okay.
I guess I picked the wrong time.
"I'll come back tomorrow, when you're feeling better."
"Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Why, Nellie you didn't have to come to work today."
Work keeps my mind off of things.
"Selena's all right now, isn't she?"
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.
"Everything is just trouble, Mrs. MacKenzie."
Just trouble.
"Nellie, don't do any work today."
Just sit around and relax.
"Happy Labor Day, Mother."
Something's wrong.
She's upset.
"Can't blame her, with Lucas gone and nobody knows where he is."
I've gotta run.
Bye.
"- Hi, Norman."
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Come on.
"Hello, Mike."
Where'd you come from?
- Back there.
It was all adrenaline...
[ Indistinct talking continues ]
Mamma?
Everyone is sitting and waiting in the cafeteria.
"Come in, please."
Close the door.
ScanBrazil has withdrawn the contract.
-The agreement was completely waterproof.
-They have gone bankrupt.
This is absolutely insane.
They sat here and smiled a week ago.
I'll find a solution.
"Go down, you."
I ...
Just look at the numbers.
ScanBrazil is thinly possible.
Of course I'm sure.
Because it My job is to be sure.
-Thanks.
-There you are.
-Hi.
-It's not so bad.
I now know not.
I'm so proud of you.
Did you call anyone?
Fine.
I'll be right.

I ain't troubling no one.
- Your neighbors are complaining again.
"You got to turn that music down and go back inside, son."
- It's a free country.
I can do what I want.
"- Come on, man."
Don't cause any more trouble.
We don't want to bring you in again if we don't have to.
Was it you?
Huh?
Fucking no-good coward.
"Hey, you got something to say to me, Harold?"
You say it to my face!
- Hollis!
Hollis.
"Hollis, that's enough."
That's enough.
Go in the house and sleep this off.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's for covering blood.
It doesn't have to match the drapes.
You want to hold him?
"He's fed, changed and burped... happy."
It's the perfect time.
"Well, you... you've got him."
Violet...
"Okay, breathe in and out."
"Shh, shh, shh."
Remember what we said?
"This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out."
You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
"Reese, what do you think you're doing?"
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.
Half a can makes me nuts.
Based on true events
"- Well done, Casper."
- Let me have a go.
- Happy with the flat?
"- Yes, two floors."
I love it.
"One floor is Mia's, the other is mine."
"- Splash, Frank!"
The champ.
- I'm off.
- Where to?
- Some sort of lunch at the Gimp's.
- No change in Bodil?
"- No, she's a wreck."
- What's wrong with Bodil?
- She's suffered brain damage.
- Up here?
"- In the brain, yes."
Surprise.
- How did it happen?
- She choked on a giant olive.
- This big.

"Jesus Christ, it's targeting."
What?
It's firing.
Target is an aircraft somewhere over Ohio.
Appears to be a modified 747.

- Nice and easy.
That hand down!
- Nice and easy.
- They're on him!
Damn.!

I wish you'd run.
I'd love to kill you.
I would love to kill you.
"But you can't run, 'cause you're busted.!"

"This is the money shot, Ned."

He's innocent.
- He's innocent!
- Later.
That really was funny.
"I'm sorry, but may I ask you something?"
What floor is the pediatrics on?
Yoon Jae?
Yoon Jae...!
Yoon Jae...
Yoon Jae...
"Yes, father?"
I went to the hospital to see Yoon Jae...
But he looked really busy.
What?
Yoon Jae's at the hospital right now?
Well...um...
I'll leave the dumplings with the front concierge desk.
So make sure to tell him...
To pick it up and eat it.
He totally dissed me.
Gyung Joon doesn't know that's the hospital Yoon Jae works at...
I'm going to go crazy...
-Assistant principle...
I'm actually...
-What?
What is it?
-It's nothing.
-Teacher Gil Da Ran!
Put down those files right now.
Excuse me?
Those files...
I was looking at them.
Put them down right now.
Those files...
"You were looking at them, Teacher Na?"
"Yes, Assistant Principal."
Mm-mmm.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kai!
It's Erica!
"Look, I came all this way!"
Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.
You can go.
Now.
"Kai-- I told you to stay away, all right?"
Stop trying to save me.
It's not your job.
"If Dr. Fred can give up, so can you."
"No, Dr. Fred, he hasn't given up."

"Yes, actually, I have..."

"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...

Yeah.

Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?

What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
I don't know.

I want out of this job.

"Go, go."
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And good luck.
- Thanks very much.
- So Joe's all right?
- I'm afraid he's gonna live.
"You can go back, tell him the racket is his."

- Yep.
- So am I.

- Pulse ox is 80.
He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.
"Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk."
They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
"Hey, George."
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
"- I know, I've been busy."
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
"Hey, I'll see you."
"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
"I mean, this is my town."
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
What about?
- Kramer.
"- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me."
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
It wasn't my call.
Oh!

[Hotch] Yeah.
Kaman Scott worked for Chris Edwards.
- He was fired seven months ago.
- [Garner] Why did he kill him here?
Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
- Anything in the van?
"- Welding equipment, cans of gasoline."
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
"Without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore."
Then he's gonna lash out again.

Prentiss.
I think I found something.
What do you got?
A girl.
There's two more of the same girl in here.
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes
- Lily and Rose Starling.
P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
"- All right, you fellas."
It looks like you're in need of some assistance.
- Get back!
- Huh?
- Back off!
- Huh?
"I said back off, motherfucker!"
Hey.
Hey!
Ho!
"Oh, man!"
Give me the case.

"Now it's time to play the snowmobile game, with your host, Russ Richards!"
Destination anywhere
"So far gone, I'm almost there"
"Can't you see, i can't deny"
I'm outta here like I'm on fire
"Livin' like an animal, criminal"
Television newsman so subliminal
Bringing down the walls of wonder land
Ohh!
- [Indistinct]
- Get out of here.
- You.
"Come on, you, baldy."
Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.
"Come on, move."
Move!
- Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You're married!
There's always something dragging you back.
What was he after?
Nothing.
You don't know him?
No.
Good.
And thanks for doing the riding hat.
Get me out of bother.
Who have you spotted now?
Mr Tubby.
"Aw, he's walking away all sad."
Will you not just have a butty with him?
No!
Yoo-hoo!
Tubby!
She's changed her mind.
She will have lunch with you - next Monday in the square.
Bring a yoghurt!
Sorry!
Pauline!
He's lovely...!
"Straight to the top of the stairs and quietly, please!"
Quiet.
Quiet!
"I shall be checking hands, faces, boots, and hair ribbons."
"The Halle Orchestra looks smart, so must we."
"Baker, come here."
You... are a chump.
What are you?
"I'm a chump, sir."
If Miss Riall had seen you in that state that would have been it.
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
"Okay, come on, come on."
When'd you attack lompard?
[Gurgling]
When you attack lompard?
- July...
July 31st.
- Good.
That's what our spy said.

They're over there...
Come on!
"Hey, you, give him a hand there."
"Oh, Christ!"
"Let's get outta here, huh?"
[Rapid gunfire]
[Indistinct chatter]
Let's move... come on!
"All right, let's get the fuck outta here."
This way!
"Hey... hustle, hustle!"
Let's go...
let's go!
Come on!
Take 'em up...
Let's get out of here.
Song:
I have been a witness to the spilling of the blood seen a lifeless body lying in the mud
I walked away alive with a wounded heart but I had to heal it
You might be able to catch him.
Come with me.
But-
Please!
Go to see him in Ito.
He's important for you.
Do you have money?
"Yes, I have some."
Good.
"When you see him, give him my regards."
Yes.
You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
Has there been any change?
No.
They believe that she might remain in this condition for some time.
We will wait as long as it takes.
We are used to waiting.
"I bet that she will be surprised, waking up to find that everything has changed."
Will I...
Will I seem different to her as well?
"She will think that you have grown into a fine man, I'm sure of it."
I shall return.
Milord Slaine!
Rittuo...
Eddelrittuo...
Milady...
I...
She...
She is awake...
Your Highness!
It is me!
It is Slaine!
Do you recognize me?
"It's Slaine, Slaine Troyard!"
I am Slaine Troyard...
Your Highness...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Slaine...
Your Highness!
I've been waiting so long to hear you say my name once again!
Not yet.
- One day.
- Mm.
Ah.
Another?
- What the hell is that?
- Get it down you.
Is there no chance of them getting back together?
Mum and Dad?
No way!
#... around me
"# Inside I'm feelin', oh, so cold"
"# Oh, yes..."
"So, tell me about London."
I don't see it.
Underground most of the time.
Underground?
"Er, yeah."
I'm a tube driver too.
"A writer who also drives a tube train, eh?"
Very glamorous.
"Research for your novel, I suppose."
Yeah.
That's right.
It's all about a tube driver.
"Handsome, comes to the Lake District, meets this feisty, young girl who gives him a really fucking hard time, and they get drunk."
"Oh, yeah?"
How does it end?
Tragically.
Oh!
"Hello, Paul's phone."
"No, I'm sorry, he can't get to the phone right now."
There's a meeting I go to... over at the Calvary Church.
- What?
- It starts at 8:
OO.
All right.
Hey.
"Oh, Burton, you caught me."
"Oh, no, that's all right."
"Shannon was upstairs, so I snuck a butt."
"Oh, OK."
- You got another one?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"
- Yeah.
- All righty.
See you soon.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Some bad news about Aaronson's wife.
- What happened?
- There was an accident.
What did he do to her?
[tires screeching]
[sirens approaching]
[dog barks] [helicopter approaching]
[boy #1] get off the street!

[boy #4] here come the goon goons!
[older boy #1] let's get 'em!
[older boy #2] they run like chickens.
[boy #1] more goons!
[boy #2] we're trapped!
[boy #3] hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
[older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
[older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
[older boy #1] hey!
"[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
- [all yell] - hey!
[laughing]
That was an ambush!
[older boy #2] stop banging into me.
[older boy #1] I can't see.
[older boy #3] I can't get out.
[older boy #4] get me out.
Get it off me.
[boys] yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
- [Ursula laughs]
- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
- [Cackles]
- You!
You monster!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"Oh, you think you're pretty good, do you?"
I am deadly accurate in everything I do.
Old Mr. Chads here.
The meanest teacher I ever had.
"- Oh, he was harmless."
- Mm-mm.
"Easy for you to say, he liked you."
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
That's because he never knew
I was the one putting' gum on his seat.
"Oh, that was you?"
"He'd jump up all wiggly and squirmy, grabbing' at his backside, th... that squeaky little voice of his cooing like a pigeon."
"Ooh, ooh."
[laughing]
- [cork popping]
- Ooh!
[laughing]
Social studies.
Why do we even need to know the state capitols?
I'm never going to Kansas.
Topeka.
Show off.
Vermont.
Montpelier.
Wyoming.
Cheyenne.
Deadly accurate.
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
- [gasping]
"- Come on, come on, come on, come on."
Shh.
Let me get the door.
"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
I'll beat you up!
Watch the teapot!
I don't need your advice!
I'm telling you
You...
"Get off, right?"
"Okay, I'll take your word"
Why are you pulling my clothes?
"Gao, are you really leaving?"
Y es!
But bear this in mind
"It's me who fired you, not vice versa!"
"Oh, you asshole!"
"Hi, is there some gold here on the road?"
It's you again!
Stay calm!
I just want to ask you something
Mind your head!
"Oh, you two are killing each other?"
Who exactly is your Brother Y an?
Y an Qingwang!
How come he stayed with Thunderstorm?
Say!
"Y es, yes!"
I'll tell you!
Brother Jin is killed!
"Y es, after Y an Qingwang killed Jin Tianyun"
He stayed at Thunderstorm's house
Dad!
"2nd Brother, 2nd Brother!"
"2nd Brother, don't you know me?"
I'm the one that's always bullied by you
A NICE GIRL WITH A BUTTON LOCK ON HER DOOR.
"YOU MEAN SOMEONE NAMED ""NANCY."""
AHEM!
"NANCY, YOU SEE THAT MAN IN THE DARK SUIT"
SITTING OVER AT THE BAR?
HIS NAME IS MIKE O'LEARY.
HE'S A PLAINCLOTHESMAN FROM BURT'S DEPARTMENT.
"FROM NOW ON, HE'LL BE YOUR SHADOW."
"HE'LL TAKE YOU TO THE RED CROSS TONIGHT,"
"AND THEN HOME TO YOUR ROOM,"
AND MAKE SURE THE DOOR IS LOCKED.
"MORNINGS, YOU WON'T LEAVE"
"UNTIL HE'S THERE TO GO WITH YOU, WHEREVER YOU GO."
YOU'LL BE SAFER THAN YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE.
THAT'S THE KIND OF GUY YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY.
I LIKE THE KIND OF GUY I'M GOING TO MARRY.
I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.
I WON'T LET HIM DOWN.
"ALL RIGHT, DARLING, I'LL DO IT."
LET'S KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY!
"I WAS PRETTY SURE YOU'D SAY YES,"
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING
"YOU DID SAY YES,"
BECAUSE THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF OUR ENGAGEMENT
IS ALREADY IN THE PAPER.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
NANCY ENGAGED TO ED MOBLEY.
"THAT NICE LITTLE SECRETARY OF YOURS, DARLING."
HMM.
I WONDER WHAT SHE'S GOT.
What?
I'm a dirty panty fiend.
I have a thing for your panties.
"Really, I can't get enough of your jumbo panties."
I really love your panties.
I love your panties so much.
You can stop saying that.
I'll stop saying that now.
Good.
"Now, Marnie, what are you doing here?"
Ask Ricky.
Don't say my name.
"So, Ricky sent you?"
"Oh, Marnie, don't kid yourself that I don't know all about the big secret."
What secret?
What secret?
And I don't care if my husband did father that fat bastard!
Sshhhhhh!
Coach Bowman's my dad?
Ricky.
Can you feel me closing in?
"You're mine, Ricky."
Ricky!
Ricky!
"Hey, we're trying to sleep."
Sorry.
"Yeah, I do get carried away sometimes."
I should just shut up.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
"For over a century, I have lived in secret."
Until now.
And that's the end of my 20-second break.
"Good luck, man."
"So, Emma, what kind of music do they play?"
It's like an '80s pop vibe mixed with a little Black Keys.
Cool.
This is gonna be painful.
Be nice.
"So, Emma, how do you know Mat?"
"I think what she's trying to ask is, does he have a girlfriend?"
That's definitely what she's trying to ask.
That's not what I was trying to ask.
Do you guys want me to ask?
"Hey, Mat!"
No!
That is not what I was asking.
He's single.
- Lou?
- Yeah.
Lucy.
We're Someone's Little Sister.

Have you gone crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Clean this up and go to your room!
You're not our mom.
To your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I've had it.
"Anything else, maybe?"
( Door slams )
I want you to say 10 times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!
- Say it.
- You're my mom.
- Properly.
You're my mom.
Look at me.
"You're my mom, you're my mom..."
Louder.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
Stop this foolishness!
I'm not playing along anymore.
Understand?
There'll be only one breakfast and one set of clothes.
And promise me not to talk to your brother!
No.

Promise me.
Don't shoot!

The boy's alive?
It's a trick!
Launch the missile.
"Are you mad, Mansley?"
"All units, stand down!"
Rogard to Nautilus.
"Come in, Nautilus."
MAN:
This is Nautilus standing by.
Launch the missile now!
That missile is targeted to the giant's current position!
"Where's the giant, Mansley?"
What...
Oh...
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.
"There's no way to survive this, you idiot!"
"You mean, we're all going to..."
"To die, Mansley, for our country."
Screw our country!
I want to live!

We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We got ambushed.
We're lucky to get out.
We lost taka.
What about the guns?
Gone.
It wasn't a complete loss though.
Kuauo got it out.
We got it out.
"Wow, this is great."
"This is your new place, huh?"
"No, yours."
Mine?
Mine?
You don't like it?
"No, no."
I mean yeah!
It's just that it's so big.
"You know, for one person."
Perhaps that will change.
What kind of bullshit is that?
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
I will investigate it all.
What's this?
- We found something.
- Come here.
This...
"What do you think this is, Team Leader Song?"
When you choke someone by the neck...
Seo Jun Seok and President Hwang's... necks?
Tell Im Tae Ho to come out here!
Wait a minute.
What is that?
That wasn't in our car before!
Sir.
"This is what I think, in all seriousness."
"There are times when you must run away, even when you did nothing wrong."
"I think that's your best move, to make some time for yourself."
Honey.

Take good care of the kids.

That's paper inside.
Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."

"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
And is this a dessert or a side?
- It's a warm banana.
"- Oh, okay."
Halved... microwaved for two minutes.
- Hmm.
- Give that a shot.
"- Oh, 'cause it's..."
"- Oh, God, the middle is hot!"
- Take some water!
- [coughing]
- Mm.
- This is not a good meal.
"No, no, no, no, I'll just munch on this dry pasta."

You know what?
I have a better idea.

Do you know the way to Makati?
I'm lost.
I don't know...
I don't know how to go.
Bring me there.
Don't you have a car?
.
I'm Pacio by the way.
You're the one who cured my wife.
But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
Hold it.
Sorry.
That's going to leave a bruise.

-Tell them to stand down.
The Captain relieved you of duty.
When did I?

You gave it to Jai.
And Jai...
I get it.
It's between us.
Why drag Jaiprakash into this?
"All right, Hari..."
what's wrong?
Your touch has awoken the music in me!
That's the background score.
Who was playing it?
It happens in emotional scenes.
Was it the radio?
I've got to give you some news.
"Your husband is dead, isn't he?"
But don't worry...
"I'm willing to marry a ""window""!"
Window?
Aren't you a window now?
!
It's Widow; not window.
Never mind!
But we will still meet!
No.
We will not.
Two gardeners and a rose.
What?

Don't look back.
But that man there...
The chap with the blue shorts?
- You know there is no such person.
- There is.
His name begins with F.
F?
A promising letter.
Foster?
Forrest?
Fotheringay?
Featherty?
- Fortescue?

Might I play your pianoforte?
Yes.
Of course.

I cannot remember when we last had a song in the house.
Brandon!
Come and meet our beautiful new neighbours.
What a pity you're late.
You have not heard our songbird.
A great pity.
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.

"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
What is it?
You won't tell me.
I'm hungry.
We can go to my place.
- Who did you inherit it from?
- My great-aunt.
She was great.
She loved collecting things.
She hooked a rich building speculator... and traveled.
This was her depot.
- Her depot?
- So to speak.
You'll see.
"The whole family died of envy, and in the end... everyone came away empty-handed."
Almost everybody.
Yeah.
She saved my life.
Just because you went shopping once!
"OK, OK."
Forget it.
- Lf I'd only known before.
- What?
That you're such a great roommate.
Where are you going?
What?
"I have to pee, you dumb cow!"
Or maybe not.
Hello.
Good-bye!
Shit!
Just a minute.
Great.
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!

"Really, Scott?"
I can't.

Or what is left of you.
You trust these guys?
Yes.

"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.

"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.

The Director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
He didn't say what it's 'bout.
"Tell him, ""he can find me""."
But...
I have found you.
No you haven't.
You are a masseuse.
Leaning the way of the ship.
"With Johnnie cradled, cradled in your arms."
Cradle.
Oh!
No...no thank you.
You look up.
And you see coming towards you...across the deck.
A vision of loveliness.
And you say.
Get up!
"""Kid's pretty messed up."""
"Girl, kid's pretty messed up."
"How are you, Dud?"
Pleasure.
This is Dan Mackintosh.
"Hi, Dan."
John McFeely.
"Oh, yeah, McFeely."
"All them ""Mac"" names sound alike to me."
"Had breakfast, Charlie?"
Yeah.
Charlie's a goddamn Yankee from Detroit.
"Listen, Dale, if we talk to this guy and he's involved in this shit..."
I told you he don't know nothing...
Hurricane.
"Dale, these are dangerous people we're dealing with."
"Well, I understand that."
"Well, you boys about ready?"
Just a second.
DALE:
"Here you go, Fern."
Keep the change.
"There ain't no change here, Hurricane."
It's a $12 check.
You give me a ten.
I'll catch you later.
Is he gone?
I haven't had a full meal since I met the son of a bitch.
"2-10, go ahead, Jimmy."
Go over to Harlan Childress'.
Lureen said he's raising hell.
I'm on a case.
Unless he's trying to kill her I don't have time.
She said he is.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
You want to tell me what's going on?
"It must have been something I ate, I..."
Something you ate.
And now I...
I feel better.
- I think.
- What'd you eat?
- What's gotten into you?
"- I know you, Marie."
And I know when something's up.
And you know I'm gonna dig it out of you sooner or later.
Lamb.
I ate lamb.
"Now, do you mind?"
"A little privacy, please?"

"This is, uh, personal."

Last party.
- Our records this long.
Something did.
"- OK, Shaolin."
"- Then you do not have a problem, right?"
"- Yes, no problem."
Who is this idiot?
- The Car Go down
- Fuck!
Damn!
Let's See!
Oyanalıyor know?
Ez on the guy!
Now!
Do it!
John?
!
- Out of the fingerprint is the output?
- No.
Nothing.
Every place cleaned up.
- What computer?
Nothing can be recovered?
- I do not know.
I can not understand.
Need to take to the center.
Out there can handle.
"- Hey, I play it."
"Yan says the woman in the office, 2 staff leaving devoted to one before."
"Young like, maybe in the 20s."
Long brown hair.
I promise you.
Pinkie swear.
Okay.
Enough.
Shit!
"Fun, huh?"
What's the worst that could happen?
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.
It's harder when you don't know what you are.
My love carries a death sentence.
"I was lost for years, searching while hiding only to find that I belong to a world hidden from humans."
I won't hide any more.
I will live the life I choose.
"This is not the day to piss me off, kid."
"I told you, man."
I wasn't even there.
Because I was banging your old lady.
"- Yo, Dy."
Dyson.
- He broke my arm.
- Just breathe.
-It's not broken.
"- Breathe, breathe, breathe."
-It's just dislocated.
What's gotten under your collar?
- See?
All better now.
- You got fleas?
You okay?
Ready and begin.
Yes!
Bust it!
She still is.
Roommate I.D'd the photo as a Jordan Arnold.
Run the DMV.
Get me an address now.
We're running out of time.
Snitch's Tavern.
Your first arrest.
That guy had to be 6′6″ easy.
"–Still, that bust was when I knew."
–Knew?
That maybe you wouldn't be a complete screwup after all.
–Take a right up here.
I wanna show you something.
"–No, I can't."
I gotta get back to the barn.
I got some stuff I gotta check up.
Bullshit.
"This is your training officer, all right?"
Take the afternoon off.
Humor an old man.
Take a right.
Come on.
All right.
Yes?
I've got a problem on this Tio murder.
What's that?
"The more I look into it, the more Vic Mackey's name pops up."
"Well, Tio was Vic's C.I."
He was also a drug dealer.
Vic's name is all over his phone records.
But Vic told me he hadn't talked to him in months.
–He lied.
Open the door!
Open the door now!
Break it down!
This is a waste of time.
We don't need him anyway.
I need him.
"If he's a member of the resistance, he may be able to help me contact my ship."
Monster!
He's the one.
He took your mother.
We have to...
They want a fight.
Don't give them one.
What?
I've done nothing!
I've done nothing.
Please!
Please...
You look like a helpful citizen.
"So, tell me."
You might have seen some strangers who were in the marketplace earlier today.
"No, sir."
"No, I've seen no one."
Please.
You!
"I'm looking for someone, a woman."
I haven't seen any woman.
There are two right over here.
"You see them, don't you?"
Yes.
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.
Caylem...
Should I call the boss for you?
"Don't piss me off, I've a gun."
I just got dumped.
"Let me remind you, there are CCTV cameras."
Cover your face.
The price tag is still on your toy gun.
Don't come over!
Don't come over!
...
Lucky.
My money!
You're under arrest.
What underwear?
You're officially under arrest.
"I'm Inspector Mak Ho-Man, Michael Mak."
Shit!
Shit?
Shit?
!
...
Congrats!
Solved another big case!
More like a ridiculous case...
Money means nothing to these rich playboys.
Michael!
You did it again!
Where should we celebrate?
I've reserved a table at a good toro Japanese restaurant.
Expensive but I know you won't mind.
I'm not going.
You guys go ahead.
Why?
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mason."
"When I call you last night-- uh, meet Lieutenant Anderson."
We've met.
"You Mr. Norstaad's lawyer, Perry?"
"No, no, not for this."
For something else.
This morning I forget to call you and tell you I do not need appointment anymore.
But it is all right.
You send me bill anyway.
And now you turn around and go back.
Goodbye.
"Well, Axel, as long as I'm already here--"
"No, no, no, you're such a busy man."
We don't want to keep you.
Goodbye.
"Goodbye, Perry."
"All right, Axel."
"Good luck, Andy."
What's the matter?
They stop serving?
Mm-mm.
Floyd Chapman's over there.
"All right, let's have a meeting of the Bar Association."
Perry.
What on earth?
"Hello, Miss Street."
- Hello.
"- Well, Counselor."
[both] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't answer that satisfactorily.
Can you?
Don't see why not.
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
Miss...
- Doctor!
- Mr. Santarelli...
- What happened?
- Something... something terrible!
Three men kidnapped me.
"- Oh, God..."
- Three men?
- Yes...
No!
- What is it?
"No, it's not possible."
It's impossible!
What?
The three men...
were you and your friends!
Me?
I can't forgive your prank this time!
"It wasn't funny, you understand?"
- I'll have you thrown in jail.
- It wasn't us!
Twenty years in prison!
People don't do this for a joke!
You're thugs!
Criminals!
"No, you mustn't call."
What are you doing?
Of course I'm calling.
"Okay, I confess, I was with my friends."
"Ah, he confesses at last."
Of course.
I can't bear to see you with Dr. Cicchirini...
I'll start getting bigger in a few weeks.
You can hang around with someone else then.
No fellas'll come near us if one of us is pregnant.
"So, Sharon, who you havin' it for?"
I can't tell.
Sorry.
Sharon.
Give us a hint.
- No.
- Just a little one.
Do we know him?
You're scarlet.
We must know him.
Is he married?
- Jesus!
"- No, he's not."
I'll bet you he is.
- Is he in here?
"- Jesus, Yvonne!"
Would you do it with anyone here?
I was only asking!
"You're right, though."
"Sorry for insulting you, Sharon."
"Seriously, though, Sharon."
Do we really not know him?
No.
Swear to God.
Where did yous...
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, all right?"
"Let's get pissed, will we?"
"Oh, yeah."
Young Sharon's after getting herself up the pole.
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
He's my arch enemy...
in affairs of the heart!
Alright!
I promise you!
I won't be with him after you've rescued him!
Really?
"Yes, I really mean it."
Will you come with me then?
"Sure I will, wherever you go!"
Yoyo's locked up there.
- So high above!
- Let's go!
- Over there!
- OK!
From here!
I go first!
Come up.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
Old friend!
I feel good now!
- Commissioner!
- Yes sir!
Did he tell you where the 'Beast' is?
Ask him!
"Yoyo, tell us."
I won't!
"I'll let you go if you tell us where it is, or else..."
You'll get Amelian!
"(A million) ln that case, I won't say anything!"
- What?
Bring him Amelian!
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
Master finagler!
"-Oh, right."
-(laughter)
"Drink up, boys."
"Ernie, uh, what have you been doing since you got out of the Army?"
I'm with some outfit.
"Come on, drink up."
"Oh, come on, come on, now, Ernie."
-What are you doing?
"-Well, it's a big outfit-- big."
"If I mention the name, you'd know it right away."
MORGAN:
What outfit?
What difference does it make?
I'm doing all right.
Believe me.
"Secret, huh?"
"Well, in a way, it has to be, yeah."
TUBBY:
I got it-- government work.
You could call it that.
Yeah.
You got a contract with the government.
For four years.
-Four years?
-Whoa.
I got a six months' contract.
Then comes cancellations and changes in specifications.
-How do you do it?
-Very simple.
"When the four years is up, I simply reen... uh, renegotiate."
-They're only too glad to do business with me. -(buzzing)
The tea is for Sifu!
Thinking of making a run for it?
Grab him!
Sifu!
- He's Wong Fei-hung?
"- Yes, it's him!"
That guy's involved as well!
He knows Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
Stop!
On your knees!
- Sifu...
- Sifu...
You two have gone too far!
Committing crimes in my name!
You're the real Wong Fei-hung?
I've been too lenient with them.
"Marshal, please don't take offence."
I'll deal with them later!
"OK, Wong Fei-hung."
"I won't pursue this, for your sake."
"Marshal, thanks for your understanding."
"Tonight, I'll hold a dinner upstairs especially for you."
Good on you.
"Foon, come with me!"
Sifu Wong?
You've already learnt Shirt Pinching Toad Trap.
You don't need another Sifu.
Get out!
Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
"Have another drink, have another drink."
Thank you for coming.
"Sifu Wong, I'll drink to your hospitality."
But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.
Quit stalling.
Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.
How did you frame him?
I socked his head.
Then planted the liquor in the car.
Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.
"Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean to have nobody get killed."
[GUNFIRE]
Have you heard enough?
"Plenty, Stacey."
And thanks.
"Okay, pal."
That's just what I hoped.
[GUNSHOTS]
[EXPLOSION]
"I'm all right, Frank."
"Stacey, you can't wash out on me now."
I need you.
I'll get you out of here.
"I'm going out, pal."
My way.
I wanna tell you something.
[GUNFIRE]
"That dame of yours is the one that sprung ya, not me."
Take care of her.
She's worth it.
I think I can hold 'em!
"No hurry now, Dale."
"So long, kid."
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."
Time is running out for him.
"I can feel it, John."
But time is running out for all of us.
Except you.
"You're dead, man."
"""Sticks"" have the name of a club."
"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?
!
(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?
)
"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.
- Rook'u Where can I find?
- I do not know what you're talking about halttan.
Fuck man!
It tires me out.
That's the Kung Fu Grandpa passed on to us.
Use your fingers.
I can't use it to fight.
Who lost a coin?
"Me, I lost a coin."
I lost a coin.
Who did that?
Bastard!
You soiled my laundry!
I'll get you!
It's not me!
Nothing to do with me!
"- Not me, not me!"
- Don't deny it!
I'll teach you a lesson!
Stop!
Brother Foon.
We're mates.
"Let me show you around, build up your confidence."
How do I get confident?
You mean...
Don't make it sound so bad.
You're learning the Tao of life.
- Tao of life?
"- Yes, let's go."
JADE PAVILION
"Marshal, please come in."
What kind of place is this?
This is the most upmarket brothel in GuangZhou.
- Brothel?
- Yes.
Medusa?
Anything like that?
No.
One point.
"No, I'm going to throw it over to you, Lutrophiles for a bonus point?"
Hejira?
Hejira?
"I'm not even going to ask you to show me a first letter, because I know that's wrong."
The answer you are after was...
ALL:
Oh!
"Oh, you know it now!"
"So, the Aristophanes play Clouds - Aristophanes, of course, the Greek writer - he wrote it in..."
Does anyone know the date?
Come on!
423 BC!
I can't believe you didn't know that!
"And the Joni Mitchell album Clouds, Best-known track?"
Both Sides Now.
"Both Sides Now, great album."
"OK, Lutrophiles, we're back with you."
Reveal the hive.
"Was Liston, Frazier...?"
Careful.
"No, Liston's not there."
Frazier...
Foreman?
"No, not sure it is."
Or is it?
For three points now.
"Holmes, is it Larry Holmes?"
Holmes is there.
But the respect I earned made me think I'd found the answer.
"When J.D. showed up a year later,"
I knew we'd get even stronger.
"Hey, man, what's your name?"
Hey!
Where you from?
La Primera.
East Los.
"You talk like a fucking chicon, man."
I'll check you out later.
"Órale, I see they finally let your white ass out of the hospital, carnal."
Santana!
"How you doing, man?"
"Cool, ese."
Mundo!
"You guys, check it out, man."
"This right here's J. D. , my best crime partner."
"This is Chuy, Casper, Chucko, Raymond and Big Happy."
J. D. :
Órale.
"Can I talk to you, ese?"
"Yeah, come here."
(SPEAKS spanish)
"You thinking of letting him in, ese?"
I told you he was my best crime partner.
"He ain't Mexican, ese."
(SPEAKS spanish)
Órale.
"So, homes, how's that leg?"
"Check it out, hard as a rock, ese."
"Shit, homes, throw some shellac on it!"
Shit!
"Medium-rare, a little pink inside."
"No, your bun!"
Light or dark?
"Either way, it doesn`t matter."
"Vicki, can I help you with that KooI-Aid?"
please?
"I don`t know why they call this ""Hamburger helper! """
It does just fine by itself.
"I Iike it better than Tuna helper, don`t you, clark?"
"You`re the gourmet, Ed."
No meat in this?
You get plenty of meat at home.
Be polite.
Have some ketchup.
"real tomato ketchup, Eddie?"
Nothing but the best!
Aunt Edna!
HeIper`s getting cold.
Is that your Aunt Edna?
Aunt Edna!
After all these years!
You`re looking so good!
"Hi, Edna!"
Nice to see you again!
- Albert--
Whose baby is it?
I'm sorry.
"Uh, we no longer have a claim against the clinic, so..."
Elaine.
Esther.
Bob.
I didn't know there was a board meeting today.
I can take the pills myself.
"Okay, fine."
Will you come visit?
You call and we'll make a date.
"I'll get some licorice, coffee, tea, whiskey."
You name it.
Okay.
"Take care of yourself, alright?"
Thank you for everything.
I'll be waiting.
"Let's go by the house first, I'll change my shirt."
"But I brought the one you wanted, it looks nice on you."
Where do you want to sit?
- Next to you.
I don't want to go.
You're kidding me.
"Goni, please."
"Daddy, do as I say."
Don't talk to your father like that.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goni.
Let's give it a pass.
I can't.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
He likes to take me because I know all of his business partners.
It's just...
It's easy for him.
What's he do for a living?
He's an entertainment lawyer.
Mmm!
[Smacks lips] Mmm!
- Is he rich?
- Does it matter?
I don't know.
Does it matter to you?
"If it mattered, I'd be with him, and I'm not."
I'm with you.
[Laughs]
I told my friends about you.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
What did you say?
- That you're crazy...
- [Laughs]
And that I'm having a sexual awakening with you.
Wow.
A sexual awakening.
I told them that I've never come so much in my life.
[Laughs]
"Oh, wait a second."
Even more than with Paul?
- Way more than Paul.
- Yeah.
Paul was too big.
I couldn't take it unless I was really drunk.
What's wrong?
Rewind.
And kiss.
- Jake--
- You want to know if there was tongue.
"I can tell you, decidedly there was not."
"- No, Jake."
Figgis is here.
"- Okay, well, good talk."
Don't die.
Holt had very soft lips.
Wish I hadn't said that one either.
We should get into positions.
"- Yeah, okay."
"- Hey, kill the lights!"
Figgis is here!
"- Excuse me, ma'am, this dolly's being used."
- Broccoli che visto?
- It's being used.
-Quantieralavitolabella ?
Tuttomatrolamente?
- Just bring it back when you're done.
-Ah!
Garbanzomarinara!
Pizzeríarestaurante!
Ahh!
Jackpot.
Let's do this.
- And how am I supposed to get all the way up there?
- Gracefully.
- Boost my bottom!
- I'm boosting!
- Boost my bottom!
We'll fly it out of Cairo.
"And Gobler, I want plenty of protection."
Jones.
"Holy smoke, my friends,"
I...
I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England... boat, plane, anything."
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
- How?
- I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
- The Ark?
- Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
- For who?
"- For, like, it's an app."
You can kind of...
"like, I've used it all over when funds were low, so..."
"- Oh, there's some interesting ones."
- Pretty cool.
"- ""Thrillseekers wanted."""
- Ooh.
- This looks right up your street.
- Okay.
"Okay, four pound signs."
That's a biggie.
That's good.
It's a little out of town.
And some kind of play test deal for a company called Saitoo...
Saitogoo...
- SaitoGemu?
- SaitoGemu.
Yeah.
They're huge.
- They're really big.
- Really?
- Horror games?
- Uh...
Have you heard of...
"Oh, what's one of theirs?"
- Harlech Shadow.
- Harlech Shadow?
"Yes, I have."
"I used to play that in my buddy David Ludwig's basement when we were, like, seventh grade."
"Well, that's Shou Saito."
It's his company.
Please.
Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacksin there.
"Yeah, in there."
So your name's Henry and...
"Okay, what a good news is that you gonna a while."
"Bad news is that in this case,"
"""a while"" means 20, 30 minutes tops, Henry."
"Unless you're very, very lucky."
Which you are.
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take you to his lab.
Hang on.
"Ah, Shit."
We got ?
on our tail.
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.
There's no clothes in here.
Put the hoodie on.
"There's no enough time, fuck."
Just cover the blood up with the your bag.
Just stay calm and let me handle this here?
Maybe we can skip right to the fine?
So...
Shit.
Fucking Akan paying...
Do you know what's wrong with Mother Russia?
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
Too goddamn hot.
As you wish.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
And I shall.
Take care of her.
Of course.
Look. ;0]
We'll put this by the window.
So you can watch your friends dancing across the street.
And look.
I love this room.
I'm going to order the whole lot.
And...
Come in and close the door.
How are you?
Sit down.
Thank you.
"Alicia, look who's here."
"We're just getting some air, reading magazines..."
Who was that woman who just left?
"Katerina, Alicia's teacher."
Her teacher?
"Yes, her dancing teacher."
Katerina's a real character.
Her academy is in front of my house.
Alicia was her pupil.
And Katerina loves her like a daughter.
FOUR YEARS EARLIER
"Benigno, you've been at the window for half an hour."
"I'm coming, Mom."
Are you following me?
No...
"Well, yes."
And?
I think this is yours.
"Master, he's right!"
Seems like he's not bad
What did you say?
Master is angry!
No wonder you can't win over him!
Dad!
"I'm sorry, Master!"
Master's technique is good
But now he can't even stand still
He was defeated in at least six or seven stances
He picked up the brick
The brick?
You bastard!
Master!
Stay there!
Don't run
It's me!
"Master, stop it!"
Stop it!
You bastard!
How dare you beat me up!
I didn't mean it!
"You did, too!"
And you beat me so hard?
It's just a mistake!
Mistake?
It's more than one time
"No, Master can't take it"
Dad!
"T ell me, who taught you those stances?"
Me
I taught him!
- They can put the finger on you.
"- Quit waiting there, will you?"
Keep in touch.
Let me know what the doctor says.
- Get our doctor if you have to.
Come on.
- Wait a minute.
"Listen, Patsy, I'm asking you, don't go up there, will you?"
- All right.
- Wouldn't that mean--?
"Now, boys."
"Now, wait."
Now wait.
Now let's be sensible.
"Now, let's start all over again."
I'll change everything back to what it was before.
- I swear I will.
I'll change and--
- You're a liar.
"We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree."
Where did--?
Where--?
- Let's go.
Get him.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up and get him.
Let's hurry up and get him.
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Come on.
"Hurry, Patsy."
He's dead.
"Hey, come on."
"We all spend so much time, energy AND money in an effort to look our best."
We all WANT to be attractive.
Hello.
"Hello, Rose, it's Alex."
Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?
"Oh, I'm okay, I'm... trying to get on with my life, ya know."
"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."
"Sammy, watch where you're going."
I'm watching.
"I'm all right, man."
Jesus-sorry!
[Overlapping chatter]
"Red light, red light."
Jesus fuck!
God damn it.
"You're fucking pushing on me, man."
Who's that?
"Hey, it's John Wayne!"
It's not the same guy.
"Hey, it's Mr. America."
I thought I told you to get out of here.
Holy shit!
[Gunfire]
"You must be thinking of somebody else, friend."
Come on...
Get out of here.

That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.
"Where'd you get it, then?"
I stole it.

Should have been.
There was nothing you could do.
Lie down.
Give me the butt.
Come on.

I wanna buy something for my wife.
What's the occasion?
Just because.
May I suggest jewelry?
I thought you might.
How about a ring?
A silver band.
Lined with amethyst.
Is amethyst your wife's favorite stone?
I just think it would look nice.
"Hey, that one."
It's perfect.

Pretty.

"No, far from it."
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
"Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?"
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
"There he is, men."
Frag him!
Let's string him up by his pull string!
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
"No, no, no!"
Wait!
I can explain everything!
"Okay, Mom, be right down."
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
"Mom, do you know where Buzz is?"
"No, I haven't seen him."
"-Andy, I'm heading out the door!"
"-But, Mom, I can't find him!"
"Honey, just grab some other toy."
"Now, come on!"
"Oh, okay."
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
"Honey, I'm sure he's around."
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

Period.
What do we do with the Atomium?
"I'm sorry, but do you have to do it right now?"
"Yes, it's very itchy."
Almost done.
I wonder how he feels.
He is probably in shock.
Wallonia broke off Belgium.
You can imagine his distress.

Kebab accident.

"Hello, my dear."
Who are these people?
Who are all these guests?
"Mother, they are from Belgium."
They have to get to Sofia.
"They need a bus, can you imagine?"
A bus?

"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."

You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.

Not bad.
A little surprised by all the Justin bieber.

I love her.
He's a guy.
They keep saying that.
But I'm not buying it.
What am I gonna do?
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.

"No, I cannot leave the ruins."
But their revenge will be carried out.
The four pirates are condemned.
They will perish.
We will go to meet them!

What's your name?
Paula.
Paula?
I don't know anyone named Paula.

"You are ill, Mr Biberkopf."
Minor injuries to your head and arm.
I need to get out of here!
I have work to do!
I need to get out!
I'll get a doctor.
Just a moment.
What is going on?
What happened to me?
"Excuse me, we need to get your personal data."
"You don't mind, do you?"
You've been run over by a car on May 12th on Eberswalder Straße.
"You are Biberkopf, Franz."

That's it.
You're awful big for 12.
"Oh, it's glands."
The whole family had glands.
"Why, my mother was 6'4""."
We called her shrimp.
"If you're only 12, you're pretty young to be traveling alone."
"Oh, well, that's all right."
I'm not scared.
I'm going be a space cadet.
Where are you going?
Home.
"Oh, here it is right here."
You're going to... (GROANING)
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm train sick!"
The rocking.
Here's your ticket.
"Oh, I..."
I'm train sick.
The...
The rocking of the train.
I'm really sick.
I get nauseous on a train from rocking and when it goes fast and it shakes back and forth.
I'm really very sick from the train.
Would you please keep quiet?
Yeah.
"I dropped my gun, mister."
Wow!
(TITTERING)
My gun shoots milk.
But it's a bit late now.
She's a pretty girl.
I can see why you liked her.
Just one kiss and then we'll go and join the others.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Lukey.
"I'm dying, mate."
I'm dying.
Just don't know that.
I've got holes in me.
I'm losing blood.
It's not rocket science.
I need a doctor... or I'm dead.
"One call, Luke."
"Give me one phone call, that's all I ask"
Just... just to give me a fighting chance.
I'm begging you.
That's it.
What're you doing?
"Luke, focus."
"We need... we need a phone, Luke."
Luke!
"Sorry, man."
Sorry.
This'll ease the pain.
"- Get away from me, you fucking coward!"
- I'm trying to help!
Luke.
Give me some.
What have you ever done for me?
"Everyone knows I'm a bitch, Luke."
Knock on the knocker!
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
Lexus convertible!
"Oh, that's good."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Oh, God, that's amazing."
Yeah!
"Fellow, you're late!"
You're late!
"The last 15 minutes... have been a fucking rollercoaster of emotions for me, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I fired up some of this shit.
"Fire up my fucking nose, yeah?"
But there you are.
"It's okay, Henry."
You just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
"PASS THE CARROTS, HUH?"
"I NOTICED A GLITCH OR TWO WITH MY 'COPTER,"

It was.

That's okay.
"But since you don't have it,"
I'm gonna need that kiss.

(SHUDDERS)
Is something wrong?
(LYDlA SCREAMS)
Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I..."
Which is why this is gonna hurt.
-(BONE breaking) -(screaming)
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles...
You make a good Batman.
"Oh, my God."
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
Don't kill her.
Of course not.
"But you, on the other hand..."
No!
Don't!
"Please, please."
No!
"Please, please."
David!
Please!
No!
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
My God.
Try the other zones.
Who's in the basement?
Let's see what's down there.
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"Oh, my God!"
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
Or was it all of you?
"Was it you, Jones?"
Was it you?
Was it you?
Or was it you?
"You sick bastard, you're imagining things again!"
Oh yeah?
"You've been fishing with Ivan lately, Reynolds?"
How's that...
How's that tuna biting?
Let me see you talking your way out of this one!
Where is it?
Christ!
"What the fuck now, Reznik?"
Get him off me!
"You're through, you fuck!"
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
And... my heart is broken.
Yeah.
Nai would what to say to you right now.
"I can't talk to her, though."
"I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore."
Exactly.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"I'm so sorry, daddy."
Hi.
Hi.
Nice shoes.
I hate talking about shoes with you.
I...
I hate that at's all we talk about.
I miss you.
I... where are you?
"Where... where did you go, Addison?"
"Like I said, nice shoes."
You came.
"No, wait."
I...
I need you to listen.
Just listen?
Um...
I want to be a good mother.
"I want to be a good mother so badly,"
"And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel..."
Uh...
Katie stole something from me.
"She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back."
"But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay?"
Okay.
because I wanted to forget him.
Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
"Wow, in stereo."
Great.
Thanks.
You ready to go?
"Hey, perfect timing."
"- How is it, haole?"
- Shamu.
What's with the stick?
You got slammed in a cruncher?
"- Um, I don't know what that means."
- Sand facial.
"You ate a big one, huh?"
There was no surfing accident.
"He, uh, busted his knee getting out of bed."
- How white can you get?
- Pretty white.
- Who's this?
"- This is my sister, Mary."
"- Mary, meet Kamekona."
- Hey.
This is the reason I called.
I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put.
"Oh, come on."
You want me to babysit your little sister?
- Correct.
"- Shoots, small kine."
"She doesn't leave this office, you under..."
"Whoa, whoa!"
Hold on.
Seriously?
What if I have to use the bathroom?
- Don't spill.
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
Illingworth.
"Ah, yes."
I see.
And then up there.
"Yep, yep."
And that leaves...
May.
"May, that sounds plausible."
And that gives...
Stewart.
Yes.
Alec Stewart.
You've got it.
You were on fire!
"Marianne, are you the big cricket fan?"
Yeah.
"Cos they were, ""Come on, Marianne - say some names!"""
"You were coming out with them, one after the other."
Very well done for a full ten points.
You certainly know your cricket.
Let's go through the names as you put them in.
"First of all you put in Cowdrey, Colin Cowdrey."
And you spotted you hadn't got that quite in the right order.
"Brearley, Mike Brearley, captain during Botham's famous Headingley Ashes."
"Hussain, Nasser Hussain."
"Pietersen, Kevin Pietersen."
"Illingworth, Ray Illingworth."
"May, Peter May."
"And finally Stewart, Alec Stewart."
And you didn't fall for any of our red herrings -
"Botham, Gower, Strauss, Willis."
Didn't go for any of those.
"Hello, this is..."
"Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin."
Professor Gregory Larkin.
Answer the phone.
I'm sleeping.
- Hello.
- Hello?
"- Yes, is Professor Larkin there?"
- Who?
"I mean, is Professor Morgan there?"
- Barely.
Who's this?
- This is Gregory Larkin.
I'm a professor in the math department at Columbia.
I was just calling to see
- how you are tonight.
- I'm fine.
How you are?
Fine.
"I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me, but I sat down in one of your classes."
And I was very impressed.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
Hold on.
- Wait.
Could you talk louder please?
- I sat in on your class.
- Hold on.
Don't go away.
- I was impressed with your teaching.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
I can do this!
"- Hello, can you hear me?"
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
- God dang.
The things I would do to that.
- You gonna talk to her or what?
- I don't know.

"- What the fuck, Lance?"
- You stupid idiot.
- It's all good.
- Seriously?
- They're leaving.
Great going.
- Come on.
Don't be like this.
Come back.
"- Fucking idiot, dude."
- Hold on one second.
"- Well, well, well."
- Hey.
"- Hi, honey."
What are you troublemakers up to?
- Just hanging out.
- Yeah?
Hanging out?
- That's all we're doing.
I swear.
- Where's your dad?
Fuck if I know.
"- You know, you're getting yourself quite a reputation around here."
"- Come on, Jacob."
"- Hey, Jacob."
"- All right, whatever."
- Shoot.
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?

He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?

Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.

This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"

- Yeah.
I also got two feds- Mulderig and Klein.
[Groans]
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys... and they can get all they want from ""Uncle Sap."""
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
"[Man] Mike, take a look at this blue one with the tan, on the right."
- Try a practical demonstration.

Weren't you supposed to call as soon as you got there?
"Yes, but I was in a meeting."

- How are you?
"Fine, they're very welcoming."
- It's not even hot.
- Stop it.
Stop lying.
"I'm yourwife, you can tell me you're suffering."
"Sure, it's tough, it's a mess here."
I knew it!

Taste the pastiera.

"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"

"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.

"I am not stupid, I am a German of Germany."
"No, you are an excrement German."
"All good, wanted?"
You are excited?
"Finally we can make the love,"
"Today also we have found a bloody fool,"
You cannot come on a daily basis here.
Why no?
Because you stay as an idiot.
And why I stay as an idiot?
Because yes.
"In agreement, I go away."
"He is determined, I go away."
But?

I go away.
To where you want to go?
"He is determined, I go away."
I go away.
Tell them to target the robot and await my command.
This is Nautilus.

"SOLDIER 1: 67. 71972 degrees west, by 44.50177 degrees north."
Locked and loaded.
"Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry."
- Stop the car.

"My God, honey, you're all right."
Go back!
We've gotta help him!
"Are you crazy, kid?"
You're lucky to be alive!
We're taking you to a hospital.
(SOLDIERS YELLING)
SOLDIER 2:
Everyone!
Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.
What boy?
Hogarth!
"Hogarth, no!"
(BEEPING)
Hey!
No!
Stop!
This is General Rogard.
Ready the attack and prepare to retreat to the fallback position.
No!
No!
"All right, but aren't you the guide?"
Are you ennoyed?
"Not ""ennoyed"", ""annoyed""!"
Annoyed?
"Not yet, but if you carry on, I soon will be."
"Welcome, engineer."
Hello.
- We're honoured.
- The honour's mine.
This is it.
Welcome.
This is one of the rooms.
What did she say?
"If it's too small, there are other rooms."
"Thank you, we'll only be staying a couple of nights."
Make yourself at home.
This is the bathroom.
Another bedroom...
That's good.
Thank you.
- Where's the old lady's house?
- Who?
- The lady who's ill.
- You mean Malek?
"Yes, son."
She lives over there.
You can see it from the roof.
- Which way?
- This way.
- Can we see it from here?
- Yes.
See that blue window?
What?

"Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
Just let me go!
Go ahead... make my day.
"You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over your face."
Ahgghgh!
"Oh, my God, what was that?"

Did you see that?

"Oh, my God, it hurt so bad!"
Agh!
"What the ""h"" is going on?"

"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?
DAVE:
So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Amn, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
"See my hands, and my feet."
You can see it is I.
Myself.
Oh Lord...
Hvo-jm...
It's okay.
My baby.
You know Daddy's a policeman.
I'll take care of everything.
Daddy will.
"They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost."
"He said to them, ""Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?"""

It's still dawn.
What is it?
Somebody died.
Chun Woo-Hee
Who?
"You know Cho, the ginseng grower?"
Yeah.
His wife died.
It's pouring out there...
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."
he's not a total stranger.
Yeah?
"Well, how well do you know this guy?"

He's in grave danger.
Help him.
Tell me where he is.
I want to help him solve his problem.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
INTERVIEWER:
And that way it's cheaper to set on fire
A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
I knew it.
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.
"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.

"I'm Mrs. Roberts, and this is Officer Gardner."
How are you doing?
- This yours?
- No.
"- Well, how about I leave it here just in case it is?"

It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?
They all fit into a cab.
Could a play like that work today?
"Yeah, which takes me back to, ""Maybe we should come back tomorrow."""
No.

Really?
You want to take our love to the next level?
"Well, I..."
"The setting's a little strange, but..."
"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be the first star-crossed lovers to make love in a crypt."
"Oh Larry, I accept."
Oh-ohhhhh!

Maybe it's here.
"No, it's never there."
There's no murder weapon anywhere.

Just a second Ricky.
Jumbo panties!
Excuse me.

What are you doing with my panties?
What should I do?
"S-say you're a panty fiend, sorry."
"Sorry, I'm a panty fiend."
Is he seeing somebody?
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.
"Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?"
Look at me!
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
You don't know.
How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey.
This is Michael.
- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Jenna!
"Michael, call me as soon as you get this message."
I'm gonna kill you.
"Oh, my God!"
What the hell are you doing?
You're calling him?
"- No, that wasn't him."
- To tell him what?
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.
"- Yes, you do."
Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.
"- No, I don't."
- Do you know her?
We are here to see--

We're here--
- Vagina.
"No, we're here to see Raza."
OK.

What's up?
- Kumar and Roldy?
"- What's up, man?"
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.
What are you guys doing here?
"Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?"
"- Hey, no, no, question number one--"
- It's kind of a long story. l-  ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Yeah.
That was my idea.
"I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of all the hype over topless."
Really?
I always liked toplessness.
That's--
- Think about it.
Think about it on your own.
You're Seigaku's pillar of strength.
Stop kidding around.
Echizen's not coming again today?
What did you hear about it?
Don't worry about it?
Looks like he came to school though.
What happened?
Is it a cold?
It is a cold.
"- Ne, ne, ne, did something happen to the chibi?"
- Ah...
What do you mean something happened?
- It wasn't easy coming here.
- Then what do you want me to do?
At least help me a little.
The age of Kanto will continue tonight.
"Ryoma, let's have a game."

"{\pos(192,242)}See you then."
"Mum there's still one more week, right."
I understand.
That is the reason!
That will deepen the hatred between us.
I don't care!
You want us to kill own men!
"Yes, kill them all!"
- And if we won't?
- And if we won't?
"Listen, I want you to fight with your own men."
Only the winning side can survive.
Or all will be killed.
We have no choice!

-We're gonna play.
"We're gonna deal this hand again, play cards or quit."

"AII right, this game's gonna be Spit in the Ocean."

Excuse me.
The little boy's room is occupied right now.
"Oh, excuse me."

- All okay.
- Yes father.
Shall we go?
Bravo!
What?
Scared of all these men?
No normally there's always a bunch of beggars outside the temple.
Minister Pradhan's sent us.
We're here to take you to ACP Pradhan's farm house.
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.
No.
I am scared.
I'm frightened.
Look at this I'm getting goose-bumps.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Boss.
Run!
Jump.
You jump.
Tell me something will anybody be at home?
Daddy the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?
Hello sir.
I could've pulverized your goons back there.
But then I had a brainstorm.
I left those rascals back in those lanes.
And I came visiting your home.
I don't get to do a door slam on me.
I do a door slam on you.
This is my bar!
That means I get the last
- friggin' door slam.
"- Oh, yeah?"
What about this?
!
- What about this?
!
- Ha-ha!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
- Moving out.
"- Oh, yeah."
Aha!
"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
- No.
"- Uh, well, it's tomorrow."
"All right, um, Horace?"
Listen.
It's been a month.
I didn't need Ricky to tell me what we already know.
He's gone.
So-
- So what are you gonna do?
- What are you talking about?
What the fuck-
- What are you--
Why are you saying this to-- What are you saying to me right now?
Why are you saying this?
"- Horace, because, right now is right now."
Pete is gone.
Are you gonna do Easter?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
- Iâm not doing Easter.
Iâm not doing any of that.
None of that makes sense without Pete here.
"- Okay, so, then close this place down."
Go do something else.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
"- Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back."
- He's-
"- Horace, he is not coming back."
Horace.
"Pete is dead, Horace."
Fuck it.
"Hi, honey."
Is that my phone in your pocket?
Or are you just happy to see me?
"Oh, God, that's all kinds of wrong."
"Uh, no."
Mine.
"- Okay, I'm gonna go shower."
- Okay.
Quick.
How do I write her back?
Just text her everything ys.
"Yeah, compliment her face without makeup, and tell her it's the best sex you ever had."
This is my son.
"Oh, they're here."
"All right, uh."
"Look, I'd love to stay... and help you pretend to be your son, but I have to go pretend I'm dying."
Hello.
I'm Victoria Chase.
This is Dr. Lori Hernandez.
I'm Dr. Robert Moore.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ah.
Likewise.
"I'm sorry for staring, but I'm just surprised at how well you look."
"Oh, thank you, but I'm tired."
So very tired.
Please sit.
I know that I need to.
"Hmm, that's very odd."
What?
You're not limping at all.
Limping?
"ABC, NBC, CNN."
Mike.
That Canada story... still interest you?
Everything interests me.
"Uh, I quit, Mike."
Bullshit.

It all worked out.

Where's the tunnel then?
We've passed it.
When?
Someone's been sleeping!
Where is it?
"We've passed it, back near Biston."
We're heading nowhere.
Read the address to see where it is.
How many times do I have to read it?
"After the junction, we take a winding road."
This is the winding road.
We're on it.
"After this road, we head downhill."
Then there's a single tree.
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."

Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.

You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!

It is truth.

You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.

"--Pasha, calm down!"
"--Egoists --Pasha, where to?"
Comrade!
Why do you look at me that way?
--Me?
"--Yeah, you"
I wasn't looking at you
No.
You clearly were.
Familiarize yourself.
A monthly pass!
"Hey, pal!"
May I join you?
She kicked me out
Now she'll start begging me back
"""Come in"" she'll say."
"I'll say ""No"" out of principle"
"I have no home, no corner of my own."
"That's how it is, pal"
--And where's yours?
--Who?
--Fedor!
--And I keep silent
--Fedor --Whaaaaat!
Nothing
See that?
I trained her
And you don't just go back either.
Train her good.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
- The fee.
For companionship.
Right.
This is all I have.
Hopefully that's enough.
We can stop by a cash machine.
"So this is what a day at the office is like, huh?"
Just another typical Tuesday.
Neil... and Grace.
Is it date night tonight?
How adorable you both look.
- I'm impressed.
- That's because it's authentic.
Everything in the spirit of the time period.
"Except tonight, the women are in charge."
Explore.
Make new friends.
Enjoy.
- Drink?
- Absolutely.
Two vodka martinis.
Up.
Olives.
- Have we met?
- No.
You look so familiar.
Yes.
So do you.
- Grace.
"- Oh, Audrey."
"Oh, now I get it."
You cancelled me so that you could do him yourself.
- Okay.
Is there a safe word you can think of?
Something easy to remember in distress?
"How about the word ""stop""?"
"- Good choice. ""Stop"" it is."
- Yeah.
"Okay, we'll leave you to enjoy your evening."
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.
Just make yourself at home.
"Okay, all right."
"Well, take her easy."
Harlech...
Shadow.
Is this real?
"Yeah, it's real."
That's real.
It's really dead.
-  Cooper.
"- Oh, hey."
- Are you hearing me?
- Loud and clear.
Oh!
"Reaching for the Dutch courage already, I see."
- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.
- Lame.
"- Well, we need you with a clear head."
- Okay.
Fair point.
Fair point.
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.
Back to the hotel?
What hotel?
The Intersexion.
I'II go check it out.
well... next!
You go.
"Name, address and occupation."
Duck...
"lionel PIourde,"
"I Iive at 157, 3rd lane in St-Jude."
Occupation...
"I worked on the Van KIee farm, but I had a small accident, so..."
I'm declared an invalid...
that's about it.
"OK, go ahead."
What happened?
What happened?
"well, a Iot happened."
From the top.
"well, at the beginning..."
"Josée Morin, Touchy Tougas and me, we... we met at the hotel around 7:00pm."
"Start with when you arrived, and you saw the black guy."
You saw him with the lady and her gun.
That's it.
That's what?
That's it... we saw them.
You got out of your car?
Yeah.
"Who was there with you, aside from the lady, her son and the suspect?"
There was the one you call Touchy?
Sorry.
"Josée Morin, the dancer..."
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."
- They're the Ching army!
"- And archery, too!"
What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.
"Fung-wu, you and Miss Cheung should escape out the back window."
Yan-ling and I will fight them in the front.
Shoot!
Now!
Run!
"You go first, I'll stop them!"
Miss Cheung!
Run!
Let's go together.
I taught you to fight.
Watch out!
You have come back?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Fantastic!
Still fighting!
[Jessie] What's going on?
- Are you Richard Sammler?
- l am.
We have a warrant.
is there another computer?
"- No, just the kids'."
- Take that too.
- [Jessie] My report!
- Sweetie.
What are you looking for?
"It's in the warrant, read it."
Have your family stand aside.
- Can they do this?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my God."
"- Hey, watch it!"
"Sir, listen, stand aside now."
[man] into the back bedroom.
"Look, Rick, I've just come from the DA's office."
Where you've been spending a lot of time.
Mason Gould is on 3.
- The opportunity to clear your name.
- On TV?
- You didn't know about the bribes?
"- No, absolutely not."
I want the two of us to face this like people who love each other do.
I can't do that right now.
Ripped By mstoll
Go!
Go!
Go!
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
It's real
What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Gordon!
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
I think I'm really hurt here.
"Help me, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, even out here, right?"
"Someone always does, eventually."
"I'm sorry I hit you, man."
"I'm really sorry, man."
"What were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
Can I move my...
No.
Bug out of here.
"Hey, stop."
I need help.
I'm down here.
Get off me.
You look pretty tasty.
Get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
Get away from me.
"Yum. ""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
"Please, don't hurt me."
"You're a real mess, my friend."
"I mean, seriously racked up."
Please.
Save your strength.
That would be my advice.
You'll need it.
Help me.
"You'll be all right, fellow."
Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed.
Can you...
You'll be all right.
I'm one ofyou.
"I grew up here, a stone's throwfrom here, on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda."
"Itwas the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tellyou that."
"The poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you ofthat."
My dad sold it before they found oil on it.
My dad sold it before they found oil on it.
- But itwas all we had.
- But itwas all we had.
- My dad built the farm.
- Huh.
You're new here.
- What's your name?
"- Joaquin, Mr. Hoover."
Oh.
My fathersacrificed everything he had... so that his sons could go to college.
- Agentle Quaker motherquietly wept...
"- oh, Christ."
- When he went to war.
"- Turn this crap off, Clyde."
It's giving me a headache.
"You may go, Joaquin."
"I wantto see him, Clyde."
"Edgar, he works in the kitchen."
"Notthe boy, you idiot."
Nixon.
- [Sound off]
- You hearwhat he said in Oregon... aboutme having too much power?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again.
Who do you want?
Kennedy?
[Laughs]
Never.
"Yes, I know, I know!"
Why you say I know nothing?
"Look, look, look..."
You know the horse?
Uh...
Nitwit or Dragonfly?
Dragonfly!
There isn't a horse called...
you're the nitwit!
"What is ""wit-nit""?"
It doesn't matt...
I could spend the rest of my life having this conversation!
"Please, please try to understand before one of us dies!"
I try.
You're going to forget everything you know about Nitwit.
"No, no, Dragonfly."
Dragonfly!
Yes!
"Sí, sí, sí."
Eventually.
What?
Eventually.
"Uh, at the end."
"No, no, no, forget it now!"
Now?
"Well, pretend you forget!"
Pretend?
"Well, don't say anything to anyone about the horse!"
I know that.
You tell me that this morning!
- Basil...?
- So don't do it again!
"- Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching."
"- Oh, my God."
Really?
"- Yeah, man."
Every time I'm gonna take...
- Why can't you just take it off?
- Just take it off.
- You're ruining the moment.
- What is with you and the moment?
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it.
- Who do you want to punch you first?
- I don't care.
- That was good.
"- Well, you caught me off guard."
That was a big part of it.
- That was the same spot.
"The same, exact spot."
- Yeah.
"Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro."
- Okay.
Okay.
Deandra.
- Just 10 more minutes.
"- No, no."
That's it.
"Dee, that's..."
- I love it.
I need more of it.
It's dangerous.
Enough.
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
I killed them for you.
You did it for yourself.
"Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you.
And you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
JESS:
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
Are you ready?
One condition.
Just this.
Then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Haha haha!
"Check this, yo."
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
Where'd you get it?
Kosovan Kate.
Who's Kosovan Kate.
She works with the Albanians.
Here.
You need to wear these.
Give the old bill an head start.
"So she's setting up her own people, is she?"
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
Do you remember the coat?
- No.
- You do so!
You used to keep it spotless except for your dandruff.
- I didn't have dandruff.
- You did so!
"After you bought it, you stopped trying... to get me to go into the fields with you."
"It was the best contraceptive... ever invented, that coat."
It's in the attic.
How are ya?
"How are ya, Sharon?"
I'm pregnant.
Did I tell yous?
Ha ha ha!
"Yeah, well, I am."
She's bleedin' serious!
"- Well done, Sharon."
"- Thanks, Jackie."
"Yeah, Sharon."
Congrats.
"Thanks, Mary."
"Well done, Sharon, ya thick bitch, ya."
"Jesus, though, Sharon."
I know.
"It's terrible, really."
"- How long you gone, Sharon?"
- Sixteen weeks.
You don't look it.
I do.
I won't argue.
You're the expert.
I'm only messin'.
I never left you.
I could have lived with you.
And him.
Love cannot be wrong.
"But I will leave him, if it means losing you."
I give my life to you.
Tilo!
Tilo!
- Are you OK?
- (Coughs)
Are you OK?
I woke up and you were gone.
I read your note.
I crossed the bridge and just as I got to the other side the quake hit.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yes.
Let's get you out...
Let's get you out of here.
(Coughs)
"Tilo Mistress, you have shown your devotion to the spices."
The spices know you will never leave them.
"Doug, I'm not leaving."
You're staying with me.
I mean here.
I'm not leaving here.
"Tilo, there's nothing left here."
This is my home.
I guess I can help you rebuild it.
You never told me what my spice is.
Sesame.
Tilo.
(Inhales)
"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody
I'd want to see
God looked down from up above
And he picked you out for me to love
He picked you out from all the rest
'Cause he knew that I loved you the very best
I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
God bless the moon and God bless me
And God bless the somebody I'd want to see
Good morning.
Hey.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Guess what.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
Move!
[shouts]
[gunshots]
[groans]
Drop it.
Drop it!
[whispers] Drop the gun.
"Stop, John."
You stop!
Stop!
I will fucking put a bullet in this motherfucking priest.
"It'll be ""bulletville."""
Drop it!
You wanna shoot that scattergun?
Shoot it.
You'll kill us both.
"Fuck it, John."
Just shoot this crazy piece of shit.
His life for mine.

"Look, there's a fine one."
I don't like that one at all...
You silly thing.
Please...
Where are the others?
Where are they all?
- Where are the others?
- There aren't any others.
- What about Henry?
- He's... back there.
"Elisa, someone's looking for you!"
When my pal was dying in the battlefield he asked me to bring you this.
"Elisa, my child..."
Pull yourself together.
"Oh God, what now."
"I've left my message, so goodbye."
Elisa.
Look at me.
Daddy.
Your Grace.
"A great performance, Jean!"
"- Yes, you'll get a medal."
"- Thank you, your Grace..."
A medal?
!
I've got 'dozens of those!
"Goodness, what happened?"
Henry was killed.
I'm so sorry.
That's life for you... that's life...
"Do you love me, Frank?"
Sure.
You know I do.
"Don't worry about anything, okay?"
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
"You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?"
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
"-Oh, yeah."
"Hey, they sound a lot like babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?"
"Yes, they do."
"Well, I expect I ought to get back to work."
"Yeah, well, we all got to sometime, that's for sure."
That's for sure.
Take care now.
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"Frank, get over here!"
"Oh, my God!"
What happened to the light?
I hit him!
I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone.
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.
"- Excuse me, Jesse."
I've got to run.
- Have a great day.
"- Have yourself a ""morning air"" day."
- I will.
Filthy rich.
Let's call a spade a spade and a chicken a chicken.
"Julie, call me the minute that Peter Rickman is out of the OR."
- The very minute.
"- Yes, Dr. James."
Perhaps you can get me an update on Hook's progress.
"Yes, Dr. James."
"Okay, Elmer, there it is."
A three-pound universe.
What do you know?
Go back to sleep.
Elmer.
That nurse down there is no longer dancing to the sound of the Big Brass Band.
"Would you mind squirreling her away in a corner, please?"
Thank you.
What the hell did you just do?
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
I'm just the dog.
Hook.
Yeah.
"Just slow down, Otto."
I'm on my way.
"Mrs. Rickman, I assure you..."
- Are you my husband's doctor?
- That would be Hook.
He was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian what?
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?
- I don't know.
- Have you ever seen him?
Honey?
This reminds me of the time in college when we drove to Fort lauderdale in my Austin HeaIy.
I haven`t thought about that for a Iong time.
Remember what we did in the car?
It`s amazing we didn`t get in an accident.
Want to relive a fond memory?
Are you serious?
No!
Why not?
"Because, that`s why."
The kids are asleep.
Let`s just wait `tiII we get to a motel.
"Okay, we`II wait."
I`II find the best one on the road.
Do you want to put your head in my lap?
That`s not what I was thinking.
The wheel.
"There you go, out of your way."
Comfy?
clark?
My head`s stuck.
Quit kidding around!
It hurts!
It`s stuck.
Cut it out!
"I know what you`re trying to do, and I think it`s sick!"
The wheeI`s stuck!
That was a dirty trick!
The damn wheel is all screwed up.
You`re tired.
You get weird when you get tired.
Let`s just find a motel.

Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.

You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."

"On ""Com all2gethr.""."
"Take a good, I saw the picture marriage is crazy."
And i. .. beautiful
I'm sorry.
That was three years ago.
Naughty girl ...
Naughty.
- Is it for your friends.
- Who cares?
It seems very friendly ...
"Do not worry with it, getting married next month."
"Really, who benefits?"
"So, something about you, Mr darkness ..."
- About me?
- Yes.
You do not need to profile even photos.
What can I say?
Hold them for me.
We waited in rare cases.
"Well, for me, is in order."
Damn.
And say once again.
Hey ... empty.
Let ...
Thank you.
That's all right.
This from the host ...
Hey!
We are ready to go.
It's the box step.
LAUGHTER
And the third one is my own personal favourite - the knee bounce.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
The reason they use these moves is because they work for any show tune at all.
What was that?
"Luck Be A Lady, a bit of Guys And Dolls."
# Luck be a lady tonight
# Luck be a lady tonight
# Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with
# Luck be a lady tonight... # APPLAUSE
A bit of Oklahoma!
Here we go.
A bit of Rodgers and Hammerstein.
"# Oh, what a beautiful morning"
"# Oh, what a beautiful day"
# I got a beautiful feeling
# Everything's going my... #
What's that?
Christmas.
Here we go.
"# Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way"
"# Oh, what fun it is to ride on a one-horse open sleigh... #"
"It's a bit camp, that one."
Have a happy Christmas.
I'm Charlie Baker.
Good night!
Thank you very much!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Charlie Baker!
"Thanks, Charlie."
I just thought maybe we could...
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
JANINE:
Maybe if you just go over there.
"Just trying to you know, re-light the fire."
"Oh, honey."
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.
Look I'm really trying here.
Do you wanna save our marriage?
Of course.
Me too.
"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
Wait a minute.
I'm on 8 through 10.
"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
ALEX:
Minor oversight.
"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
[WORKERS CHUCKLING]
MAN:
"Yeah, he quit."
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
Not really.
"- No, not for me."
ALEX:
Great.
Good.
Great.
Meeting adjourned.
-What 'they say?
Dad where's Wes?
Jacob.
We'll get him back.
[Kids steps]
Wes!
What are you doing here?
-Why you never call me back?
What's that?
-I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
-I don't know.
"Look, I'm gonna race next week."
Alright?
"I'm gonna win for you and dad, whole town's gonna see it."
Okay.
"-I need you to be there, okay?"
You gotta tell Pam.
Wes?
[Ring]
Let me go.
"Hey mom's still at her bridge club, you wanna come in for a cold one."
(Hollis) I gotta get back.
"Everything's gonna work out just fine, man."
What 'you worried about.
Yeah.
Put some clothes on.
You scaring the kids.
You alright with riding this one?
"Well, come on, get in."
[Roaring engines].
"(Speaker) ""If you're just pulling in at the front gate you can tune in at 87.5 on your fm radio""."
Get lost.
Dork.
"Yeah, gain some weight, will ya?"
(laughing)
"Oh, of all the years to be trim and well-hatted."
"That was a fun birthday party, huh, Stewie?"
That kid was Indian and 11 years old.
Where are you finding my friends?

So how was London?
Quiet.
"No bombing since Tuesday, apparently."
I meant the exhibition.
Very successful.
-You think so?
-Babe...
-...
I know so.
-Good.
I love a man who speaks his mind even when it's bullshit.
"Hey, stranger."
"-Hey, you."
-Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
-I tried to wake you.
-Really?
-You didn't move.
-I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
-With the apartments.
-Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah.
I think it's gonna take some time.
"I was sure there was something perfect in here, just ready to rent."
So how was work yesterday?
Strange.
"I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic episode, and he thought I was a Nazi."
How ironic.
-Yeah.
-And upsetting.
"Yeah, he was pretty upset."
-I'm sure.
-This one looks good.
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"
Nicolas!
Nicolas!
"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.
My daughter.
Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!
Where did your grandma take you?
Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
Synchronize.
Take cover.
Squad charge!

# Sing out the numbers loud and strong #
"# Two, three, four!"

"# Five, six, seven, eight. #"

"Oh, Ernie, I ain't never going to let you go again."
"Sure, sure, sure."
I'm going to take you into my business.
"In one year, it'll belong to me, pal."
(laughter)
"Come on, you dogfaces, let's hear it."
# Hi!
hi!
hee!
#
# In the field artillery... #
(buzzer sounding)
Roll call.
"Doberman, Anderson, Dober... (buzzer sounds repeatedly)"
"All right, all right, all right."
"Good morning, sir."
"Take it easy, will you?"
Just plug them in there.
So how come you are here?
I just came here for dinner.
"Anyway, I saw your designs."
Lovely.
They are awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You hid the secret for so long.
"Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before."
But..
I couldn't show it.
"What do you mean, couldn't show it?"
I don't understand.
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?
Few things I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
I will see you then.
- See you.
"Ma'am, hold on."
I will give it.
Take this.
"Sir, here is your lemonade and honey."
And towel.
You didn't bring today's newspaper?
"Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday."
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?
Yes.
"If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper."
Bring 30-40 years' old.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
You aren't needed here.
Dix.
How observant.
Good!
# This is Flora's holiday... #
Yes!
# This is Flora's holiday. #
"Good night, Mr Kirkby."
Night.
I'm meeting my dad.
See you!
"See you, Hewitt."
"We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby."
"Are you all right, Mr Kirkby?"
It's this leg.
Gets bad in the cold.
Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.
I'm always carrying coal and spuds and that for Mam.
"Come on, Tubby!"
Hello!
"Oh, you came."
"Pauline, this is Tubby."
"You remember, I told you."
"Look, we gotta find a weapon."
All right?
There's nothing here.
What are you gonna do with that tiny knife?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
"- No, no."
Wait.
"Stay away, stay away."
We're not gonna hurt you.
"It was Vivian, right?"
Yeah.
Where's that guy that was with you?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
He was...
He was behind me.
Gimme your phone.
You have a phone?
Did you call someone?
"We did, we, got a call out."
Are they coming?
We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
- Bishop Allen.
- Tilt up.
Tilt up.
There they are.
- Those guys were great.
- I say hi and then they say hi.
- This song was stuck in my head after.
"- Yeah, I love this song."
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
- This is one of my favorite...
- Is that her?
- That was the girl in the background.
- It was?
Here's one my favorite Ari Graynor moments.
Here it comes.
What?
Can we get a ride?
"- Oh, that's..."
- That's you.
"Is that ""we""?"
Here it comes.
"Sorry, Tris, the car's full."
- It is full.
- Is she gonna hiccup or something?
Are you mad at me?
What I love about that is the gum that's...
The gum is just about to fall out of your mouth.
You look so messy.
It's like Andy Capp.
"Remember the impossible, like, cigarette dangling?"
That's like you and the gum.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
Good night.
"Don't get too attached, Dale."
"Come on, Jill."
We're gonna go have a sleepover at Dale's tonight.
Drew!
You ok?
She needs a couple glasses of water and some sleep.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
"Come on, babe."
"Ah, that's disgusting."
No.
This is definitely picture worthy.
Is that her puke bucket?
Look at...
Becca's panties.
They're grannie panties.
Bowie.
He's gonna have the worst diarrhea in the morning.
"It's so weird getting older, isn't it?"
Everything just... changes so fast.
"Yeah, but that's supposed to be the exciting part, isn't it?"
Why haven't you ever dated Zach?
Because I never felt like I was...
good enough for him.
"But you like him a lot, right?"
Yeah.
And you think he's handsome.
Yeah.
And he likes that dog of yours.
Yeah.
He loves Bowie.
How?
Knocked him on the head.
And who's speaking?
"Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!"
Meet you?
All right!
"Hey, man with a mustache!"
"Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?"
"I've been watching you for a long time, by the way."
It's hard to recognize you.
Good for you!
Hi.
And what's this round thing?
This round thing.
- You bought a cake?
"- No, it's a hat."
"Right, it's time."
Soon the last ones will fall down.
- Are we waiting for someone?
"- No, nobody."
And the flowers?
For you.
What?
No way!
God forbid!
Take them away!
I'm not some young girl!
What's so bad about it?
It's interesting.
"The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says."
"Come on, Maria Vasilyevna!"
"Look, what's going on?"
Stop!
My son is out there!
"No, wait."
"It's me, Hogarth."
Remember?
It's bad to kill.
Guns kill.
And you don't have to be a gun.
You are what you choose to be.
You choose.
Choose.
GIANT:
Hogarth.
(WHIMPERS)
It's okay.
It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.
"Nautilus to Rogard, missile armed and ready."
"What are you saying, he's friendly?"
Yes.
Attacking him is triggering a defense mechanism.
"Don't listen, General!"
Destroy the monster while we still have the chance!
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"General, you shoot and the whole thing starts all over again."
- Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!
"- Orders, sir?"
"Which is why you have got to stop, General!"
- It's getting closer!
"Orders, sir?"
- Don't shoot!
What is going to be?
"The died hand, no?"
Help!
Help!
Espérame.
Espérame.
I already go.
You excuses.
They stand back.
The dead has escaped!
In the name of the Medicine.
Stop!
Stop!
You run.
"God, what cold does."
You run. you run.
Towards where?
"Delay, hopes."
By there.
"yes, by there."
"According to last theories ""paragenéticas"","
Ia prenatal sexuality...
By where have they gone?
By where have they gone?
"They have gone by there, Doctor, to the bottom, in the washbasins."
-You have seen Him?
-Seen who?
God mine!
What is this?
Sexual violence?
Have you seen a naked man enter?
-Naked?
I'VE WRITTEN DOZENS OF LETTERS.
"I'LL HAVE THE PRESSURE POURING IN,"
"BUT KYNE KEEPS HARPING ON THIS MURDER THING,"

YES.

HE'D NATURALLY WANT THE CRIME-BEAT MAN ON HIS TEAM.
SO WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND GET HIM ON YOURS?

It could be a distraction.
Athena...
Yes.
Three points now.
Your answers?
Athena and Minerva.
Let's see if you're right.
"Athena, well done,"
"Minerva, well done."
"So, Athena the Greek goddess of...?"
Wisdom.
"Wisdom, arts, crafts and later, war."
"I mean, you were there straightaway."
You just couldn't find them.
"OK, Wags, over to you."
Find...
Reveal the hive.
THEY CONFER
ALL:
Erm...
I can't see any at all.
For three points now...
For two...
I don't see any.
No.
Running out of time.
"Wags, you're out of time, you are stumped,"
"I'll throw it to you, Lutrophiles, for a bonus point."
Fishguard and Rosslare.
Show me your first letters.
Rosslare and there's Fishguard.
Let's see if you're right.
"-Uh, substitute coach Roth."
DEAN:
Yes.
Miss Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Miss B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous--
[BLOWING WHISTLE]
-Take a lap.
-But--
[DOOR CLOSES]
Go nuts.

Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Find anything?
"Been over the entire school twice, no sulfur."
"No sulfur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
"-I don't know, maybe I was wrong."
-It happens to the best of us.
"We hit the road, huh?"
"But after lunch, it's, uh, sloppy-joe day."

"Hey, I need to copy your Algebra homework again."
What was that?
Great!
Awesome!
What do we do?
No!
Jason!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Grab the oar!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Yeah.
We gotta go to shore!
"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"
"Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while."
"Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again."
"You get that, right?"
It was an accident.
I'll bet it could have been avoided.
Right?
Am I right?
Baby' I need you to paddle.
"Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!"
You know what?
Sit down.
You've got to sit down in the boat!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
What are you doing?
I don't feel very well.
What the hell is that?
"Ok, I'm gonna call 911."
"Come on, pick up that goddamn phone."
I think I need something to eat.
"Please hang up, and try your call again."
"Please hang up now, this is a recording."
"Please hang up, and tr..."
Krista.
Oh no!
No!
Is he dead?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.
Where will she go now?
I don't know.
- Think.
- I don't know!
They are all dead!
My entire family is... dead.
Not yet.
But the sun is coming up soon.
Let's go.
She's hanging out with a different crowd now.
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
"Van Sciver Incorporated, how can I direct your call, hello?"
Hello?
Krista.
All you have to do is die.
Welcome to the family.
Family?
We will see how she does in the office.
I am sure she is going to do well.
"She is my friend, after all."
- Yeah.
"Anyway, you guys carry on."
I will see you later.
Yeah?
You witch..
'I am writing this diary only because..'
'..my mom wants me to maintain a diary.'
'My first day in office today.'
Gul.
"Hi, mom."
How are you?
I am fine.
You tell me.
I told you to call me up after you reach office.
"I am so sorry, mom."
I was very busy with office work.
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.
Okay.
Tell me.
How is your office?
"Very good, mom."
Even my boss is very friendly.
Gul.
"Okay, mom."
I got to go.
Pia is calling me.
I am very late for office.
Listen.
He would've gone in search of his father.
- What did you say now?
- My foot!
"You watch cartoons on laptop, he would've left your area along with his father."
"This place is my fortress, I'll get him at any cost."
"Enough of searching there, come on boys."
"Come on boys,"
Find him whether he is here.
Search inside.
- Playing cards?
- How much?
- 250
- Calm!
"Drinks, cards, you need any woman?"
May I send one?

"Now, now..."
What kind of book is it?
Sevigne de...
You have to read it the other way!
"Oh, yeah!"
Um...
The Letters od The Marquis de Sevigne!
"It really seems like an old book, Shizuru!"
Yeah.
"Shizuru, did you always read that type of book?"
"Oh yeah, Shizuru!"
"You went to the library with Saho-san, didn't you?"
Eh?
"You're still meeting up with Saho-san, Shizuru?"
!
You are the one that introduced them!
Yeah!
"That's true, but just listening to Saho-san makes me tired!"
It's so hard that I just can't keep up.
"You are too good, Shizuru."

That was then!

Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
"-30,000 enlisted this morning."
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.
-That's Pop talking.
"-You're right, that's Pop talking!"
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.

No.
It can't be.
You were taken by the Daemus.
No father.
Father?
I don't understand.
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
Precisely.
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
Is Mrs Ransom in?
"Yes, but I'm afraid she can't see anyone at the moment."
Then I'll wait.
"Please, couldn't you come back tomorrow?"

Mumsie won't be in the least surprised to see me.

No!

(Dennis) Good evening.
"Well, don't look so surprised."
"You expected me earlier, or did more pressing engagements banish it from your mind?"
"No, no, no..."
Of course I expected you.
- Won't you have a drink?
"- No, thank you."
- Your daughter warned me.

"Ethel, come here."
Excuse me.

I know that!

"Come on, Warrick."

I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.
I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.

I have to deliver a few more things.
-Can I fix you a drink?
"-No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ls it really true that you might go to Portland?"
I received the offer.
"It's a larger school and, naturally, more money."
She's not breathing.
Her neck feels broken.
What the fuck?
"Oh, my God, she's dead!"

She must've crawled under there for warmth.
Are you fucking crazy?
You fucking killed her!
-I didn't kill her.I must have sat on her.
-Jesus.
-My poor baby.
-I'm sorry.

Where you been?
"This was in the mail for you outside, Tony."
"Oh, no, you can't really do that, Billy."
- It'd be weird.
"- No, it won't be."
"- Here, give me your hands."
"- Billy, what are you..."
"Come on, just look at me."
"Come on, T, look at me."
Come on.
Look at me.
Look at me.
"You're not looking at me, T."
"Billy, please don't..."
"Come on, give me those blue circles, girl."
Come on.
That's what I'm talking about.
"I love you, T."
I...
Love... you.
Oh.
"No, it's not like that."
It's not.
It is like that.
"I love you, T."
"You're an amazing partner, but you're an even better friend."
Okay.
"- Oh, no."
- You even took a bullet for me.
"We don't really have to do this right now, okay?"
"I do, T. We all do, you know?"
"Two coffees, one with four pumps of caramel."
"Rosemary, give me your hands."
"Rosemary, you make delicious coffees."
Hey.
I'm looking to score.
"You know, party favors."
"Come on, Coreen."
Do you want angel tears or crow?
Angel tears?
"Come on, come on..."
"angel tears is acid, crow is cocaine."
Come on.
I'm actually looking for something a little different.
"Evan told me about it, but I can't remember the name."
Venom?
That's it.
Venom.
Do you know where I can find any?
Something I said?
I've got a lead.
Over.
Oh!
Wynter.
"Hey, I hear you're looking for some venom."
"Yeah, do you know where I can get some?"
Um-hum...
How about straight from the source.
First time's free.

Can you help us?
Yes.

"- No, I'm the sexton."
Where's the priest?
He's not here.

Can you come inside the police station with us?
And talk to the policeman and explain it to him?
"Yeah, no problem."

Mmm.

"You know, it is good to have a drink and have a good time."
Then do it!
"Well, I guess we just go around, huh?"
"No, we gotta go through."

"Come on, shug?"
Hi.
Hello.
Hot.
Yeah.
"Um, dad's inside."
Mum too.
Ok.
But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
"-Goodbye, Amadeo."
-To you I do not salute to you.
He is amiable...
The cut practiced and the blood has been horrible.
I say to you that it is not possible...
"Boys, you watch."
"Is not the dandy, that of there?"
The dandy?
It seems a closet.
That enormous one?
He comes towards here.
"But, who is?"
We hope that he does not see us.
I already am in charge to flee.
Calm and caradura.
"No, calm and swollen face?"
you do not see as it is?
"Hello, Paulino."
Dr. Sughirini...
Ceggirini...?
-Dr.
Cichhirini?
-Yes.
He is there.
He is.
He is.
With permission.
"When they act thus, it would give a beating them."

-Yes?

My boyfriend surprised me.
Going to countdown to the New Year there.
Counting down at Central World would be the same?
Just as boring.
You want to say that to my boyfriend?
You're leaving now?
"Yeah, boarding soon."
So you want anything?
I don't know.
No.
Just go.

So why don't we go ask him.

I got blood.
STEVE:

Jason Kroll?

Jason?
We know you're hurt.
We can get you help.
But first we need to know that you're not armed.

He's armed.
(gunshot) You think?
(gun clicks empty)
We need the paramedics right now.
"Right now, Catherine, go!"
"Catherine, now!"
"Paramedics, let's go!"
Okay.
Who hired you to kill John Cutler?
Don't you die on me you son of a bitch.
You hear me?
Hey!
Who hired you?
!
You were lucky.
But if you go out.
you'll die like a dog.
Where is she?
She's in a place where you can never find her.
Never.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But be nicer to your customers.
I'm sorry.
Very sorry.
Please forgive us.
What the hell is this?
- You're scary.
"- I just yell, that's all."
- Have a cigarette.

What?
You shouldn't have done that.
You shouldn't treat people like that.
Go and apologize.
I'm serious.
Go apologize.
What's wrong with you?
You don't do that to people!
Even if he's a waiter!
This isn't right.

Why on earth should I?

Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- We're fine.
We were ambushed.
- Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
I can look like a man.
What do you think?
- How is Maria Concetta?
- She escaped.

"Yes, and you're going blind."

"So we don't want to hear about that, is that right?"
I'm not the one who has to worry about that.

So why are you scratching?
True.

I've bought it for you. lt's red.

"C'mon, I bet you enjoy this."
"C'mon, look at her."
Look at me.
Her name's Betty.
"Bet he's got a nice, big weenie."
Look at me...
"Please, look at me..."
"C'mon buddy, look at Betty."
Morons.
What the hell!
You morons.
Why don't you stop fucking around?
Weren't you taught to not bother others?
"Say something, dammit."
"Hey, man!"
Why don't you shut up?
"Don't hit us, we're just pretending!"
Pretend in the damn room!
"Manager, what're you doing?"
Shut the hell up!
I don't care!
I'm gonna quit this damn place!
You listen.
I'm gonna get a job at a nice hotel.
Then I'll pay you back.
And I'll find me a better girl!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Suzuki San?
I'm running away!
Need a bike?
It's heavy.
- More?
- Much more.
This man hasn't had a bath since the last time he fell off the boat.
Change of plans.
Going straight from Uncle Frank's Mayday to wounded Johnnie fixing the propeller.
"Hurry up, Rex."
We need you over here.
"Yes, sir."
Corning.
Quick as I can.
"Right, what can I do for you, sir?"
"Right, be careful."
Careful.
"And watch out for that-- Watch the wires, please."
- I thought you'd be at the office.
- Don't lean against it.
I was.
I read your ending.
You bagged it.
- You were almost there.
- Nowhere near.
I've been useless for weeks.
"I read your other stuff, too."
Oh?
- What did you think?
- Hmm.
Bit inconclusive.
I wasn't really sure where it was going next.
No.
"I wasn't too sure of that, either."
Crumbs.
I thought having you here was gonna teach you something.
-Then you go and do this.
-l didn't do anything.
You know what?
Your father's on his way here.
"So for now, go sit in the waiting room."
"-But, Dr. Pratt--"
-Waiting room.
Bag him.
-Got a second line?
-Vein keeps blowing.
Run first unit of O-neg.
Hold four more units ready to go.
So where's the reception gonna be?
He needs central access.
They haven't decided yet.
I'd go to Baby Joon's.
La Chiquita Roja is more romantic.
"Neela, place a subclavian."
Cordis and sterile sixes.
What was the other place?
MALlK:
The Mandarin Club.
No way.
-That's a bad idea.
-Turn his head to the left.
-Systolic's 84. I like The Mandarin.
-Got a flash.
Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
"Candles, white table cloths, you know."
"No, Baby Joon's."
"I'm telling you, martinis and chili fries."
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
You're looking for typefaces.
"You've got 45 seconds, two passes, remember."
Reveal the hive.
Helvetica.
Helvetica.
Press the letter?
Correct.
Simon.
30 seconds.
Two passes remaining.
20 seconds...
Pass.
"Pass, Helen."
Courier.
Courier?
Correct.
Simon.
"Ten seconds, one pass left."
Five seconds.
"No, you're out of time."
"Simon, you could've passed if you couldn't see it."
I did say.
One pass left.
You were concentrating...
It wouldn't have helped.
It wouldn't have helped!
All right.
"OK, let's see what you got."
"Courier, which is the standard typeface for writing plays."
And is the default setting in Hollywood.
You also found Helvetica.
Do you know where that was developed?
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.
- I got it.
Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.
- And her husband did that to her?
- It happens.
Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.
- Timothy...
"- No, no, I understand."
I didn't before.
But...
I do now.
Thank you.
- I was hoping to see her at the end of the day.
"- Yes, well, you must."
- You will be back in time for this...
"- Yes, of course."
- He was in the rubble for three days?
"- With her body, yes."
Jesus!
- Who was the psychiatrist they sent him to?
- Yes?
- I wanna give you something.
- No.
"Yes, please."
I recently became ordained.
Weird story.
"Um, and I wanna be the one to marry you guys."
- Wait.
What?
!
"- Yeah, what?"
Yeah.
I think this is why I became a minister.
"No, you became a minister to piss off that dude at the restaurant."
"[Laughs] Oh, my Sweet Lord thundering Jesus!"
"Yeah, before you start crying there, Rob, we don't have time for a wedding."
All I have to do is sign a piece of paper.
W-would you have time for a little ceremony?
"God, no."
It would mean the world to my little lady.
Ew!
"Please, we'd be hitched by noon, I swear."
- Okay.
I'd be...
I'd be honored to.
- [Laughing]
"Oh, my lord!"
Oh!
Mwah!
Mwah!
Oh!
"- Yeah, just... uh, no, no."
Doing that interview would have been a really great opportunity for me.
"Last interviews are hard to get, because you never know."
I know this guy.
I like his work.
- I had lunch with him recently.
- You did?
- I did.
- IKE:
You had lunch with him?
- Yes.
"- Lunch, and, whoo!"
(LAUGHS)
"Oh, well."
"Erm... you know, I'm looking forward to reading your work."
"Hey, hey, hey, don't buy a copy."
I got plenty here.
You can have one of mine.
"Anyway, listen..."
"I gotta go to bed, OK?"
Old Ikey has got to get some rest.
Why don't you stay here tonight?
I've got a meeting at the college tomorrow.
You can drive me there.
- Erm...
- Is that good?
- Yeah.
- OK.
- I didn't bring a toothbrush.
"- Good night, everybody."
Good night.
- Night.
- Good night to you.
Yeah.
That's fantastic.
"Well, where to begin?"
"Well, first off, it's not just a bunch of nude farming."
Dad.
- Wow.
- Let's look at Stonehenge.
Obviously not a coincidence.
They didn't have the machinery to move those rocks.
They're huge.
"- Yeah, they're heavy."
- Of course.
"[""IF I NEVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN"" BY MAROON 5 PLAYING ON STEREO]"
- I'm Nathan.
And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.
- Gigi.
Hi.
- Hey.
So how do you guys know Alex?
We don't.
Our friend Mary heard about this from some guy named Conor.
And how do you know Alex?
I hope...
I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.
BRUCE:
Ooh.
NATHAN:
Oh.
"So are you here as, like, a guest, or, like, his date?"
"Oh, I hate that."
When you don't know if you're a date.
"Hiya, Red."
Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
"I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe."
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
"Hiya, sonny boy!"
"Had a long trip today, huh?"
"Oh, sort of confused."
"Well, your old man's confused, too."
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
"Right here, the great Joe Krozac."
"He's been pining for you, sonny boy."
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is.
Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
"Y- you're kidding, ain't you?"
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See?
That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
"You're just kidnappers, aren't you?"
I see what you're heading for.
"No use trying anything with this kid, see?"
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.
Two minutes to target.
Clear the area.
Get back in there!
The Department of Homeland Security..
Get in there!
This is a mandatory evacuation..
Emily.
"No, please, please, baby."
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Tabriz targeted.
Confirm Tabriz.
"Please, baby, you gotta turn around and look at me."
Damn it.
Evacuate this area immediately!
"We need you to move back, people!"
Move back now!
Emily!
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!
My daughter was in there.
Emily Cale.
She's still in there.
Wait!
Emily!
What is with this family?
Wait for me!
Confirm Tehran.
Targeting complete.
Armed for nuclear launch.
You have 15 seconds to initiate.
"Fifteen, 14.."
"Police, stay!"
Told you to stay!
My father may have Alzheimer's now.
He was awesome in South Asia 30 years ago.
You playing me?
I can't find the guy.
I give you 2 days to find him.
Or you are dead.
That's it.
What's wrong with you?
You've never listened.
Go to the toilet.
You too?
What the hell?
What?
"Look, numskull!"
You hit a cop?
How dare you are?
It's a tiger head.
Should have said so.
Forget it.
Let's go...
"Hey, who are you looking for?"
Someone with a scorpion tattoo.
Scorpion Yong?
I know where he is.
Let me go.
Wasn't that an intense toilet experience?
Intense?
Come later and I could have died.
"Well, you're the one who needed the toilet."
I asked you to come along.
SlPOWlCZ:
What's up?
- Guy in a wheelchair.
- He's got a gun on four hostages.
- I know this guy.
Let me talk to him.
- Wait for the negotiating team.
- You sure the guy's going to wait?
SERGEANT:
Get him a vest.
OFFICER:
Got it.
Ernie Dowd!
It's Detective Sipowicz!
"- I'm coming in, Ernie!"
ERNIE:
I got no beef with you.
"We'll be done in here in a while, then everyone can come in."
You got no problem with the bartender.
Why don't you let the bartender out?
"Yeah, go ahead."
- Put this on my tab.
BARTENDER:
Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
"I'm coming in, Ernie."
"You were over there, weren't you?"
"Couple inches the other way, I'd be just like you."
"You gotta cut this out, man."
They got guns out there.
They don't know these three are assholes.
Public loves to watch stars suffer like regular people.
Tito's Burritos para todos.
So any joy?
Ah.
These four windows.
I caught film of the victim on the night they were broken into.
What about Kai Ng or the blondie with her at The Edison?
Here.
The night Vicki DeMille was robbed.
There's Vicki and Chelsea and there's Kai.
I might have something.
February 10th footage.
Fast forward to 12:02:16.
Chelsea Sennett?
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
"Now March 5th, rewind to 04:42:03."
There's Chelsea again.
"All four times, Chelsea was with the burglary victim on the night they were robbed."
"One, that's random, two's coincidence."
Four?
That's a pattern.
"So what do you say, Manto?"
Eight.
Eight?
They're worth 120 retail.
Not anymore.
"Story's all over TMZ, AH, CNN."
You hit the big time.
We should take off for Palm Springs now.
It's just one more.
We need the money.
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leave it.
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
Please.
"Good, together."
Why didn't you shoot?
-And you?
It's much worse for him to live like this.
You'd do him a favour by killing him.
That the bastard's ending like this...
-Excellent.
Couldn't be better.
Can I do anything for you?
"-No, I don't need any help."
I could buy the collected works of Marx and Lenin from you.
They're for my son when he graduates.
He'll never read them.
-You don't know that.
Elinor?
Marianne.
"Marianne, I do believe you're better."
"Yes, I feel better."
(CARRIAGE APPROACHES)
How long have I been in bed?
I don't even know.
"It is ten o'clock, exactly as the Colonel promised."
Mama is here.
Mama?
"Oh, Mama!"
Do not excite yourself... for her sake.
Elinor!
"Oh, my darling, are we in time?"
You're smiling!
"- Oh, Marianne."
- I know.
And your leopard pants.
- Too much fun.
Too much fun.
- And my shorts.
Totally.
- They're so nice.
"- Mom, can we just please go home?"
- You are no fun.
This is why you're the designated driver.
You're the responsible one.
"That's funny, honey."
That's really funny.
- Unlike us.
You are so not responsible.
- I'm responsible sometimes.
Where are you girls gonna go to school?
"Where are you gonna apply to college, huh?"
- CalArts.
Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Great.
- UCSB.
- Yeah.
- You see?
"Both of them, local."
"Oh, my God."
"This one, she wants to apply someplace like the University of Lithuania."
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't even know where I want to apply yet.
- Lithuania.
"- I mean, it's like the East Coast, right?"
All right.
He'll probably call me.
"No, no waiting."
We are in this situation because of your bullshit...
So sort yourself out and take care of the matter tonight.
Was that Vlad?
"I am going to smash your face in, you fucker!"
Why did you say Elena ran away?
Are you mad?
"It wasn't me, I said nothing."
Must be the Shark!
"He's a good guy, he wouldn't have squealed!"
"I swear it's not me, Niko!"
Word of honour.
Tell the girls to get ready.
"Tonight, I want them to work flat-out."
I see them.
Do you see them?
- Yes.
Great.
There are five...
"No, six."
Take their pictures.
Hurry up!
"- Yes, I'm hurrying."
- Is it OK?
Wait...
On the bridge on the right there.
I can't believe it.
It's Ronaldo.
Do you see him?
- Wait.
This isn't good.
This is fabulous.
I love it.
"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially
"""amazing..."""
Where have you been'?
An ice-cold milkshake for you.
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
There's glass.
What happened?
"I told her I wasn't thirsty, and she kept sticking that goddamn straw in my face."
[Sighs] Fuck.
"If you keep running off all these nurses, there's gonna be no one left, dad."
It's a simple job.
You water me and feed me.
I'm a fucking plant.
But that goddamn woman...
She's trying to do the Tijuana waterboard on me!
"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.
[Chuckles]
"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?
Does it really matter?
"- Yeah, that's a good point."
- Thank you.
"Now, let's be a couple of outlaws and get me a fucking drink."
[Chuckling] Okay.
Okay.
[Exhales sharply]
"Yeah, why not?"
[Music playing]
"Paolo took me to a residence,... where the practice was to swap partners."
"-Yes, who is it?"
-Roberto.
Oscar sent me.
"Well, we have arrived."
-Are you coming in?
-One moment.
-Good evening and welcome friends.
-Good evening.
Have you got something for the cloakroom?
Perhaps you don't need your handbag.
Do you know the local?
"No, but others of the same style."
"The ones that pay for drinks, will know."
They'll see.
Let's go.
What would you like?
-What would you like to drink dear?
-Nothing.
"To watch, we must consume something."
-A whisky on the rocks.
-One with Coca-Cola. for me.
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
Here we go.
Have another?
-How much is it?
"-100,000."
-Thanks.
-Thanking you.
Take it.
"Come, we find someplace to sit."
The sign says 'Booneville. '
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?
- That way.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.
He took me for a native.
That's so cool.
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.
- No.
- It's all right.
"Man, I should go find him."
He'll figure it out when he sees the numbers getting smaller.
He still thought I was a native.
That's cool.
I'm your witness.
"- Well, I should go."
- Okay.
I got to go to my mom's graduation.
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.
Go on.
I'll check on the guy.
I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44th.
Why did you come here?
- What?
"- I said, why did you come here?"
You ditched school and everything.
I'll put you up after Cassie.
"Arnie, listen, man, I had a sales call in Bakersfield and it went long, okay?"
"I--and I have to go get the groceries, you understand?"
I have to sit down and have dinner with my wife and kid.
I've gotta plan out this goddamn christening!
"What am I, Dear Abby now?"
1:45.
"You can be a fucking dickhead, you know that, Arnie?"
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Nick.
- [Nick] Hey.
"- Hey, hey, hey."
- How are ya?
- Good.
- How are you?
"- Yeah, good--good to see you."
Good.
This must be Tawny.
- [chuckles] Hi.
- Yes.
"My wife, Olivia."
Hi.
So nice to meet you.
"Last time I was invited to a house this nice, it had a grotto, so."
[laughter]
"Holy guacamole, I-I love marble."
- Yeah.
- [Tawny] Yeah.
"[laughs] Oh, my God, so cute!"
Can we have them for dinner?
'Cause I could just eat them up.
"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."
"-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola."
-We need some more help.
-Johnny?
"Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?"
"-Who's that, honey?"
"-Listen good, Fredo."
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.
Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal.
"-Oh, God."
-Will he come alone?
I don't know.
You've got me in deep enough already.
Everything will be all right.
Pentangeli says he's willing to make a deal.
"All we want to know is if he's on the level, or if he'll bring his boys."
You lied to me.
I don't want you to call me anymore.
-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.
"-Frankie, I've got nobody here."
"-Wait in the car, Cicc'."
-Frankie.
"-That's okay, Cicc'."
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.
Ritchie.
Give us a taste.
"We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie."
-You won't regret it.
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
YOU CAN COME AND VISIT.
YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND PLAY?
YES.
GO.
"PRAMOD, PRAMOD."
"No, you've already had some."
Go away!
"Come on, Pramod."
You have to go to class.
- They want to meet you.
- Me?
What do you mean?
- They want to meet you.
- Why?
I don't know.
They just want to meet you.
The CEO is Danish.
He wants to shake your hand before giving us the money.
Perhaps he doesn't trust us Indians.
"- Let him come, I'll shake his hand."
- They want you to go to Copenhagen.
"I know what he wants, but I'm not going there."
"""This is the cat..."""
"""...that killed the rat."""
It's not possible.
I can't leave the kids.
"""That lay in the house..."""

Pramod has a birthday soon.
"It's not possible, Mrs. Shaw."
"""That worried the cat..."""
"Come on, I'm messing with you."
"It's nothing, really."
I'm ok.
This isn't your fault.
"Actually, it is."
You're a team leader.
You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.
Again.
You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.
"The rest of it, that's not up to us."
That's the job.
"This is nothing, really."
"I mean, the thing with Doyle, that..."
I'm kidding!
I'm...

MARIA'S TIGHTROPE
Maria.
"Come on, sweetie."
"Maria, my child."
Come on and bring your bag.
"Let's get going or we'll be late, sweetie."
- See you later.
- Bye.
"Maria, say bye."
"Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus."
My stomach is killing me.
"Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore."
But I'm not sure about my magic yet.
Why?
"Oh, Carol."
"Oh, God!"
"Hey, Jack."
Amy told me the good news.
"In my culture, when two people start dating, you give them a present."
They're condoms.
"Hm, I really thought these would have wrappers."
You seem to be enjoying this.
Nice to see cocky Jack Gordon uncomfortable for once.
Yeah.
Especially because of that secret you have with Jack.
[laughs]
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, I think you do."
A real challenge... delicious!
Just tell me what happened.
Sex?
Rehab?
Embezzlement?
Sex?
Animal fighting?
Hit and run?
Sex?
Roland's secret son?
"Damn it, woman!"
You're showing no emotion!
How is this possible?
!
I'm British.
"I think the real question should be, Mason, why the obsession with secrets?"
Who betrayed you?
Who said anything about dough?
"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?
One for you.
"- Well, I'll have a little one."
- Good.
Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.
[LAUGHING]
Here.
"Oh, uh, chaser?"
- Always have been.
- Oh...
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I walked in.
What are you doing?
This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!
Do you understand that?
"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
All right.
"I'll tell you what, if you're right,"
I'll help you.
But you better be right.
"Woman Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!

Howdy.
"Oh, hey."
You're home.
Thought you were gonna go pick up those patches for the screen door.
"Well, I was, and then I thought that sounded like a good errand for you."
[Chuckles]
Ooh.
Orange Julius.
[Slurping]
"Ok, honey, I told you before."
"If it's empty by the time you get home, leave the cup in the car."
Don't come in here showboatin' with it.
Sorry.
So did you get me anything?
"Um, as a matter of fact, yes, I did."
Ah!
Oh!
Look at this.
"Hi, shirt."
You get to be draped across my nipples.
Congrats!
"Ok, well, you two get acquainted."
I'm gonna go put this stuff away.
"Hey, dad."
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
Come with me.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Do you dance?
"Oh, but the treatment."
Try this.
"Oh, that's wonderful."
Try it again.
Turn around.
(MUSIC STOPS)
But what about the treatment?
"Oh, I know what great lovers you Frenchmen are."
Kiss me.
"Oh, that's good."
You!
What are you doing with my wife?
"Uh, massaging the scalp."
"Oh, oh, pardon moi."
The jacket.
It's very warm here.
The jacket.
"Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle."
I ought to kill you for this.
(GRUNTING)
If you lay one...
"If you lay un hand on me, you know what I will do?"
What?
I'll bleed.
Au revoir.
"If I ever see your ugly face again, I'll kill you."
I want you to get out of town and stay out.
"(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, all right, but I can't leave from up here."
Is there anything else?
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
Don't let him get in your head.
"Don't let him get in your head, Dave."
I know a place you will like.
Really?
Yes.
You will love it.
What kind of place?
Like a place that has dancing?
There is everything.
Everything?
"Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing!"
You want to go?
"Yes, please, regard me."
Follow me.
"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.
"Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head!"
"Go, go, go!"
Dave!
Dave!
Cut his head!
Big finish.
Star power!

THREE-YEAR-OLD JACKIE JR.
QUICKLY MADE FRIENDS WITH KIDS ON THE BLOCK.
"ON JANUARY 13, 1950, RACHEL GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL, SHARON."
JACKIE STOOD OUTSIDE THE YMCA IN HARLEM
ANNOUNCING THE GOOD NEWS AND PASSING OUT CIGARS.
ARE YOU NERVOUS?
"A LITTLE, MAYBE."
BUT I WON'T BE WHEN WE GET OUT ON THE FIELD.
ANOTHER HOUR AND WE'LL BEGIN.
WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T GO?
NO.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME TO THE GAME.
"IF I'M GONNA FALL ON MY FACE,"
"IT MIGHT AS WELL BE IN FRONT OF YOU, TOO."
"YOU WON'T FALL DOWN, DARLING."

"THE FILM GOT MIXED REVIEWS, THOUGH CRITICS"
DID PRAISE ROBINSON'S UNDERSTATED PERFORMANCE.
"MR. RICKEY, DO YOU WANT A BALLPLAYER"
WHO'S AFRAID TO FIGHT BACK?
"Look, I don't believe you're ill at all."
You just need more strength.
Take mine.
Really.
I have too much of it.
- No.
- Yes.
I want you so.
- No.
- Oh!
Forgive me.
I... fear that we would harm the memory of our beautiful afternoon.
Yes.
"Yes, of course."
All right.
Who's taught you to be afraid?
No wonder you're choking to death.
Someone's got to show you how to breathe.
Come on.
Come on.
You need light and air.
You need to move about.
Why stay inside wrestling with perfection?
Come outside!
Perfection is flowing all around you!
- MALLEFIILLE:
George!
- No!
"Run, Chopin!"
- Excuse me?
- Yes.
I won't kill you here as you deserve.
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
!
I told you dumbasses to shovel the walk!
Crap.
It's Dad.
He's coming for us.
We're so dead!
You get your asses out of there before that thing collapses and traps you in an icy tomb.
Stay strong.
We're untouchable in here.
Untouchable?
I'll show you untouchable!
He's shimmying!
"Oh, no!"
He's entering the snow fort!
I never thought this would happen!
Ah!
I'm stuck!
I can't move my arms!
My arms are stuck!
How are your arms stuck?
It's snow.
It's soft.
I'm wedged in!
My circulation's failing me!
I can feel it!
I'm gonna die in here!
He thinks he's dying.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me right now!
Why are we hiding from this man?
Look at him.
These are my last breaths!
No.
Does anybody?
Probably.
Okay.
Pine Street.
Windward Elementary.
"""Sunset."" Where the hell is ""Sunset""?"
Sandstone paint.
Sand.
"$651,000."
"That's what, 55 years of back pay the government never gave you?"
They owe me.
They stole my star.
They took my pension.
Who are you?
"I wrote a book about Alcatraz, and pretty much everything in it is wrong."
You write about me?
- No.
- Why not?
I was there.
I was important.
The Warden said so himself.
"Gave me the royal treatment, him and his lady head-shrinker."
There were no female doctors on Alcatraz.
Let's go.
Both of you.
Where?
Sunset Beach.
The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song.
He painted the mines to blend in with the sand.
That's where we'll find Hauser.
Or what's left of him.
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."
3rd: the Atom at 1.24.
2nd: the Westfield at 1.23.02.
And first - the amazing Radical at 1.19.08.
"Right, diesel engines."
Three makers didn't do diesel engines.
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
"Now, the last one has now gone."
Jaguar.
No!
It's terrible.
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE
Are you OK?
That's nasty.
It's horrific news.
"They're doing a V6 in the S-type, and a four cylinder in the X-type."
Which has nothing to do with Ford.
"It won't be a Ford engine, it's a Jaguar engine in every way!"
Yep.
"But if you pick at ""Jaguar"", it might say "".. ord"" underneath."
I have worries about this.
"Jaguar is stealthy, sleek..."
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.
Stig.
Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER
That simply won't work.
"It loses something, doesn't it?"
"Relax, okay?"
Scanning.
- Video link confirmed.
- Up.
This next part might hurt.
Maybe quite a lot.
"But it won't last long, I promise."
Almost there.
Welder.
You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument?
Please don't move your hand.
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory's a funny thing.
I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were... we still are... husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you say it.
Henry.
His memories are still catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."
- I'm Robbie.
- The sorcerer of sound.
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.
"- Yes, Mr. Thurston..."
- What?
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.
But I have a taxi driver waiting.
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind if you just gave me change.
- Do you?
"- No, no."
Go ahead.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Can you tell me how to get to Glendower Street?
"Now, I've booked a room and bath with a sea view for three nights."
- Glendower Street?
- Yes.
You haven't finished with me.
Missus...?
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Alice Richards.
"Mrs. Richards, Mr. Thurston."
"Mr. Thurston, Mrs. Richards."
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending to at the moment.
What?
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending...
Don't shout.
I'm not deaf.
"Mr. Thurston was here before you, Mrs. Richards."
But you were serving me!
Make this quick.
"We're all gonna pull you through this, all right?"
Positive attitude - that's everything.
"Hey, pal, he got shot in the leg."
I think he'll be fine.
Let's hope so.
Be careful with him!
[ Larry ] What are you doing?
I'm trying to disconnect this so we can get out of here.

[ Grunting ] Why do they make these things out of metal?
"Uh, I think it's twisted."
"No, it's coming."
It's coming!
"- Oh, I don't know, Russ."
- It's coming!
Shit!
Fuck!

Why the fuck is it snowing now?
Fuck!

"Oh, of course."

Right.
"Um, well, Paris, right?"
J'adore Paris.
"I've never been, but it looks amazing."
- No.
"- No, that's not gonna happen."
"- Oh, of course."
- Do you have another...
"Well, I love Australia."
Down under.
And the president needs you to vote no on tonight's bill.
Are you guys... are you...
Are you serious?
"Okay, the president, she wants me to vote against her bill?"
- Am I being stupid here?
- Yes.
Yes.
No.
"I mean, you're..."
"No, you're not being..."
"It's, yes, you need to vote no."
"Okay, I can..."
love it.
"Don't get it, but it's all right."
I just want to help.
"But, yeah, just let me know where I'm going."
- You need to know now?
"- Yeah, that would be great."
"What'd you say, ma'am?"
Mm-hmm.
How could I?
With all the stuff I was bringing.
"Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten?"
"I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please."
- What?
- Stasik and I are separated.
- Divorced?
"- Not yet, but it's going to happen."
"- Oh, Nina!"
"- Mama, I beg you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Mama, please."
"I'm begging you, mama."
I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing.
"How can you, you got a daughter!"
"I've just informed you, that's all."
I wish I'd never come here!
I'm going away from here.
Nina!
Nina!
"- What is it, mom?"
- They're there with those snags!
"And look, up there!"
Your man!
A real hero!
"Oh, mama!"
It's for me.
- Why for you?
- I swear.
Listening.
Playing again?
No brains mean a cripple.
Something's very wrong here.
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.
I'm from DC.
Look.
"It's a wallet, okay?"
Wallet?
I'm from DC.
My name is John Klein.
Washington Post?
Yes.
Yes.
Can I get out of this shower now?
"You can wait for me outside, Mr. Klein."
We'll run a check on him.
"Anyone else comes by, forget the gun."
Just call me.
Just find out what he wants.
"So, you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?"
No.
But I heard the knocking.
Three nights in a row.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
"I'm gonna give you a ride into town, unless you wanna sleep in your car."
I can call for a tow in the morning.
You're a long way from DC.
What are you doing here?
Driving through.
"We're not on the way to anyplace, Mr. Klein."
I recognize you.

lifestyle.
-I'II get you another dog.
-I don't want another dog!
-Four in the side.
-One up the ass.
So nobody's heard from ralph?
I'm starting to worry.
-I'II call him again.
-Try the gay man's choir.
I read they were having tryouts today.
"Three ball, far corner."
Son of a bitch.
Where you been?
"This was in the mail for you outside, Tony."
UPS.
-What's going on?
-He's calling ralph.
Leave a message and leave your phone number.
"Oh, guys, check this shit out."
I woke up holding a winning ticket.
"Daddy's revenge, 20 grand!"
Oh!
- God damn it!
- Oh.
I knew you'd outlive me.
"I'm invincible, sweetheart."
"All right, let's see who won the pool."
When did you wake up?
"Uh, let's call it 11:20."
That's my square!
250 bucks!
"I love you, Frank."
"I love you too, dollface."
Five minutes off.
You bet on my dad's death?
You didn't?
"Ah, baby, you won the over/unders."
100 bucks.
Everybody's a winner.
"Stink hand, watch the door."
Daddy needs a cigar.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank."
"No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad, come on."
I think...
Why don't you just order Italian beef while you're at it?
"- Jesus, Frank."
"- That's a good idea, honey."
W...
"Jesus Christ, I can't get that goddamn song out of my head."
I didn't get your invitation card.
Damn it.
"If I'd a gun,"
I'd have blown his head off.
"Pity, you've been suspended."
I'll get a gun tomorrow.
Is that easy to buy one in HK?
"A toy gun would do, baby."
This is it.
Chinese Tea.
You can go home when we are done.
Sure.
Take care of Lisa.
I know you'll take good care of her.
Scorpion Yong.
"You want trouble, I'll give you trouble."
Revenge?
Lucky I heard about it...
Fight me!
Try fighting with my gun!
Fight now?
"Michael, wait."
Be careful...
Did you kill my brother Lin Long?
Lin Long?
I killed many in my fights.
But we'd signed fight contracts.
Which clan are you from?
We are the police!
"Whatever, please put down your gun."
I'm afraid of guns.
I beg you.
EZRA:
"Hey, Nathan."
Get back here.
You can't have Nathan.
He's one of my investors.
"Funny, he didn't mention that when he signed on."
"Now, can we discuss this another time?"
I have a rendezvous.
"Afternoon, Maude."
A woman like this renews a man's faith.
In what?
"Hi, Buck."
Lucy?
What are you doing in here?
You're gonna have to leave.
Not what you said last time we were in here.
"Hell, that was a long time ago."
"Oh, Buck. I've seen all that."
"You certainly don't have to be modest in front of me, of all people."
I think I do now.
"-Lucy, we gotta talk."
LUCY:
Don't I know it.
There are a thousand things to discuss.
The honeymoon.
Where we'll live.
-Lucy--
-And baby names.
"I like Randolph for a boy, and Eudora for a girl."
-What do you think?
-What I think...
... isthatyoucan 'tsee orhear anymore.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Evenin', Lyle."
I knew the German girl worked at the lodge.
That's why I called Greg.
"I didn't want to bother you, sir."
You-
"- You told him that, didn't you, Greg?"
Yeah.
"Uh, Dad wanted to come."
I insisted.
Hilla was one of my best employees.
Melvin.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Uh, she's back here."
Oh.
You were close?
Uh--
Yeah.
We were friends.
"I-- Ah, he's a good-looking kid."
Lots of girls at the lodge have their eye on him.
"Suck it up, Greg."
[ Chuckles ] Kid's got his mother's stomach.
Seems like there was more to it than that.
Her name's Hilla.
Hilla Danner.
I hired her as a desk clerk at the beginning of the season.
"She, uh, have any family?"
I believe they were all killed during the war.
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to bury her in potter's field."
I'll pay for it.
"Well, that's real nice of you, sir."
Linda's coming in.
"Uh, okay."
"Well, you do that."
I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine.
That guy must really know what he's doing.
"Why, because he's slurping?"
Mm...
Ugh!
"Oh, my."
Excuse me!
Hey!
Hi!
Are you some kind of an expert?
I just overheard you doing that sound...
Oh.
I'm a wine enthusiast.
Although I'm not enthused by this first flight.
Oh!
He's hysterical.
You should come taste with us.
Oh!
You can give us tips on how to get tipsy.
Sure.
"Lin, no."
I don't want to drink with that guy.
Why?
"I do, Bobby."
He's an expert.
"Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off."
"I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest."
I just don't want to drink with the guy...
Hi...
No!
- Teddy...
"- Oh, damn."
Damn.
Oh.
- What?
"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
Who's going to help me?
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.
They're not the enemy.
And are still talking.
"We're still here for you, brother."
-Go ahead.
-All right.
It starts with a loss ...
"No, no, no."
Sorry for the moment passed.
"I forgot what I was going to say, maybe tomorrow."
"No, I'm sorry!"
"Is not flowing, the show is over!"
"-Please, sir."
What?
Their story is about flight?
-Where are you?
-From the land of the emperors.
And what's your name?
Erik.
In Insvelândia had many brave warriors
Erik called.
-Seriously.
"Yes, of course."
Everyone!
"Your attention, please."
"I dedicate my comforting much celebrated saga to my brave friend, Erik."
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
It begins with a story ...
From my home!
Hecomesfromanextinct Penguin Race  yourworldveryquickly came to an end
The power of flight was what saved me
"Bye,Sven"
Are you a cop?
Talk to this man!
She's like your sister...
Your sister maybe!
"To me, she looks like a ravishing film-star!"
Don't touch me.
Or else...
I haven't yet.
But here goes!
I'll show you now...!
Let me see what you have.
Let go of my hand!
Let go of her hand first.
"Go away, Janki."
"Come along, aunty!"
Take the doctor and leave!
"Take Mom away, Bharti!"
"Let's go, Mom!"
Please!
I'm about to lose my temper!
Let go of my hand!
No one dares touch me here!
Bloody rat!
You can touch women!
"But women can't touch you, eh?"
I want to ask your Mom what she ate before delivering you!
Shera!
Ashok!
Kaliya!
I spare you because you're a woman.
Or else...
Don't just stand here!
"Well, what do they say?"
That I should die.
"That I'm worthless, that I'm evil, stupid."
- I'm so sorry.
- That I'm...
"No, it's, um..."
"Yeah, it's terrifying."
Do they ever say good things?
"You know, like:"
"""Your hair smells like cupcakes."""
Or:
"""I don't wanna leave you."""
"No, they never say that."
"Well, then your voices are idiots."
- What is it?
- It's a labyrinth.
"You think of a question,"
- okay?
- A question.
Mm-hm.
Something in your life that needs an answer and then you just walk the path.
And maybe you'll get an answer.
Okay.
A question.
Lucy.
- He hates you.
- This is when you die.
I can't.
I can't do this.
You're disgusting.
- I can't.
- You're disgusting.
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
- Yang flame.
"- Yang flame, too?"
"Wong Fei-hung, are you trying to kill me?"
Put the fire out!
Don't kill me!
It really works!
That's enough!
Feeling better?
You're good!
Good!
Bastard!
How dare you hit me!
How many hands did you fight with?
You're incredible!
I'm completely won over!
See you soon!
I hate the cut of this jacket!
You can have it.
- Hey!
"Hey, don't go!"
- Let him go.
He didn't make a donation.
- Forget it.
Get ready for the lion dance.
"- Yes, Sifu."
SOUTHERN RIVER ASSOCIATION
Keep this.
Firecrackers.
"Fellow villagers, welcome to the opening of the Southern River Association."
"We're honored to have the lion-dance master from Po Chi Lam,"
"Sifu Wong Fei-hung, and his disciple Leung Foon."
"Maybe I can help, you know."
You just need to communicate.
See this book?
It talks about all the different stages of forgiveness.
"- You know, they say that""s very important."
"- Thank you, sweetie."
"Daddy""s home."
How do I look?
You look great.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
I got some strawberries.
Do you want me to say things?
Dirty things?
Is that what you want?
How does she touch you?
Does she touch you like this?
"Does she let you, you know..."
- Would you like me to try that?
"- Don""t talk, Clara."
"I will try it for you, David."
It might excite me.
"You excite me, David."
See how we fit?
"I can hold you all night, David."
"- I hate it, Clara."
- I love it.
"- Oh, my gosh, y""all!"
"Lt""s beautiful."
- Wait.
"Hold that up higher, honey."
You have to come back to me!
"Do you hear me, Josie?"
Josie!
Josie?
!
Don't!
Don't!
Please don't lock me in here!
Don't!
Please!
No!
I just want to go home!
Please!
Lies.
Lies.
Lies!
I said her name.
I forgot.
It's all right.
"Garcia, were you able to trace it?"
No.
I was so close.
But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I just sent that to your phones.
"What's this area like, Sergeant?"
Mostly blue-collar residential.
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
We're on it.
There.
"If nothing else, kill me, please."
Make this end.
- You're gonna be...
"You're gonna be okay, Mary."
You're gonna be okay.
"- ""The gardens at midnight... beneath the gnome."""
- Isabel.
- Ah!
"Foul demon, leave me be!"
- What's wrong with you?
- He knows everything.
You will tell him and he'll hurt me!
- Isabel.
Isabel.
"Please, you can trust me."
- You keep calling me Isabel.
I am Mary.
But I remember you.
Margaret!
"- Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?"
What did they do to you?
- I dreamt I killed you.
- I'm still here.
- Did I hurt you?
Margaret!
No!
How can it be?
Why would you help me if I did this to you?
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.
We can't stay here.
You have to tell me everything.
"Yes, Cedric."
- Ethel will find you a taxi.
- Taxi?
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Before I dropped off, didn't you have a moustache, Sergeant?"
"Yes, Cedric."
"That dropped off, too."
Away with you.
"Well, good luck to your endeavours."
Thank you.
We'll need it.
"Oh, dear."
Oh...
"- Now, where were we?"
- My plan.
I'll polish him off but I'll need an alibi from you.
Hey!
I asked you to sit down.
Get that thing out of my face.
I've been abducted by aliens.
You think I care about your little toy trumpet?
( group gasps )
RAY:
"You sit down, hero, or I will shoot your bride-to-be."
DR PENZLER:
"Ray, I'm sure if we talk about this, we can work it out."
"Ray, listen to Dr Penzler."
It's gonna be all right.
DR PENZLER:
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
"Please, give it to her, Ray."
Thanks.
Is that it?
We shouldn't be doing this as partners.
- We should be taken out and shot.
- We should shoot each other.
- Too much paperwork.
"- I'm serious, Tommy."
"Well, maybe you're in the wrong job."
Tommy?

THIRD VICTIM IN 3 RIVERS MURDER CASE

I used to call her Connie.

- I took her to the prom.
Amazing coincidence...
me knowing all these girls.
You knew about the nurse.
Now you know about Cheryl.
And now Connie.
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who?
Who can I trust?
I don't know how high up this goes.
- What do you mean?
- Say I told the wrong person.
- You didn't do this.
- Why?
ls it an obvious frame?
"Nice kicks, by the way."
Where did you get them?
Some place on Melrose.
I'm waiting for these limited-edition Japanese imports.
They've got blue and orange on the side and this red mesh on the soles.
- I had my publicist put me on the list.
- They sound great.
"I could ask her to put you on it too, if you want."
If you don't mind matching.
- No.
Sure.
- Right on.
"I'll need your info, though."
I'm so sorry.
"You're Dr. Phillip, right?"
From Tempest Bay?
- That's me.
"- I know it's completely hicksville,"
- but would you sign my gym bag?
- Sure.
No problem.
Thanks.
"Oh, my God."
My mom's gonna flip out.
Bye.

I expected no less of a millionaire!
Goku has good friends!
Is it true that we have a plane and a castle as bingo prizes?
You are right!
But the special award is much more amazing!
Krillin!
We are three with Maron!
which is the second prize!
Huh?
Want the second prize?
Is there anything wrong with that?
I did not mean that ...
Goku is not here at this moment in time!
Why was he training ?
!
Are you going to let him see bingo prizes?
Goten!
This way!
Sorry!
Darn you!
What the?
let's open!
Yes!
Are these all bingo prizes?
it is too early to be surprised!
What is this?
Okay.
"Over here, right over here."
And do you know who I am?
Who are you?
Must have cleared 30 patients and no one's brawling yet.
See?
"It's not that hard, is it?"
Like the man said:
"""Can't we just all get along?"""
"Sam, weren't we sending the cracked Broviac up to lR?"
-Don't you want a CBC first?
"-Yes, you're right."
"-Sam, the labs done on Mrs. Garvey?"

"Dr. Weaver, the search committee meeting has been moved up to 12:30."
"All right, Jerry."

There's something not right about Glenda.
"Hey, that sounds like a movie, like, Something Not Right About Glenda."
"-A body snatchers thing, shaky camera."
Morris.
I wanna re-scan her.
Really?
Why?
Because she's altered.
"-But she's a drunk, how can you tell?"
-Dr.
"Clemente, why don't you--?"
"Lindsay, no kid talk."
We get enough of that when the nannies take a break.
- Let's talk about the book.
"- Well, I loved it."
You know what else I love?
Hummus.
Couldn't stop thinking about it when they described the Middle Eastern-y part.
Oh.
Hummus.
Fun idea.
Belinda.
"Christine, where's Belinda?"
"Uh, I guess she stepped away."
Ugh.
I am gonna have to let that girl go.
"Oh, but I'm sure she's coming right back."
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- We need hummus.
- And sangria.
"- Ooh, that sounds good."
"Oh, that does sound good."
And roasted red peppers.
"Oh, me make it."
Right.
"Belinda, are you in there?"
I need you.
"Christine, for God's sake, I asked for that sangria a week ago."
- Where's Belinda?
"- Oh, she's not feeling well."
She's lying down.
Probably.
By now.

Any police contact?
Hey.
Any police contact?
"Nah, nah."

Stay away from the bullshit.
You're doing all right.
I'll see you next week.
All right.
(Women giggling)
(Angela) Enrique?
"Yeah, in the bathroom, ma."
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Isn't tonight Michael's school thing?
"Yeah, but I didn't think you were going."
Now you got a hot date.
It's not that big a deal.
Ah.
I think our table is ready.
"We should just sit right down, I think."
"Yes, thank you."
To the buzzer.
A Sports Illustrated moment.
I actually think I got hit by Kobe's sweat when he took the shot.
Nice.
You still down for hanging out?
Sure.
"Uh, do you..."
you know a bar around here?
Let's skip the bar.
Too many drunken fans.
Fine by me.
What did you want to do?
Let's get out of here.
Take a drive up Mulholland.
- Mulholland?
- My girlfriend's out of town.
- I don't have a curfew.
Hop in.
"Lt'll be fun, I promise."
That is a beautiful watch.
I have three sons and a brother.
Always looking for good gift ideas.
- Where did you buy it?
- Fred Segal's.
- Oh.

An homage to 1940s noir.

We'll meet you downstairs.
"All right, there we go."
You okay?
I'm getting lots of experience at this.
"First, Detective Medavoy, now him."
SlPOWlCZ:
You holding up okay?
ERNIE:
Yeah.
"- Jack, just set the chair there."
JACK:
All right.
SlPOWlCZ:
Thanks.
- No problem.
SlPOWlCZ:
All right.
"James, you want to give me a second here?"
"Sure, let me get the paperwork."
You okay?
Yeah.
"You got my card, you know, if you feel like talking."
You feel like talking?
"I can't remember most of it, being over there."
I don't want to remember it either.
SlPOWlCZ:
Good luck.
James.
"Counselor, can I have a word with you in private?"
I want us to be square about that fish.
"Andy, I don't think we're going to make it."
Come quickly.
Would you like soup kitchen?
It's not him.
It's alright though.
"He don't like strangers, see."
Don't like a lotta things.
But you took his boat without asking.
Weren't you scared?
One of the soldier's had this kit bag and suddenly it woofed!
It gave us such a fright.
It was a dog.
And one of them Frenches tried to kiss her.
I'm scared now of what your dad might do.
No!
He got himself a bottle.
He thought we'll be back before he woke up.
"Besides, Eric was in Dunkirk."
Eric?
Dad's first-mate.
Got us photographs for our birthday.
Yeah.
He got same birthday.
"Robert Donat in ""The 39 Steps""... and John Clements in ""The Four Feathers""."
Have you ever met John Clements?
No.
I haven't.
Those ones are mum's.
We don't know who he is.
Oh!
I did meet him.
Is there going to be a film?
Probably not.
Out of my sight!
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Are you done?
Against the wall!
I've to search you!
Don't go too far!
Why?
I suspect you're an illegal immigrant!
You're Lisa's boyfriend?
"I meant ex-boyfriend, Michael?"
Michael!
You've suspended?
Why are you here?
Let go!
Do I need to escort you out personally?
"How are you, David?"
"Mr. Lin, welcome back."
"Just give me the keys, I'll follow."
Thanks.
"Anything else you need, Mr. Lin?"
You're great.
No wonder my brother praised you.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
"Lisa, is there a Lo Keung amongst my brother's friends?"
"No, why do you ask?"
Just wondering.
You suspect a friend killed him?
It doesn't seem like a robbery.
I'm not convinced.
My brother values his life.
"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.
- What's going on here?
Mr. Heller.
"Gary, you... know this one?"
Ms. Keyes works for me.
Really?
Give your HR person a bonus.
"All right, all right."
What are you doing here?
I live right around the corner.
"Yes, much is found!"
"Give it to Brother Lone, it's very important!"
Greet Brother Lone.
Brother Lone.
I heard steps.
And it's far away...
"It's late, Brother Lone, let's call it a day."
Wait for me.
Super swords and capital chopper.
I can tell it's a trap.
The prosecutor is cocky!
Who the hell is he?
A very sharp-tongued lawyer.
"What a co-incidence, he is Ho Chun's boss, named Ho Chung."
Who is his boss then?
"His dad, Ho Sai."
Ho Sai?
"He is a rich merchant, and is the council member."
He owns many properties in Western District.
Sai?
"Yes, Sai."
"Hearing this word ""Sai"", I..."
Did it ring your bell?
"Right, because I remember Foon has..."
What?
"A piece ofjade which the word ""Sai"" is carved."
"Maybe, there is another story."
"This may be related to the poor orphan, Ho Foon."
Wu Man.
Hubby.
Do you know anything about Ho Sai?
"He is a Catholic, a righteous man."
I'm sure Dad would have been here if he could.
[SNIFFS]
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"-What happened, anyway?"
"-She banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?

Good.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.

No.

Can you hide me?

"Come on, she's out."
Karate-chop me or something!
That is not...
Okay.
All right.
Let's just do one simple move.
Okay.
"Now, this won't wrinkle my top, will it?"
Ohh!
Wow.
That was actually fun!
Show me one more time.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you again.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Back up.
Again?
"Oh, yeah, when we almost got killed,"
I thought I lost my phone.
It was really scary.
"Mentos-pramp-climb, test number two."
"Lesson learned... when pressure builds to dangerous levels, it must be released."
Is your lip getting better or your face getting redder?
Just gonna pop into the family room.
What the hell was that?
!
"Oh, I'm just getting started!"
Ohh!
Why do you have to be such a silly...
"Haley, stop!"
Mom!
"Phil, honey."
"- Yes, fine, thanks."
Hello.
"Oh, hello!"
Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard?
It was.
But I made an effort...
"Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right?"
No.
Sometimes people blow it.
I saw you had a car.
Are you going back to Bordeaux?
Yes!
"Oh, yes!"
I'm leaving...
Oh dear!
In 5 minutes.
Could you handle a stowaway?
"I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad."
The rebel of the family.
"At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia."
He's in Vietnam now.
I tried to stop him.
Well... in my own way.
"Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well."
His taste for adventure doesn't come from me.
- Is Vietnam nice?
- I've never been there.
Even to see him.
I'm a disgrace.
"Stupid, isn't it?"
Am I boring you?
Yes.
"Carried away all my stuff,"
For the bride didn't care!
What's up?
Did you wind it up?
No.
Guys from our fish factory gave it to me.
"As a joke, they wrote on it:"
Don't oversleep the fishing season.
"It works alright, but rings whenever it likes."
Excuse me.
Are we almost there?
"- Maria, may I call you?"
- All right.
- Shall I give you a lift?
I got a car.
- No.
Come on!
Come on!
"Fast train number 71 ""Bogachyovo — Suvorsk"""
is arriving at track one.
The train stops for 5 minutes.
Cars numbered from the tail.
"- Oh, daughter!"
- Mama dear!
"Oh, my God!"
"Careful, mama!"
Hi!
Welcome!
- When are the exercises?
- Tomorrow.
I was traveling in style!
Do you wear glasses now?
You all right?
What do you mean?
You look a bit...
I'm fine.
"Loudest club in the west, mate."
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
"Hey, Tony..."
"Hey, Cass."
Are we going somewhere?
"Oh, yes..."
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm sad about them.
Aren't you?
I'm fine and dandy.
Good.
We're just fine and dandy...
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.
"I think that since Sid and Michelle are together, we should do the same."
"What, go out?"
Yeah!
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?
Yeah!
"And we'd talk and eat dim sum,"
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...
But I'd knock my head on the door frame and fall down.
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Hmm.
Who's next in our little contest?
Oh.
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff.
"Yeah, whatever."
Whoop.
"Pshh, pshh, pshh."
You had your chance.
"Now, then..."
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
"Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come."
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy."
I've got three little ogres at home.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!

Okay.

[Man] You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. Government project... administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
Making sure we haven't blabbed to them.
"Well, I'm the guy that's gonna make sure that you don't."
Mmm.
Concealed weapon.
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.
"Let's go, guys."
You shoot Julio ?
I didn't cap nobody.
That's all right.
We'll get the bullet from autopsy.
"Well, when you do, get back to me."
Are we done ?
"Not quite, Luis."
What's that ?
That is your confession for another murder.
What murder ?
Bob Keaton.
Muzzle stamp's identical.
"Bob's chest, your gun."
800 or deal is off.
Then it's off.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Five.
I'll give you five.
Now you negotiate ?
"Luis, show him my counteroffer."
- I'm out of here.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
You killed him.
Julio's the boss.
"Maybe you took care of that, too."
"No, I swear."
I didn't.
And I was the one who saw him first.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.
- Don't be angry with me.
"- I'm not angry with you, Ursula."
I'm just gonna get the washing.
"No, no, I'll do it."
I'll do it!
"Oh, Ursula."
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
"Not cheap, is it?"
[Man]:
It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.
It's just as well.
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
I want some pilchards.
[Man]:
No more left.
"What do you mean, haven't got any left?"
I did have half an hour ago.
"What have you done with it, then?"
All right.
Phyllis has got 'em up at the shed.
She'd better have.
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?
Stargazey pie.
What's the matter with coley fish?
Hello?
"Crowe, wait up!"
There's no one there.
Crowe?
Hey.
Do you hear me or wh...
"Think of him in terms of Leslie... someone she might've known, someone who liked her a lot."
You got something?
I got an I.D. From an orderly.
The guy's name is Neal Booker.
- Neal Booker?
- Yes.
You know him?
The orderly.
He's so quiet... like he's not even there.
- He working now?
- I don't know.
I think this could be Neal... if he were really angry and scared.
"Ridge, get down to personnel."
Find out where this guy is.
"Your eyes are different, Leslie."
They gave them to her.
They're not the right color.
They... they took the corneas.
Just the clear window on top.
The windows of the soul.
I've been looking for you.
In all of them.
I... saw them... carry pieces of you away.
I'm here.
Put it on.
You have 30 seconds.
- Who is slave?
"I am a soldier, too, please."
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
"Proud ox, where is your army?"
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him.
Now.
He's next.
- I'm waiting.
Will you speak?
- I don't know.
"Hold on, Mac, old boy!"
Stop.
Look.
"See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?"
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in.
He'll talk from there.
"- No, I can't stand it!"
- Will you speak?
All right.
"If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you."
Take me outside.
"- Be a man, Mac."
"- I can't go it, mates!"
"Come back, Mac, old boy!"
"- Well, Sergeant?"
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
What are you doing?
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
"If you do this well, there are more jobs coming."
"Doc, don't worry."
I won't break my promise.
Hey...
You can't charge your laptop here.
"Sir,"
I really need to download some work.
Just a little while?
Yes.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
I'm taking it doc.
Shit!
Damn it!
Only half an hour left.
Are you done?
Here.
Thank you.
Just half for now.
Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest.
You haven't finished it yet?
This is a big project.
"Je, what are you doing?"
I'm calling Jerd.
Why are you calling him?
Tomorrow you will get it.
Yoon.
"Je, don't call."
Send it now or we're screwed.
"Je, stop dialing."
You have another 50% to finish.
It's not...
Doesn't matter.
"Oh, he's already left for work."
I hear him go 7:40 on the dot every morning.
Oh.
Does he live on his own?
Joe?
You bet he does.
Nobody'd put up with the grumpy old bastard.
"I'm Kieron, by the way."
We keep missing each other.
"Oh, Michael."
"Oh, let me get it."
"Oh, thanks."

I said I wasn't ruling it out.
"Got me thinking, though."

He wasn't even here.
He was out looking for you to help.
- Thank you for my life.
-As in left or died?
-Died.
"- Well, I'm very sorry."
- We were hunted down one by one.
All that they died for is this.
It's a Purean.
It contains a collective data of human progression as well as Draconian war plans.
Information that could be very helpful in our cause in overcoming them.
- And how are you gonna get that to your people?

I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Sure she would.
But who has money for a rug?
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.
"Yeah, sure."
My wife would like it.

What was so bad?
I was in this room.
And it was red.
DAVID:
All right.
"- And there was no doors, no windows."
- Mm-hmm.
"And these curtains, they were on fire."
And I was in this corner.
Right.
"(STAMMERING) And I was looking out, and there was someone else there."
She was staring at me through the flames.
Then I woke up and...
"Well, hey, well, don't worry, all right?"
It was just a bad dream.
"Previously on ""Once Upon A Time""... (Grunts) Killing me's gonna take a lot more than that, dearie."

- There's an enchanted compass.
"Take a look, Aunt Rosa."
"On the bench, next to Mom's purse..."
- Yes?
- There's a man's bag and hat.
So what?
Lots of men in Marseille wear hats.
Marseille?
When were we in Marseille?
"What do you mean, Marseille?"
"I told you, this is Paris."
You just said Marseille.
"I made a mistake, so what?"
I'm not feeling well.
- Just tell us who took the picture.
- I did!
"Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa."
When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery.
You couldn't have taken it.
What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
- Oh...
But that wasn't then.
"I'm telling you, I took the picture."
Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-.
I'll show you.
- What?
- Your whole hat theory...
I feel like an idiot.
Why does she call me Doborobon?
It's been half an hour.
She fell asleep.
"Check her, maybe she's dead."
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.
Thetearswon'tcomeout.
Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.

You are so cute when you pout.
There's no other woman.
At my age.
At your age.
You keep fit enough.
You're sweet.
I know you're not cheating on me.
I'd notice it in seconds.
You would?
How?
Everything.
I know you through and through.
Ab.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Talk to me.
"If you don't know, you can't tell."
Can't tell?
"Can't spill the beans, you mean."
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.

"In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be."
I had a really nice time too.

"Yeah, I like that idea."
Hello.
Is someone there?
My name is Vivian Thorpe.
I have been a prisoner in here for weeks now.
Wait.
We have to get a signal first.
"We're here, sweetie."
It's a party!
Ring it.
Come here.
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.
Barbuda loves you.
"Barbuda, honey."
"Darling, I've missed you!"
It's Quico's party.
He's staying with me for a while.
Do you remember Quico?
Why didn't you tell me she'd be arriving today?
We thought it'd be better to wait a while.
You could've told me.
"Mrs. Maria Cecilia, the circus is on the road."
We didn't know exactly when it would stop nearby.
Nearby!
We walked almost for two hours.
- You live pretty far away!
"- Fine, I see."
"What really matters is that you're here, my doll."
Let me look at you.
You didn't grow much in these past fewyears.
Let me see your face.
Come on.
You look so much like -
Mrs. Maria Cecilia.
Here are her things.
- Is this all?
"- Yes, ma'am."
"Come on, Maria."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Man, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
How much did you see?
"Don't worry, I won't tell."
So you saw everything.
Everybody!
"The sea is frozen over, ja?"
Impossible for aliens to return!
Too much ice-y.
Too much ice-y.
PENGUIN 1:
"If the sea so far away, how we gonna catch food?"
PENGUIN 2:
"Yeah, what's the point of us starving too?"
PENGUIN 3:
I guess we should be going.
PENGUIN 4:
We can't just leave them.
PENGUIN 5:
I think they're leaving.
PENGUIN 6:
Who's leaving?
- It appears that we...
PENGUIN 7:
What is he saying?
I regret to inform... we are no longer in the catering businesses.
[CROWD GASPS]
NOAH:
Then who will bring us fish?
LOVELACE:
Some good questions have no good answers.
"Sven, they can't leave!"
Not now!
"I so sorry, fluffy one."
"If they stay... then they, too, become not alive."
PENGUIN 8:
Ah!
"- Damn right, it's an error."
POLICE OFFICER:
Unless he set you up.
- (GUN CLICKS)
"- Hands above your head, please, miss."
Wait.
Why?
Possession of stolen goods.
He left you holding.
I have nothing.
"Sorry to tell you, but your boy took off."
Probably in Canada by now.
He called in a tip.
Told us to take a look at the surveillance footage at the train station.
Give me the watch.
Now!
You know your rights?
EMMA:
Yeah.
Good girl.
Turn around.
Where's the rest of the watches?
Gone.
They're not coming back.
Let's go.
EMMA:
"So, it's just in here somewhere."
HOOK:
Allegedly.
"Give me a boost, would you, love?"
So I can't see what you're pocketing?
No way.
- You're?
- Wu-tang!
Then you're my uncle!
"Chao Fung, you know the sentence for killing your master."
- He had no choice.
"- Yan-ling, keep calm."
You're?
Cheung Ching Tse!
I'm willing to receive any punishment.
Please punish me!
He didn't kill his master.
Who are you?
Yan-ling of the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Uncle!
This is our internal affair.
Yan-ling!
Uncle!
"Uncle, she just came to save me."
"Alright, let's go back and have our senior be the judge."
- Don't go!
- No.
Be careful!
Yan-ling!
We came here today to catch the traitor Chao Fung.
We've no quarrel with anyone else.
"Chao Fung, you have nothing to do with her anymore."
Leave her.
"Uncle, he didn't intend to kill his master."
- But he did kill his master!
- Uncle!
Yan-ling!
Stop before I blush.
Actually I need your help.
I want to break up with my Thai boyfriend.
Ok and then?
He can't speak English and I can't speak Thai.
You guys can't even talk to each other and how did you get together?
You know S-E-X?
It's all about SEX.
Because sex is my life.
Okay enough.
I got it.
Thank you Tutor Pleng.
For what?
For agreeing to help me breaking up with him.
Oh no!
I didn't say I would.
But...
I got you this Louis Vuitton bag for you.
Oh yeah
Breaking up with the guy is so easy.
Don't worry.
Thank you
I grabbed it already.
You have good taste.
One original mocha ice blended please.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You have a problem?
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?
Gym?
Kaya's boyfriend?
Finished.
Just do some cardio.
I got to train 'cause I took a fight.
You did what?
I took a fight.
It's in Fresno next week.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You put yourself in a bad situation.
"Hey, listen, I can train here or somewhere else."
It's up to you.
- I'll leave right now.
"- Oh, will you?"
"What do you think this is, huh?"
You making a fucking...
You making a choice here?
You're making a big fucking mistake.
You understand me?
You're gonna fuck everything up.
I'll fucking leave right now.
"Oh, yeah?"
Give me the fucking word.
Okay.
Ground only.
No fucking striking.
Got it?
Give me the gloves.
Ground only.
Fucking Fresno.
[Gloves thud]
Fucking idiot.
Here you go.

"Hey, Mama."
- Hey.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"Okay, you know what?"
I can't believe that you just ignored the dirtiest text I've ever sent you.
"Well, dirty text?"
What dirty text?
I didn't get any dirty text.
I got...
"Ooh, geez."
No.
"The last text I got from you said, ""Never mind."
"- I forgot I had eaten beets."""
- No.
(sighs)
- Oh... (murmuring)
- Uh-huh.
I think that's the dirtiest text anybody's ever sent anybody.
You like it like that.
"Well, now I see why I never received it."

That's good.
"All right, let's clear some of these patients. I will be on today..."
"... butfirst,runyourcases by either Drs. Kovac or Clemente."
You're on today?
"Good, I mean, that's good."
You just--
You're always stuck in administration.
Good to keep your skills honed.
Dr. Kovac and Dr. Clemente will share the honor of running the board today.
-Share?
"-Abby, head lac's ready for you."
Doctors.
-After you.
"-No, no, after you, my man."
"No, no."
Really.
"Really, I insist."
"Oh, well, I insist too."
I'm serious-- l'm serious too.
Dr. Clemente.
Board.
Right.
"Okay, Glenda, come on, come on, come on, stop it."
Don't make nobody--
"Haleh, your paranoid gardener needs another slug of Haldol."
"-Oh, it's all right. I got this."
Go ahead.
I'll be back.
"Okay, Glenda."
"Here we go, a little stick, okay?"
-Aah!
You are too... a child.
It's dangerous to go alone!
I wonder if it is God's messenger.
Kill me...
I beg you....
Kill me...
This are the demon seeds...
Before they birth...
Kill me I beg you!
This is terrible....
Terrible...
Please stop it!
Don't look away.

You prayed for help...
You must believe until the end...
But...
If you pray...
Pray for death!
Devil!
Shoot!

Explain it!
What is this white bear?
I think....
You may not believe it...
"Well, when you get discharged... what will you do?"
"Jin-san has been here for so long, he well deserves a big payroll."
If that's so...
It's good.
Interesting.
Sammy OK.
Bring the family.
- Please.
Please.
Leave my family.
"- You stole from us, Sammy."
"- No, I did not steal."
"- Chan, caught our malımızla."
Chan works for you.
Now the whole damn family will die.

- We do not have to do this.
Do you know Mike?
You're right.
You Sammy'yi shoot and I'll leave her family.

Tekledin?

Good evening.
"From New York City,"
I'm Dan Rydell alongside Casey McCall.
"Bats and balls, balls and strikes -- let's play ball."
It's time for spring training.
"You hear that, gentlemen?"
This is the sound of opportunity knocking.
Don't be slow to answer the door.
J.D. :
I still can't believe you did it.
You know this is material evidence.
Did I say it wasn't?
"Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself."
I'm hungry.
How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
As you like.
"Yeah, what's up?"
What's so damned urgent anyway?
Order me a beer at the bar.
"I'll be right there, okay?"
Sorry.
"Hey... 2 beers, please."
Recognize her?
I found her.
Minks' daughter.
Got it?
She's been here since last Sunday.
I didn't realize it until we talked to each other.
Marie?
"This is Marc, the friend I told you about."
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I have a beer?
I have to talk to her.
You really just want to talk?
What if she doesn't want to?
- What?
Go back to her old man?
Will you leave her alone?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Turn around!
"- Man, I have my rights."
"- What do you mean, your rights?"
"Who's the boss here, huh?"
"Hey, who's running this outfit?"
- I am.
- You are?
- What are you doing here?
Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.
"Don't talk back to me, man."
What are you doing here?
"- We saw the car, man."
- You heist this car?
No.
We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up.
"- All of you, come on."
- Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.
"You dumb spics, get outta here!"
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!

Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.
Find yourself an elephant seal and show them the moves.
"Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing gonna move that?"
"With enough oomph, we can shove enough snow."
Pack it in behind.
It'll go.
BRYAN:
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it.
Hit the beat hard!

"Oh, yeah!"

- Sir?
Maybe if I had a couple minutes alone with Mrs Greenberg.
She's not gonna be very helpful when she's this upset.
- Sure.
That's a great idea.
- Thank you.
- I'll be in the doctors' lounge.
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.
- 'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.'
"'Dr Haywood, you're wanted in paediatrics.'"
"- Lena, they're just doing their job."
Here.
- I know.
Have some coffee.
"Look, Lena, I don't wanna push you, but..."
Here you go.
"- I don't want any, thank you."
- You don't want any.
"Erm, I get the feeling you know what's going on here."
"Lena, talk to me."
'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I thought it was his imagination.
He kept telling me he felt them.
He felt them.
Wait a minute.
Felt who?
"About two weeks ago, he started to act different, nervous."
"This week, it was worse."
He couldn't even sleep.
"And then yesterday, he..."
Did you say anything stupid?
"By ""anything stupid,"" I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago.
Go on.
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read them to you.
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Brandon Mayhew.
Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
- Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man."
I...
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Okay.
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart
# Turn me away and you'll lose me
# I know I messed things up and got them wrong

# To bring you joy
# So you can say
"# Yes, he's my boy"
# He's mine. #
"Thank you, Baker."
You'll hear from your teacher.
Morning.
You see that ceiling?
All them tiles might have to come down.
Sorry.
Hang on.
"Give me a sec, Tom."
Tubby.
Mr Brierley.
I'm glad I've seen you.
"Look, about the other day."
My wife's a bit...
She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
We're gonna miss out on all this money.
- Anybody could kick that guy's ass.
- I know.
Come on.
You could kick...
You-You could kick that guy's ass.
You think?
"Oh, my God."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know."
I did bash Charlie good a couple times.
- You almost hurt him once.
- With the bottle?
"- Yeah, and that's next to impossible."
- That was good.
- You're...
You're good.
- I am good.
Yeah.
Tell you what.
Um...
Why don't you go stretch out.
I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby... has arrived.
- Let's do it.
- All right.
Goddamn it.
"- Frankie, what's the deal?"
- She got arrested.
- Ah!
I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.
- So we'll never get the fight.
Oh my!
It's so hot outside!
And these things I bought are so heavy!
Sis?
"Sis, why?"
What happened?
.
Why am I being like this?
What's the matter?
.
Come here.
"Don't cry sis, it doesn't look good on you."
"Because of my jealousy, because of my suspicions, I'm turning into something else."
"If I keep on being like this, Migs wouldn't like me."
"Come on Sis, you know you're not really like that, right?"
.
I'm already choking Migs.
"I've smothered him so much,"
"You know, it's like this Sis don't put him on a leash."
He has to be with you because he loves you.
Right?
Come on!
Brother Migs!
Happy Birthday!
"By the way, my sister left your cell phone."
She told me to give it to you.
Wait a second okay?
.
Brother!
-Who's that girl?
-I'm your wife!
"Bela, what's this?"
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'll buy you a refreshment.
"Please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'll buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will buy."
- I'll buy.
"- No, I will."
- I will.
- I will.
- Me!

My name is Ben Laine.
I will help you through the day.
I know that you're anxious.
You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"I'm talking about getting very, very rich."
"You count cards, right?"
All of you?
"As a team, yes."
- When?
- Weekends.
And Christian holidays.
- Where?
"- Vegas, baby."
"So, why are you telling me?"
"Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster."
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
"- Yeah, it's catchy, I know."
"Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?"
"Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler."
Yeah...
This is crazy.
"No, Ben."
This is profitable.
"Yeah, I can't do it."
"So, I'm sorry."
"- Come on, Ben."
It'll be fun.
"- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun."
"No, it's not that."
It's...
"I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me."
We pay better.
"Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends."
Why not?
"- Oh, is that what you call it?"
- Violet!
What?
"I almost forgot, I got something for you too."
Really?
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world of view.
Now you can share with others... in a new way.
"Thanks a lot, mister."
I need the police.
"Yes, that's my address."
What are you doin'?
He's writing a letter.
To who?
"To ""whom""."
To whom?
His daughter.
I'll do it.
What?
I'll write it for you.
Alright.
Thank you.
So where was I?
"""Dear April..."""
That's it?
"So far, yeah."
"""Dear April,"
"I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do."
In any case...
It's time we finally talk.
"Please, take care of yourself."
I managed to put some money in your bank account.
Is that paint?
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Hey, Gabby!"
"- Take a sample from her left fingers,"
- Left hand.
"Excuse me, Mr. Monk?"
I have a nephew.
He's ten years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spider-man.
Really?
Kids!
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think i'm some kind of hero."
"Sorry, Mr. Monk is working."
Maybe when he's finished.
- I'm sorry.
- Anything else?
"Clues, clues, scanning, scanning."
"No, that's it, all done."
You said something about an autograph?
That would be great.
Thank you so much.
I got.
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.
Your hair's in the way.
"Head down, head down."
Are you okay?
- She's fine.
-No!
"-Mom, if I eat all my pizza, can I have some alien slime?"
This cannot be happening to me.
-A stranger.
-From the outside.

The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.

Take that!
"Oh, no!"

Get down!
What's gotten into you?
I was...

Gotcha!

No way!
Yes!

"See ya on ""Trisha""."
I was thinking of asking you to speak at the school.
Speak?
About drugs.
Speak about drugs?
To the kids.
Speak to the kids about drugs?
They need to hear about the harsh realities 'cause... people talk so much shit about drugs.
Yeah.
I know I do.

Jason.
Miss.
- How are you both?
- Wicked.
See you off?
I feel very sorry for you too!
"Miss Bridget, it's time to board the plane!"
"Hey Yank, don't go away!"
"Hey Yank, what about the money?"
"I want cash, no credit cards!"
I've paid her already!
Yes!
I've donated it in your names to the War Relief Fund.
You're great!
I thank you for the four hundred million people.
See you after our country wins the war!
- Allow me!
- Thank you!
"It's all your fault, me posing as Hiroshima."
Now we've got no money and no woman!
Hey Yank!
What is it?
Remember to get Hiroshima for me!
What?
Don't forget to fix Hiroshima for me.
OK!
"No money, no woman, that means we have nothing."
I guess we're friends again!
Sure we are!

It was alive.
It was alive as if it were waiting for me.
I was in the light.
I felt good.
- Didn't you want to come back?
- No.
But you did come back.
Yes.
Why did you come back?
I just did.
Something made you come back.
Is there something you're holding back?
"She can't recognise anyone, she can't speak."
What did the doctor say?
That there's no hope.
- The doctor said that?
- Yes.
Who's watching her?
"My mother, the neighbours, the family, my young uncle."
Your young uncle?
He's called in three times.
His holidays are over.
My grandmother's better.
How old is she?
100... 150... 100 or 150?
100.
Special rate?
Yes.
"After one hundred, the rest doesn't matter."
Do you know that or not?
I don't know.
"We grow old, you know."
"I have to go, I have exams."
I'll be back.
Come back quickly.
Don't forget.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
"Hello, are you well?"
Are you looking for something?
My camera.
We left it here and it's gone.
You didn't lock the car.
"One night has passed, you expect it to be there?"
"Hello, good luck."
"Oh, hello"
Pick it up
Sada san I'm grateful
What for?
I was in the mood for something sweet
"Actually, Sada san"

He's a laborer in Kawaracho
That widow he's living with is a beauty
- You knew!
"- Yeah, I knew"
- Since when?
"But you got away, didn't you?"
You're a Pure Blood.
"You were born a vampire, and I was turned."
I'm unworthy.
"Come on, Chase, that is so old world."
It's not me anymore.
You're still with Marcus?
Of course.
But is he with you?
Your master's voice.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Marcus."
You didn't close the deal?
"No, it didn't go well."
Nothing has since Berlin.
"What's wrong with you, Chase?"
Relax...
I love your voice.
What's your name?
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
What's Pepita the Elephant?
I can feel something hard against my stomach.
Did you get it all down?
"Keep it, Superman."
I'm really hot all of a sudden.
Hello.
Is it Lusty Terhi?
Wait...
I'd just fallen asleep.
"Okay, try to come fast."
"I'm trying, Terhi."
I'm the secret garden of your lusts.
I'm taking off my panties now.
My orchid is opening up.
"Where are you going at this hour, Jemina?"
Where were we?
You said Jemina.
-So?
"Terhi, let's pretend that my name is Jesse."
I don't believe it.
Remember Pepita the Elephant?
Give me some phone sex now.
"Do I have to, Jesse?"
I'm fucking paying for this.
"Fine, let's go then."
My pussy is all wet.
I can hear you open your zipper.
-Right...
His name is Vito Corleone.
We'll send him olive oil from here.
To his company in America.
"They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio."
"We'd like your blessing, and your permission to start work."
Where is this young man from New York?
Have him come closer.
I can't see him so good.
"My respects, Don Ciccio."
Give me your blessing.
Bless you!
What's your name?
You took the name of this town!
And what's your father's name?
His name was...
Antonio Andolini.

My father's name was Antonio Andolini and this is for you!
"Michael, say goodbye."
"Hi, Al."
"Can I speak with you for a second, Tom?"
"Tom, where's Mike?"
Waiting for you to leave.
-Can I talk with him?
"-Sorry, Fredo."
No chance.
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.
"Michael, it's Connie."
Michael...
"I'd like to stay close to home now, if it's all right."
Is Kay coming?
SAM:
"When I told Dad I was scared of the thing, he gave me a .45."
DEAN:
What was he supposed to do?
-I was 9 years old.
SAM:
The weapon training?
And melting the silver into bullets?
"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors, the windows, close the shades."
-Most important--
-Watch out for Sammy.
[GROWLS]
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
-It's called being a good son.
"-Dad's gonna be here, right?"
"He'll be here, promise."
"-Where is he, anyway?"
-On business.
-That's why you ran away.
-I was going to college.
"It was Dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
"Your brother and me, we needed you."
"You walked away, Sam."
-You walked away.
DEAN:
Stop it.
You're the one who said don't come back.
"You closed that door, not me!"
This isn't the life I wanted for you.
[SCREAMING]
"BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO SAY ""I TOLD YOU SO."""
"THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU, MICHAEL."
I KNOW.
"FIONA,I NEED YOUR HELP."
"OH,SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HANDLE THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN."
"YOU JUST COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF, COULD YOU?"
"SADLY,NO."
TAKE DOUG BACK TO THE LOFT.
LOCK HIM DOWN TIGHT.
"YOU CAN HANDLE THAT,RIGHT?"
HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN?
"BE CAREFUL,FI."
"DON'T WORRY,MICHAEL."
I NEVER LET MY GUARD DOWN.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T GET AHOLD OF HER?
SHE DOESN'T HAVE SOME KIND OF A --
"YEAH,ALL RIGHT, WELL,KEEP TRYING."
"MIKE,SHE'S IN SOME KIND OF A MEETING WITH A NEW CLIENT"
THAT JUST CALLED THIS MORNING.
"I MEAN,IT MIGHT BE NOTHING."
"IT'S NOT GONNA BE NOTHING,SAM."
HELLO?
Evelyn:
"Michael,if I had known you were this much fun to work with,"
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'M GLAD ONE OF US IS HAVING FUN.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress,are you?"
"""Michael,my son!"
I'm afraid!
"Please,Michael!"""
You changed.
This is more my style.
- Who?
Finnerman?
I won't let her.
"I couldn't protect you before, Allison."
But I can now.
"Dad, what have you done?"
You weren't supposed to see this.
You should go.
"Dad, no!"
No!
"Help us, someone, please help us!"
Protect... protect the innocent ones.
No!
"No, Dad."
"Hey, stay with me, okay?"
You're gonna be okay.
Just...
Just stay with me.
"Stay with me, okay?"
"Please, someone help us!"

JARED (over radio):
Hold your line.
"Keep your speed up,"
Dana.
You're doing great.
"I'm doing so great, how come you're right up on my ass?"
I'm drafting you.
"(laughs) Not for long, you're not."
(gears shift)
No.
"Anyway, uh..."
So I can still have Daisy this weekend if that's OK?
"No, that's great."
"But you could have called to tell me that, so why are you really here?"
"Well, I just wondered if you, you know, fancied a drink or a bite to eat tonight?"
Um...
I...
I can't.
I'm...
I'm having dinner with someone.
OK.
Cool.
Yeah.
Have a good night.
"Happy anniversary, Harry,"
You too.
"What the hell are you doing here, Harry?"
I've come to win my money back off you.
You're deluded.
Fortune favors the brave.
"If fortune favored you, you wouldn't be drinking here alone."
"So why don't you have a drink with me, Freddie?"
Unburden yourself.
"Take your hands off me, Harry."
Do you mind?
(MAN SHOUTS)
Look at me!
I need your help.
I need to talk to Freddie!
"Look, Kayleigh's gone, JC!"
She's disappeared!
Eat.

O-ume you are not quite good.
Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
"in ""Assistant""."
I left my coat on the bus.
- Can you describe it?
"Yes, it had eight wheels, hard plastic seats, and when it stopped, it went, ""sh-h-h-h"""
"Harry, he means the coat."
"- Oh, oh!"
"Um, well, it kind of looked like this one, only it was furry.."
don't have it.
Next.
Night Eddie.
- See you Monday.
He's got my coat.
"- Harry, be a man."
"Hey, Mister, that's my coat."
No it isn't.
"- Yeah, that's his coat."
"If it's his coat, how come I'm wearing it?"
Good point.
Hey babes.
"Good morning Dick, did you sleep well?"
"Once the adrenaline wore off, like a baby."
"You know when you've been riding the bullet train to ""yuk-ville"", it's kind of hard to slow down."
I've been up all night faxing jokes to Leno.
What have we here?
Eleven banana cream pies!
One for every letter in my name.
Am I right?
Right.
Oh girls.
You shouldn't have.
"Oh, we had to."
Really.
"Come, come, come."
You must be famished.
"Let me help you, my dear."
There we go.
That's better.
"Now, quite comfy, hmm?"
"Ha, ha."
"It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?"
[Match strikes]
"Uh, do you like it?"
It is rather a fine one.
"- [Laughs] - [Woman] Oh, my."
"[Clears throat] Sorry, Grim."
"Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks."
"Ah, very amusing. [sniffs]"
"Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?"
"Oh, you're gonna love it!"

I'm really sorry about Stephanie.
Sam...
"Hey, sweetie."

I can't.

There's no blockages here.
So it's not a heart attack.
No.

You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.
"Tris, we need to leave now, all right?"
"I'm sorry, Four."
What?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was gonna go.
I wanted to say goodbye and I just didn't know how.
I didn't know how.
What are you talking about?
So even though I didn't get to say it in real life at least I get to say it now.
Even if it is just in the sim.
"Tris, we're not in a sim."
Don't you think I'd know if I was in a sim?
"Four, you're not in a sim."
You are the sim.
"Wait, wait."

"One time, we had a warning of an attack."
We had the entire village like this.
"When the raiders came, we jumped up and chased them back to the beach."
But there was one small problem.
You couldn't find the village again.
Have I told you the story before?

I receive training.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean.
You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this.
This was shorter.
Because...
That way.
They'll give me back...
Look.
I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.

I can't give it to you.

It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison.
There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is.

No judgment.
L-lt's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that... but I...
I wanted... the opportunity... to show him that I could be there for him.
You know?
I haven't always been.

You haven't.

Hey.!
"- We gonna talk or what, man?"
- When your rep gets here.
- Fuck the rep.
I gotta talk to you.
- When your rep gets here.
"Rueben, can you call E.M.S. about this guy?"
Yeah.
"Hey, Moe, Harbor found one of Superboy's shoes."
What about the socks?
They find them too?
Fuckin' shoe.
Jack Rector's comin' in tomorrow at 9:00.
- What about Donlan?
"- Uh, next week."
- His P.D.A. attorney says--
- Who's that?
Who's his lawyer?
- This guy Sloan.
- Sloan?
"Ooh, big gun."
Says he's grieving and all depressed for his nephew.
"Oh, Ray's all grieving and depressed."
"Now, put it to good use."
I'm on it.
Twice the firepower means zero xborgs.
[grunting] Huh?
[grunting] [grunting] Let's switch up too.
[grunting] You got it. [grunts] [grunting] Hiya!
[grunting]
I just can't get over these new powers.
Yah!
You got that right.
Ugh.

How many of these guys' butts do we have to kick?
Time to go to the next level.

Let's try it.
Legendary ranger mode-- samurai.
[both] Ready.

Woo hoo.
Yeah.

Whoo-hoo.
All right.
This is an historic moment for the Power Rangers.
Ready.
"Go go, samurai."
Power Rangers samurai.
- Sweet.
- Let's try another legendary mode.
Look...
"Yeah, that's cool."
'Cause I don't see no bwoy.
"Well, I suppose that is a matter of opinion."
I suppose.
(grunts)
Oh--
You're home early.
Mmhmm.
They changed my shift.
I'll get you food.
"I like dat, you should wear it more often."
Well it doesn't help much with finding work.
(kisses teeth)
Excuse me?
"Listen girl, no decent folk is going to hire any deportee, alright?"
That's just great.
"Alright, alright, listen!"
None of dat is my business anyway.
But you?
You have a problem.
But I tied him up.
Fine!
Fine.
I will go find him then--
"But I bet you could, right?"
It's doubtful.
That's almost $200!
"Uncle Archie, I can't afford that!"
"Well, Marva, there are other ways to pay for tings."
Hm?

Due to serious setbacks to our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago my position in Cuba is untenable.

Get me a wet towel.
Does Kay know I'm back?
My boy?
Did you get him something for Christmas?
-I took care of it.
"-What was it, so I'll know."
It was a little car with an electric motor that he can ride in.
It's nice.
"Thank you, Al."
"Fellows, could you step outside for a minute?"
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat.
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey...
So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty!"
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!"
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I...
I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
"You made it up, didn't ya?"
"I... hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!

And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
- No.
It's our dog.
Uh-huh.
When will Mom be back?
Hmm?
Um...
She'll be home soon.
Can we wait?
Where should we wait?
Hand me the list.
I'll see how much we've collected.
- The money too?
"- Yeah, I'll count it."
Okay.
- Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.
You'd swear a doctor had written it.
It's barely legible.
Looking forward to school?
- Well...
- It starts soon.
- Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.
A lot more going on there.
We've already collected a tidy sum.
"If somebody else gives as much as him, we'll have done pretty well."
Mm-hmm.
We'll see how much more we get.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I have to go to the toilet.
( indistinct chatter )

I've done my homework.
Do some reading.

"Grandpa, all I need is the truck."

"Come on, Ma, let me have the truck."
I got a date!

Frankie.

"Oh, sure."
I believe that one.
He's originally from Chicago.
He and Ray got busted about six years ago for another drug rip-off.
They did two years together in San Quentin.
Prison buddies.
DUD:
Pluto's a piece of work.
"IQ 150, college graduate."
We think he's the one who did the stabbings.
His package indicates that he's very fond of a knife.
He's got three priors.
"And for some reason, he left the videotape playing."
Sick son of a bitch.

JOHN:
He knew we couldn't lift those prints.
He left a calling card.
Dud.
Cole here.
"Yeah, put him through."
"Chief Dixon, this is Dud..."
"Yeah, I'm fine, thank..."
Put him on the box so we can all hear him.
What's his name?
Chief Dale Dixon.
I'm going to put you on the speaker phone so we can all hear you.
We have Chief Jenkins here.
DALE:
Chief Jenkins?
Los Angeles Chief of Police Jenkins?
No shit.
"Wow, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"Good to meet you, Chief Dixon."
"10 years ago to this day, his father died here."
He was waiting for a train as he did every evening.
"He had a good job, happy family."
"And one evening, he'd had enough."
"And when the express came by, he jumped."
Was he a friend of yours?
"And these last few days,"
Dennis has come here every evening.
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?
Look at him.
- Why should I?
- Look at him.
"Because in about two minutes,"
Dennis there will be dead.
What the f...
You're crazy.
Completely crazy.
"You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit, right across the platform."
Look!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
"Listen, don't do it!"
"Please, put the gun down!"
Is this your first time?
You seem kind of young.
He's here to see Dr. Kay.
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
"- No, it's not."
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
"John, do you realize what's happening to you?"
I have to go.
"Hey, it's me."
- Connie?
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
"I tried to get you on the one to Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
"Mano, Erik!"
Mother!
-Glory!
"My beautiful boys, I you never see them."
We have to find a way to take you there.
"Honey, everyone is looking for a way out."
"If there is an exit, we'll find."
"Do not worry, Dad."
"Today, the Uncle Mano took an enormous elephant seal a large black hole."
But that hole was quite different.
-But he drew.
"-Mano, can bring a fish for my children."
"-For me, too."
"-Here, too."
"Okay, will do my best."
"Hey, listen!"
There's a way of freeing almost all of you.
"I'm going to delelândia, I'll bring some friends."
"Will be patients, all right."
Where you going?
-I take a shortcut.
-Of course not.
-You will be right here.
-But I'm quick.
-Erik.
"-Walk away, she is an athlete."
"Sorry, Erik, I will go faster."
Boadicea!
Which girl impossible!
I'm impossible even.
"-Then, boot to break, girl."
-Yay!
- Will I?
"- Yeah, totally."
"You've got the pony bug now, and there's no cure for that."
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl.
Back in time for dinner.
"Okay, I've had the most insane day."
I don't know where to start.
Uh...
"Sam, she asked me to help with Raven, he's a horse."
"And Pin was like, ""Back off, tourist."""
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?
"It sounds like you had fun, whatever you were doing."
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...
I don't want you riding.
What?
Why?
Because I need you keeping an eye on Rosie.
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable?
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's fine.
She doesn't have to be with me the whole time.
This isn't up for discussion.
I've got enough to worry about with Gramps and your dad and...
Just... promise me.
No riding.
Sure.
No riding.
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!
Flying saucer!
Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
- R-Right.
Turn the right tap.
- He's messing with you!
It's up to Chris.
He's saying left so that you'll pick right.
Maybe it's because I don't wanna hurt Gemma.
You don't care who you hurt.
One.
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Left tap turning on.
"Good call, Chris."
"Babe, babe, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, babe, he made me choose."
I suppose a date's out of the question now.
I'm so sorry.
"He made me choose, all right?"
He just made me.
"Round, and round, and round it goes... where it stops... nobody knows."
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why you?
Why us five?
Why did you choose us?
A photograph by Felix's bed.
Five faces scratched out.
- Your faces.
- That doesn't prove anything.
"- Fucking hell, a photograph."
- It was good enough for Felix... it's good enough for me.

- You were bored?
- Yes.
THEY WERE BORED.
He smiled and then -
"It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but..."
I was surprised when he called me afterwards.
",We got to know each other, Iike in the song."
What song?
By Hugues Aufray.
could you sing it for us?
"No, not Iike this."
REFUSES TO SING
- How about you?
"- I don,t know it."
Why do you ask?
Might she remember?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
What?
-A man to see you.
-What man?
You're a very nice lady.
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.
I'll come back when she's feeling better.
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
"A draft in the fall, when the house is hot, is a magic carpet for bacteria."
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
It's all right.
I can always make a new one.
I'd rather lose my engine than seeing it misused by a villain.
This is it.
Here I go.
"I do this and this, and then..."
"Professor, here we come!"
"Oh, no!"
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Wait!
"He has the devil's luck, indeed."
Did you see that?
Two planes are leading.
Mac's and Hudson's.
Everybody's here.
Dear!
Helen!
Here.
Congratulations on your victory.
"Congratulations, Mac."
Thank you very much.
I owe my victory entirely to your kindness.
"No, it's due to your excellent engine."
Or perhaps to Mrs. Hudson's lunch basket.
"Oh, that may be right."
I wished I could have asked Professor Moriarty how he liked the dessert.
I bet it was the bitterest cake he had ever tasted.
Ouch...
Shall we raise our glasses?
Cheers!
"Professor... we completely blew it, didn't we?"
The humans barely put up a fight.
"Yes, your majesty."
"Give the word, and I'll send in the second wave of xborgs to finish them."
The special weapons I've developed will assure our victory.
"I wish I had a device that could locate your lost brother, Vrak."
Thank you.
But we must assume
Vrak fell in battle.
"We will avenge my brother's destruction, and claim Earth as our own."

Anybody here? Ha!
[whimpering] Oh. sorry.
Are you okay?
"So then this Miss Elvina comes in, she must have been 100 years old, and I tell her, I say,"
"""Roger's just a friend of my family's in cotton,"""
"but she won't hear of it, she just wants to talk fish."
[voice fades]
♫♫
Zelda.
Zelda?
Oh.
Did she get what she wanted?
I hope so.
I beat it out of there the minute Roger got back.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I...
I get goin' on a story.
"Not at all, John."
I like it.
It speaks to your general enthusiasm.
"Well, I do have that."
I have something else.
My pin.
"You know what this means, right?"
I surely do.
"Where is everybody, Mama?"
I'm here.
I mean Daddy.
Rotary Club.
"All right, then."
"Well, Zelda, baby, how is everything?"
What?
"Just, you know, wondering how everything is?"
"You are so bad at faking' things, Mama."
"You know, don't you?"
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
"Three, judge."
"Thank you, judge."
Three for the judge.
Ten dollars.
I'll let you off with a light sentence.
Pair of nines.
Pair of dogs.
"I didn't know you had a twin brother, judge."
"All right, Brock, the door's open."
"It's temporary, anyhow."
"Who opened it for me, Bill;"
I suppose I ought to say thanks.
I don't know the party.
Ho!
[playing piano]
"Brock, you're home."
"Papa, Brock's home."
"Well, were you still as lucky;"
"Oh, sure, I'm always lucky."
"-Stop that, play something else."
-Like;
"Well, anything but that funeral march."
Play something with people in it.
Can't have a funeral without people.
Have dinner;
Yeah.
Ate at Bailey's place on the way out.
"-Brock said he was lucky again, Papa."
-Really;
That's funny.
-Looks to me like the boys took him.
-They tried.
Hold me.

"(Danny) Uh-oh, back that shit up."
Enrique mento!
"Hey, Mike!"
Want to bat?
"Come on, Mike!"
Yeah...
Yeah!
Remember how we used to do it?
"Hey, he's gonna mess up the whole flow of the game."
"Dejalo, dejalo..."
Come on.
That's gonna throw everything off.
"Danny, just throw the ball, dude."
"Man, he's gonna take my spot."
All right.
"Remember how we used to do it in little league, right?"
"Choke up on the bat, put your shoulder into it."
"Come on, throw him a nice juicy one so he can smack it!"
"Yo, what if he hits a home run?"
"Yo, just shut up and throw the ball, B."
Okay.
"Ponsela, ponsela!"
"Come on, Michael!"
"Esta seria, aqui."
"Go, go!"
"Go, run it out!"
"Run Michael, run it out, run it out!"
Run!
"It's okay, that's okay."
"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
"Look man, you don't have to be nice to me cause I'm going out with Haley, okay?"
I'm not.
Team sucks on a day without you man.
Ask Whitey.
I'm trying to avoid him.
That's cool.
Do what you got to do.
Usually do.
Am I hallucinating?
Did I just see you talking to Lucas?
"No, he was trying to talk to me."
The whole nice guy thing's wearing kind of thin.
You want to walk to English?
"Actually, I think I'm gonna cut out of here a little bit early."
Wanna join me?
Are you serious?
"Yeah, why not?"
You up for it?
"I can't, Nathan."
Alright.
"Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I'll catch you later."
Okay.
You know what?
Catch me now.
- Oh My God!
"- Nice, huh?"
"So, are we trying to get killed?"
"I told you, my dad's in Charlotte, it's okay."
I've never seen you like this.
Now you have.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?
No.
Are you sure?
It's very good.
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Stay away from me!
Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not going to change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
Yes.
Why?
They just found another victim.
Guess he wasn't a person after all.
"V, Cash said that you took the money."
That's not true.
"I, I believe you, but... you got to tell Waltzer in person."
Um...
"T ell me where you are, and I'll come to you."
V?
Got to...
"Oh, shit."
Got to get out of here.
Okay.
Oh!
Excuse me.
"Sorry, excuse me."
Thank you.
Who do I need to find?
What am I doing?
"Uh, Dad."
Dad.
Find Dad.
"Um, excuse me."
I'm looking for Frank's father.
He's a teacher here.
"Oh, what's his goddamn name?"
"His name is, um..."
T om.
"T om, that's his name."
...the edges on the sedge.
That's one of the ways you can tell-- sedges have edges.
"Now, if you look at the composition of this soil closely under a microscope, you could see traces of thousands and thousands of years of evolution."
"Thanks, Mr. Wheeler."
"You're welcome, Nate."
- You changed your mind?
- They saw your gun and your wire cutters.
What can I say?
Hope is contagious.
- But Death Valley...
- We have a plan.
"We, uh... cut the phone cords and the power to the watchtower lights first."
- Safer in the dark.
- George!
Wait.
Danny.
"Danny, I'm sorry, lad, but we can only take five."
I want to help.
No.
Stay inside.
Stay safe.
Lifted it from the guards' latrine on cleaning duty.
What's it for?
Protection.
I won't allow it.
"Don't do anything daft, Danny."
How long does it take the guards to reach the far side?
Two minutes.
"OK, then."
"Two minutes from now, we run."
"Go, go, go."
Cut the wire!
Hey!
What are you doing?
_

Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
I'm so sorry!
"- Don't worry, Jocelyn."
How do you know my name?
I don't know.
"This is Paul Rochester, Deputy Art Director."
Hello.
Have a nice tour.
Thanks.
Well... you go...

- Whore!
- Who?
- Whore is here.
- Roxane Rochett?
"- Not that whore, the nail enamel!"
- Whore!
- What does it mean?
"It means fuck me, but respect me."
"Worship my body, but the upkeep is going to be costly."
"Stripe me, spurn me, treat me as your Spaniel."
I'm your dog and I'm gonna break the leash on you!
"- Calm down, Cornelia!"
Arf!

"""You were always my little boy."""
You really were.
Maybe we... we were blessed that...
Please don't go.
Please don't leave me.
I can't do this on my own.

What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
"Oh, God, Adam."
I don't know.
Dad?
Nina!
Nina!
"- It's OK, it's OK."
"All right, all right."

I think he knew it was gonna happen.
That's why he came back to Wales.
He wanted to die here.
- This is it.
I'm on my own.
"- Oh, no, you're not."
You and Nina are just dealing with a problem.
That's all I am to you.
"Look, I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, cos personally I haven't been through it."
I know.
You're just a kid.

This is Factionless?
This is insane.
Tobias.
Mother.
(WHISPERING) I thought she was dead.
Me too.
Someone please tell me what's going on here.
Tobias' father was very abusive.
I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him would be to disappear completely.
Abnegation helped me fake my death.
Anything to protect Marcus' image.
But you just left him there alone with Marcus?
I was very young-
I reached out to him about a year ago.
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.
(LAUGHS)
- What the fuck?
- Come on!
"Down, set, go!"
TTD:

Y'all take five.
Good play.
Take five.

"Sorry, Rick."
You know what a skinny post is?
"Why the fuck are you throwing it so high, man, and behind me?"
"Man, we don't even call plays at my school."
School?
What you... you in...

- Miami-Dade High.
- You in high school?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Really?
I'ma really kick your ass if you don't get to step...
Get out of here.
"T, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
"We got Amendola, Gronk, and Edelman working with Brady."
On the road.
At the edge of town.
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.
Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.
Okay.
- Did they ever say where?
- Anywhere is better than this.
"- Any friends with a white car, a Citroën?"
- No.
It's Quini.
- What?
- Her boyfriend is outside.
Can we go now?
You can leave.
- Your son?
- The youngest.
He's in Germany.
He's been working there for two years.
I have two more in Barcelona...
- ...and my daughter's in France.
- Can you tell me what you saw?
On the bend.
That's where it stopped.
- Did you see how many people were in the car?
- No.
- Were they forced into the car?
- I think they knew each other.
I don't have time for this.
"I am sick, damn it!"
I'm the one that is out of time.
"Jacob, I am dying."
You have to stay and do what we have decided.
- Nothing has been decided.
- Anna will need you.
And Helene...
And the boys...
"They're so young, Jacob."
"Look at me, Jacob!"
Don't you see that there is a point to all of this?
"You have a responsibility here, Jacob."
Do I have to live on the other side of the world to get your help?
"Hi, Anna."
It's Jacob.
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.
Call as soon as you can.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go take care of my hubbie.
Anna?
Is something wrong?
- Can I sleep here?
"- Yes, of course."
"Anna, what happened?"
There.
- Hello.
"- Mrs. Shaw, it's Jacob."
"- Hi, Jacob."
Want to talk to Pramod?
"- No, just let him sleep."
I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.
- Can we talk?
- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
- So talk about Jorgen.
- Can we sit down?
We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
Took me a Iong time to understand that rhyme.

"But having respect, that feels even better."
SANTANA:
"You know, La Primera lives through us, ese."
It gives to us.
It is us.
"We make it, carnal."
"We don't fake you, we just take you."
'Cause La Primera's ese.
J. D. :
"Always has been, always will be."
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...
I've got you...
- Are you good?
- All right.
"That's, please don't take that call."
"I've got to, booty calls."
"I'm looking for the truth, Mr Sugar."
Alan?
"Alan, someone who's smashed up the shop."
Mr Sugar?
"You got some sort of problem, boy?"
We've got some talking to do.
And I'm looking for the truth.
"Yeah, well, I'm telling you the truth."
You want to smash my shop up?
Not particularly.
"Let's smash, let's smash it up."
Let's smash it up!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's smash it up!
I appreciate you're a little bit angry...
HE LAUGHS
Have one!
Have one!
These are beautiful.
They're great.
What do you want to ask me?
What do you want to know?
Have a nice fruit salad.
One of your five-a-day.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You can eat them...
Why have you got it in for Cowell?
"Cowell sent his boys around here, did you know that?"
I can see you're attaching electrodes to the boy's chest.
What are those for?
"- What are those for, Dr. Ross?"
- Patch me through to County.
Dr. Ross has just asked me to patch him through to County General.
- You need a red key.
- Look out for the Lost Soul.
- Use the rocket launcher.
- Mount Sinai's shooting us.
- They're cheaters!
Get them!
- You do it!
- I need a bulletproof vest.
- Blast him with a BFG 9000!
"Look, his guts are all over the place!"
"Quiet, you guys."
This is County General.
Go ahead.
This is Chopper Five from Channel Five News.
We've got a Dr. Ross flying in a hypothermic kid.
- Doug Ross?
- That is correct.
"Hold on, Chopper Five."
"Mark, Doug is on a news chopper bringing in a hypothermic kid."
- What?
- It's on the MICN.
- What's he doing on a news chopper?
"- Look, there's Dr. Ross."
- Turn up the volume.
- Where's the remote?
"Doug, do you read me?"
"- Mark, is that you?"
Gone.
They've gone.
Where'd they go?
To the mountains.
(dramatic music)
Allow me.
(laughing)
(whimpering)
"It's okay, Xiao-Mei."
"Spare me, I beg you!"
"Mr. Cheng, let me go!"
Let you go?
"You killed so many people, I'm putting you in jail!"
(triumphant Western music)
"Brother Jeng, you're going."
You will come back?
Just as soon as I can.
Really?
"Of course, and then I'll take you to see a doctor."
Take care.
Let's go.
See you!
See you.
Hello?
- 120 over 80.
"- Okay, Bob."
That oughta do it.
Good.
How's everything look?
"Everything seems fine: solids, liquids, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, E.K.G."
"Actually, it is one of the most boring physicals I have ever given."
France isn't there.
For three points.
Maybe look for countries.
Belgium?
No.
No...
No...
"Hungary, or...?"
What's the country?
It must be something?
"Yes indeed, it must be something, but you haven't found it."
I'm going to throw it over for a bonus point to the Araucarians?
"Oh, yes, I've got the country."
We think it's Chagall and...
Belarus?
Show me your first letters.
Let's see if you're right.
Yes you are.
Chagall and Belarus.
"Chagall, one of the leading artists of the 20th century, came from Belarus."
Settled in France.
Anyone know the town he was born in a Belarus?
Minsk?
Vitebsk!
"And whenever he did his paintings, he said, ""Whenever I paint,"
"""I'm thinking of Vitebsk."" Anyway, there you are."
"Araucarians, we're with you."
Reveal the hive.
One of them's oxygen?
Oxygen's not there.
I know.
Fluorine.
-In the back.
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.
"I'll take a small steak, two eggs on top some fries, juice, and a side order of toast...."
"Yes, sure."
Right away.
"Look out for that stomach, huh?"
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.
Okay.
"See you, huh?"
We'll have your steak ready in a minute.
Where's my buddy?
"Oh, he left."
He left?
-What are you talkin' about?
"-Hey, what's a matter?"
You okay?
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?
"Oh, I think your steak's ready."
Thank you.
"Oh, no!"
-What?
-He took my wallet.
I left the raincoat in the car and....
I can't even pay you for this.
"Tell me, where you goin' anyway?"
-Down to L.A.
-Why?
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.
-What kind of job?
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"Gibbs, Lance Corporal Finn's fiancée's upstairs."
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"How, Doctor?"
"As soon as I know, you'll know."
Her name is Siri Albert.
"She's 25, lives in Manassas, and works as a physical therapist."
- Finn's fiancée is here.
I put her in the conference room.
- You did?
I did.
"No, I did."
His fiancée?
"Yeah, his fiancée."
Tall ?
Like brown hair ?
Red hair.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from Iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in Jackson, Pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That James Finn has been dead three months.
He left for Iraq three months ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay, but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
AndI 'mcomingforyou .
"Peace out, loser."
- He's at the Fun Zone.
Gear up.
- This ends tonight.
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
- What were you aiming for?
"- Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
- Why do we keep hurting each other?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not--
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
I count that.
- Yeah.
"- Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just-- want us to be normal again."
"- Yeah, me too."
- I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
- What?
- Why did I say that?
- Why did you kiss Holt?
- I didn't.
I did.
"We did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything."
"Just forget I said anything, right?"
Sculptor?
"Yeah, every family's got a"
Black sheep.
"Most families get, like, a"
"Retard, or a guy that likes to"
"Wear dresses, we got a sculptor."
"Yeah, retard, sculptor."
Same thing really.
"Yeah, there was a retard"
Sculptor.
60 minutes did a piece on him I
Think.
Yeah.
Really brilliant work.
"And he was real quick, too."
He'd make like one or two
Statues a day.
Only one problem though.
What was that?
He liked the taste of clay.
"So you're saying... yeah, he'd eat his own work."
"Goddamn, what a waste."
"Not really, you know every"
"Time he took a shit, genius."
"Ah, Lou."
"T, you and the probie go down"
"That way, Franco and I are gonna"
Head this way.
"What'd they say, 5 people on"
This floor?
"I said 5, 5."
Whoa.
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
Uh...
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not good enough!
"After the accident, I had to get my life together."
And what about my damn life?
It took me two years to get back on my feet.
You were the only thing that kept me going.
"Kaman, what happened to you?"
What do you think happened to me?
[Boy] Mommy?
Who else is here?
"Mommy, what's wrong?"
[Woman] That's my sister's son.
"Uh, go back upstairs, baby."
- Go back upstairs.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
"He said ""Mama."""
"The boy's confused, Kaman."
Is that your son?
"[Tracy] No, Kaman."
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
"Kaman, drop it."
"You shoot me, I drop this, and they burn."
Then what?
"You move, you die."
For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?
March.
I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
(TIRES SCREECH)
Excuse me.
Suri.
(SIGHS) DI Orwell's here.
Why?
Our new chief called him in when you didn't answer any of my calls.
That's grand.
"Listen, Harry."
I deleted your text from his phone before Orwell got here.
- What?
- Harry!
You look like shit.
What were you up to last night?
Getting lucky.
We think this is Freddie Lau.
Owner of the London Green Dragon Casino.
DI Clayton knows who he is.
"Come on, Ben, let's give Harry some room, shall we?"
"- Do you want some notes, Chohan?"
- Sure.
I need a laugh.
- HARRY:
Strangled?
- Yeah.
Lau's PIN was one-two-three-four.
"Why are you texting a dead man, Harry?"
This is not going to affect our investigation.
- No.
That's not good enough.
"- You have to trust me on this, Suri."
"Jesus, Harry, we can't investigate a murder if you're considered a suspect."
You know I'm not a suspect.
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"
- I told you I wanted to go.
So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
I am king.
IMANDINKA GROWLSI
Do you realize that you came this close to hitting me out there?
"Gosh, Ed."
I'm sorry.
"-I'm really miffed, Alan."
-My mind wasn't on it.
I was thinking about that Donahue Show I gotta do tomorrow.
He's ruthless.
Ed.
Ed....
BILLIE:
"No, I don't want-"
- No--
-Just look at him.
"When they dragged him out, his face looked like a pizza."
"Come on, come on, he's right over here."
"Look at him, he's fine."
Hi. toots.
-Hey. you're not allowed in here.
-We've got passes.
-We're looking for Bull Shannon.
-Who?
He's a big guy.
Kind of weird-looking.
"All right, let's have your attention."
"Gents and ladies, meet the next wrestling champion of the world."
IWHININGI Hey. you promised me I'd be champ next.
"Don't get bitchy, Ed."
[NORMAL VOICE] I'm sorry.
I've been on the edge lately.
This new fabric softener isn't working out at all.
Now he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"
Angie W.
"[CHUCKLES] Angie W., Tricia S., Tony D."
Don't any of you people have any last names?
"Look, I heard the gunshot,"
"I saw the fire, just like a hundred other people, all right?"
Can I go now?
"Yeah, yeah, you can go."
"Hey, but first, uh..."
"Can I bum a smoke, please?"
[LAUGHS] Sure.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"All right, here."
Right.
Having a rough time?
"Nasty, nasty habit."
I'm handling it.
That's what they all say.
"Seriously, I'm just down to one a day, a pack a month, tops."
Really.
"And, um, how many more do you bum?"
"A few, and you must be Clara B., right?"
Clara Barton?
No.
Monica.
Let's go.
Hail Mahadev!
Look.
I've already been punished for my crimes.
Let's end this enmity.
For that one needs to kill the enemy.
Understand!
Go on.
Kill him!
Catch him.
No matter what color you paint on black... it'll still remain black.

He's already slipped out of our hands.
And now he's out of Satyakant Shashtri's life too.

Listen carefully.
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.
And you.
Satyakant.
Get out of here.

You're dead!

How can someone like you be sulking?
Thank God.

What's up bro?
"A busy day, huh?"
How is your aunt Shukran?
I want to visit heragain but she neverpicks up the phone.
She is still looking for a job.
I told her.
She could work here.
She can't...
Her new boyfriend is overly jealous.
Anyway...

Don't be late.
I hold yourroom free the whole day.

Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know.
A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."

You don't have to say anything.
"Well, let me--let me-- l did this to you."
"And if nothing else comes of this, at least you can finally hear me say how sorry I am."
"I'm--l'm really sorry, honey."

"Whoa, Annie!"
Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie?
They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?

The proper thing to do would be to finish him off quick.
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.

Pulling through?
You saw what that grizz did to him.
He'll be dead inside an hour.
Mmm-hmm.
"Yeah, we all will be if he don't quit wailing like that."

I'll hold him.

Now I'm going to do you a damn bad one.
"I'm giving you a field commission, Sharpe."
- We can't lose him.
My husband's a good man.
You can't do this.
George is gonna die.
They see this is a con.
- They're gonna kill him.
- We got to go.
It's not just him at risk.
It's you too.
"And, by the way, the FBI, so let's get real here."
I'm not going to give up on my husband.
"Salt, at the end of the day, you're a Federal Agent."
"We do not negotiate with terrorists, and I'm sorry, but you know that."

It's time to move.

I'm going to go get George myself.
"Salt, stop."
Think about what you're doing.

"Remember, the one with the braid?"
--Why did she give you the booze?
--What?
For soap?
--What else?
!
And you kept it for 40 years?
"Bobylev, have some tact."
"No, just remembered it this morning."
Saw your daddy-o and remembered.
Like father like son.

Here you go.
Go buy yourself some soap.

See that?
Childhood friend.
Let's go.
And this one... get acquainted...
"--Pavel, I was just..."
"--This is Dina, a friend of the family"
--Hello --Come this way please --Pavlik!
This is Elena Kirilovna.
You probably don't know her.
"Stay in there, snowqueen."
"Take rest, snake."
These 2 dames try to get rid of me by sending me to shrinks
--Looky here!
"--Pavel, what shrinks"
"This turkey, professor Sklyansky him you know."

- Dinner for the boy.
"- Yeah, come in."
I can't tell you how beautifully your wife sings.
"- Pretty good, isn't she?"
"- 0h, she's marvellous."
Too bad it was interrupted.
I've had that same feeling myself many times.
"Well, everything's fine."
The manager has a babysitter for us.
Good.
Permit me the pleasure of serving you a drink.
I would love it.
Thank you.
"Were you on the American stage, Mrs McKenna?"
"Yes, Mr Bernard, I was on the American stage and the London stage and the Paris stage."
[engine starts]
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"[Rocky] hey, wait for me."
"[dazzler] come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
- [door shuts]
- I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, yo-yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
[laughs] this bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby...died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
And dead is dead.
I have to sit down.
Stan?
The fair Eleanor.
Truth.
Who do you think should take the test next?
No one.
No one should.
"You have to choose a friend, or take the test yourself."
- Who're you gonna choose?
- Fuck you!
5 seconds... 4... 3... 2...
Chris!
- I'm so sorry.
"- Now that wasn't so hard, was it?"
Sorry.
I need a drink.
Luke... please.
Look in the drawer of the workbench.
Find something you can use as a weapon.
"Something small enough to hide, a s-screwdriver maybe."
- He's too fast.
"- No, no...not when he spins the bottle."
"When he spins the bottles, he's distracted."
"If you can get his gun, this is all over"
"I don't know, mate."
"He's going to kill us, Luke."
"And when he's killed us, he'll kill you."
Didja get that?
He'll kill you.
Chris... shall we?
It was me.
I sent the postcard.
I confess.
You were in Spain.

Squirrel boy.
Hogarth.
"By night, known as Hogarth."
Got it.
"Well, come on inside, kid."
Sorry about the crowbar.
You'd be surprised how many people wanna steal scrap.
"But, man, once I turn it into art, I can't give it away."
"I mean, what am I?"
A junkman who sells art or an artist who sells junk?
You tell me.
HOGARTH:
I like it...
I think.
"Listen, you're, you're not gonna call my mom, are you?"
She doesn't know I'm out.
I...

Pretty sure. landlord says the guy is a loner .
This happen tomorrow.
Can you handle it?
Of course we can handle it.
You got the specs' ?
Now we good ?
"Yea , we're good."
"Come on, Daze."
Do you gals know about Barbie Sunday's new dress ?
"Yea, we know."
Just checking.
Daze !
Yea ?
Happy Birthday!
"Thanks , Russ."
"If you keep an eye on your partner, you might be around to see her next one."
"Fuck off, Russ!"
Ask her about Rose.
I said :
"Fuck off, Russ!"
Who's Rose?
My old partner.
I thought I was your only ...
"Sorry, Daze ."
"Well, what happened to her?"
She died.
How?
Got shot.
How?
Wait here.
I'm going to go get the old man.
"Jimmy, don't go."
I was wrong.
I thought you were my friend.
"Ciao, Jimmy!"
"Hey, I'm here to see Maria, Maria Concetta."
- Jimmy?
"- We'll talk later, alright?"
- Don't go.
- Jimmy.
Relax Captain.
Get in line like everybody else...
- What are you waiting for?
"- The virgin of Naples, isn't it?"
Bullshit!
I hear she even does it with horses.
- How was it?
- Save your money.
Put it into war bonds.
I'd stick it anywhere if I could just find a hole.
"My god, all the quim that isn't being used... and you keep jacking off."
"Confucius says: ""Pussy everyday gets old""."
Go to hell!
"Out, out, out."
Let's go!
"A dollar each, a dollar..."
"Enough, enough!"
Relax...
You want to screw her?
Impossible.
You want to be with her?
What's up?
I'll get the car.
I'll see if I can reach it.
I'm almost touching the water.
Careful!
Are you okay?
"I got it, pull me up!"
Estrella was wearing hose like those.
Freeze!
Stop!
Why are you running?
- I don't have a permit.
- What is that?
- A baby deer?
- Roebuck.
- Where are you from?
- The town.
Get up.
- What's your name?
- Jesus.
"You and I met the other night at the fair, remember?"
My head still hurts from the gin.
- How did you get here?
- I walked.
- It's along walk.
- Not if you know the trails.
See anyone go in or out of the farmhouse?
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?
- How much do you get for Bambi?
- 250 pesetas a kilo.
"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?
A widow?
Right!
Must be somebody famous.
Name's Obediah Jackson.
"Chris, let me see that."
"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.
[chattering ]
"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.
- Are you crazy?
"- Save the lecture, look..."
Damn it.
I remember them.
From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
"- You know, mooning about."
"Daydreaming, singing to herself."
"You haven't noticed, hmm?"
"Oh, well, I..."
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
[Gulps] Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
"- In love, hmm?"
"[Whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!"
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans?
What about humans?
Humans?
[chuckles nervously]
Who said anything about humans?
[yelps]
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
You'll see.
It's a surprise.
"Oh, Flounder."
"Flounder, you're the best!"
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
"[Giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?"
"Oh, this is all so... so sudden."
"- Ha ha, idiot."
This person must be mute.
"Saa, who knows."
I'm just too ignorant.
"Hey, you guys are noisy."
Na?
What did you say chibi?
The one you were talking about just now was the Eastern grip.
Eastern grip?
It's really common just for people like you.
Did you said something wrong?
How old are you?
- Junior High student?
- Middle School student?
Looks like you know a lot.
Get off the next stop.
Mada mada da ne.
Who's that?
Good afternoon!
Thanks for the hard work!
Oi chibi.
We are not recruiting.
Wait chibi.
What is your name?
I'm asking you for your name.
Could it be you are that transfer student named Echi something?
Answer me.
Echizen Ryoma.
So it is.
The prodigy from America.
Show me what you've got.
And you are?
I can fly?
"-Erik, please."
-The boy seeks the larger truth.
"If you want, must desire."
"If you wish, all you want is yours."
"Now, go."
Bye!
Bye!
Son.
Erik.
"You know, when everything goes wrong running away is not the solution."
Okay.
Need to find itself a way to solve.
-Right.
-All right.
And we are all different part of life to know who is and what their gifts.
You can not dance or fly but when you discover is all yours.
Got it?
"Yes, that's okay."
Great.
"-Will, what is this?"
It's the wave of change.
"The world is changing, Bill."
We have to get in on.
"My god, can not be."
Something somewhere gave the greatest hustle.
Something hit the land of the emperors.
"Come on, children."
Let's push the pace.
"-It's our time, Bill."
-Right.
"Swimming-and-death, my friend."
–Yeah.
Over here.
"While I was checking the bathroom, this tile fell off."
It looks directly into Kayla's bathroom.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, God."
We got to get an A.P.B out on their car.
Jesus.
–You okay?
–Better than you.
"Looks like I taught you my last lesson, huh?"
Don't end up like me.
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.
Going after that guy was the right thing to do.
"–Hell, I got you shot."
–I always knew there was a bullet with my name on it.
And guess what?
I'm still here.
So are you.
"Hey, you really ought to get in there and see him."
Yeah.
Me and Vic aren't really talkin' right now.
He'd want to see you.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
"Hey, what the hell is going on?"
"We found the peephole, Bob."
–What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
–Step away!
–It's clean.
–Pop it.
You aren't so special- He's fed up with all of us-.
I have to talk to my son.
"Say ""Daddy"", Yarivi."
"Yarivi, say ""Daddy."""
"""Daddy-""."
"He's a night owl, like me."
What?
Who's a cutie?
Who's a cutie?
Who's beautiful?
Why don't you bring him here?
He's growing up in exile.
- He's with his mom in Budapest.
"- Where's Budapest, in the Negev?"
"She's in school there, pest."
If you married her she wouldn't have left.
But like an idiot you told her you're bi.
- 'Cause I'm not a liar.
"- ""Bi"" my ass"
There's no such thing as bi.
"What is it, a bivalve?"
"What are you, an oyster?"
Go ahead and laugh.
Budapest...
Everyone there is anti-Semitic.
- They closed them.
- Closed what?
"The concentration camps, didn't you hear?"
"Just you wait, what was, shall be again and there's nothing new under the sun."
- Hello.
- Hello.
Your dad sent this.
You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.

That's it.
Not many.
I'm not sure whether I want the doctor to come or not.
"I am sorry, doc."
I...
I died.
I broke my promise.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I will take full responsibility for this.
This boy is gonna die!
Let's do it.
It's a great story.
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- I need supplies.
- I need a portable defibrillator.
- I got a spare.
- You're taking a hell of a chance.
- Damn right!
Let's go!
Hold it right there.
Here we go.
"One, two, three."
There's no room in here.
Give me the camera.
- All set.
- Get a minicam van and meet me at County.
"Here, here."
Close the door.
Let's go!
Patch your headsets back to the station.
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.
- You're filming this?
- We're live from Chopper Five with Dr....
"- What's your name, doctor?"
- Doug Ross.
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued a boy from a storm drain.
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
-Whoa Anthony--
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.
OK.
"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
What?
-I'm sorry.
-What did you say?
"I will not kill you, son."
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
I...
I'm losing my mind.
It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."
Me?
"I just take, take, take."
So I have to take this.
Just...
Don't start crying.
Okay?
And don't kill yourself.
- Hey.
- Have you met her yet?
- Who?
- Audrey.
Your date.
Do you usually meet them first?
"Grace, if you want me to call this off..."
No.
I'm just curious.
"Sometimes I meet them, sometimes I don't."
Just seems so strange.
- Stronger.
- What?
[Scoffs] Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those.
Where'd you get those?
Will it show up on the test?
Will these narcotics show up on a drug test?
- Hey.
- What?
"Seriously, why don't we do this more often?"
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
[Knock on door]
"Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors."
They're early.
My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined.
You had a lot of these growing up?
How do you think I put myself through med school?
[Laughs]
"Come on, aunt Hallie."
It starts in five minutes.
"Uh-oh, what do we have here?"
VIP guests for the parade?
- Aunt Hallie!
- Hey.
"- Hey, Viv."
Hey.
- How ya doing?
- Can't complain.
- Good?
"- How's, um--how's your mom?"
- Viv.
"No, it's fine."
Put me down.
Put me down!
Henry.
"They underestimate you, okay?"
Let them get close and then engage.
Engage!
No.
Henry!
Fight back!
Come on!
"No, stop it!"
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- Stop it!
- Estelle...
No!
"You're a fucking rabbit in the headlights, aren't you?"
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?
Ten minutes.
Hagman.
Perkins!
Cheeky bastard!
"- Which one, Cooper?"
"- Left, three o'clock."
That'll teach him.
"Sant'lago, saint of Spain, stand with the Chosen Men."
Sant'lago
- That's my boy!
"- Ha, ha!"
St James!
ALL St James!
De L'Eclin.
No shooting!
He's mine!
Who fired that?
"Me, sir."
"Give him yours, Harper."
"Chosen Man, Perkins."
"Take a tip, Perkins."
Give it back.
"Under Major Hogan's orders, I held Torrecastro long enough to effect an uprising."
I deemed my duty done and thought it prudent to return to await further orders sir
"You did damn well, Sharpe."
Napoleon will be in a fearful rage about Torrecastro.
Heads will roll.
Morale will suffer.
Which is all to the good.
"Because next month, I mean to cross into Spain and give Marshal Victor a damn good thrashing."
Pity about James Rothschild.
I presume
What do you want me to do?
"If you kill them,"
Boss will reward you handsomely.
"Before I do so,"
I want to get my hands on So Seo-No that wrectch.
"As you wish, Commander,"
I just want to get rid of them.
"Then I'll leave this to you, Commander."
Have a safe trip.
-Let's go.
-Yes.
Are we really going to kill them?
"If what he said is true, if he really is a Prince of BuYeo"
We'll get into deep trouble.
Capturing So Seo-No is our first priority.
"Han-Dang that rascal, I'm going to kill him."
Really?
Is that true?
"Yes, it is."
"Besides Ju-Mong, we have Oh-Yi, Ma-Ri, and Hyeop-Bo too."
We might even have a chance of nabbing So Seo-No.
I'm...
I'm...going to be rich!
"Eh wait, why am I still sitting here?"
I'm off to tell Prince Young-Po the good news.
-Han-Dang...
-Yes.
I got it.
Your Highness...
Yeo Mi-Eul!
Yeo Mi-Eul!
What are you standing around for?
Shut up!
"- Siempre soy amigo, siempre del cártel."
- Shut up!
Shut up!
"All right, just speak English."
Lalo didn't send you?
No Lalo?
- Who?
- Thank God!

I thought..
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
Anything!
Just tell me
- what you need.

You should have taken it!
Wait a minute.

The uncle.
That was your guy?
"No offense, guys, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
- No.
"That offer's expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
Not what I'm saying.
And I'm sorry that I said that about Anna-Kat.
And I'm sorry that I missed so many things when you were younger.
- Mm.
"- You know, like that weird, um, break-dancing thing."
- Mm-hmm.
- It was always so important to you.
"Well, it's never too late, Mom."
Okay?
Okay.
Unh!
Unh-unh!
Unh!
Wow.
Mm-mm-mm!
That's something.
"All right, why don't you help me get out of this thing, and then we can go downstairs and enjoy ourselves before Viv's happy pills wear off?"
"I mean, where did you get this thing?"
"Oh, I visited Ruth Jackson in the home."
- Mm-hmm.
- And this was in her closet.
- Mm.
- That woman doesn't have a clue.
- No.
"- Half the time, she goes to lunch nude."
Thank you for your gift earlier.
- Oh!
- It did the job.
I've got gobs of them.
I'm really glad you came.
Wow.
These pills are powerful.
An error ..
"Lord, you mistake."
I was in the bathroom.
There I got the message.
What message?
"""Do not let your life."""
He said that he killed if it does not do what it says.

He killed my mother.
I killed them all.

Let it be.
Seriously?

Sure?

Bad guys don't turn that down.
Okay?

What are you doing?
Watching my girlfriend.
I got some bad news.
Your girlfriend's marrying that creepy old dude.
That's just her Dad.

Not like that.

You're a coward!
Admit it!
Wake up!
You fool!
"Don't turn around, I told you."
What if I do?
You wanna bite me?
"Of course I won't bite you, but if you don't leave in 5 minutes, you're done!"
Because the car's going to explode.
You think I'm a fool?
Can't I get out in 5 minutes?
"Oh no, not 5 minutes, but 5 seconds!"
5 seconds?
Counting now...!
"5, 4..."

"Scared you, didn't I?"
Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?
- What kind of joke was that?

- I know I switched it off.
Maybe he did something while I was out of the room.
An oversight.
Won't happen again.
The incoming signal must have interfered with the upload sequence.
Every synapse in his brain lit up at once.
Then went dead.

You said he shouted something.

Why are you here?
Do I have a reply?
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.
About everything.
What do you talk with Luisa?

But it's not the same.
Why not?
See you then.

What is this?
"-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?"
"-Oh, my God."
Are you kidding?
-What?
-Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Of course I like him.
"I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one."
You don't like him like Daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.
In an ambulance.

Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

Why did you let one of DI Orwell's stooges in on this?

"Oh, he's a good cop, apparently."
It's just a shame that Orwell got him.
- How do you ever know?
- Know what?
- If someone's right for you?
- I don't know why you're asking me.
"I, er, suppose you just do."
"But when you do, make sure you hold onto it."
- Approaching now.

"Go, go, go."
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
"- Ben, are you hit?"
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."
- With what?
- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?

- Hey...
I want the answer.
- Sir...
He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
"When everyone started hitting him, he escaped."
"If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name..."
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
"No idea, Sir."
The guy who was working at Beach Walk restaurant.
His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?
"I don't know, Sir."
He should be somewhere around.
Thanks.

Please throw the ball.
I just said sorry.

They came searching for you.

"You know, something about me being too into myself."
You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"
"I need a good woman, Muffin Man."
"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?
- I don't know.
- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait.
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!

Are you okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."
"Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out."
"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."
"Blair, just go find a signal, okay."
"We gotta go, we gotta go."
We'll be back.
- Nitrous?
"- Yes, please."
No.
More booze for me.
Seems all right?
"""Seems"" being the operative word, mate."
This will cheer you up.
"Shame Felix can't be here, he's always talking about you guys."
Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.
- She isn't house-trained.
"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
What?
That woman...
What woman?
The one whose house burned down...
I knew I'd seen her before.
It's that naked woman from last night.
What?
The woman who was standing here last night.
Crazy fools.
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.
All three of them?
Yeah.
"Freaked the hell out of me, too."
Prime suspect is the missus who hung herself.
What the heck happened?
Beats me.
Over here.
In here.
What?
Give us a hand.
A little more.

Idiot!
Don't touch it with your bare hands!

"It's up to you now, Jefferson."
"Gray, listen."
"If we're going to do this, we got to do it together."
"It's going to take the two of us, all right?"
- You're right.
- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."
Damn it!
I wanted to be the one to kill him.
"Again, I mean."
Um...
I don't think our problems are over yet.
I'm on it.
On what?
It's not working.
The radiation buildup is too progressive.
I got this.
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Uh...

Not so much.
Stop crying and tell me what you want.
I want to listen to Macarena!
There's going to be music here soon.
Their music?
Yuck!
I want Macarena!
"Sing the song you sang the other day, aunty."
Not today.
I have an irritation in my throat today.
No one sings a song when we assemble for it!
Yes.
Some can't sing and some have a bad throat.
Sharma!
You can't even speak!
How will you sing?
"You sing a song, aunty."
Yes.
"Sing for us, Laxmi."
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?
"Explain the meaning of the song to us, Laxmi."
Very well.
It was fun...
I see you wearing that for the first time.
You look great.
"Is it only for today, or..."
"Don't get excited, aunt."
What's a matrimonial necklace with so many others?

I would have if you had cooperated.
What else you want to do?
Choose the material.
I'll take the piece on your hand.
Cut it.
I know you're the Demon Tailor!
Why do you want to kill me?
My Big Brother Tam King is angry with you.
Can you tell Mr. Tam?
"I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!"
Master!

It's difficult to clean.
How the hell is this a surprise?
This is the most cliche thing in the world.

Shit!
What the hell!

"This is a person's life, not some pig, dog, or chicken!"
You shouldn't be a doctor!
Go do something else!
"Please calm down, sir."
Calm down please.
Doc.
Here a New Year's present for you.
Last time you didn't come.
So I'm giving it to you now.

Sail ho!
"Deck, there!"
"Large sail, two points forward of the larboard beam!"
- What is she?
Can you tell?
"- She's a frigate, sir."
"Hear that, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
A single frigate.
- Beat to quarters.
"- Aye, aye."
Beat to quarters!
They think it's a safe road.
We'll run with her.

"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.

I-I--
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable... even foryou."
"Ofcourse, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter ofthe great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange... for someone even better.
"- Eric, what are you doing?"
"- Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!

We walked into school life.
Sometimes I think your mind is its own.
"Tell me, what is beyond the school?"
More-school.
-And then.
"There is nothing beyond the school, a school are endless."
Everything has an end.
"See, I'm here."
And it's not a happy ending.
"It makes sense, Bill."
If I swim to the opposite of the school end up coming ...
At the end of the world.
Very well.

You just missed her.
- Daze?
- She just left.
Who?
Rose.
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.
But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."
I keep missing my flights.
What's that?
"Oh, that?"
That's his.
The guy's.
What do you mean?
There's something very strange about him.
"God, I don't know how to explain it."
At first I thought it was just a crush.
But...
I think that Mikey's in love with me.
He's only nine years old.
"He's not normal nine-year-old, Rachel!"
"Jessie, you're upset."
You've had a huge shock.
Rachel!
"Would you listen to me, please?"
- Mikey said stuff.
- What stuff?
That David was being punished for killing Rosie and that now I could love only him.
I think that he killed David.
Jessie--
"Rachel, listen to me!"
Your son is dangerous!
"If there's something wrong with Mikey,"
Neil and I will deal with it.
RACHEL:
I know we have to talk with Mikey.
We'll decide what to do then.
"I'm sorry, Jessie."

A lawyer?

Can you raise your voice?

It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
It's quite a nice old place.
At least the roof doesn't leak.

"You can't blame her, can you?"
That's the soup gone up.

"I'm Mario De Santis, and he's De Santis, Mario!"
"Wretch, then it is true!"

Someone else could not.

- He has an Arab accent.
- Cut it out.
- Why are you pushing?
I'm fed up!
"Mom had an Arab accent, too."
"She came from Algeria, not some kibbutz in Sweden."
So what?
So she's an Arab and he's an Arab and so are you.
- Are you cursing me?
- Yes.
"And I'm an Arab and he's an Arab and we're all Arabs, okay?"
Now lay off.

She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."
I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."
good bye.
Has her period come yet?
Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Tell us what happened.
"Joe was coming on to me, and I told him no."
And Officer Taggot told him to get lost.
And all hell broke loose.
So who started the fight?
Joe...
I think.
Maybe it was Bobby.
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
"Did Officer Taggot hit you or shove you at any time, even by accident?"
No.
No way.
It wasn't him.
How could you be so sure if it all happened so fast?
"'Cause Roy would never, never..."
Valerie?
"Okay, Valerie?"
Valerie.
Going down is much faster.

- Just a tad.
I'm scared of heights.

"Please, you have to leave."
"You broke your arm, Georgie."
Is it true you did it trick riding?
Or was it broken some other way?
You think I'm abused?
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?
"Look, I know how the game goes."
"You people are always trying to put words in my mouth, trying to make me say things I don't mean."
"Now, that's not true."
I want you to feel you can tell me things.
You're in a safe place...
I'm not abused.
"Okay, I broke my arm when I was doing a trick riding routine for my aunt Crystal."
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been doing it with her alone.
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.
Stop.
What's wrong?
Stop.
"I don't want to hear any more of it, and put that back where you found it."
Why?
What's... what's wrong?
"You okay there, Duval?"
You said that I could do this.
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
"Just because you don't talk about him, doesn't mean that no one else can."
I'm your father and I told you to put it away!
So put that thing away now!

I know.
That was wrong.
I know.
I'll apologize to Gracie in a minute.

"If Dad came back, right now..."
What would you say to him?
"Oh, my god."
It's happening.
"It's finally happening, isn't it?"
What?
What's happening?
"Well, you're letting in that Dad is gone."
He's gone.
He's not coming back.

"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.

"Oh, yes."

"Oh, I am so happy to welcome you."
You said so.
"He gives that appearance, yes."
"But in disturbances of this sort, we can't always be sure."
"No, I'm afraid John has to stay here."
But he can't.

You will bring Ankita back home... sooner than Shivani's mother's eager to die.
Okay sir.

"Because I was kind of black you could dump me, what the hell."

"Dale, where are you at?"
"Hey, June."
Juney!
How are you doing?
You got something for me?
"Hi, Mr. Charlie."
Is this Ronnie?
"Ronnie, this is Ray."
Is Fantasia there?
"Yeah, Lila."
Where is she?
Have you got a number out there for her?
"Give it to me, all right?"
Ronnie!
"Ronnie, come here."
-Come here.
-I got to go.
"If you know something about Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen."
I don't want you being in trouble.
"No, ma'am."
I don't know nothing about that.
June Hawkins told me he was out last night digging frogs.
"Oh, really?"
- For who?
- Us.
"Good one, dangerous one in the Backstreet Boys."
Hey.
I could not believe you guys are here.
"When I was a kid, I humped all of your posters."
"Wow, really?"
Which one of us was your favourite?
OK.
OK.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
- Hey.
- These are my friends!
Anyway.
"Yeah, good one."
Almost beard to beard.
Nice.
No.
Justin actually wrote us a letter asking for a simple favor.
So...
"- Yeah, you're on, buddy."
"- Don't blow it, dude."
I won't.
Are all the Backstreet boys taking a poo together?
"Uh, Candace I, I believe that when you meet the person that you're supposed to of your life with, you shouldn't wait around."
You should just know it and go for it.
So with that said...
Holy crap balls!
"- Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
- I love you.
But it's not good.
There you are.
I had a dream about you.
Yeah?
Hope a good one.
"There was some kind of... disaster... nuclear, maybe, I don't know."
[muttering]
Seemed like the whole world was burned.
And I was looking for you.
"I couldn't find you, and I was..."
I was calling your name.
So not a good one.
You've been working too hard.
So why don't we stay in bed all day?
Order some food in.
Watch movies.
What?
What is it?
It's Sunday.
Yeah.
I know what day it is.
"Yeah, it's Marius' deadline."
Yeah.
"I know that, too."
"If you ruin Eddie's hands, you'll never get a chance to expose Mukherjee."
So you want me to give Eddie a pass.
Yeah.
"Hey, tell me something."
Yeah.
"I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."
Of course.
Do you still care about Marius?
That's what I'm thinking.
How did this happen?
"Last week, they're asking me to run the network, and tomorrow, I'm gonna be blowing guys just to get a job."
Figuratively.
Of course.
"For the record, I've never blown anyone for a job."
Impressive!
Mm-hmm.
"Oh, wait."
There we go.
"When I first started out,"
I gave a handjob to the head of development at nickelodeon.
Nickelodeon?
!
He was an adult.
"It's for kids, not run by kids."
Oh.
Right.
I suddenly had an image.
"Yeah, like I'd Jack off some 12-year-old for a job."
I really don't think I would.
Good.
Unless it was like some amazing...
Stop talking.
"Yeah, okay."
Good morning.
Hey.
How was the weekend?
All right.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Bullshit.
It's OK.
I am still worried about you.
More than ever.
"Sorry, mom is calling."
"Mom, I'm in Istanbul..."
it's been six months.
I don't know.
"Mom, I'll try to."
"Sure, I am doing fine."
Coffee?
What coffee?
"Oh, I see dad wants some coffee."
"Mom, I have to go now."
Clients...
Bye mom.
"Watch out, God damn it!"
How many have you broken so far.
Enough with your morning tempers.
"Get away from me, you asshole!"
"Auntie, what do you find in that animal?"
That's exactly what I like in him:
The animal in my bed.
Take down those pictures.
I'm sure they drive him crazy.
"Well, he hates me anyway."
He can fuck off...
I'll kick him out soon.
Is this forthe rent?
It's been 9 months and I still don't have a job...
Cavit still asks about you...
"Oh, he is disgusting!"
I wish our motel was still open.

"- Well, I'll see that she gets it."
"- Uh-uh, uh-uh."
Ha-ha.
"No, I think she'd like me to have it."
[BUZZES]
What is it?
"Yeah, you're the doll."
You dropped this in the Randolph Hotel.
"- I tried to catch you, but you were too fast."
"- Oh, thank you."
I didn't miss it until I got home.
I wondered where I lost it.
"Won't you, uh, come in a minute?"
[CHUCKLES]
Who could say no?
"Oh, it's all there."
All I wanted was the card.
I didn't mean it that way.
"I was looking for a reward for you, but I'm afraid I haven't got enough."
- You've reached the voice mail...
"- Em, pick up the phone."
Can't tell where it's coming from.

Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
Previously on Alcatraz...
Meet the '63s.
The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back.
My grandfather wasn't a guard.
He was an inmate.
That's him.
"Tommy Madsen, he killed my partner."
Police.
So we have to find these '63s?
We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know, they're not so bad."
"Lucy, get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr. Sengupta.
"Thank you, Warden James."
"I don't know, Hauser."
Maybe the pirate life ain't for you.
No.
You want some ice?
"No, no, no, no, no."
But she was something special to me.
"I mean, everybody felt that, but she was."
"I wouldn't be won'th a damn today, if it wasrt for her."
And it was more than that.
She was my friend.
Hey.
"Take it easy, Ward..."
"Exactly what time did it happen, Lieutenant?"
"Last night, sir."
About ten minutes to nine.
Ten minutes to nine.
God knows what I was doing when she could have used my help.
"Alone in my room, probably, with some idiot script."
"You were not, you were watching the ballgame with me."
I was?
A ballgame?
(SCOFFS)
"Oh, God."
I hope I wasrt.
I was alone.
I hope I wasrt...
But you werert alone.
"Listen, Lieutenant, he's upset."
"He's nervous, you know?"
And he...
"Mark, for God's sakes!"
Will you stop it!
This isn't one of my shows!
This actually happened.
You knew he's gonna be here.
He's probably didn't expect me!
She alright?
Avoiding Hilliard...unfortunate experience.
Carnal?
What!

No!
"Oh, that!"

Oh!
I shouldn't worry about that.

"Ah, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce you now... to a young man, to whom we all owe a great deal."

Hi.
Hello.
Mr.Hilliard?
I've forgotten right...
Mr.Ambrose Hilliard.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!
Jeon Hyo-jin
You're getting all wet!

Guess the other one sunk to the bottom.

"What is it, Melvin?"
Hmm?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
It's not like you've never seen this sort of thing before.
It's just that she's so young.

You are their son.
"What you are doing is wrong, wrong, wrong!"
Do you mind?
You're killing the romance in here.
"Well, it was a grueling two weeks, but you have your son back."
Ooh.
Mom.
Dad.
I missed you.
Aww!

Is all TV this wonderful?
"Um, I'd kind of like to go home now."
Like a hog!
I-
- What?
What was that?
"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful... but I want to go home to my family."
[ Sighs ] I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this... but I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back.
[ Stilted Speech ] I do not miss Bart at all.
"Quiet with those hands, If you are better than I,"
"Eh, is passing something here."
We are going to see.
"It quiets about that purse,"
"I have not made anything, Help,"
Sight as it beats.
Has done me one trap?
you do not understand it?
Help.
"You wanted to deceive to me, eh?"
displeased!
"They see here, pig."
For already with that purse.
"Wretches, you are not going to help me?"
And you also.
And you.
Displeased.

"Damn bastard, children of puta."
Children of grandísima puta.
I am going to kill them.
-You have seen what they have done to me?
-What have they done to you?
You know them?
Abduct the mandible.

- Don't move.
- V-tach.
"- All right, I'm in."
"Let go, Gallant."

- Clear.
- Sinus rhythm.
"- Okay, full trauma panel."
"C- spine, chest and pelvis."
"Gallant, why don't you go get yourself some air?"
Want a facial CT?
"Yeah, good idea."
Why don't we get a full head series?
Call RT.
Let's get a vent.
"Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav."
"Nice work, John."
Bet that was a new one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Look, I'm sorry."
I just thought I was gonna be sick.
It's better if you keep your head down.
It'll be okay.
"It just caught me by surprise, you know?"
Relax.
Take a minute.
"You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this."
-Oh!
Alice!
Isn't he a darling?
"- Oh, he's the most adorable thing I've ever seen. -(giggles) l-ls it all right if I pick him up?"
"Oh, sure, go ahead."
"Oh, I've never felt anything so cuddly in my whole life."
- Where'd you get him?
"-Well, Mrs. Manicotti went to the pound today to get a dog for her kids,"
-Mm-hmm.
So I went along with her.
I took one look at this character and I was a goner.
Did you ever see such eyes?
What kind of a dog is he?
"Well, he's a cross between a cocker spaniel"
-and a French poodle.
-Mm.
It's a...
"I guess you'd call it a ""cockerpoodle."""
Mm-hmm.
(cooing)
"Aw, Trixie, you'd better put him back in the box,"
-'cause I got to feed him now.
-All right.
There.
"Get a look at that, ""choice horse meat."""
- Horse meat?
-Uh-huh.
- Ew!
"-Oh, they must know what they're doing, Trix, 'cause the dogs are nuts about it."
Ah.
Is that gonna be enough for him?
"Oh, sure."
Are you gonna call me?
I'll call you.
"Unlock the door, Jenna."
I'm packing.
Come back later.
The house will be empty.
No.
You have to come talk to me.
Things are not going to end like this.
- Like I did this.
Move your foot.
- I panicked.
I made a huge mistake.
Fuck!
"Jenna, open the door!"
Michael?
- Is anything wrong?
- Everything's fine.
I locked myself out.
"- Jenna, you're having our baby!"
"- Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!"
"Don't you ever say that, Jenna."
Don't ever say anything like that ever again!
I can do whatever the hell I want.
"We're not married, remember?"
"- We're both free, just like you wanted."
- I made a mistake.
You're right.
"Too late, man."
Move your goddamn foot.
Hi.
"Hi, darling."
Okay.
"Thank you, Brian."
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.
My God.
Here you are.
We were just making sure there was adequate closet space.
Good.
"Well, this house is yours if you want it... but you have to decide right now."
We'll take it.
-Really?
"Oh, my God!"
You know what I kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
That we should get a mattress for that closet.
I kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true.
Come here.
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.
Let's see.
Okay.
"- We bought a really, really..."
- Excuse me.
We bought a house.
We bought a big house.
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
¡Mary!
"Mary, are you all right?"
"Mary, talk to me."
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
We can wear as many rings as we want on our fingers.
But women wear only one matrimonial necklace around their neck.
Laxi!
You're not in the mood!
But that's all right.
I'll await your answer.
And I'll wait for my husband!
...my God!
Aunty!
Here comes the detective for you!
"Hey, wait...!"
I've got to follow the woman!
Not the vehicle!
Watch where you're going!
Mister... does the dog bite?
No.
Out of my way...!
You said it wouldn't bite!
It's not my dog.
Laxmi!
Haribhai?

"Don't call me ""bhai"" (brother)!"
Anything else will do!
All right.
I have something important to say to you.
Of course.
Come inside...
No.
Keep walking...
"You gave me a rose, right?"
Did I?
Can't get better than that nοw.

"Fuck me, it's Τrudy."
"- Oh, Τrudy!"
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure.
Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."
- Mac Keefer?
"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
"- That's soft, eh?"
- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What?
The hundred grand?
"- Plus, he won the Civil War."
- What about Leo?
- What'd I do?
- As running mate.
Bartlet-McGarry.
- Done.
"- It's not absurd, you know."
- It is.
- It's not totally absurd.
"- Yes, it is."
- He wants your parking space.
- I really do.
- It's not totally absurd.
You have a good parking space.
"You know, if it weren't for the drinking and the Valium... ."
"- Yet, Grant... ."
- That's right.
"They told Lincoln, ""Grant's a drunk."" He said:"
"""Send my generals a case of what he drinks."""
- I see a 30-second spot.
- An alcoholic can't be vice president?
You really think the 20th century didn't see an alcoholic in the West Wing?
I'll be around.
"Hey, Leo."
- They didn't mean anything.
"- Yeah, I didn't take anything."
What's going on in Idaho?
The tunnel's still hot.
We're looking at evacuating Elk Horn.

"Emma is my daughter and my granddaughter, and Ritchie's sister and Ritchie's aunt."
"And if we had Emma, she'd be your daughter and niece, and Ritchie's sister and cousin."
What?
What?
!
Why are you doing this?
Why do you keep trying to make us have a baby?
!
I don't know.
I don't know why I'm doing any of this.
Who is it?
Is everything okay?
Richard told me you had diarrhea.
"Oh, God."
Should I put it on the board?
Get out.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I don't have... that.
What happened?
Why did you leave?
I don't know.
I just freaked out.
I had to come home and get it straight.
I charted what our family tree would look like.
- Looks confusing.
- Confusing?
!
"Connect the dots, you get a map of freakin' Alabama!"
Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?
"No, I'm not."
- Who's Emma?
"Full ten points, very well done."
Team Araucarians - are you ready?
I hope so.
I can tell you you will be looking for...
"You've two minutes, reveal the hive."
Right.
There's Kil...mar...nock.
Along the top.
"I don't think that's a red herring, because it's right in the corner."
So let's pick that one out.
Have you got Blane?
Is that Oban?
Let's try and think of small places.
"Dumbarton, is Dumbarton in there?"
No.
Is there Dun-anything?
Dumfries?
Dumfries?
That sort of works around that edge.
"Yes, it does, you're right."
Let's go for that.
Enter.
Cum...?
Cumbernauld?
Cumber...
"Yes, that goes all the way around there."
There's Ayr.
"No, hang on, Cumber..."
"Oh, that way, oh yes!"
"So, around there."
Cumber...
And then...

"I was a big fan of Red, White  Blue."
Welcome aboard.
Thanks.
I'm happy to be here.
"Between you and me, the staff are concerned about you working for us."
- But so long as you're discreet...
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not sure I follow...
- Sorry.
I need to take this.
"Noreen, can you help Kitty get settled?"
Thanks.
Your office is this way.
"Not quite what you're used to, huh?"
"No makeup, no stylists."
This office is seriously lacking in glamour.
"Well, I worked in basic cable, so..."
Ooh.
- No glamour there.
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.
I apologize again.
For what?
Keeping me waiting or lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.
Sabine will show you out.
"Picked the wrong House to crash, Ma'am."
Chthon is pretty picky.
I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
"A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am."
What's that?
An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it.
I promise.
"Oh my god, mom!"
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.
"You're gonna have to kill me first, you son of a bitch."

That's not necessary.
"Very thoughtful, but, uh, you know, up yours."
'Cause 2 Wycked don't need no wash right now.

"She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?"
Mmm.
"Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty, children got to be free to lead their own lives."
You always say that?
[Chuckles]
[Sighs] Then I guess there's just one problem left.
"And what's that, Your Majesty?"
How much I'm going to miss her.

"The Chinese investor, it's him."
Aksel Nilsen.
-Oh well.
I shook his hand.
Damn ...
"It goes well, it."
Come now.
That's OK.
"Helen, now comes the Chinese soon."
It does not appear here.
Tonje.
-Put away the report now.
-They must get the latest version.
It's not what's important now.
Now you just go in and smile and buttoning his coat outright.
Let me.

"Wears a beret, has a beard."
"The other one's a big, stocky guy."
"Ugly, looks like an animal..."
You know who I'm talking about?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
- No?
"- No, uh-uh."
Huh... huh?
"Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged."
I think they did it.
"A black man, this morning?"
You know anything about that?
"No, I don't know anything about it."
"Wait, no, wait... no, no!"
Uh...

Tell me where they are right now.
"Uh, we got a..."
"We got a clubhouse over on barton and throop, on the... on the second floor, okay?"

You despicable cad!
Come here!
Trouble!
Come out now!
"Who's looking for him, please?"
- He's Master Ding.
- Marshal of seven provinces.
- The Brave One.
- It's nice to meet you.
I'm here to arrest Wong Fei-hung.
This doesn't concern you.
Step aside.
"Marshal, have you met Wong Fei-hung?"
Of course!
We've even fought!
You fought him?
Does Wong Fei-hung look like me?
"No, Wong Fei-hung is a young man."
"At most, 22 years old."
"If he were that young, he'd invite you for tea to celebrate."
Why did you call him a despicable cad?
Are you messing with me?
"Marshal, I'll be honest with you."
I'm Wong Fei-hung.
You're Wong Fei-hung's father?
"Wong Fei-hung, stay there."
But that didn't mean she had to like him.

Hey.
Sounded good.
Where are your glasses?
"You wear glasses, right?"
Contacts.
So which one's your date...
Grumpy or Doc?
Thank you for asking me.
Let's do it again sometime.
It was great.
Good night.
You all right?
You and the doctor...
I wanted to get on with my life... but I just can't see him that way.
Why is that?
I don't repeat things.
"And I hope I don't offend you, but I don't respect Korean men too much."
There are some good men though.
"Yeah, I guess."
Take care of your leg.
Hope your script comes out great.
I'm sure you'll do well.
I really like you.
"Yes, good-bye."

Here she is!
"You didn't expect it, did you?"
I knew that it was not delirium!
I knew it.
You'll tell me everything now!
You'll sign everything off to me!
How much did you get for it?
How much was your price?
You're the one who sold your soul.
You!
You didn't rape me.
You stole my life away.
You killed my son.
He could have lived.
He could have been saved.
But you demolished the hospital.
What did you do it for?
You did it for the sake of your damned mega-center.
Save our children!
Korob is the killer!
"Uh, well, Gibbs is right-  we should get going."
Yeah.
"- Yeah, we should."
6:30 flight out of Dulles.
Tony should be into Dulles about now.
DiNozzo-- that's who's missing.
His father's flying in from London.
Maybe you'll see him there.
Or maybe not.
Airport's gonna be nuts.
"Actually, I'm thinking the snow might thin the crowds a little."
"All right, well, we'll see you guys."
Nice meeting you.
Your attention please--
Do not leave any baggage unattended...
Are you sure I was okay?
You heard Abby-- you were adorable.
"But that Gibbs-- I was babbling away about Turkey, and he's just looking at me with that look."
The Gibbs look.
Hello?
Did you think I was making it up?
You were great.
Really.
You okay?
You seem on edge lately.
The flight?
"No, no."
I'm good flying.
Okay.
"Just, um, I don't know, the holidays, I guess."
I'm fine.
Okay.
I KNOW.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.
YOU SHOULD.
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.
[ CELLPHONE RINGS ] RIGHT ON TIME.
YEAH?
Evelyn:
Change your mind?
ENOUGH OF THIS.
"YOU WANT A DEAL, YOU DEAL WITH ME."
YOU LEAVE LUCY OUT OF IT.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
"You see, I can be reasonable."
"Of course, I still have a job to do."
And the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or... or -
- I know -
- Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"SHE'S NOT LEAVING TOWN, IS SHE?"
THAT WOULD BE A NO.
Doug:
"IF SHE KNOWS ALL THIS ABOUT YOU,"
SHE'LL PROBABLY COME HERE.
SHE WON'T PLAY THIS OUT ON MY TURF.
SHE'LL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON UNTIL SHE GETS AN OPENING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
"I'M A CPA,FOR CHRIST'S SAKE."
A CPA BROUGHT DOWN AL CAPONE.
THERE'S A REASON WHY THE FEDS WANT YOU TO TESTIFY.
I SAY WE HUNT HER DOWN.
- I don't know.
It's OK.
I've got my badges.
- Why?
"- Look, all I know is that... that there was a girl, some stripper who worked in Soho."
"Freddie Lau stole her from Grey, and Grey went mental."
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Stop the machine, I'm dying here!"

Cough fit.
It's all the rage in LA.
I need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of it.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me.
And I will not keep my mouth shut.
All right?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar.
- Who's that?
- No-one.

I told you I'm sick of this food!
Bills-sama.
End soon with that.
We reach the North Kaio planet in about 10 minutes.
Really?
Why?

Why Bills Ki-sama coming to this planet ?

Curse!

G-Goku!
Are you still here ?

You do not have to go to Bulma's birthday party?

I have also curious to know why you're acting so weird.
Me I'm weird ?

I'm strange.
You really have something strange ... training or me ?

"the West Sitting Hall, and the president's bedroom."
"Killick, he's trying to burn the place."
Second floor.
Send your men.
Tyler?
Turn off the goddamn sprinklers!
Who makes this shit?
"Oh, shit!"
What was that?
I've been waiting all day to kill you.
Stop hurting my White House!
German mantle clock.
Empire style.
"Killick, report!"
"Killick, what the hell is happening?"
Report!
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?
Dad!
She's here with me..
"in the Oval Office, so why don't you come down and get her?"
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make all this shit personal?
"Oh, you're talking to me about personal.."
when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I should've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kill this prick.
Hey!
What?
You lied to all of us.
"So if she's a fucking head case, why do you even want to get involved with this one?"
I think she just needs some guidance.
And I've already had some sponsors asking about her.
- Who?
- Slaughter Water.
- Did you pitch Ryan?
"- Yeah, they don't want him."
He has an image problem I have to figure out.
Fuck.
Too fucked up for Slaughter Water.
How'd that happen?
Yeah?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Mario Goldsmith can be here by 4:00.
- Perfect.
- You did not.
I'm just gonna apologize to him.
I'm gonna smooth things over.
"You know what, I don't even care."
Just keep rubbing my feet.
Enjoy your meal.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your...
Order?
[Sighs]
Terry:
I'll take a triple cheeseburger.
- [Cash register beeping]
- Extra onions...
And chili.
And...
- A tantalising invitation.
"- David, please..."
"Drink up, darling."
"- You'll be packed and ready, won't you?"
- You needn't worry.
I'm ready now.
Good.
Daddy.
"Mother, I apologise for David."
He finds it difficult to be with people now.
- You understand?
"- Of course, darling."
- My poor girl.
- No.
I'm all right.
We're all all right.
"Aren't we, Tom?"
"Aye, indeed we are."
"Well, goodbye, Mistress."
These are for you and your husband.
There's little enough to eat in London at the moment.
"Thank you, Tom."
"Thank you, Tom."
"Come on, Tom."
He's drunk.
- Is he always like that?
"- Most of the time, but he's a good friend."
"Any time you want to come home, you and Jo..."
No.
"My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo."
It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure.
- I'm afraid it was.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
Ha ha.
"Touché, Eddie."
"Come on, let's go and pay for the stuff."
I've remembered why we shouldn't be here.
- We have no cash.
"- Eddie, I am a celebrity."
Celebrities don't need money.
- Next.
- Ha ha ha.
Boo!
"Hello, love."
"It's me, Richie Rich."
A-ha!
It's just cancer crunch and a trolley of meat.
I'll give you a mensh on my next prog.
"£200, please."
"My dear girl, you don't seem to understand."
"I, Richie Rich, am offering you, nobody, a mensh on my next prog."
- Right.
This requires subtle handling.
"- £200, please."
How does it feel to be a checkout girl who's reached the peak of your potential?
How does it feel to know that you're a talentless git who never even had any potential?
- I see.
"- £200, please."
Uh.
Stitch that.
I think you're on there.
I know a come-on when I see it.
This is ridiculous.
Somebody here tell donkey face who I am.
We don't know.
(woman laughing)
- Great tush?
Mike:
Great.
- 'Cause you're a fucking fag.
"- No, I'm not a fag, I just appreciate a great tush when I see one."
"- No offense, Mike, but you are a fag."
- You're a fag.
"- No-- I am not a fag, you're not a fag."
"- Hey, Iâm not-- I'm not a fag."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Prove it.
"- All right, all right, all right."
"All right, he said it 'cause--"
- What?
- He said it 'cause you said it.
He said it 'cause you said it.
- But I'm not a fag.
"- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag."
"Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated."
"- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--"
- Right?
- Yes.
"- All right, it's okay, Pete."
- Watch your mouth.
- It's okay.
- You watch my mouth.
- What?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, okay."
"All right, Mike."
"Mike, let me get-- Let me buy you a beer."
It seems there was an argument.
She fell down the stairs.
Potentially a blow to the head before she fell.
Potentially?
- l don't have all the facts yet.
- Is she all right?
"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.
I'm late.
Your-- Your dad went home.
"So, um... your ne_ hearing is in 28 days."
OK.
And we will get you moved then.
28 days.
That's when we'll move you.
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.
- Do you guys remember?
- He did.
That was uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
On-stage.
"- But I stopped it, didn't I?"
- There we go.
"- Yeah, he was trying to get me back..."
"Oh, my gosh."
"- But, Mike, I averted your..."
"- Yeah, you did."
We were on stage doing a QA in Toronto and Rafi said:
"""Mike, sing that song that you always sang to me on set."""
And he was getting me back because of this prank we had played on him in Toronto.
He was getting you back for the $20 prank?
"Yes, exactly."
"Oh, I felt..."
I was really...
That was not a good moment.
"And he looked at me, like, the most sadistic look."
"Well, and then he got his, like, Rafi little-kid thing of like:"
"""Mike, you did it to me."""
Hilarious.
"And then I played, like, mom."
I was mom there.
"I was like, ""No."
"Michael does not do it."""
"- Yeah, that was nice."
- Here we go.
Bishop Allen.
"Oh, Mike."
"Oh, yeah, here we go."
-Perfect!
"-keep quiet, she already comes."
Thanks.
-Young lady.
-Yes?
You often suffers migraine?
From time to time.
"You feel nauseous, dispepsia, schizophrenia?"
"Good, in fact..."
"Sickness, pains to the legs?"
Why?
I am ill?
-It is possible.
-It could be serious.
"Please, Professor, help me."
We would have to examine you.
-I undress?
-You are not embaressed?
"-Good, in fact..."
"-Young lady, we are doctors."
We on a daily basis see a great amount of naked women.
"Good, then..."
"Well, we will help you."
-Lie down in the sofa.
-Comfortable position.
We are going to examine you.
"-Lie down, trust us."
We undo this...
"-Everything, Doctor?"
"-Yes, it is better."
He already is...
"The next time, a bad zipper"
I'm answering all your questions.
You're a fucking sadist is what you are.
A little.
"Wait, look."
Wow!
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Look at these features, huh?"
"I mean, the fucking cheekbones right here?"
Are you kidding me?
I look like an angel.
- Look at that.
- [Camera shutter clicks]
[Laughs]
Babe.
"Oh, you look good."
Thank you.
- [Air hisses]
- Drew:
Try it.
That's original flavor.
I'm pregnant.
I probably shouldn't.
"Ah, it's harmless."
Every ingredient on that can is natural...
Or a near-perfect synthetic match.
"Okay, drew, I've got a lot of other meetings with sponsors."
What do you want to do?
I love Ryan.
You know that.
But I was at his last fight.
He did not look good.
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.
- Shut up!
"- Dude, come on..."
- I said shut up!
Go!
get me out of here!
Help!
"Excuse me, can I see your ticket?"
That trunk yours...?
TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE...
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
REV.DECENIO
"Hey, it's Fred!"
My life is a horror movie!
It's so scary!
I'm so scared!
"And you'll be, too, once you hear about it."
You'll be scared and scarred.
Scare-arr-red!
"That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined."
Which is what you'll be.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Do you want to hear about it or not?
Meet me in the kitchen.
"Usually, I lead a very normal life, go to school, hang with friends, see my girl."
"You remember Judy, right?"
Freddie
Judy.
"Yeah, we broke up."
Dumped her.
"-Don't go, Fred."
WOMAN 1:
Operator.
Hello.
Can I please have long distance?
"For long distance, dial 110."
"Oh, all right, thank you."
WOMAN 2:
Long Distance.
Hello?
"Oh, hello, long distance."
"I would like to place a call, please, to Mrs. Karen Blair, that's Colonel Blair's wife, at March Field, California."
"One moment, please."
"Yes, thank you, I'll wait."
Long distance?
Are you still there?
Are you ready for your call?
"Yes, I'm ready."
KAREN:
Hello?
"(MIMICKING GRETCHEN) Karen, darling."
How divine to talk to you again.
It's been a long time.
"Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it?"
"Much too long, you naughty girl, you."
We must get together again real soon for a rousing game of mahjong.
"Oh, I'd just love to."
"Oh, by the way, Karen, my dear."
I have an enormous favor to ask of you.
My Bobby...
Booby?
"No, not booby."
Bobby.
"- Oh, my."
Now that's going to leave a mark.
[Pants]
All aboard for the transdimensional express.
Huh?
[sighs]
Why me?
This can't be good for my cold.
But this is no time for selfish thoughts.
It's time for a little turnabout.
Ew!
Can you get any more disgusting?
Don't make me come in there.
Wait a second. [sniffs]
Smells like... ambush!
"Mucal invader, is there no end to your oozing?"
[Pants] Adaptor!
[Pants] Adaptor!
Adaptor!
Thanks.
I've had enough chasing.
"It's your turn now, Thorozpog."
Thrakkorzog!
Thrakkorzog!
"With a K. Boy, are you ever rude."
Eat your brain!
No brains today.
"We're only serving humble pie, Whatchimozog."
"- Listen, for the last time it's..."
- Thoraxinabog?
- Thrakkorzog!
"- Ah, Laxativelog."
I really want to do well at this job.
I can't do well if everybody thinks that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.
"So if you will excuse me, I am meeting with the EM very shortly..."
- EM?
- It's the executive matchmaker.
Now silence.
Mother.
You want help with that bar?
There you go.
- Hey.
"- Oh, hey!"
You made it.
Yeah.
"I didn't want Major Pain to make me do extra pushups, so I ran here."
- Wow.
"- Hey, you should check them out."
"Oh, yeah."
That...
Nice.
- I got yours in my bag.
- Great.
You need to break them in.
What are you doing tomorrow?
"- Say, around 11?"
- I...
I work.
I'm...
I'm a lawyer.
That's too bad.
"Not that you're a lawyer, that you're not free."
"Well, you know, I work pretty flexible hours."
Cool.
Richie Rich.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Here we go.
Break a leg.
- OK.
"Get off, you maniac."
"Hello, hello."
Shut up.
"Hi, God bless and if you can't be good, be careful."
Ho ho ho.
Right.
"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."
Happiness
Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."
- Get off!
- The greatest thing
That I possess...
"The smile of a child, a beautiful woman, just simply being..."
British.
- Good.
"- Photo IDs, please."
Thank you.
- What are you guys looking for?
Explosives.
This is awesome.
"Park up on the left, go into the East Lobby."
Have a good one.
Did you know that the president travels in an 18-ton military-armoured modified Cadillac CTS built to withstand gas chemical and missile attacks?
- That's on the Internet?
- Wikipedia.
"- Capitol Police, off-duty."
- Have to check your weapon.
All right.
Check her good.
"- Hey, Torn."
"- Hey, buddy."
So how is your blog coming along?
"Nobody says ""blog"" anymore, John."
"What do you mean, they don't say ""blog""?"
"- I just learned ""blog."""
- Hi.
Hi.
"Just for 20 seconds, act like you don't hate me."
- I'm Carol Finnerty.
- Hi.
John.
- Carol?
- Cale.
"Oh, my God."
Carol Wilkes.
"Actually, I'm Carol Finnerty now."
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?
I haven't gone this fast in years.
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.
Serpentine!
"Serpentine, serpentine!"
What in the blue blazes?
Crazy hot-rodder.
"I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower."
"The sixties weren't good to you, were they?"
What?
That's not the Interstate!
Ah!
Oh!
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ow!
"I'm not the only one seeing this, right?"
- Incoming!
"- Whoa, man."
- No!
- Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
My tires!
"Fly away, Stanley."
Be free!
"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble."
"We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track."
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
What's your strategy?
What?
Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
"Brother Foon, he's the one!"
"- Mousy, you have a go!"
- I can't do it!
My legs go weak when I see him.
Brother Foon is a really good fighter.
I'd be happy if I was half as good as him.
Does it hurt?
I forbid you to scream!
"You've got to smile, too!"
Smile like you mean it!
Mousy.
"Next time you see Mousy, I want you to smile like you mean it."
- Brother Mousy...
- Don't you know what to do?
Scram!
"Brother Foon, you're brilliant."
"When you meet people like that, you've got to behave like a bully."
I can't act fierce.
"Brother Foon, you're my idol."
Everything will be OK if Sifu Wong agrees to take me on.
"OK, I'll put in a good word for you."
We're done for the day.
I've got to dash.
What are you doing?
"Excuse me, please."
Stop clowning around!
Let me pass!
Help!
Help!
This actor is trying to kill me!
Make way!
"Make way, please!"
"He says he loves me, Pam."
"L""m human."
Okay?
"Lt""s okay to be human."
"You won""t win this one, Lisa."
"- Hey, Boo Boo."
- Hi.
"- I don""t believe it."
Not him.
"- It""s true."
"And it""s poisoning the entire office."
"L""m telling you, after a day of watching them, I go home physically sick."
"You""ve seen the way she bends to pick up a pencil at the waist instead of the knees... like any decent woman."
- He has lost weight.
"- He""s drinking Slim-Fast for lunch."
Slim-Fast?
Really?
- Does she know?
- No.
"And I""m not gonna tell her."
"David Harris, last person I ever thought would cheat on his wife."
Yeah.
"Hey, Boo Boo."
"Why don""t you come in and keep me company?"
"You know, you could afford liposuction, Dad."
"God, I can""t believe you use this stuff."
It makes you look all orange.
I listened to this music when I was 12.
"I know you""re sleeping with Lisa, Daddy."
"Kiddo, you don""t buy into that office gossip?"
Not my smart girl.
"Dad, admit it."
Every young student doctor...
She wanted to know my menstrual history.
I didn't know what she was talking about till she told me.
I felt like a right bleeding'eejit.
"Why didn't she just say ""your periods""?"
"We'll weigh you now, Sharon."
Doctors are always like that.
"""Menstrual history."""
"I got a ""C"" in that in me inter."
How are your movements?
Not bad.
How's yours?
There's the heartbeat now.
See it?
Yeah.
Only one heart.
What?
There aren't twins in there.
"Oh, yeah."
That there is a leg.
See it?
"Oh, yeah."
Sharon?
Why didn't you come in this morning?
Had a checkup.
I swapped with Mona.
You should be on check...
Ask her.
You should be on check-out now.
I can't do it!
Why not?
'Cause I have to keep going to the toilet!
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
"When he gives the order, don't do anything, call me."
Do as I say...
- Understand?
- No.
- Perfect.
- What's the matter?
.
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, then I'II leave."
- I wanted to know...
What?
Can you confirm that FriuIi's below Austria?
- Why are you going to Pordenone?
- Where?
Pordenone.
"There's no sun, there's no sea."
There's no me.
"If you have something to say, okay, if not, I'II go back to the festival."
"Every time I have something to tell you, you gotta leave."
- What transfer?
.
- You're staying here?
Fire calling fuse.
hello?
"The music's done, they're wantin' the 'works."
"I don't understand a word, could you repeat clearly?"
I can neverunderstand a word when you talk!
"Mattia, hearme?"
Shoot!
"- hello, Mattia?"
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Are you expecting somebody?
No.
Can I talk to my sister for a minute?
It's okay.
I had this whole speech planned. so-- wait wait.
Just-- what I'm trying to say is that l-- but it wasn't for lack of trying.
Dad split... and Mom passed away.
And we got stuck with Rod.
And... you know?
I'm not your responsibility anymore.
I know that.
That's what I came here to say.
I know you're not a little girl anymore.
And... you-- you grew up to be this really beautiful woman.
And you deserve better.
And I'm gonna have to learn to let you go. but I'm gonna try.
okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's not such a bad guy.
I know.
He's not.
I'm gonna go.
Are you okay?
it was my mom's ring.
I didn't know he had it.
I'm gonna be leaving.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
- Yeah?
Got a minute?
I'm off the clock.
I want you to give Griff his job back.
- No.
"There, less than a minute!"
"- Well, let's talk about this."
- He almost killed a patient.
- It was an accident!
It's still no.
- Just like that?
- Yup.
- No discussion?
"- Uh, no."
Alright.
I'm not leaving until we talk about this.
Close the door on the way out.
I need to eat.
"Frank, wait!"
Nicole...
"It's OK, I just,"
"I just wanna sit with her for a bit, OK?"
OK.
I yelled down the stairs.
- What?
"- When she left for work, I was too tired to go downstairs and kiss her goodbye."
You didn't know.
No one does.
I never in a million years thought I'd marry a woman.
"I had a boyfriend, we were serious, and..."
"I met Stephanie at some first responders thing, fundraiser, and  all my everything turned upside down."
I do.
"I do,"
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
Down...
Down..
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, Rene?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, Rene."
"I like you, Rene, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fraulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a...
China cup.
I'm about to lose my house.
Where will we stay?
"On the streets, or in their house?"
Do we have any other option?
Why don't you understand?
"Come on, Jigna."
Sit in the car.
Come.
- He's made a mess of things.
I won't leave papa.
I'll slap you if you refuse.
"- No, mother."
"Come on, sit inside."
Please..
Hello.
Hello.
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).
What?
"lf you were a Muslim, I would've said Allah."
"lf you were a Christian, then Jesus Christ."
"You're a Hindu, so Krishna."
"You, here?"
"You're an excellent stuntman, really."
Very good.
I'm sure you're acting is decent as well.
Why don't you approach some television channel?
They keep remaking Ramayan and Mahabharat.
Krishna.
Suited-booted Krishna.
Here to teach me a lesson.
Look.

Let me try to take this one step further.
I'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.
I won't even write these down --
I'll just call them out as they're called out to me.
"Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number."
"Anyone on our panel, verify the answer."
Just give some indication if it's right.
"A three-digit number, sir, yes?"
Audience:
987.
AB:
"987 squared is 974,169."
(Laughter)
AB:
Yes?
Good.
Another three-digit -- (Applause)
"-- another three-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
"Hairy is the word that's just, I just picture his forearms, and being like, where are you?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I don't mind that.
BETH HOYT:
"I could, I can French braid."
I'd love to try a fish tail braid on his arm.
That would be fashionable.
"OK, you guys."
We are minutes away from open comments.
Anything you've ever wanted to ask Julie or
"Ted, now is your chance."
Put them in the comments.
We'll be right back.

I'm going to set up shop right here.
Perfect.
You're just my type.
They aren't like you.
Wasn't that Jae Hee?
"Who, hyung?"
Why did that guy come here?
"Now, you even sleep out?"
Ah!
"Baek Go Dong, are all the guys here?"
I detest waiting!
I think the guys are here.
Hello! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
What is this?
"Uh, did you come?"
Who said you can use our practice room without permission?
So what?
"Man Ok, keep doing it."
This... this is totally cool!
Aren't you practicing?
"All right, I'm leaving now."
Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.
"Can you pass me a spoon, soul roll brother never would?"
"Lights up, please."
"Come on, now."
"Damn, directorio."
What it do?
You must be on them red devils.
Y'all know what a red devil is?
"I'm not going to tell you, either."
"But I know my uncle used to take them, then fall asleep at the light."
BETH HOYT:
All right.
"Hi, guy guys."
"Man, um, here, we, this is, need these props."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, thank you."
BETH HOYT:
"These aren't full, though."
"So you guys, what we're doing, we've got some [INAUDlBLE]."
I'll give you this one.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Cheers.
BETH HOYT:
Not that it matters if you have.
"OK, we're here with [INAUDlBLE] ""Real Housewives of New York City"" critic Julia Klausner, and rock star Ted Leo."
"Ted, have you ever watched ""Real Housewives?"""
TED LEO:
I have.
BETH HOYT:
"Oh, good."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You went to high--
"You went to high school with Camille Grammer, didn't you?"
Take care.
We might not be able to see again until the trial.
You want anything from us?
No.
Just your good health.
Tell the lawyer if you wanna eat anything.
I'll cook and send it over.
"Okay, but it's not needed."
"I took a vow, when you get out of this place... ..."
I will feed orphans.
Look...
Stay away from the prison dogs.
- God be with you.
- Stay away from them.
Inshallah you'll be out after the first trial.
We'll see.
Inshallah.
We got the appointment for 13th of the month.
"Oh that, I got it."
I wish you the best.
Good for you...
"Goodbye, son."
See you.
- See you.
- Goodbye.
Handan Pakel.
Can I have my bag?
Have a good day.
"Ilyas, where are you?"
"Okay, I'm coming."
Can I have my ID as well?
Sami Tekinoğlu.
"-Wait, let me finish."
- Absolutely not.
No way.
-Why are you so worked up?
- Fools...
Don't I have a say in this?
Forget it.
No.
I have a guy already.
"A blind date is the best present, right?"
Really?
You have a boyfriend?
You do?
"115 00:14:46,652 --&amp;gt; 00:14:47,209 Wow..."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Yeah, he's good-looking."
How'd she meet a guy like this?
"- They look like a good couple, huh?"
- Right.
"Hey, Sister-in-law!"
Stop!
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Time out!
"Looks ridiculous, huh?"
- It was a mistake!
"Coach, save me!"
- You're dead meat!
"Come here, you bastard!"
"Get over here, you bastard!"
It was a misunderstanding!
The ministry of education requested proper courtesies regarding cell phones.
"And if anything unwanted comes up in the future, get rid of it."
And I'm sorry.
But I can't wear a skirt for you.
"A baby, crying all night."
"This poor mom, who can't do anything for him, other than to cry outside, so that he doesn't hear her."
"All night the baby cries inside the house, and I cry outside..."
"I love you, baby."
Please don't be sick.
I love you mommy.
Please don't be sick.
Why?
Hwi-chan.
Hwi-chan.
You don't need to do that for Mom anymore.
The nurse came and gave her a shot and some pills.
So you don't have to do that.
"No, when Mom did this for me I got well."
Go on.
-What?
-The song.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Mommy's got a pot belly.
"Hurry, hurry and get well."
Daddy's got a healing hand.
Is anyone here?
- Is nobody here?
-We're the rescue team.
"If anyone's here,just yell."
-Anyone here?
-We're the rescue team.
"Ten, this is 101."
Let's just have a drink.
Alright.
I'll be back.
- Slow.
- Yes.
- Slow.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
We can drink with our clothes off.
At least our tops.
Let's do it when it feels right.
It feels right to me.
"Okay, then I'll show..."
I'll show you up to here... so can't we just stay like this and just talk?
No!
You've changed all of a sudden.
Humans are like that.
Then undress up to there at least.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Why are you undressing?
Let's just do it once.
Do what?!
Just once...
Come this way.
Look.
- This is funny.
Really!
- Let's just do it once.
Look.
Can you buy some more liquor?
We've drunk all.
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.

I can't break it.
Senior.
Is Tuan Zhengchun coming for his children?
Of course.
I've brought them here... as bait for Tuan Zhengchun.
Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."
No one can fight it.
Not even the Yi Yang Finger... can tackle it.
We can get rid of his whole family.
Only then I'd have vent my anger.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
But I love Kishan.
Then get ready for the ruin.
I agree.

Really?
Why would I lie?

"I was cleaning up your wound,"
I wasn't aware of that.
You cleaned up my wound?
Then you saw my body?
That of course.
Come here.

Find the person who sold him the ticket and make an identification.
See that your men have pictures with them.

You've got pictures of Kimble.

I keep thinking about it.
Keeps coming up in my throat.
"Ah, you think too much."
"If Gerard wasn't there, where is he?"
Someplace.

"He's going to get a message from the captain, he's gonna come running like crazy."

- She's inside the house.
Are you all right?!
"- Yes, sir."
"Aunty, give me my clothes."
It's getting late.
Suraj will be here soon.

I thought that it was aunty.
Get out from my room!
Come out.
There's no need to feel shy.

(Berta) Un momento.
"(Roberto, her son) Mom, I need to use the car, remember?"
"Pardon me, this is my son Roberto and his friend Julio."
"These ladies come from San Antonio, they are going to Hotel San Diego."
Why don't you take them to their hotel?
"No problem, Mrs...Toledo and Ms. Toledo."
We're named Toledo too!
True!
"Is this the last name of everyone here, Toledo?"
"All, no."
But it's a very common name here.
I'm not named Toledo.
"I'm Julio Lovero, at your service (pleased to meet you)."
"(Roberto) Let's take the suitcases to the car.(Julio) Ok, I'll take this one."
This one is mine.
I'll take it.
"(Julio) Allow me, Linda."
"Great, ok."
Thank you very much Mrs. Toledo!
"No, thank you."
It has been a pleasure.
I hope you have a good trip.
Hi!
This is my daughter Daniela.
"Daniela, this is is Mrs. Toledo and her daughter Linda."
They're from San Antonio.
Because you are the future of Egypt
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!
He will be safe with me
"He is Egypt, that is all I've ever lived for!"
And now he must live for you!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
ls Marc Antony alive?
"I do not know, my Queen"
But you have to flee the city
Octavius' army will be here within the hour!
No!
I will wait for my king
Your Majesty... there are documents that have to be destroyed...
Go!
Go!
Have you seen Caesarian?
Where is he?
Have you seen the child?
Where's the child?
Out of my way!
What're you doing here?
Your Queen needs you on guard!
Where's the boy?
"He's not here, by the blessings of lsis"
Not here?
What do you mean?
"It doesn't matter, he's safe"
"Listen to me, Mardian"
Caesarian is in grave danger
That's not it!
Don't you know me?
In that extremely degraded place!
Ah!
I don't know.
I feel leery!
I feel leery!
Hey!
Doesn't my body smell?
Huh?
"Hey, Baek Go Dong!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Try to smell it."
"Ah, hyung-nim!"
Speed up!
I have to go quickly and wash it off.
Sauna!
Sauna!
You can't go home right now.
Why?
Tae Ik hyung-nim
left for the practice room.
He kept saying he won't let you go if you are late.
Seriously!
I said speed up!
"Anyway, the one that came out best..."
I think is this one.
What do you want?
I don't expect anything big.
The commercial that Won Kang Kwi is shooting again.
"If you hand it over to me, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;I'll keep my mouth shut."
Just for a commercial you go through all this trouble?
"At a cheap motel, with a guy partner..."
Isn't the combination extreme for a Hallyu star like Won Kang Hwi?
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Donatacci?
TED LEO:
Yeah.
Donatacci.
That's right.
BETH HOYT:
"OK, you guys."
I've watched plenty myself.
"One thing I've learned, I mean, you guys can back me up on this is that bitches be crazy, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
In general.
BETH HOYT:
Yep.
"So we're going to play in general, Bitches Be Crazy."
"OK, I'm going to give you guys a quote from either ""Real"
"Housewives of New York City"" ""Girl, Interrupted,"" the"
Winona Ryder movie about women in an insane asylum.
You have to guess which crazy bitch said what.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
BETH HOYT:
"Julia and Ted, you use your paddle to show us which one you think the quote is from."
"And you get a point for each one you get correct, and you drinks for each one you get wrong."
I'm just going to be drinking throughout.
TED LEO:
OK.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That makes me more comfortable.
BETH HOYT:
That's what we're looking for.
OK.

"-No, your ideas are always this unoriginal and half-baked."
-[scoffs]
"Well, you know what?"
I wasn't thinking of going with that idea anyway.
I was thinking that we should just--
"-Haunt people and, while they're distracted, just steal their money?"
-Stop it!
"Yes, let's just do that."
"-Sweet, high five!"
-Whoa!

-Ohh.
"-No, the thing before that."

"Last week, when you were driving..."
-No.
-There was an accident.
"-(dispatcher) Uh, please say again."

-(dispatcher) Oh no!
You're screwed!
"[screams, dial tone]"
-Ugh.
"All right, I'm out of ideas."

"-Look, everybody."
The important thing right now is to just remain calm.

[all screaming]
"-No, no, no!"
Everybody just shut up!
We're not going to freak out.
-That's easy for [hiccup] you to say.
You don't have an exploding [hiccup] hippo in your tummy.
"-Dude, it's not a hippo."
-It's an exploding hippo.
"-Listen to me, Orange."
Do you want to get rid of your hiccups?
-Duh.
"-Then you have to do exactly what I tell you, okay?"
-Okay.
"-Okay, it's really simple."

There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.
- I understood.
And I also want to see one more relative.
"Mr. Jackie, don't drink so much."
For God's sake.
Please.
Mr. Bharat?
You?!
"Come... come, sit, Mr. Bharat!"
Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
"- Okay, come."
Are you blind since childhood?
- Yes.
"Me too. . . . it's okay, don't worry."
It's okay. . .say hello to aunty.
Come.
What is your name?
- Babu.
"Babu, are you Hindu or Muslim?"
Where did he go?
Strange!
I asked him his religion and he disappeared?
It's time for my bus to come.
Who throws such things on the street like that?
Hey guy! . . . idiot!
Why are you. . . .

"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"

- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).

"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
Fuck Prince.

JULlE KLAUSNER:

"Are you a fan of ""30 Rocks?"""
TlLDA SWlNTON:
Tina Fay is an ice flow in the north Atlantic that I astral project to every third Sunday in Ramadan.
I sit on the ice.
On my bottom.
In my mind.
And let the fear of a dying world snake its way up my vagina.
Through my pelvis.
To create a crystal of ecstasy.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Wow.
"Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tilda."
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"You're very welcome, Julie."
I'm ready to begin the interview whenever you are.
BETH HOYT:
Wow.
I thought that went great.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
BETH HOYT:
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.

Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:
April.
AB:
April what?
Audience:
17th.
I believe that was a Sunday.
"Can you confirm, Chris?"
Chris Anderson:
Yes.
AB:
Why hasn't he?
"Oh, he's got some idea he's looking for somebody."
Oh.
Passport and all the rest was just to throw us off.
Maybe.
May have planned to change places with Priamos at the last minute.
"They were friends, weren't they?"
They had a fight.
I told you.
You think I'm lying?
They'll be closing the net.
We'd better get downtown.
What about me?
I'll get you a cab.
"Oh, no, you don't."
I'm going along.
I gotta get to Gus 'cause we're gonna get married.
You said he was dead.
"Look, I've got some rights."
"After all, I was the one who called you, wasn't I?"
Yeah.
You were the one.
( somber theme playing )
"Hey, Gus."
"Come on, Gus."
"Are we home, Johnny?"
"No, Gus."
I had to get off the streets.
We're in an alley over by the river.
Are they going to catch us?
Not a chance.
How do you feel?
The money has been paid
When did I say that?
Go now I won't fight， I didn't say I would
She's really got the nerve.
She's special
She'll crush you to death!
Miss， I give up.
I give up
I give up
Beat her
Don't!
Open up
Help， help!
I hate being hit on the chest， you bitch!
Landal， what are you doing inside?
Why so noisy?
Nothing.
I'm composing
Does it sound pleasant?
So-so
What happened?
My brother's still not back.
What about your sister?
Mimi hasn't returned either
You alone?
And me.
What do you want?
I feel a bit lonely
Shall I keep you company?
No.
Good night
Good night
- Showing them a TV.
This is not done.
- That's how I do it.
I sold all TV's.
Only one or two are left.
What are you doing?
Do you intend to loot?
How can they loot like that?
What do you mean by threatening me with a gun?
Keeping a gun on the temple means. . .
Gun?. . .
Gun ! . . .
Neelambar!
You were making a bill and demanding money?
I'll pay you !
Move it. . . move it both sides.
What are you doing?
- Kick him.
"Neelambar, call the police."
Call the police!
What happened?
- Mr. Gorpade has come.
"Mr. Gorpade, they were stealing our TV's and Videos."
Who?
Where?
- Over there.
You always give wrong direction.
- Thieves?
"Constable, arrest them."
Beat them up.
What happened?
"For the first time, while shopping with you, I made an arrest."
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
"Ladies, five minutes."
Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
"Work out, plenty of rest."
"You know, eat your green vegetables."
Thas what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on.
Go.
Keep it steady.
Is a web.
"Go, Spidey, go!"
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
"I mean, no."
Hey.
Hey.
"Hey, chief."
"You park there, I'm towing it."
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
Can I help you?
"Yeah, I've come to see the show."
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
Tell Kerim to call him.
"OK, a second."
Need a pen...
Where did I put them...
"- A moment, there..."
"- Okay, no need to rush."
I'm writing.
"OK, I'll save it to my cell phone as well."
He'll be waiting for Kerim to call.
- OK.
"- Tell him to go meet him, he'll help him."
- Thanks to him.
- And how are you?
- Do you need anything?
"- No, thank you very much."
"- Good night, see you."
- See you.
Come on.
Get inside.
You'll catch a cold.
Take these on your shoulders then.
"Have your medicine, too."
That lawyer named Münir knows where they are.
He knows or he knows not.
What is it to you?
Just forget about them.
You know what...
I didn't believe a word he said to me.
He's a bastard like the others.
"Look, brother..."
I know it's hard to accept but...
Everyone knows about it now...
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
How... you know this better.
At present he's celebrating festival at Khandala...
"Your father, Pasha."
Santo!
Raghu!
Kali!
Badal!
God!
Who are you trying to threaten by firing in the air?
Those days of threatening and firing have gone.
Now I'm only a retired IG.
- Uncle!
- Yes.
Uma sent this photo for you.
Wow!
Dear father!
Your darling daughter Radha!
Did you see?
This time my daughter left me... ...for her college youth festival.
"Thank God, your darling sister is here."
"Sandhya, it's right that Jamna is my sister."
But reason her widows are not supposed to have long tongue.
Even I don't like it.
But she's a widow.
"So, I can't even say anything to her."
"Shanti, where's Jamna?"
Sitting in the backyard.
Reading a holy book.
Mother!
Aunt is calling you.
"You go, my son."
I'm coming.
"I told you that I don't want to kill anyone, why aren't you leaving?"
Have you forgotten our enemy?
Charge.
Follow me.
"Mercy, please"
I didn't know you're so able.
"Miss Mu, could you slow down?"
I'm afraid.
Let me down.
What was that for?
Shut up.
"I didn't tell you to talk, shut up."
Why?
You are very violent.
Let me go.
I don't want to be with you.
Shut up.
I won't.
Shut up.
I won't.
I'll curse if you don't let me go.
Go ahead if you have guts.
"In my whole life,"
I've been cursed by many people.
Why don't you?
"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
SPEAKER 18:
"Dude, we do lock our doors."
"Our house has been broken into a couple times by some people, mainly dudes."
SPEAKER 19:
I've taken self-defense classes.
SPEAKER 16:
"I know how to fight, so I'll kick some ass."
SPEAKER 20:
Good question.
SPEAKER 21:
"Oh, man."
Uh.
SPEAKER 22:
Shoot.
"Uh, I don't know."
SPEAKER 23:
[LAUGHS]
SPEAKER 24:
Have you ever felt like you're in danger of sexual violence?
SPEAKER 25:
"No, I haven't."
No.
SPEAKER 26:
"I mean, I've never really felt at risk."
SPEAKER 27:
Sexual violence?
"Well, I don't know."
It's not really something that I think about a whole lot.
SPEAKER 25:
It's not really something I think about that much.
SPEAKER 21:
"I mean, when you think of sexual violence, you usually think of a woman walking down a street at night."
When daddy has put the incense in here.
[bell rings]
That's it.
"Good morning, mummy. boy speaking native language:"
"Good morning, mummy. man speaking native language:"
"Good, now put the incense out."
Good. boy speaking native language:
All done.
I want some water.
[man speaking native language]
[woman laughs]
[man coughs]
man:
Today we're gonna videotape Sasha doing his first ever shave.
Sasha:
"Oh, boy. man:"
Sasha is how old now?
Sasha:
Uh...15. man:
All right.
Sasha:
15. man:
The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha:
Yes. man:
So that it'll warm up your face and moisturize your skin.
"Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?"
Sasha:
It's always been hot. man:
All right.
Yes.
"Whatever you say there, dude."
What the f did I tell you?
The bandaid on the back of your neck?
The briefcase.
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
MALE SPEAKER:
"Oh, jeez."
Just another day at the office.
-I told you Porno Pictionary was the way to go.
"-Hey, why don't we kick it up a notch and make this into a swingers party?"
"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
-I choose Nancy.
-What?
-That little filly.
-What are you talking about?
-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!
"- Really, sir?"
Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.
"So, Seung Jo liked Ha Ni all along."
"Hello, Eun Jo!"
You came again?
"Go Ri, hello!"
"It's not Go Ri, it's No Ri!"
That's right.
"Hello, No Ri!"
Hello.
I brought cake to give to you.
"So Ri, you're going to eat too, right?"
"No Ri, No Ri!"
I'm sorry.
I'm not that smart.
"No, it's okay."
"Everywhere I went, the hospital rooms were so quiet that it was no fun."
"But, it's fun and nice here."
"No Ri, have you been in the hospital for a long time?"
"Yes, about 1 year and 2 months."
"So, they said I have to repeat fourth grade."
Really?
"Then, I'll teach you your homework."
You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.
Thank you.

This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
- Is Güney Bey here?
- No.
- Tell me when he is.
"- Yes, sir."
Has the vendor come?
"You bought some hair conditioner, too?"
"Okay okay, good."
I took my time when those two appointments were canceled.
Maybe I shouldn't come to the shop today if there's no customers.
"I'm home, yes."
You call me if you need me.
"Okay dear, kolay gelsin."
Why don't you take a break.
- Your coffee is getting cold.
"- I'm coming, abla."
There's a lot of ironing to do as well.
"We'll get all done, abla."
Don't worry.
"What is wrong, abla?"
- He's dead.
- Who?
"Which one, the one with the picture?"
Who is he?
Abla?
Someone you know?
"""Son of deceased Ibrahim and Hatice Gencerel..."""
"""... beloved father of Arda and Tuba..."""
"""... husband of Sevgi Gencerel."""
His funeral will be on this afternoon.
A relative?
"Abla, are you okay?"
To the funeral?
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."

Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Paul, we know this has been hard."
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.
- Lying bitch.
Are you insulting my wife?
What?
What?
Let's go Rung.
I'm so sick of his face.
"Just a minute, Dow."
Let me take my revenge.
"You forced me to call you ""lord"""
I'll get you back now.
"Hey, what are you going to do?"
I'll leave this with you so you will think of me.
"Call me ""Baron"""
- What Baron?
- You won't call?
"Call me ""Ananda"""
"Call me ""Ananda""."
- I command you.
- Ow...
"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."
You bastards.
But I never had the proof.
"What are you talking about, Marla?"
"Your husband, Barry.... my ex-husband, Barry..."
"Denise, Barry's a selfish bastard."
What?
No!
"No, he's not."
No.
Look.
-Oh my god.
-Mm-hm
This is not happening.
He fooled me too.
There were always signs.
What signs?
Think about it!
Haven't you ever been stuck out in the cold with him?
"I got pneumonia once, but..."
You got lucky.
I lost a finger.
Frostbite.
Think about your last birthday.
Happy Birthday to you!
Mmm!
It's spongy.
Selfish bastards can't participate in the celebration of others.
It's been documented.
No!
It's not true!
He loves people.
He was so close to his brother and sister.
Selfish bastards recreate the past for personal gain.

"I searched for you everywhere. seema.. seema, believe me."
This separation has tormented me a lot.
"Even my life has not been smooth, shekhar."
"I don""t know for which sin I am paying the price."
"For God""s sake leave!"
"Don""t force me to get you arrested."
"Don""t give people the chance to say.. ..that for 50,000 rupees a wife got her husband arrested."
"Leave! - seema, give me my child!"
Leave him!
"Don""t remind me that I am the mother of a smuggler""s son!"
"Mother, is he my daddy?"
Your daddy is dead!
He has ruined our happiness and peace!
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm so lonely?
"Is your husband quiet, too?"
My husband?
As he walked out of the wedding hall he closed his mouth and he's been quiet ever since.
"Ah, It's cold."
Don't.
You're going to get my clothes wet.
Stop it.
My shoes are all wet.
So what!
They're not mine.
You look lonely.
I'll buy lunch today.
Whatever you want!
"But, at student cafeteria."
"They're freshmen, aren't they?"
How do you know?
Because they look tacky.
It's good!
"Back in my day, it wasn't."
"Did you go to college, too?"
Why?
Anything say that I can't?
"No, of course not."
What was your major?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Philosophy.
Huh?
It can't be!
Brat...
- Let's break up.
"-Why, Sook-hyun?"
-We've made it this far.
Just...
- This card is maxed out.
Find a better woman.
Can you put these back on the shelves?
Sook-hyun!
There's no better woman for me.
Don't do this...
Cut it out and get lost!
I'm sorry

"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...
Don't die!
I'll behave from now on.
Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.
I only bought the fish!
From where did you buy the fish?
"I bought it from my boss""s company truck.. ..that delivers fishes everyday."
I am so sorry! - so sorry!
"Hello, shekhar!"
This is for you!
Thank you very much!
Bye-bye!
Bye!
ls she the girl who dropped the beer?
Why did she come here? she came to apologise!
- Apologise?
And in this room? she is a mad girl!
And she left a present for you.
lf she had got it for me.. then why did she give it to you?
"Darling, we are in Europe!"
You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.
What does this mean?
This means that you doubt me!
"You are making me doubt you, shekhar!"
"I don""t know why I feel afraid."
"Now unnecessarily you are scared. come in the bedroom! oh God! ln the morning, bedroom!"
"ln the afternoon, bedroom!"
"At night, bedroom!"
Always bedroom!
I am fed up of this place!
"Let""s go home, shekhar!"
Please!
Are you really fed up?
"- Yes! okay, darling!"
1 1 O'clock.
And that guy must still be snoring in bed.
"Get up, it's morning. . . . ."
"Get up, it's morning."
"You have come, that means it's morning."
Don't recite poetry.
"Get up, you have a meeting at 1 1."
Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.
- Wear them quickly.
God !
"Go take a bath quickly, the water will go."
Why take a bath everyday?
"It's a waste of time, water, soap."
My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.
Ay!
Ay! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;All you needed to do was open your mouth.
I can't lie.
Smart ass!
What should we eat?
Uh...
How about ribs?
I like rib patties.
That is slightly...
Then do you want to have sushi?
I know a great place.
"Their fried fish is also good. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;And, they also have Yeongdeok snow crab."
"Even that... for the time being, no..."
Then what do you want to eat?
What about pizza?
Pizza?
We haven't had it lately.
"Oh, Pizza sounds great."
Really?
Then where should we go?
How about Marco's?
Their pizza is good!
That place is expensive.
Let's go where we always go.
Ah!
The pizzeria at the crossroad?
Hey!
There is no place to sit there.
"Baek Go Dong, let's go somewhere else."
Somewhere else!
Forget it.
Go there!
It's a great site.
"Earthquake's got a thing on there, oh my god."
"Oh, I know, I always go."
"That's another thing too, there's like, there like a top link on their US business site, so that the, like, uh, the top thing that's come out."
Visited.
Yeah.

Yup.
"Or we can do it online, god, geez."
"Yeah, we're coming to"
"California in a, a few weeks here."
"We're in the middle of a heat wave right now and we had an earthquake last night and, and earthquake today."
And I'm just hoping that this earthquake is not a harbinger of a big one.
"Oh, oh."
I hope not.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, the, the, yeah."
Cuz that's.
A big earthquake.

"Professor, I want to make a request."
Request.

Is that your birth year?
My parents weren't even married.
What's the connection between marriage and birth?
"City, Mumbai."
I mean then it was Bombay.
Don't touch anything.

You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
"Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest."
"Often during this time of the day,"
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.

No more allowance! and no more Belila (Egyptian food)
I don't like it
Help me Sameh

Smart and clever and always studying really hard

It'd be bad if they returned
Please
I'll cope with you some other day
I don't know what you're up to.
Anyway， you must pay
How much? $200，000?
No， make it $20，000
Thank you， boss
Where's he?
Landal， where have you been?
The Seven-Eleven， to buy shampoo
Why are you wet through?
I was pouring at Seven-Eleven
Why's your head covered with suds?
I had a shampoo because it's wet
This is the detergent， not the shampoo
I took the wrong thing.
I must go back and change it
Who are you looking for?
She's coming up
Miss， it's late.
Come some other day
You've put on my underpants
You must be crazy
Now I've got the proof
Take them off now
Okay
These are yours.
Take them back
ln fact， it was my fault
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Now we're literally playing with power.
"Come on, jump."
Jump!
"Come on, Mario, jump!"
"God, how do I jump?"
"Come on, jump!"
Ass!
"Oh, jump is over here."
"Alright, here we go."
"Get the mushroom, oh-"
"Aw, now that's assy."
"Yeah, I know I use the word ""ass"" a lot."
I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?
- Yamah Rajdoot 350.
"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.
- I did everything for you!
"I did everything, what else do you want me to do?"
"For God's sake, Basha."
Is your heart that cold?
"I beg you, answer me!"
What?
Answer me!
Popoy stop it!
Basha...
I love you.
And it hurts.
Take me!
Right now!
Take me right now!
Hello?
Where are you?
Huh?
Where?
"I've been going around here over and over, where are you?"
I'm coming.
You keep saying you're coming but I still can't find you!

Kill him
Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
"And when you finally, finally think you do have something that matches customer needs, you get to the next step, which is customer validation."
An Advaita Song
Satsang with Mooji
[Mooji:]
Hari Om.
[Questioner:]
When I came to Lucknow in '96
[M:]
They want you to put the microphone more close.
[Q:]
Yes.
"When I came to Lucknow in '96, it was a little... scary for me."
and I had the great grace to meet Papaji at that time and you remind me very much of him.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
He's here you know?
[Q:]
"Yes, I do."
And so at that time I wasn't quite ready to sing for him.
So I wondered if maybe I could  sing for you just a little bit.
[M:]
Oh yes.
[Q:]
A song that was in my heart  but never made it to my mouth.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
"Oh yes, please."
[Q:]
It seemed childish and simplistic.
"It was embarassing, and I felt I just wasn't ready at that time."
"So, we go."
"Row, row, row, your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,"
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.

Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."
(high-pitched static)
I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, my God."
(high-pitched static) (footsteps crunching)

"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.
(pulsating echo)
"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!

Ryan Gosling and James Franco.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, I'm done with Ryan Gosling."
"I'm done with like, girls being like, isn't it interesting that I have a crush on Ryan Gosling?"
Because I'd kill him just to get those girls to shut up.
"And then James Franco, why not?"
It would be a project.
It would be an art project.
BETH HOYT:
Absolutely.
"That's the way he would see it, too."
"Not that [INAUDlBLE] it's just, you know, his view on everything, right?"
It's all art.
TED LEO:
"He's an indicator for me of how old I am, because I really don't know who, like--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You don't get him?
TED LEO:
"No, I just don't know, I don't know, I don't think I've seen anything he's been in."
You know what I mean?
"Like, it's that kind of, I feel like it's, I'm on some other side of some line."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Ryan Gosling, or James Franco?"
TED LEO:
James Franco.

You will.
"He's like all the little, a bunch of things."

He'll show up at your house one day.
What's that for?
It's my granddad's cross.
It'll keep trouble away.
I'm off.
Go ahead.
You abandoned her!
You hear?
You got cold feet.
Say something!
Tell him he's a coward!
Shut up.
"You mean, everyone run for your life?"
- Yashka couldn't have helped.
- You would've abandoned her too?
What's the use?
He'd have got caught himself and not saved Ksanka.
For shame...
Wait for me here.
"If I'm not back by evening, you come..."
Valerka.
Who's there?
"It's me, Father Mokei."
Danka?
Thank God...
I thought you'd followed your father.
I'm still alive.
Everybody's gone mad.
They threw the bell-ringer from the belfry for spite.
The bell's not been rung since Christmas.
- What are you here for?
- Looking for my sister.
She's at the inn - a waitress.
- ln demonology -
- Hey so that you could make it - [ Moans ]
"- - You're really makin' it --** - Hon, can you tell Vic to come on down for supper ?"
- [ Screams ]
Holy shit !
- Shh.
You know there's no lock on your door ? - -- [ Humming ] - [ Moaning ]
-- [ Continues ]
Ohh !
I'm coming !
I'm coming !
-- [ Humming ]
"- Oh, Jim !"
- Dad.
"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."
You see ?
It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
Yes
CL:
It's scary.
I think it's scary.
CL:
I'm a little nervous about how it will go in front of huge numbers of audience.
CL:
I don't know how I will act when the cameras are turned on.
I have no idea.
I am so nervous that I hardly sleep at night anymore.
KL:
There are still some steps...
D:
A waltz by Camilla and Kristjan
D:
Thank you.
D:
Well Dermot.
DC:
"If you had the nerves, I couldn't see it."
"To be a premiere dance, this is perhaps one of the best I've seen through seven seasons."
DC:
It was elegant.
You have a very nice position.
"And if I should criticize anything the first night, it is to breathe more and get the head a bit more....."
CL:
I didn't breathe at all
DC:
Think about it to next week.
You have to dance and breathe.
"It was a very, very good start."

Sri Siddeshwar Maharaj has just said.. ..that Lord Krishna is very pleased.. ..to see the crowd that has gathered around.. ..for the 'Janmastami' festivities.
And today He'll eat milk and butter from His devotees.
"Yes, He'll drink milk and eat butter."
And Siddeshwar Maharaj also says that.. ..this auspicious opportunity will last only for an hour.
Only one hour.
"So, your time begins now."
You go to the hospital everyday?
"So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?"
"Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two."
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
"Hey, what are you saying..."
No?
What no
"We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!"

You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!

Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
"No Ri, happy birthday!"
"Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged."
Thank you.
"Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me."
Okay.
"If there's something you don't know, always call me."
"You know my phone number, right?"
"Yes, I will."
"No Ri, get healed quickly."
"Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem."
"No Ri,"
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm not going to.
We have to get out of here.
They won't take me.
They won't take me.
Not again.

Hello?
"Pablo, where are you?"
"Malena, listen."
The son-of-a-bitch who's behind this is connected with the military.
Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?
Give him a break.
[woman speaking native language]
[Masood speaking native language] woman:
"Here I am by myself, because my husband is a half a world away, going to work, fighting for us."
What shirt should I wear?
Which one do you think will Phil like better?
Hmm?
Which one do you think?
That one?
Is that one the best?
Masood:
Here is the market in the old city.
"Most foreigners think that it is dangerous to walk around the streets of Kabul, but as you can see, there is no danger... for us, anyway."
woman:
Waiting game.
Waiting game.
[birds chirping]
Masood:
So this is a street that's normally selling birds like this.
They call them lovebirds because they are always kissing each other.
Sharon:
Oh.
Where are you?
Ooh.
Phil:
"Hi, Sharon."
Sharon:
Hi!
Phil:
Hi.
Sharon:
How's it goin'?
Can you see me?
"So, it starts with level one, holding hands."
"Two, arms around waist."
"Three, good night kiss."
"Four, kiss lasting over three minutes without breath."
"- Five, open mouth kissing."
"- Number six, tongues."
"Oh, my God."
"Seven, upper body fondling outdoors."
Eight...
"Oh, my God."
I've gone all jelloid.
- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
I have.
Why?
Then today is tomorrow!
Today cannot be tomorrow.
"Tomorrow will be in the future, and we are in the real time."
And the future is not real?
It...
It is make-believe?
"The future is real, but..."
But?
"But, but, but?"
It will come later.
When?
Soon.
And I think it has already come.
"What do you mean, it has come?"
When?
"What do you mean, it has come?"
"What has come, my friends?"
The future.
Where?
Everywhere.
Today's morning it is already tomorrow.
Really?
It can't be that today is tomorrow.
Yes?
"You mean, today is yesterday?"
Yesterday is over.
"When yesterday ends, starts tomorrow."
Then the day after tomorrow.
Then two days after tomorrow.
Then...
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
Why do you want to know my bra size?
Huh?
- I never knew Su-eun was so dirty-minded.
- Get away from me!
Happy birthday to you!
"Happy birthday dear Su-eun, Happy birthday to you."
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!
"-Okay, in one shot!"
- One shot!
One shot!
One shot!
Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!
My present?
You want more?
"My present, my birthday present!"
You think I'm still a kid?
These are really popular these days.
Then you wear it.
We spent all day looking for this.
Just keep it.
"Quiet, both of you!"
You're so loud I can't understand anything.
Let me speak too.
What's his problem?
"Sister-in-law, I'll give you a better present than this."
How about a blind date?
Really?
With who?
"Well, in my station, there's..."
"No, No firemen."
Letter to Santa.
"""Dear Santa, I have been SO good this year..."""
You know what?
No!
"No, I am not listening to any more of this!"
You're just jealous!
Long term exposure has compromised your ability to judge.
There is no way I am married to a selfish bastard!
(SMACK!)
"Focus, Denise!"
Think about all that you have sacrificed.
How could I be so stupid?
"Don't go there, Denise!"
You deserve so much more.
I do?
"Denise, you deserve oral sex."
But... he said that was...
Impossible.
That it's just...
A scam.
Can't he get help?
No.
It's terminal.
"If he were a loser or even a prick, maybe..."
NOOO!
I hate G-d!
I hate Christmas!
Pull yourself together!
Denise!
NOOOOO!!!
Your life is in danger.
Earthquake!
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.

"Yes, sister-in-law."
She'll definitely come back.
She'll definitely come back.

I just can't think over it.
That young boy and young girl...
And she'll be all alone.
And that too in a jungle!
Wonder what he must be doing with her.
And Radha is so innocent.
She doesn't know anything about this world.

But I've been taking a sh--
"I know I can take a shower, but I haven't."
But I thought maybe I could at least try to take a shower before you got here.
Is that okay if I just go ahead and do that?
"Oh, good."
Okay.
Bobby:
"Dad, can I come down?"
Cathy:
"Bobby, can we have a talk, though?"
"Please, please, please?"
Bobby:
Oh.
Cathy:
"I just need to have a talk, okay?"
"Because Grandma is telling me-- all the grandmas, all the friends are saying what a great boy you are."
And of course I know that.
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.
I've never been like this before.
"I just need us all to help each other, okay?"
"And I know that sometimes when we ask you to do something to help, sometimes it's 'cause you don't want to go upstairs 'cause you get scared."

I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.

But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."

Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
Whoa.

But there is another side of Afghanistan that you don't normally see.
These girls make me feel optimistic about the future of my country.

man speaking native language:
It's not easy to explain motivation.
Can I do something to reunite Korea?
It looks impossible.
It looks out of my hands.
Judging from that Yello Robe fellow's expressions... he must have wicked plans for Wanqing &amp;amp; Master Tuan.
No
I must try to inform the Tuan family first.
"Go, little snake."
Go to Dali Palace.
A snake!
What's going on?
Snake... there's a snake!
"Your Highness, it's the gold snake from Wanjie valley."
It must be a message from the Chief.
"""Master Tuan is in the Stonechamber"""
The Tuan family Chief is here.
Please.
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
You cut off my legs with your Yi Yang Finger then;
Your children can pay for your debt today.
Where have you imprisoned them?
In the stone chamber;
About to be food for the gorilla.
"Zhengchun, don't worry."
I believe Tuan Yu is good enough ...to take on the beast.
Wait and see then.
Shameless old thief.
Tuan Yu.
"Quick, eat up the toad."
You've sucked up the Red Python's blood;
"And after you've eaten the toad, ...you will be invincible."
We have to get out!
"C'mon, eat it!"
Hurry.
"Tuan Yu, now you have acquired super power."
Theresa:

"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Aah!
[romantic music continues] man:
"Well, so here's the deal."
"Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, ""No."""
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.

"Okay, let me say that it is meant for women to kneel down."
"For example, a woman is supposed to kneel down for a man. man:"
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to show us how you do it? woman:
Yes. man:
"So you greet Moses, like, traditionally."
[Moses speaking native language]
man:
Wow.
Wow.
"Moses, how do you feel about it?"
Let me go!
Please!
More compresses.
Is he stable?
It looks like he's responding.
"The doctor told me not to call the police, but to keep you here for the moment."
I'm better now.
"I need some coffee, please."
"One, two, three..."
"One, two, three..."
Third discharge.
"One, two, three..."
He's gone.
Doctor!
Mom?
"No, I was awake."
"Yes, I know I said we'd take a plane this week but..."
Pablo can't talk.
He's... asleep.
"Mom, hold on."
Listen.
I want to read you something.
"""Manuel Leonardi was a writer and journalist."
He wrote stories.
His wife Amalia... studied fine art but quit her studies when she became pregnant with her first child.
The last thing Amalia painted was her daughter's bedroom.
"She painted it blue with colored fish."""
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
A woman by the water took off her clothes and...
"You love me, don't you?"
Don't talk nonsense.
Love?
"In the chat room, yes."
Not in reality.
No.
"I love you, too."
Alright?
I love you.
Don't go.
"Love, my ass!"
Bastard.
"Are you selling out love now, too?"
You bastard.
You deserve it.
I love you.
For real.
What happened with the college student?
- He's going off to complete his army duty.
-Why?
All of a sudden?
He's running off from my husband.
That hurts.
"If the sun comes up will he come, When the wind blows he'll leave."
"When I look at you, you're ignoring me."
Please wind stop blowing.
Why are you eating everything?
Stop eating the bone.
"It's no use holding you, you just go away."
Please wind stop blowing.
I don't know
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
So you know our guys are looking forward to it.
It's an opportunity to play at home.
And to home course call it advantage if you want to but were looking forward to playing them at home.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Anything else you like to add?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Just that you know there's no admission to come and watch the golf team play.

There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?

Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"

Of this instrument.
"- C'mon, hero is calling us."
"Whatever you say, but she's so charming."
Remember one thing.
We should not forget our objective for this girl.
This girl will not stay here for 18 days.
"Well, I..."
Don't answer that.
My society photographer got hit in the head by a polo ball.
You're all I got.
Big party for an American hero.
"My son, the astronaut."
Could you pay me in advance?
You serious?
Pay you for what?
Standing there?
"The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00."
There's the door.
My Rosie's dead.
My dream is dead.
And these... ...monstrous things should be at the bottom of the river... ...along with me.
Something... ...in my head.
Something talking.
The inhibitor chip!
Gone.
Rebuild.
No.
Peter was right.
I miscalculated.
I couldn't have miscalculated.
"Tomorrow we'll go see the house, okay?"
I have to help them.
I promised.
Please...
"Things can be changed, you hear me?"
Things can be changed.
Hello.
Are you closed?
- I got stuff to do.
Did you go back to that night club?
The place where you did pole dancing.
No...
I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?
Just once?
Doesn't your wife wait for you at home?
Cemre left home.
We are divorcing.
"Besides, all her roads go to north (Kuzey)."
- Where are we going?
- To my house.
Okay...
"Hüseyin Bey, sorry for the trouble."
"I could come and get it, you didn't have to Huseyin Amca."
I was kinda worried about you.
Since I didn't see you at the shop today.
- Hoped you didn't get sick or something.
"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."
And this isn't my concern for you.
It's a direct warning.
Yes.
"You're safe here, it's a government property."
But how will you escape them?
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Sir.
The case has been accepted.
I'm worried about Sushila and the children.
"I'll take a cab, you go."
But how can I leave you alone.
"I'm going to the police station, for protection."
Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I... ...love it.
"Oh, you're just saying that."
"No, no."
I do.
It's... nice.
"""Nice""?"
Nice.
"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
"Oh, but I do like it."
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
I shouldn't have lent the room to...

"Hey, what are you doin' here ?"
Just enjoying my first exhilarating lacrosse experience.

"So, I had this thought and--"
It may seem like it's way out of left field.
"I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anybody, I thought that maybe--"
Those guys sucked ass !
"Not for your complexion, but you stink."
Go quickly!
Prepare my breakfast.
- I am.
"Lado, get my shampoo."
"If I give him the whole bottle, he'll finish the whole bottle."
He will keep shampooing himself.
"Whatever he does, his complexion won't change."
Get the shampoo.
- Coming !
"The cat is troubling me here, and the husband troubling me there."
Everyone troubles me.
What all do I manage?
"The water has gone cold, get the shampoo!"
Coming.
Take.
- Coming.
Why do you give me the shampoo in a bowl everyday?
Am I a beggar?
"Take a bath, but not in excess."
- Damn !
What shampoo is this?
It stinks!
"Was this shampoo, or egg?"
I'll benefit only if I serve him.
"Lado, my body is stinking of egg."
Smell me.
An egg shampoo will smell of egg.
Now eat.
Okay.
Will you eat?
Is it good?
Jackie!

"I'd suggest, it's not good to delay Radha's marriage now."
But there should be a nice match for her.
What about Mr. Prem Prakash's son?
He's little close in our relations.
But the boy is really nice.
"Even if we keep refusing the alliances, Jackie... ...will not come out of the jail for 2 years."
And it's difficult for us to let Radha... ...remain unmarried for 2 more years.
Its an absolutely lost case.
Gone.
"Oh, yes."
I forgot.
Your old friend has sent a letter.
From Singapore.
- Singapore?
He's Mr. Jimmy Thapa.
"Oh, Jimmy!"
He was my college friend.
Last year he was stuck with some custom problem... ...and I had helped him solve it.

Gotcha!
My!
It's coming here!
"Hey,this is a real elephant."
Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?
"Wh, what are you!"
I'm Atom.
Stop it!
"You are a robot, right?"
Hey!
Come here.

"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.

I am still ashamed for that.
You are embarrassing me by saying this.
Please have a seat.

Great!

"Enough, seema!"
- Please!
Thank you!
You too have some!
"- No. lt""s okay."
"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.

I sure have.
I'd like to say it to the lieutenant.
I'm afraid you'll have to say it to me.
Lieutenant Gerard's out of town.
SOPHlE:
"I never liked him, right from the beginning."
"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."

Jackie's got Geography with the one called Tom.
She says he just moved here from London.

Apparently their family just opened an organic shop on the high street.
Dishy and nutritious.
"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.
"We have to know ourselves, to see how boys see us."
Can you handle that?
"Okay, so it's time for the Physical Attractiveness Test."
Finished.

"""Maybe now is time to push our anger aside."
"What do you say?"""

"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."

"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."

Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out...
But it does not really fit the personality

So let me tell you what cutting edge astronomy looked like not so long ago.
It looked like this.
"First of all, that's just a sketch."
"Somebody stood at a telescope from night after night, incidentally wearing a top hat, sketching what they could see."
"And secondly, they're looking at a single object."
"In this case, it's what was known as a spiral nebula."
An island universe.
All right.

Well done!
Didn't I tell you?
"- I told you, you would be successful.- Well done my clever sister."
"Thank you, Meryem Abla.If it wasn't for you, I--"
What did I do?
You did it alone.
- You gave me courage.- But the labor was on you.
- Thank God.- Let's give the news to Kerim as well.
"Sure, he was waiting for your call anyway."
- Ops...
They wanted two teas.- I'll get their teas.
Maniac.
"I want to see whoever is responsible for the maintenance of this elevator, in my room."
And call the firm and tell them about this scandal.

You heard him.
How he threatened me.
He is very determined to get me in trouble.
Güney Bey...
You have a guest waiting at the reception.

Tell them to send her away.
How many times I have to tell you not to let that woman in this building?
You still asking?
He doesn't want to see her.
Güney Bey isn't in the company.
His car is here though.
This is what they told me.
I was going to give him something that belongs to him.
"Anyway, as he wishes."

The house is smelling wonderful.

"Ah yes, of course!"
I did get home safely.
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.

"Anyways, it was fun."
It was like we were shooting a movie.

But who gets to make all the important decisions?
- Stop worrying so much about it.
"Your life will be so much easier without Inochkin, you'll see."
If you only knew how much bad blood there is between him and Dynin.
- Hah.
"""Bad blood."""
Can you imagine what would happen if I spoiled even a tiny drop of his blood?
- All of comrade Dynin's blood just went bad!
Help!

Those jokes running under your editorial were a howl.

They'll show up any day now.
"You see anything suspicious, let me know."
"Banu, see what you did to us."
"Read it, further details in the paper."
- Go on read it.
- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."
"Please, if you wand to get well, my dear."
I am sorry.
I know I upset you so much.
I am sorry.

She didn't look tired at all.
She was outside all day.
She went to the jail with Sami Amca.
- Jail?

That's how I saw her.
- Good evening.
"- Good evening, how can I help you?"
- Gülten Hanım?
"- Yes, it is me."
"I am Münir Erkut, lawyer."
I told Barış all I had to say.
I don't want anything from him.
I have no demands.
All I want is to divorce as soon as possible.
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I'm not an attorney to the person you mentioned.
I am Kazım Gencerel's lawyer.
My condolences.
I had not told my daughter about it.
My condolences.
Your father wanted me to give you something.
Please come inside.

Come.
"No one from the mansion comes here, right?"
"Don't worry, no one can disturb us here."
"Harun said I had to go, but I am not going."
You... ...only thought of us...
"It is enough, my daughter..."
There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...
"Look, my darling."
There are people who can take care of us here..
Don't think of us.
Think of yourself from now on
Your husband. ..it is not good to leave him alone.

Good evening.
- Welcome...
- Thank you
Hello?
"Where are you, Narin?"
It is late.
I should go.
Let me drop you off.
"No, don't trouble yourself."
I can go by myself.
It is late.
It won't do to go by yourself this late.
"Go, my daughter."
"President, the ticket is ready."
Call Kang Hwi immediately!
He is in the practice room now.
President!!
"Did you see, President?"
"That is called Hapki Dance, isn't it good?"
Sit down.
"Ah, yes."
"As I was sleeping yesterday, I suddenly had an inspiration!"
"So, I came early because I wanted to complete the choreography."
I could make it big like this as a choreographer.
What is this?
Go and rest for a few days.
Why suddenly?
Did we get a schedule?
Ah!
Did we get a commercial?
What is all this?!
That is what I want to ask you!
Hey!
What is all this?
Why would I with this greasy guy?
What?
"You don't think that I really did this, do you?"
"President, don't you know me?"
I know.
You would never do something like this.
Exactly.
What is this?
It's that place!
You know?
"I know, but..."
- What are you guys doing here?

"Tomorrow, my friends, we need to aim for record heights."
Yes.
In being disciplined...
In being orderly...
In being talented.
- Who's missing?
- Inochkin.
- Fill the gap.
"- So, what about talents?"
- I've got three.
- From the entire troop?
"Don't tell me there are no talents among you, my friends."
"Sorry, I don't believe that for a moment."
"- Half a meatball, everyone."
"- And if you can't sing or dance, you can recite a poem."
You are stone.
"I have never asked you for anything, O Lord."
Today I ask for my son's life.
Please grant my son his life!
Please let my son live.
Take my life instead.
"Renu, I have good news for you."
Hello!
Where is Suraj?
- He is at a military hospital.
Hospital!
There's no cause for worry.
He's perfectly all right.
A bullet hit his shoulder and now it's out.
He'll be dancing within a week.
I told you that nothing would happen to Suraj.
God heard my prayers.
This means that our hero is perfectly all right.
He is no ordinary hero.
His plane caught fire and it crashed.
He landed with his parachute right in the midst of the enemy.
He was 20 miles away from our side... ... and he came back avoiding the shower of bullets.
Can we meet Suraj?
The visiting hours are from 4 to 6.
You can meet him then.
Goodbye!
"Come, aunty."
This is Suraj's room.
You can go in.
"Hello, aunty!"
Are you all right?
- Perfect!

When she bites her tongue.
"Hey, Hey!"
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!

Beware if you touched our shoes!
I am sorry.
"I need stone, not shoes."
I need stone!
Why?
Whose skull do you want to break?
"I am not mad that I will break somebody""s skull!"
No need to give justifications!
I have heard about many thieves!
But today I am seeing a fashionable thief!

"Maybe you don""t know who I am!"
You talk politely!

"(Energetic) ""Hurricane"" MV THE END!"
This is Washington D.C.
After a little break some members will get ready.
I heard Him Chan and Jong Up will be filming first.
I didn't want to waste time in the hotel.
I heard the set is near here so I came out to skateboard.
I like it here so much.
"Hi, I'm Him Chan."
"""Hurricane"" MV is over."
We were filming for a real long time.
There were many different places we went to.
"And today, we came over to Washington D.C."
"As soon as we got here, Jong Up and I had to film for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV."
So we're out here and it's pretty nice.
Zelo is here too.
Zelo seems to like America a lot.
Look at him.
But I'm a little worried about something.
L.A. and San Francisco were very natural and free cities.
Washington D.C. seems like a noble place.
I'm worried that Zelo will get scolded.
We're at the MV shooting set.
Wish us luck.
Goodbye.
We're heading to New York now.
New York is the final destination.
We'll try our best in NY too and head back safely.

But why did you come here?
You mean to say.. ..you came here to make your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea.
It's a stupid idea.

"Professor, can you lend me some money?"
How much do you want?
"Professor, you're a rich man, whatever you can spare."
For Tanya.
- For Tanya.
Give me tea and bread.

"Brother Kundan."""
"Brother Kundan, do you want to stay unmarried all your life?"
"Have you ever thought about love, marriage, girls.. ..or will I have to do that for you as well."
I did.
I also did.

"It was very beautiful and the song was called ""Natural Woman"" and I thought that you really was one."
D:

D:
"The jury agreed, Camilla, and what do you think the policeman over there think?"
CL:
"He thinks that everything I do is fantastic, so he just got another confirmation now."
D:
Do you know what I believe?
I think that the cop thought it was touching.
D:
Thanks to the jury.
Thank you so much Camilla and Kristjan.
J:
"Camilla, this is almost like a dream."
What great praise you got from the jury.

Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:
There are interlock systems everywhere.
Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...
Let's do it later.
Let's just talk now.
- About what?
-What painters do you like?
- There.
Have you buried the gold here?
"You will be buried here, sheikh."
Why was the bullet fired?
I think something is fishy!
Remember.. in front of me you had killed my mother.
"I won""t spare you, sheikh!"
"I won""t spare you!"
As per our information lran lnterpol had raided the place. sheikh Padar was killed.
And Tiger singh fled.

We will equally share the gold.
Now Tiger is going to come.

"1112 01:34:58,100 --&amp;gt; 01:35:01,200 You must be joking!"
"1113 01:35:05,462 --&amp;gt; 01:35:08,129 You know that Selim did not know about the money?"
"1114 01:35:08,300 --&amp;gt; 01:35:10,100 You did not tell him, No?"
"1115 01:35:10,795 --&amp;gt; 01:35:13,436 How was I suppose to know that it'sa secret?"
"1116 01:35:13,517 --&amp;gt; 01:35:16,158 I wanted to thank him.I thought he knows it too."
"1117 01:35:16,800 --&amp;gt; 01:35:18,300 God damn you, Sude."
"1118 01:35:21,900 --&amp;gt; 01:35:24,300 500.000 dollars..."
"Ender... 1119 01:35:24,509 --&amp;gt; 01:35:26,867 I'm talking about 500.000 dollars... 1120 01:35:26,921 --&amp;gt; 01:35:29,467 More money that I earn in a year."
"1121 01:35:29,600 --&amp;gt; 01:35:31,800 I gave my own money.. 1122 01:35:31,990 --&amp;gt; 01:35:34,629 I don't care...Wherever it is from."
"1123 01:35:34,685 --&amp;gt; 01:35:36,686 How can you take so much money and give it?"
"1124 01:35:36,686 --&amp;gt; 01:35:39,015 I gave it to him as loan."
"Even if it's so, you did not tell me."
Why did you hide it from me?
Faruk didn't want the situation to be known.
Landal， go to bed early
Okay
Lonely?
Why not call a girl?
Tina， on call?
Tina's here.
For taking out?
Yes
Where?
23 La Salle road， 2nd floor.
"2nd floor, get it?"
Yes， 15 minutes
Good
You want to take away my girl?
Never
What's going on at this hour?
You're lonely， I've come to keep you company
Please come in and sit down Yes
Come， come
Come， come
Look
Good.
See how you'll end up
You really are wicked
What's going on at this hour?
You're lonely， I've come to keep you company
Come in and sit down
Why don't you turn round?
Go and sit down
"Remember, when Tina comes， tell her to take off everything"
Then you take off everything to go to bed with her
lf any girls come， tell her to go home.
No... not you.
"Okay, I'll hang up now."
This IG seems very loyal to the Law.
It seems we must think of the other scheme.
I've thought of one.
What's that?
You'll disguise goons... ...and I'll become a police officer.
Then?
And we'll kidnap Shreekant's darling daughter Radha.
It seems someone is coming.
Have the goons gone?
Take me out from here.
Please...
Just a minute.
"Sheela, someone is passing."
- Don't make noise.
Move away!
- Stop!
I said move!
- What are you doing?
Leave!
Leave me!
- What are you doing?
I will not spare him!
"- Stop, sir."
"If you'll start firing, there'll be bloodshed here."
Damodar!
Damodar!
"See, what's does."
What's written in this letter?
"Mr. Shreekan, your daughter Radha will remain... ...in my custody, until Pasha is in law's custody."
Remember!
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
I feel suffocation over here.
I feel I'm jailed.
"Neither I can move about freely, nor can I sing."
And you've got no idea about music.
And you...
"Don't worry, baby."
We're with you.
It's just a matter of few days.
Moment the risk of goons is reduced we'll drop you home.
You'd never feel that.
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
Om!
Om!
Om!
Mother!
Mother!
"What happened, mother?"
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
- Shanta!
God!
Take care of my Kishan after my death.
"Don't say that, Shanta."
Today I'll bring all your medicines.
Today...
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
"Let it be, tormentor."
Let our eyes remain close.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
"Let it be, tormentor."
Let our eyes remain close.
"This beauty, o beloved."
ls smitten by you.
Look here.
Let eyes lock.
And let love happen.
You rule my heart.
You can ask people.
You are not aware. of the chaos that eyes have created.

Where is the gold?
"- I have the gold, sheikh."
But how could I have brought it here?
I have hidden it in the mountain.
You can take your share.
"Let""s go."
Where is the gold?
"Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well."
"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.

Had to sleep in makeshift shelters...
Cook on open fire.
Had to fetch our own water.
And do our own laundry.

And now?
Look around.
Tha-Tha-Tha-- That would be-- That would be great sometime.

Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]
- Nice car !

"No, I like the car."
"By the way, though, about prom ?"
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.

"That's Richie's sister by the way, the fireman."
Myself.
And Loretta Slader.
All four of us lived here.

You!
Why would they do this to me?
You want me to feel the pain?
"Yes, you want me to understand it."
So that I may show others.
Huzzah!
Excelsior!
- Right.
No.
- It's not a game.
What you want is you want a partner to return the ball.
- Do you want a partner ?
- Yeah.
"Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner."
- You do want a partner ?
"- Oh, I want a partner."
- Want a partner.
Good.
Good.
- Of course.
Good.

You'll miss it later.

That's amazing.
She's probably gonna want to do it soon.

Q: the full explaination.
We're encouraging everyone to chant Hare Krishna mantra
"Q: yet we're seeing now there's one quote in Padma-purana, the sa that same, without proper initiation, the mantra received is wihout effect."
So is it that those without proper connection they're not getting any benefit from chanting the mantra?
[What did he say?]
Q2:
[bengali] [onosoly??] progress is near impossible.
Proper progress.
"There maybe something like [unna??], [backward??] marriage?"
"Like [budwa??] activating and sadure, abruptly it may become or may not namabhas."
Fine.
I feel all right.

We're gonna have to get rid of the car.
We can take that ferry.
You'll have to walk a little.
"I can't, Johnny."
Come on.
"I'll help you, Gus."
I can't.
I will only hold you back.
"You gotta go alone, Johnny."
You got to.
I'll stay here.
I'll make it.
I'll send you a postcard.
( tense theme playing )
"I'm not gonna leave you like this, Gus."
Go.
"Go on, Johnny."
Run.
"Go on, run."
SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
"Better than me, better than its dad, better than both of us together."
"Please, let it be a girl..."
Why am I acting this way?
Am I a pervert?
"Good night, Princess."
How are things with your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.
Sister-in-law.
I also have...
"I have a worry, too."
But don't...
Don't tell your sister.
Your sister...
Here... flowers...
She wants me to propose like this.
Why'd she hit me?
Not enough money?

I ...wanted to ask ... if your dog was taken ill.
Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!
It happened like this...
That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"
Now I will draw!
- Give back the crayons!
Do you want a candy? - what?
Let's have it!
Here!
Have a treat!
"Watch out Sasha, don't eat it."
It'll turn you into stone!
Why did you bring it here at all?!
"Don't be angry, Valerian I'll bring you some chocolate tomorrow"
And me?
And you?
You'll get an ice cream! ans I'll buy you... a sausage.
"Mitya, have you perhaps seen my tablet somewhere?"
"I did, grandpa, here it is, your magic tablet!"
"Haha, It's not really a magic tablet I was just joking!"
See?
I'm healthy again!
So I don't need medication any more!
"Grandfather, Look!"
Why did he pretend it was only a joke?!?

Ah.. is there anyone here? heeeeeelp!
"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
Oh!
"How sweet, Tanya."
Red heart shaped box.
Very nice.
"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."
You will know what I am talking about.. ..once you meet my parents.

- 13.

"10, that's it."

A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.
My shoes.
"Hey, a daughter wants to talk to her dead mother."
- She is just being a good daughter.
- It's her business.
"If this makes everyone uncomfortable, I'll go there by myself."
- You'll walk there yourself.
Good idea.
- Add.
This is too much.
Do you have a heart?
"Hey, if you don't want to go with me, Get out of the truck."
What did you just say?
Read my lips.
I won't go.
I'm not going either.
"Ood, Add, where are you going?"
Come back now.
I won't.
What is this?
I'm not going.
"Since you have picked us up and raised us, you never did this to me."
Who is she?
You've just met her.
She's a liar.
Why are you serious with a whore?
What the...
Don't ever say that again.
I don't want to cause any more troubles.
I'll go.
Hold on.
"Shut up, you two."
Don't ever talk to my woman like that.
I don't like it.
Don't move
No!
Come back here!
Let her go or I'll destroy you!
One!
Two!
Three!
Where did she go?
Has anyone seen her?
No one?
Let me find her
Everyone!

That's our lesson
Did you enjoy the show?
That's the end of Jo-gu Ma's Horror illusion
Come on out
Amazing!
"Great job, today"
Just keep it up
You were great
It'd be nice if you were taller and your face smaller
Touch up your nose and eyes?
Great job
Thank you
You're a natural
Live with an actual ghost or something?
Wait
Don't go We're all going out for drinks
I have an appointment
You always say that
I have many appointments
"They asked students to turn off their cell phones in libraries, classes, hospitals and concerts and..."
Mom
- Mom!
- Huh?
Aren't you going to let me out?
What's wrong?
Does your stomach hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
Should I drive?
You don't even have a license.
You know what I mean.
"It's frustrating, unnerving,"
"- scary, sad, and futile."
-What is?
Poverty.
You know how long it's been?
Three years.
"But in those three years, nothing has changed."
I worked here part-time back then and I work here part-time now.
You've changed... you've grown much prettier.
You had no job then and you don't have one now.
"What drives me crazy is, in the future I'll be still here, and you'll be still unemployed."
Do you need a bag?
It costs 50 won.
- The total is 24 dollars and 80 cents.
"-Wait a bit more, give me a chance."
- I know I can do better.
- I've been waiting three years.
Hurry up and pay.
Will this work?
I think so...
I danced on stage with all my might.
"So my bones are thick, not thin."
Scanning Zelo's leg's to the end.
Shall we get started!
Shall we get started!
Who is this?
Shall we get started on filming?
It's my turn to lip sync for the MV.
I'm looking forward to it.
Since the background is so pretty.
Anybody with that background will come out very well for sure.
- Great job.
- Great job.
Great work.
MV lip sync is over.
Great work.
None
We have to shoot again.
My face is probably bloated right now.
I slept a lot.
It was past three thirty when I checked in the car earlier.
I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.
"- I don't think I can, I'm too sleepy."
This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
"-Anthony, not all French men are gay."
That sounds a little bit racist.
"-Okay, well, earlier today, he was doing some really questionable things."
"This is the living room, and I'll show you--"
Why are you holding my hand?
-Why would I not?
-Not gay!
-What?
-Not gay!
-What are you doing?
-Looking at gay porn.
"-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay."
"-Anthony, you can't be so racist."
Just because his culture is different it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.
-He was looking at gay porn.
-And who doesn't from time to time?
-True.
"-Dude, I gotta go."
I've been looking for French fries for the past five hours and I can't find them anywhere.
-(Pierre) I want to be... [knock on door]
"-(Anthony) Hey Pierre, are these your friends?"
They look like Richard Simmons.
"-You idiot, that's the Italian mafia."
-What the hell are they doing here?
-I have a lot of gambling debt.
I just can't say no to naked Twister.
"-Okay, it's time to eat s--t and die, sillies!"
-Yeah!
"You've messed with the wrong Italians, Pierre."
-I'm so scared right now.
Hold me.
-What?
I go to my post abroad tomorrow.
It's for a year.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's meet and talk.
- Let's talk later.
I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
We will see him together.
Okay have your seats.
He will be here soon.
Thank you.
"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.
Hello Can Bey.
"Yes, yes, we had sent them to the factory."
"Okay, I'll be there in half an hour."
See you.
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
"No Ri,"
"Eun Jo, I'm fine."
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
Jana:
Our...
"Ju: with ""It Rains""."
Ju:
"Guys, since I listened to this song for the first time, I fell in love with him."
"I love his voice, the voice that doesn't belong to that 19 years old body!"
It's perfect!
"I like ""Wild and Young ""too, but every time I listen to this one..."
"""Wild and Young"" is good, but there is something especial about ""It Rains""."
Ju:
4th Place is Exo- Growl!
Ju:
What amazing song!
"Definitely, it is one of the best songs of the year."
I have...
Jana:

"The best song for me is still ""Smoky Girl""  Jana:"
And one of Exo's best songs.
Ju:
Third Place F(x)- Rum Pum Pum Pum.
Ju:
"We did a MV Reaction, and I wanted to listen to again to see if I could like this song."
"And that's what happened, I really like it."
"The choreography is weird and cool, the song too."
"The lyrics are weird, it's about the wisdom tooth, and I mean they compare the wisdom tooth to their first love."
I thought that the lyrics were so crazy that that's why I liked Rum Pum Pum Pum.
So 2nd Place... my divas!
My band!
My Band!
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
Okay.
"All right, all right !"
"- Good hustle, guys."
- Good hustle.
But you can still lose.
You all saw what happened to Oz out there.
I don't want to ever see any of you thinking you're gonna score.
You don't score until you score.
- Until you score.
"- That's right, baby !"
[ Coach ]
It all boils down to today.
"For you seniors, this marks the culmination..."
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.
[ Coach ]
I want you to think about what this means to you.
Do you guys wanna look back on your days at East... and know that you used the time you had ?
"- Hell, yeah !"

"Good attitude, Ostreicher."

"Christ, I didn't tell ya to leave the game."
"I'm sorry, Coach."
"You got someplace more important to be, Ostreicher ?"
Yeah.
Ostreicher !

They have entered the forest.
We got a message from Kasi.
He said that he will kill that man and .. .. bring the girl before the hour of marriage.
He said he will not be your brother if he fails.
"Uncle, make me as bridegroom."
He kept the ring I gave to him.
That means father lied to me.
And I believed his words.
I did a big mistake.
Come on.
Move away.
Do you want to die?
What do you want?
- I want a lift.
This bus belongs to a marriage party.
You will not get the lift.
"This is your bus brother, come inside."

Neighbour?
Neighbour?
The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.
- Advice.
Anyone who thinks of me.
Public service.
Service open to all.
A solution to every problem.
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.
But...l always get there on time.
You understand?
Yes...
Let's end this.
That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.
- Can you please leave me alone?
- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6?
"Same as she did, OK."
You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear.
Volunteer:
"0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4."
I think you left out the number 3?
AB:
That's three.
"The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:"
10 to the fourth power.
"OK, any six of them."
(Laughter)
"Really scramble them up this time, please."
Volunteer:
"2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2."
Did you leave out the number 7?
And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
"For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries,"
I have one more question for the audience.
"By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?"
"If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand."
"Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first."
"What year was it, first of all?"
That's why I pick a gentleman first.
Audience:
1953.
"1953, and the month?"
November what?
23rd -- was that a Monday?
[laughter]
David:
"Okay, [laughter] there are some asexual people who will masturbate."
"But I know that's like very, very difficult."
Joy: asexual
David:
"It seems counterintuitive, but yeah, thank you for saying that."
Think about it: you can like having sex with a man and not like having sex with a woman
You can like having sex with yourself and not like having sex with a partner.
Joy:
Yeah.
Star:
Wait.
"Now, you're describing something that's-"
Joy:
You didn't answer the question.
Do you like to have sex with yourself?
David:
"Oh, me, personally?"
Joy:
Yes.
David:
I've tried it.
I mean it was all right.
Joy:
It's not all that?
[laughter]
David:
Yeah.
[laughter]
Joy.
It's not all that.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.
- What's going on?
"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
And from that blood I'll write a name... ...outside Shreekant's bungalow.
Radha!
"That's great, mister!"
You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.
"61 going once, 61 going twice."

I'm Amanda.
What makes me joyful this Saturday is this...
And a little terrified and really excited. woman:
"Oh, my God, did you feel that?"

Now your mama has made herself a little copy of Mama.
[woman speaking native language]
man singing:
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
Take him to the hospital.
He being bit by a stroke!
Pay your debt first!
Give me the money!
He is dying and you're still thinking about your money?
It's only his nose to big deal!
The stroke is going to kill him.
Let me call the ambulance for you.
"Ping, get me the phone."
Anything wrong with your nose?
Is it the police or the hospital?
"Just the same, anyway."
I've got some loan shark here bleeding.
Please come quickly.
It's alright now!
He's managed to stop the bleeding.
Thanks.
Mom was right in saying that everything is predestined.

"""The news-vendor kid called."
Sylvester's being hitting.
Come!
Hurry!
Look!
I don't live here!
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?

Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!

I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.

Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.

So do you know what I did?
I was wearing a similar gold chain.
And I gave that to him.
It's all about faith.
Anything you give is less.

Wow.

"Not just my gold chain, I will give up my gold ring too."

I'm your daughter.
What's that?
You're my daughter?
My daughter Malena is 6 years old and she's at home with my wife.
You are not my daughter.
You're just a subversive piece of shit.
We're here to educate you people.
The rich.
The landowners.
Now they'll be yours.
"Cows, bulls, hens, pigs - all yours."
Give me back my cow!
"You'll have to wait, my dear."
We'll give you everything in time.
You're a free woman.
A citizeness!
Here's where they buried him.
"Next morning the grave was open, the coffin empty."
Since then everyone passing by the graveyard gets in trouble.
- But people do drive past.
- But it's not him...
Didn't Pyotr go at night?
Hear that?
Hear that?
Father!
Look!
THE AVENGERS
Good Lord!
Is it true?
- Honest to God.
- He's talking through his hat.
"I didn't believe it myself at first, then looked around... and saw a coffin flying over the graves."
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound... not a sound.
Stop!
Stop!
You do better today.
"But when you kick him in the belly, swing your leg harder."
- Got it?
"Yes, sir!"
"What""s your age?"
"- 32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
What was your age when you joined the police force?
"32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
How long have you been in police service?
"- 32, sir! strange!"
How did you get stuck at 32?
"Yes, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"
You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana!
"Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat."
"But you read it in lndia itself. sir, his age was 275 years."
"And the secret of his long life was that.. ..he was a bachelor like me. sir, you should count a person""s real age after his marriage."
You are right!
You are an interesting man!
"Yes, sir! sir, shall I come with you?"
"No! lf you want, you can go and.."
"Yes, sir!"
Now it is too late!
Did you patch up with your beloved?
That is not a problem.
"But her unlucky papa, he interferes a lot, boss!"
"Boss, give me such an idea.. such an idea.."
That he stops interfering!
"Yes, boss!"
He should be completely defeated!
What does her father wants?
And this one is the camp director.
Comrade Dynin.

These locals are spoiling our whole regime.
"- Oh, relax, will you?"
- I heard there were cases of whooping-cough in the village.
We must make sure our kids avoid all contact.
- Avoid any contact... contact... contact...
"- Oh, dear, I shudder to think about the parents' day."
As if we didn't have enough trouble with locals.
Now we'll get some walking infections from the city.
- So what.
It's all good!
"- Why, why does he insist on this ""parents' day?"""
- They say Mitrofanov will be coming.
- Aaah.

We got married right away.
"908 01:14:40,135 --&amp;gt; 01:14:43,580 And this was the best decision in our live."
"909 01:14:46,100 --&amp;gt; 01:14:51,300 As child he use to say he would become an engineer, architect..."

"914 01:15:02,000 --&amp;gt; 01:15:05,400 Hopefully!"
My mom is excited.
"915 01:15:05,483 --&amp;gt; 01:15:07,351 You should get excited, you."

Thats one section
Alright
Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."
"El Señor Balzar of the Agency ""Fuera"" spoke with you last week about making a reservation for us."
"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Rumors have spread everywhere.
Huh?!
Are you sad?
Since the girl that was following you has left?
Seung Jo ah!
"Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor."
"Miss Calm Cat,"
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?
Have you heard?
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.
I'm leaving first.
Good luck
Congratulations.
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?
Of course.
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.
Do you think I'm a baby?
I also.... need to spend some time alone.
Look at you.
That's right.
"Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow."
Hurry!
Don't play too many games.
I won't.
Just leave quickly.
Let's go.
Ok
Aigoo
Alright!
Oh!
"""Seung Jo ah"" &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I came all the way here without even realizing it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; How did I end up here? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date."
Let them be happy...
Sorry...
You bring us tea and etc...
That's why...
Bring your tea when you come next time.
I'll brew it for you...
"Please, no money!"
Mustooo!
My brother!
How are you?
Eh?
Look what Muko brother has brought for you...
Do you remember what you did to neighbourhood's dogs and cats?
"Wasn't this Uncle Aslan's dog, Kral (King)?"
Do you remember this?
We used to hunt with this in the garden of your village house.
You were the best slingshooter.
The children of the village still have marks on their head.
All of them are your marks...
"Look, do you remember this?"
"You did this to me, remember?"
"He doesn't even look, dude..."
He is completely lost.
Unbelievable...
My brother...
My dearest brother...
Come on...
Take this.
Musto???
You see...
"He took the sling, dude."
"Keep your maniac under control, brother..."
"JlN Dal-rae, from Youngbyun, Yaksan!"
"Dad, you named me, so don't forget it."
Okay?
"Dad, you're losing weight."
"Good morning! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's Ji-hwan, a friend from neighborhood.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was out exercising, brought these for you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stopped his mental age around ten.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How pitiful, so I play with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Dal-rae! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's Young-hoon, my boyfriend.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good looking, huh?"
"Master of Taekwondo as well.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Always finishing in 1st place.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Took some time, but finally found myself the one.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Hi!
Keep practicing.
I missed you.
Changed your hair.
It's pretty.
Let me walk you to the lecture hall.
That's okay.
Hey...
Took three months just to grab your hand.
Feels good!
Looking for Ji-hwan?
Yes.
I don't see him anywhere.
Hasn't come to practice.
Doesn't answer the phone either.
Hmm...
Do it for love of movies.
"Hi, how are you?"
"Good, how are you?"
"Excuse me, but..."
Can you hand me the tissues?
Damn!
Stop!
I'll kill you!
And be quick.
"Ok, boss."
Here the connection is removed.
Let us put it in the girls room.
"Hey Anjanna, put this lantern in the girls room."
"Hey, he is escaping with the girl."
Catch him.
Is everyone safe?
Let us go from here.
We are waiting for a long time now.
We didnt see any train.
I am scared.
Is there any train now?
Why are you scared?
Not for myself.
I am feared about Shailu.
I asked in the enquiry.
"There is only one train, that too goods."
It will not stop in this station.
Still Venkat and Jagan has not came.
How can we leave them?
Venkat told us to leave with Shailu whether he comes or not.
I dont come until Venkat is here.
Here they come.
Venkat!
Is everything all right?
Do you know how scared I am?
When will the train arrive?
There is only one goods now.
Let us somehow try to catch it.
You are not coming with us.
What are you saying?
So what?
Things are expensive!
Don't you have a job yourself?
How much can I make?
How about Moon?
What can he do?
I won't count on him.
Go to hell and don't ever come back! 你干嘛挂啦?
What are you doing?
Why begged him for his money?
I'll have money next week.
Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?
I'll call and inform you.
Make your daughter have a rest.
Hi there!
Your daughter got a stroke?
Stroke yourself.
Let me remind you.
You played me last time.
Don't ever try play tracks with me!
Pay!
He has forgotten all of us.
Hatun Abla...
Look...Maybe this baby will be born but...
Mustafa won't even recognize it.
"What kind of husband or man... ...or father he will be, that I don't know, but..."
"If you and the doctor ask and if Narin helps and goes to the hospital to see him,  maybe he will get better."
Stay away from Narin!
Enough of your malice!
Enough!
"Hatun Abla, for every cruelty I did to you... for my every misbehaviour, forgive me!"
Please...
"Look, I will cary you on my back until I die."
I will clean you...
I will be your slave.
"Please, forgive me Hatun Abla."
"Doctor, please help..."
"Look, If you want, I can give you golds I kept at my mom's house."
"Fatma, take me..."
"Hatun Abla, please!"
"Hatun Abla, please forgive me."
Pull yourself together...
Get up...
Please...
Inci Teyze...
Get up my girl...
"Hatun Abla, please..."
Asiye...Pull yourself together...
Maybe you should give her some medicine???
"Not now, mom..."
Let me take you home.
They will be worried.
Who will worry about me?
Move over.
Let's go to the station first.
I'm gonna throw them into the can!
I'm gonna throw you into hell!!
"-You guys come along too, we need witness."
- Ok.
You stop!
Stop there!
You stop right there.
"Come here, you..."
Don't come any closer.
Let go of me.
Don't follow me!
Stop right there!
"Man, I'm dumb."
"I should have ran downhill. if you don't have the smarts, the body suffers."
"Dammit, look who it is?"
Dear hubby.
You bastard.
You put someone after me!
Where are you?
Tell me now!
I You're dead!
You crazy?
Tell you where I am?
You think I won't catch you?
I'll chase you to the end and throw you in the can.
Sure.
I'll just go to the ends of the earth and wait.
We'll have it out there!
Are you in your right mind?
Making jokes?
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
I understand your intentions.
I have already studied the book of heart.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
Greetings.
- Greetings.

"lf Tiger singh found out, he will not spare you!"
Get lost!
Hey!
"Don""t aggravate the matter!"
Fine!
I am dead for you!
"But don""t instigate my son!"
Who are you to separate me from my son? son?
Whose son?
"A criminal""s son?"
"A smuggler""s son?"
Take your son!
I hate him! seema!
You can hate me as much as you want!
"But don""t abuse my son."
Nobody is born evil in this world.
"People""s circumstances make them evil."
"20 years ago, destiny played a cruel joke on my family."
You know.. my father used to work in the lighthouse. stop!
Think before you do anything!
I have thought about it!
"Let""s inform the police!"
How will we reach to the police? smugglers have surrounded the lighthouse!
Have you also joined hands with them?
You may think so.
Traitors!
"Today because of people like you.. ..the country""s state is bad!"
Patriot! sheela!
You! - shekhar!
What happened to you?
- Father!
Who has done this to you?
Traitors!
Raman has joined hands with the smugglers!
Today I saw him.. and he did this to me!
"I won""t spare him!"
So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."
Good bye.
Now we'll be moving on from San Francisco to Las Vegas to film.
This is Las Vegas.
The weather is really nice.
It's warm.
Las Vegas!
It's warm.
"Weather is good, scenery is good."
I feel good.
"""Seoul, Tokyo N New York City"""
Everyone is making bets going around.
Las Vegas!
Will you... will you listen to me?
You can ask for my life.
Because now I will not be able to live without you.
Kishan!
You...
You... surrender yourself.
"Sacrifice makes love immortal, Kishan."
Love is a test.
"And those who fear it's result, their love is just a pretence."
You may be a criminal in the eyes of society... ...but you are a true man in my eyes.
And I want to show this to the world.
- Radha!
Kishan!
Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.
I'll do as you say.
- Kishan!
Radha!
Don't cry!
"Don't cry, Radha."
Now that I've got you... ...I don't even fear gallows.
I'll surrender myself.
Kishan!
I'm proud of your love.
And I'll always be proud of it.
- Radha!
"Kishan, promise me that whenever you'll return... ...we'll meet at this place."
Near this temple.
- Sure!
If I'll come back.
"Don't say that, Kishan."
"Mira!&amp;gt; Okay , we will talk later."
Can you stop for a minute?
I am trying to explain you something.
Can you wait for a minute?-it's OK.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please!
You always are like this.
Go!

And I had better be fucking right.
"So, Bovver... ...is there anything else you wanna tell us?"
"Listen, Tom, please."
This is how it's gotta go down.

"You know, there comes a time... ...when the best reputation you can have is the one where your family--"
- What is it?
- Get down.
Get the fuck down.
"Hello, boys."
Jesus.
Pete.
"Pete, come on, man!"
"Hello, Terry."
Fuck off!
Terry.
Terry.
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey after all these years.
Just get it out.
"If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you."
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
Do you see this star?
I want you to draw this star down here.
Take your time.
You worked so hard on that!
I want you to pick up a penny in one hand and then you're going to put it in these fingers.
Drop it in here.
OK can you do three of them?
You do one at a time.
Take one from that hand and put it in that one.
Great job!
Let's put them back.
This time I'm going to count while you do it and then time you.
So you're going to go as fast as you can when I say go.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Let's do it one more time.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Start with one hand and one foot in front of us and the other hand and other foot are going to be behind us.
I'm going to jump and switch them.
Jump and switch them.
Can you try it?
Alright.
You have to switch your hands and your feet at the same time.
OK are you ready?
When I say go I want you to go until I say stop.
Ready?
Go.
Good.
Stop.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"For breakfast at midnight,"
To fall in love with strangers.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
Yeah!
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely at the same time,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when,"
"We forget about the deadlines,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if,"
You keep me next to you.
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright,"
"If we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're, twenty-two, twenty-two!"
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"This place is too crowded,"
Too many cool kids.
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway?
Ew).
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"We ditch the whole scene,"
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping.
Yeah!
And transformation magic
"Overrated, right?"
I needed something really unique
Just then
I saw a strange woman
One more time?
She never smiled
Like she had a dark secret
I can't really explain it
So
I followed that mysterious woman
It felt so strange
How should I put it?
Like a ghost was about to pop out of a wardrobe
Just then
I had an awesome idea!
Exorcist magician
Rattle
Wardrobe ghost
Magic spell!
HORROR MAGlC SHOW
Jo-gu Ma Rocks!
I'm a star!
Mega hit!
Geez!
I built up the courage
From then on became a team
And my magic show became a sensation
SPELLBOUND
Why did you come here?
The one who killed you is here?
Is the killer watching you
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
Look there.
Gods are bare-bodied.
Like this.
They're never fully covered.
"That's your wedding photo, right?"
- Yes.
Wearing that traditional attire.
"So, did you only wear a traditional attire.. ..since your wedding?"
"No, right?"
- No.
See.
That's our older image.
"Conch in one hand, mace in the other."
Where are yours?
"lf I keep holding them all day, won't my arms hurt?"
Think.
"Actually, our latest photos haven't been updated on Facebook."
"People still use the older ones, and we let them."
We don't have a problem.
- Let them.
- That's enough.
You're boring me now.
"Get out, leave."
Mahadev!
- Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.
"Yes, coming."
Coming.
Mahadev!
What happened?
"What happened, Kanji?"
See him.
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
Is it okay living here?
"Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small."
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
"Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae."
"Excuse me, Hae Ra."
I have something to tell you.
"It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen."
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean...
Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
"I have tried my best not to think about it,"
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
"You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it."
"Take your time, I will pay and leave now."
Hae Ra.
I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
Yes!
"You're happy I got tickets for the game, huh?"
Yeah yeah
Huh?
"You're happy, huh?"
"Yeah yeah, it's great"
"That's a nice gift, isn't it?"
Yes!
"It really pleased you, huh"
"It wasn't easy to get tickets, huh"
"Well, it was easy for me, one my friends works in an office and was able to give me tickets"
"On top of that, we have good seats, I think"
"I'm not a soccer fan, but, really, I'm happy"
"Also, I must say it's a beautiful game"
"A nice game, no, really, I like it"
"I feel good seeing him happy, it pleases me, it's..."
Really...
Thank you!!!
"Oh, you're not gonna put make-up on, again?"
"Look, Loulou, my lipstick is all gone"
What?
Miss Universe!
Miss Universe...
"Careful, there, oh!"
"Stop it, Loulou, you're being silly"
"Oh, come on!"
"But, look, you're an idiot!"
Careful!
"Stop it, Loulou, it's really not funny!"
"I know it's not funny, can't do anyhting about it, it's the car that does that all the time"
"Stop it, I'm telling you!"
"Oh, come on, breathe!"
"Cind-who? fuck'n ""rella""?"
Jesus!
Who the hell's naming these kids?
Goddamn my head.
So it turned into a yearly ritual.
Is that a crime?
Yes.
"OK I have a huge family, and yes OK I may have snuck into their homes after dark - but only because I didn't want to wake them."
What?
I told you - I'm not one to skimp on the Gandja..
Ahhh... it's called MUNCHlEEEES.
Ya - all I did was eat a few cookies and maybe grab a glass of milk?
And are you forgetting I DlD leave them a few gifts?..
So what?
What's the difference if I do the Return or someone else does the return for me?
They still get to exchange it for something they want.
Oh come-on.
I'm sure a toddler can find something cool from Joe's Big-Boy Shop.
What?
No fuck'n way!
You can't pin that on me!
I have absolutely nothing to do with that kid Jesus.
I want a lawyer.
"Yo Guys, it is Keralis, I am here just to tell ya that I am livestreaming."

"Harmattan, Burton &amp;amp; Smith."
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
"Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas... ...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
You have to make it in time.
"Peter, you're a nice guy."
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
"Hey, what, are you stupid?"
Whoa!
He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
"Hey, you guys."
No playing in the streets.
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
See you.
"Way to go, Spidey!"
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
"Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing."
"But to me, is serious."
"Is serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
You're fired.
I'm asking you to leave.
Please.
You got the newspapers?
What does it write about us?
"Look, I'm asking you, please, don't open your mouth no matter what they ask you."
"Okay, Kadir Bey."
Don't you worry.
- And Kerim has just went out.
"- Yeah, I saw."
"- ""They admitted they money""  - Fatmagül better not see this."
Good morning.
"- Fatmagül, don't read it."
- I agree.
This is sweet.
This will reduce all  the cheering to nil.
- You see how the tide has turned.
- That's right.
Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."

Europa (moon)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system.
"Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
"The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century."

"The fight or flight response lets animals respond quickly to threats. This system is universal in vertebrates. That shows it is ancient in origin, and very important."

His work influenced many other writers in the 20th century."

"If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked"
"Yeah,"
I understand.
"They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress"
and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately
Once every five years?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, you have got a pretty big family."
Yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.
"Oh, yeah."
And you?
"Yeah,"
"we have a pretty big family,"
"but most of us,"
"well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia."
Uh-huh.
"Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania."
Yeah.
Most everybody is right in that area.
That makes it a lot easier.
A lot more convenient.
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.
Yeah.
because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
Yeah.
They put one together for our family about once every June.
"It was on my grandmother's birthday,"
"but she is, she is gone now."
"Yeah,"
see that is kind of what happened with ours.
That is why we have not had one in a long time.
Yeah.
Uh.
"So, so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do."
"There is, course, the the Grand Canyon"
"and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way."
Yes.
"And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
"and, uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too."
I imagine.
"Yeah,"
I would imagine they are.
"Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country."
Yeah.
I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now
"I think it's called a job,"
I don't know
"Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?"
No
not around here.
Oh.
Not around here
Place is forested with with those concrete trees.
"Uh-huh,"
"lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, I guess that's God's place, too."
"Anyway, Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?"
Yeah.
"Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California"
"I took, uh, three weeks."
Three weeks.
And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
"Yeah,"
"the whole family, then, was in on this?"
Uh-huh.
"It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six months pregnant."
Uh-huh.
"So I don't know,"
it worked pretty well.
"It was one of those, uh, those, dome type pop up tents."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Nice and quick and easy to put up.
Yeah.
Packs away nice and small
"and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto."
"Well, that's true,"
that's true.
It was a lot of fun.
"I guess the last real, uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years ago."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias."
"Wow,"
that's got to be beautiful territory.
"Yeah,"
"it's gorgeous,"
I love the big trees.
"Just, just the drive up through, uh, up the coast line and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though."
Yeah.
"What, like, Sequoia National Park?"
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had been there before when I lived in California,"
"but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe"
Yeah.
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"
Golly.
"and the other one is in Everett, Washington."
How did they end up so far away?
"Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh,"
Those are the youngest ones?
"Yeah,"
"well, the"
"the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that."
Uh-huh.
"Boy, that's, those are a long way."
"And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,"
"How,"
"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy"
"but, you know, he's"
Uh-huh.
"I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?"
"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace."
Uh-huh.
"And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well."
Yeah.
"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months"
Uh-huh.
and I have not had to use the heat.
Wow.
Because it's all geothermal.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
"And with all the,"
"see I've got,"
on the south side is all glass.
"Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass."
Yeah.
"I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet."
So it's almost all glass.
Wow.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows."
She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
"Oh, I see."
"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
"those those are,"
"we'd, I've done one,"
I helped somebody do one of those before.
"Those are, those are, you know,"
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
"But it's,"
No
I designed it from scratch and did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
"They're pretty forgiving, you know."
You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
"It's a,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"That's not near, like building a house or anything"
"but,"
"Yeah,"
those are nice.
"Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know."
"I don't know,"
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
"I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
"or,"
"I,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds nice.
"All done by yourself, huh?"
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
Oh.
which my son goes hunting.
He goes deer hunting.
He goes duck hunting.
"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, you know."
"As far as  just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around."
"Right,"
right.
Right.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I agree too.
"I, uh,"
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns."
There's just too many.
"Well, no."
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things."
"Right,"
"and I,"
"yeah,"
"right,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard."
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know."
"Yeah,"
"well I suppose you could. Uh,"
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on."
Yeah.
"It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess"
Yeah.
"And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat."
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
"You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney."
Uh-huh.
"They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing"
"and how children can, can do that"
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
"Wow,"
that's cute.
"That's neat,"
yeah.
"When you,"
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
"Well, when you start early, I guess,"
Hi.
How are you doing?
"What,"
I couldn't hear you?
"I said, how are you doing?"
I'm doing fine.
"I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now."
"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it was a wonderful environment.
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
Uh-huh.
I see.
"So, it worked well."
Oh.
How about you?
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
Yeah.
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
Uh-huh.
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
"Right,"
like half day programs.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
and this is one of the few churches that did it.
There were a couple downtown Dallas
"we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, central  New Jersey, you know,"
Okay.
"we're like, uh,"
"Well, that's nice, too."
"Yeah,"
"oh yeah,"
"it was beautiful,"
"that's why I, I really miss it."
"I, I don't really like it here at all"
"Really,"
"yes,"
"my wife's been away for twenty-five years,"
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
"Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,"
"and her mother was from New York,"
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
"Yeah,"
"so they,"
Yeah
"Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,"
"but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling."
"Well, yeah,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and, then, of course they call, you know,"
"before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous"
I know.
"you know, I said, this is absurd,"
"I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing."
"That's a, that's a good suggestion."
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them,"
"I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills"
and they're bouncing checks all over the place
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
"uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks."
"Well, we have,"
"we used to, when I was younger"
Yeah.
we'd go every weekend.
All right .
But we haven't done whole lot of it lately.
Yeah.
I'm kind of into it.
"I'm, uh, kind of a sailor."
Yeah.
"I'm up in Minneapolis now,"
but I was in Florida
"so, uh, yeah,"
I was kind of into it for a while there.
Were you sailboating?
"Yeah,"
for the most part.
Yeah
Yeah.
"I had a little sail,"
"Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here"
No
"Just motorboat's all we,"
What part of Texas you from?
"Uh, Nacogdoches."
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
and it's changed their perspective.
"And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer."
Uh-huh.
"So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would  think, uh,"
"Well, that's, that's great."
"I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing."
"Well that's,"
"Like I said, I think it does,"
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes
Yes.
Well
"Well, I guess, um,"
did you have anything else?
"No,"
no
I guess that's about all.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, I enjoyed talking with you."
"Well, good talking with you."
And I hope you have a good evening.
You too.
Thanks.
Okay.
"Bye,"
bye.
Bye
Okay.
"Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, child care, Mary Dell?"
Oh yes.
I'm an old experienced hand.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
and you can do a
it makes things very convenient.
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I've never tried using that,"
I don't know too much about it.
"What about,"
"have you, did you use commercially available software"
"or,"
"I have, I have used Lotus."
"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I,"
not heavy use.
"I've used, uh, D Base"
"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
I've been through three classes
Uh-huh.
and I have a great deal of respect for it.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
I do some
Uh-huh.
"and I,"
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
"I've never used D Base, um,"
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
"Yeah,"
Isabelle Chang.
"Okay,"
"thanks for that, uh, reference."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, probably four or five days."
Uh-huh.
"Well, that is great."
"Well, I hope the weather stays real good for them. And, and, uh, that you have a good visit and everything."
"Well, thank you"
Thanks.
And I hope your garden does good.
Yeah.
And the same to you.
"And, so. Okay."
"Well, it was really nice talking to you."
A pleasure.
"And, uh, good luck in your, this venture."
"It is, uh, like I said,"
it has been real interesting.
So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying it
I am sure I will.
"In, in fact, if I had not been preparing for this, the out of town visitors, I probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days."
"Yeah,"
I forget to.
"The day goes by,"
and I forget to make a call usually.
"Well, I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now, I will, I will start doing it"
"Great,"
great.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, thanks, Jean."
Uh. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
"is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?"
"and I say that's great, why not, you know."
"Oh, my,"
uh-huh.
"Yes,"
"why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's,"
"I believe that, uh, we in that category,"
and I'm not in that category quite yet
No.
"but, we are seasoned minds."
"Oh, yeah,"
you're really ready to learn finally.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen."
"Yeah,"
"it was,"
It was a complete waste of money.
"Yeah,"
"settle down,"
"we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study"
"and, uh we know our limitations."
"Right,"
right.
"We,"
Right
"and, uh,"
And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether.
No.
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
"At seven,"
yeah.
"We're past, yeah, we're past that age"
"I've, I've seen it, uh,"
"and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,"
"it's just so dreadfully expensive,"
and there's just so many other ways live down there.
Yeah.
It's not a treat
Uh-huh.
it's what you do every day.
That's right.
You know.
That's right.
"Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the, on the beach and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
"and, and that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left."
"That's right,"
"So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do."
that's right.
Right.
Right.
"Well, do you live like along, uh, Houston, down there?"
"No,"
no.
I live in Dallas.
I lived in Dallas.
"oh, okay."
"But you, uh,"
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
"Yeah,"
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
yes
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"
"well two, two of them actually."
"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one."
Oh that was great one.
"Wasn't that fabulous,"
"and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY."
"Oh, I loved it."
"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,"
and I need to go see it.
"Oh, you need to see that."
Yeah.
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
Uh-huh.
and this all took place in the South.
Oh my.
"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet."
"You bet, especially in the South."
"Yes,"
"right,"
"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie."
The acting was phenomenal.
"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it."
"Oh yes,"
Jessica Tandy won best actress
"Yeah,"
yeah
"And these days that helps, doesn't it?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
It really does.
I know what you mean.
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
"Um, I do that a lot."
Uh-huh.
I do spaghetti a lot.
"Yeah,"
it seems like most people like spaghetti.
"Yeah,"
I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.
Yeah.
"Because, um, I don't know,"
"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
I guess.
"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's right.
"And, um, we don't entertain that often,"
"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Most,"
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.
"Okay,"
Gene
"So, it's nice to talk with you"
"and, um, food is a very intriguing thing."
"Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, nutritionally good for us."
"Yes, sir."
What kind of dining out do you like?
"Well, there is two kinds."
"One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant."
Oh.
"Uh, you know, something nice."
Yeah.
"And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy"
"Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up."
It's a local Mexican restaurant.
Uh-huh.
"because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and everything."
"Pancho's, that's,  a new one."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it's a chain down uh,"
it goes up into Colorado and down here.
I don't know where else it is.
What about you?
We have one called Chi Chi's in in our area.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba"
"but it's just, it closed recently."
"But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think."
Isn't it Mexican?
"I think,  think it might be."
Really.
"It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something."
"Oh, no"
"No,"
no.
"See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now"
and they go isn't that a nice van
"and I go, um."
"Not really, you know."
How about  a Greyhound bus
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.
Maybe practical.
Yeah.
"I mean that, you know."
Isn't that a practical van.
There's some that are prettier than others
and
"yeah,"
"the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like"
"but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know."
"It's not like, like driving a little sports car."
Yeah.
"It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive."
Yeah.
I don't think that happens
"so, but I, I love mine,"
"so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii"
and I just went home
and I walked in
and I picked it out
And the same way with those calls.
"What is it,"
"oh M C I, M C I really does."
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back."
M C I
what's that?
M C I
it's the long distance telephone company.
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up."
"Uh-huh,"
well they they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.
They just keep calling back.
"I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,"
Uh-huh.
"so, uh, I'm very polite"
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely"
"and I hang up and, don't bother me after that."
Uh
Yeah.
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me.
Uh-huh.
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau."
Oh yeah.
That bothered me.
Uh-huh.
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
Right.
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
and I don't understand what their need to know is.
"yeah,"
"I agree,"
"it's, it's pretty tough that way,"
"and, I know, even like with your school books and papers."
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
"See,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
"That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though."
"Yeah,"
"well, actually I do know,"
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
"and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,"
"but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"And that,"
"I mean, I've, I've used it once,"
"All right,"
"well do you play any musical instruments or,"
"No,"
I don't play any.
I used to.
"Oh well,"
I think everybody took piano lessons
"so,"
"Everybody,"
sure.
I mean
You know
"But it is nice,"
"it is a, it is really a nice area."
"I, I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,"
and we could not get her out of the what she called the English back garden. Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn.
"Oh, really?"
Oh.
And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn
"Oh, good heavens"
Not me
I avoid the sun
"Well, yeah,"
"basically I do, too."
"Yeah,"
"it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass."
And I try to cover up when I do the lawn
"Well, I, that, that is really healthier, frankly."
"Yeah,"
"well, I have had a little, a couple of problems"
"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier."
"And, uh, we are just crazy"
"But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot."
"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,"
she is more wrinkled.
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Get the computers out
Which is too bad.
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
hard.
Uh-huh.
It's so difficult for them.
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
was that in your home or in someone else's home?
Until they were two.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
both times they were at our house.
Uh-huh.
So you were able to have somebody come there.
"Are, are you a T I-er?"
"No,"
"no,"
I work there as a temporary.
"Oh, really."
"But, are you at T I?"
Oh yeah.
So you have to do the random drug testing.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about,"
I'm so much for it.
I don't really have much to comment about it.
There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.
"How many times have you called,"
or have you been participating in this?
"Oh, about ten or eleven calls."
"Oh, you got ten,"
"well you, you've passed me up."
Right.
This is about six times.
Oh.
"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too."
Yeah.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.
"No,"
I think it's good.
"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,"
but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.
"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I."
"I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,"
"and I've, I still play the piano as of today."
Do you?
"Yes,"
I do.
"I started,"
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
"But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band."
"I played the drums,"
"I played the clarinet,"
I played the trumpet.
Wow
"Uh, you know, whatever"
"and so I, I still sing,"
and I sing in the choir today
"so,"
All right
"I I enjoy the music,"
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
"It always sounds like,"
"for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know."
True
"So, how long did you play?"
Only for about three months.
Three months.
"Yeah,"
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
"I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh."
"Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song."
"Yes,"
I am familiar with that.
"I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it."
"And we bought it from someone who was in it,"
"but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm not sure what happened,"
"but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years."
"Oh, no."
"I, I, I found a lot of things,"
"but,"
"I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia."
"Oh, my,"
yeah.
"Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois."
"Oh, do they have one?"
"Yes,"
they do.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
"Well, I learned something already"
Yeah.
"Well, let's see,"
"the three questions are what, uh,"
How much time do you spend with your children?
Very little. Because they're grown.
Oh
What?
They're grown and gone.
"Oh, yeah,"
"well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college"
and the other one is in high school.
Huh.
"But he's in a box, right?"
"No,"
"no,"
"no,"
"in fact, it's funny."
"He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
he was just kind of walking around.
Didn't he used to?
Not really.
He was always in the box before.
Oh.
"Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's what I was thinking.
"Well, do you do any recycling?"
"Uh, we do here."
"Uh, see, what do we recycle?"
"We, they recycle,"
they have bins
Yeah.
"and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles"
and I think that's all they have.
Oh.
What about you guys?
"Well, we, uh,"
"there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,"
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers
"And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,"
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
right.
"But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people"
Uh-huh.
"and then by time you pass everything around,"
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
"So,"
"Well,"
"But anyhow, I,"
"Thank God for microwaves, you know."
"Yeah,"
"you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know."
Yeah.
"But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties."
"Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas"
Yeah.
and I have my family.
"Right,"
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
"and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either"
"and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready"
Uh-huh.
"and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, uh, Spaghetti"
Right.
"You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think if they want one, they're going to get one."
"Oh, you know"
You know.
true.
That's true.
"The bad guys are, you know,"
"like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
And that was hard too.
"I, I lucked out with really good people both times"
but I know so many people that are never able to find that
"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,"
so
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you have a nanny
or did you have someone  that lived in with you?
Yeah.
"Well no,"
she didn't live with us.
"Uh, the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school  just purely on baby-sitting money."
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.
Uh-huh.
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had  because both our parents are dead.
Yeah.
Oh.
"So that, that was a plus from  that respect as well."
Oh gosh.
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"I have, uh,"
I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
Uh-huh.
"I was just listening to a program this morning,"
"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,"
"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,"
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
"Okay,"
what kind of dinner parties have you had?
"Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and I had help with them."
"Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it,"
"I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers"
"and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres"
"and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,"
Uh-huh.
"you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to."
"Whatever you like, huh?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh, you put that in"
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
"and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes"
Um.
and they are so good.
"Oh, that sounds delicious."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
"You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,"
"but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick."
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
"and that, that's true, uh, uh, you know,"
"the, the water was murky,"
and I would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
Huh-uh.
"huh-uh,"
no
I wouldn't want to eat them.
"No,"
"So,"
"no,"
no.
Yeah.
You went to Galveston.
"Uh, I have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water"
Uh-huh.
"the, uh, what is it, the Flagship?"
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Is it still there?
It sure is.
I like that place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It most certainly is, so, uh, so that, it, it was, it was certain things that were enjoyable about it,"
"but, uh, I don't, I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then, because of all the oil spills that they have had,"
"and, uh, it always smelled the entire time we were there."
"It was,"
"I didn't realize that had happened, for some reason."
Yeah.
"We went swimming one time, in the whole week that, we were there,"
"and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool, because the water was so awful,"
"and,"
"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care."
"I, I, give me cyanide."
"I mean, is it )),"
"Yeah,"
right.
I'll take anything you know.
Uh-huh.
"I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me."
"Ri-,"
Exactly.
Go ahead.
"And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,"
Exactly.
"let them, do it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what I think they're saying too.
Have you had any snow up your way?
"No,"
"we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas"
"and, uh we had a lot before Christmas."
Um.
The ski resorts were really
"and, uh,"
"but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,"
"so,"
"but no, uh, no snow."
Um.
"The snows all melted off uh,"
"Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend"
"and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way."
"Uh-huh,"
"And,"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, you know,"
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.
Vulcans age a lot better
"Well, yeah,"
"he didn't look too bad, did he?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"Matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, uh, NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK"
Imagine that.
"Yeah,"
that's amazing.
"But, did they have some pretty good special effects?"
"Oh, excellent, excellent special effects."
"But I think the script was, you know, just incredible compared to the last one."
"Yeah,"
"FIVE was, the script was bad, bad, bad"
"Well, you know why?"
"No,"
I don't.
Why?
"Uh, William Shatner wrote it."
"Oh, is that right?"
"And even worse, he directed it."
"Uh,"
"Leonard, Nimoy, he does a lot better."
"Oh, yeah,"
"he, in fact, uh, he didn't direct this one."
He produced this one
"But he directed the one before, uh, I think STAR TREK FOUR, something like that."
"In 1630 Breenbergh returned to Amsterdam. In 1633 he married, and received a yearly wage of 60 pounds from the court of king Charles I of Britain. He remained in Amsterdam until his death, where he made popular paintings and etchings of Italian buildings. There he was influenced by the pre-Rembrandtists such as Pieter Lastman and Nicolaes Moeyaert, but he placed their Biblical and mythological scenes in Italian landscapes."
"His only registered pupil is Jan de Bisschop, who was his pupil in the 1640s until 1648. He influenced the painters Jan Linsen, Scipione Compagno, Laurens Barata, Charles Cornelisz. de Hooch, Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen, Francois van Knibbergen, and Catharina van Knibbergen."

"""White Lies"", released in July 2007, is the first single from Paul van Dyk's album ""In Between"". It features vocals from Jessica Sutta, former member of the Pussycat Dolls."
"""I had a lot of fun working with Jessica. Her lascivious voice and sexy attitude reflects the theme of the single perfectly."" said Paul van Dyk via press release."
Jessica also spoke about working with Paul Van Dyk:
The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."
"The track has been a success on the American dance charts, peaking at #3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2007, becoming Paul Van Dyk's highest charting single. On Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, it debuted in the top 40 in late August 2007, since then it has also hit the #3 spot. It has reached #80 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007."
"On Billboard's Hot Dance Singles Sales chart it has been #1 for four weeks. It has also reaching #38 in Germany's pop charts, #4 in Turkey's top 100, #14 in Finland and #8 in Canada's top 40 charts."

"Charles Bodinier (6 January 1844 - 1911) was a French theater manager. After working for the Comédie-Française he became director of the Théâtre d'Application and then of the Théâtre La Bodinière. La Bodinière appealed to an elite audience, and staged a variety of lectures and performances until Bodinier retired in 1902."
"Charles Bodinier was born on 6 January 1844 in Beaufort-en-Vallée, Maine-et-Loire."
"He became a professional soldier, and was captured in the war of 1870."
He was not released until 1874. In 1876 he joined the staff of the Comédie-Française.
Bodinier was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"In 1886 Bodinier proposed to establish a small theater where the students of the Conservatoire could stage performances of the Classics, a concept that was well received by the Minister of Fine Arts."
"In his application to the ""Commission des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques"" Bodinier insisted that the Théâtre d'Application would be a school and not a profit-making enterprise, and on that basis he was given permission for six months."
Both the municipal council and the ministry subscribed to establishing the theater.
In 1887 Bodinier opened the Théâtre d'Application in an old tannery at 18 rue Saint-Lazare for use by students at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

"His job there was to code a music sequencer for the Sega Mega Drive, he wrote some music on it to demonstrate how it worked. The boss liked the music and he asked him to write the music for ""Asterix and the Power of the Gods""."
"Nathan is most well known for creating the original music for ""Tomb Raider"". While creating the ""Tomb Raider"" music, he had an idea in mind to create music that sounded like English classical music. He notes that his influences might have come from English classical music that his father used to play when he was small. He wrote the entire score for the first ""Tomb Raider"" in four weeks without insight on the game levels to help him draw the music accordingly. On the following two games he was still getting very limited descriptions for what musical elements he needed."

Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."
"The coat of arms for Rede of Roche is a pun on the name. It always contains three reeds (golden or silver) on a sable field, and sometimes carries the pun further by adding three roaches (a type of fish) on a red field. The red field might even be considered a pun of the name Rede - one Welsh homonym for Rede being “rhudd,” which means red."

Near the end of the fourth quarter with Pittsburgh leading Kansas City by seven points, Royals failed to direct a punt towards a sideline, and instead, punted the ball forward directly towards the line of scrimmage. The punt was blocked and recovered by Kansas City. With 1:43 remaining in the fourth quarter and on 4th down, Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to receiver Tim Barnett. The ensuing PAT tied the game which then went into sudden death overtime.

= = = Shepperd's Dell = = =
"Shepperd's Dell is a small canyon in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, located at"
which is less than one-third mile (500 m) southeast of Rooster Rock State Park.
"The Historic Columbia River Highway runs over the dell on a bridge that was the answer to one of the engineering challenges of the highway's construction. The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park. Omitting the apostrophe when referring to the dell itself is consistent with the policies of the United States Board on Geographic Names, which strongly discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names."

= = = Anne of Foix-Candale = = =
Anna of Foix-Candale (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of King Vladislaus II.
"Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics."
"The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day."
"Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery. She was 22."

"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."

"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."

"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."

U-103 hit ""Calabria"" with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors."
"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Schütze would have been able to target ""Calabria"" by moonlight."

The film is a homage to the 1964 martial arts film ""Buddha's Palm"" which starred Cho Tat-wah, who also acts in a supporting role in this film."
"Advertising company staff Mo Tak-fai (Lau) and his friend Lai Chi (Chan) go to mainland China for a business trip. Chi smuggles some relics, leading to them being chased by the police. They go into a cave to escape capture, but Chi is bitten by a poisonous snake. He finds a medicine belonging to an ancient hero named Long Jianfei and shares it with Tak-fai. Not only does the medicine detoxifies Chi, it also bestows Tak-fai and Chi internal strengths. They also rescue Princess Yunluo (Wong) and her maid Xiao Man (Mui) from the Yuan Dynasty after 800 years of slumber but in the process also releasing a two-hundred-year-old evil martial arts expert Tian Can (Yuen)."
"Fai and Chi remain skeptical about the things that happened and they bring the two ladies to Hong Kong. Yunluo is able to adapt to modern life in Hong Kong very quickly. On the other hand, in order to defeat Tian Can, Yunluo helps Fai to learn the ""Buddha's Palm"" technique while Chi, due to poor qualifications, only excel at the ""Seven Rotary Slice"" technique. However, when Tian Can arrives he effortlessly defeats Fai since he has not mastered the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. Tian Can forces Fai to eat a cursed silkworm, which can cause pain to people who consume it when Tian Can plays his drum."
"The next day, Tian Can goes on a spree. He steals money from a bank ATM, threatens Fai and Chi to go to their boss' home and capture his family, as well as defeating the police who come after them. Yunluo saves the two men but Fai is furtherly injured by Tian Can in the process. Fortunately they come across Yim Chan, leader of a supernatural performing troupe from China, who heals Fai from his injuries while also channelling energy to him. A few days later, Fai finally masters the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. He and his friends confront Tian Can in a final duel and Fai uses ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" to cripple Tian Can's martial arts ability, becoming a true hero in the end."

"McHugh was born at Annagh, Glenfarne, County Leitrim. He was the son of a tenant farmer, Peter M’Hugh of Leitrim, and of Anne McDermott. He entered a Catholic seminary, but left without taking orders. He went to Paris and engaged in journalism, and taught science and classics in the Athlone and Sligo Intermediate schools. In 1882 he married Mary Harte, daughter of a J. Harte of Sligo. She died in 1894. He became owner of ""The Sligo Champion"" in 1885. He was Mayor of Sligo in 1888, and again in 1895-98 and 1900. He was elected to Sligo County Council on its establishment in 1899 and became its first chairman."
"He was elected MP for North Leitrim as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist in 1892, winning comfortably over the Unionist candidate with 87% of the vote. He retained the seat unopposed in 1895. At this election he also challenged the Parnellite Willie Redmond in East Clare, losing by only 57 votes in a poll of over 6,500. In 1900, standing for the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party, he was again challenged in North Leitrim by a Unionist, but again won comfortably, with 91% of the vote. In April 1901 he was imprisoned for six months following conviction for ‘seditious libel’ on account of an article on Jury Packing in Sligo published in his newspaper. The article had attacked jurymen who had convicted two men of intimidating persons who rented farms from which the former owners had been evicted. On his release he was given a celebratory lunch by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In September the following year, he stood before the Irish Court of Bankruptcy after a petition from the Crown Solicitor for Sligo, but this apparently did not affect his political standing. In 1906 he was returned unopposed both for North Leitrim and for North Sligo, and chose to sit for the latter constituency, which he represented until his death in 1909."

= = = Pavane (Fauré) = = =
"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."

"The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) was a firm which manufactured and sold Hollerith unit record equipment and other data-processing equipment. During World War II, BTM constructed a number of ""bombes"", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers."
"The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the ""British Tabulating Machine Company Limited"". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment."
"Annual revenues were £6K in 1915, £122K in 1925, and £170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939."
"In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948."
"During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed ""CANTAB"". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed."
"BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum. BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer."
"In 1959 BTM merged with former rival Powers-Samas to become International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT). ICT later became part of ICL (International Computers Limited), which was later taken over by Fujitsu."

"Dave Smith Motors is a car dealership in Kellogg, Idaho, that attracts customers from all over the country. The dealership has a reputation for being the ""World’s Largest Ram Dealer""."
"Dave Smith Motors started in October 1965 in Wallace, Idaho. He purchased the small Chevrolet dealership from Mort Keane. At that time, the Chevrolets were sold mainly to miners, loggers, smelter workers and local businessmen in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley. Five years later, he moved the dealership to Kellogg, Idaho. Today Dave Smith Motors carries Chrysler, General Motors, and Nissan products, according to the Dave Smith website,(Dave Smith.com)."
"Idaho’s Silver Valley was founded in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest silver mining regions in the world. The community is located along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho’s Shoshone County. The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then, in 1981, the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed. Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn. The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry. The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership."
As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof. He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the Internet.
"In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat, Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list. Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in Kellogg, Idaho."
"The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because Chrysler Corporation (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales. Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals. The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to boycott Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors. The Federal Trade Commission considered their boycott illegal and the group settled the charges before the boycott began."

Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert or Nicolaes Moyaert or Mooyaert (1592–1655) was an authoritative Catholic Dutch painter. He followed Rembrandt in his use of red chalk.
Moeyart was born in Durgerdam. As a young man he is thought to have traveled to Italy to see and experience its art. At 25 he married Grietje Claes (in 1617). Possibly he was in business with Pieter Lastman in St. Antoniesbreestraat.
"Moeyaert painted many biblical and mythological scenes, and also designed Amsterdam's triumphal arch for the arrival of Maria de Medici. On 1 September 1638, he stood on the Spaarndammerdijk to watch the procession."
"Moeyaert was a very rich man and had three children, two mentally retarded and cared for in his own home. He had stakes in the business of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, a famous art dealer, related to Rembrandt's wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh."
"Moeyaert was for many years' commissioner of the Theatre of Van Campen, with Jan Vos. He lived until his death at a house on the Singel, not far from Torensluis. Nicolaes Berchem, Salomon Koninck, Jacob van der Does and Jan Baptist Weenix were his pupils."

"The Astros selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft. In 2015, Kemp began the season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League. He received a midseason promotion to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and appeared in the 2015 All-Star Futures Game."
"Kemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros. After former Astros center fielder Carlos Gómez was designated for assignment, it was said that Kemp and Jake Marisnick would be splitting duties in centerfield."
"On March 19, 2017, he was optioned back to Fresno. On April 27, 2017 the Astros promoted Kemp to the major leagues to replace injured Teoscar Hernández. On May 1, 2017, the Astros optioned him back down as Marisnick was activated off of the disabled list."
"On September 2, 2017, he was called up to the Astros and played in their doubleheader against the Mets, their first home game after Hurricane Harvey. In 17 games with the Astros, Kemp had a .216 average and 4 RBI. The Astros finished the season with a 101-61 record and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever championship title. Kemp did not participate in any playoff action, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title."
"In March 2018, the Astros optioned Kemp back to Fresno. He was called up on May 16 to replace Jake Marisnick.

Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first. After further review, they announced the catch as confirmed, meaning the MLB replay crew in New York saw conclusive evidence of the catch. In game four, Kemp hit a fourth inning solo home run off Rick Porcello after only hitting six homers during the regular season."

The marine is armed with a rifle and is initially supplied with 99 bullets. The player can only move orthogonally, in half-tile steps. Each screen may contain one or more enemies, who move toward the marine in a straight line until they reach an obstacle. The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"".

"= = = Leila; or, The Siege of Granada = = ="
"Leila; or, The Siege of Granada is a historical romance novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton published in 1838."
"The novel is set in Granada, Spain at the end of the Middle Ages — beginning in the summer of 1491. It was originally published in an expensive form, with many engraved illustrations. The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations."
"In ""Leila"", as the double title suggests, there is a double storyline: the domestic story of the daughter (Leila) and the public story of the nation. Leila's father, Almamen, switches allegiances between Christian and Moor in what eventually becomes the famous Siege of Granada. Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza. He inadvertently delivers her into the hands of the Christian monarchs, and Leila is subjected to the procedures of conversion by the queen's intermediary, Donna Inez. In the double story line, the conquest of Muslim Granada runs parallel to the conversion of the Jewish Leila. The characters meet at the altar of a convent in which Leila is about to take her vows as a nun, and her father kills her. The domestic plot parallels the Christianization of Spain."

NRLM will be implemented in a mission mode. This enables:
"(a) shift from the present allocation based strategy to a demand driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans."
"(b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound delivery."
"(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector."
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
"As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."
"The second dimension of demand driven strategy implies that the ultimate objective is that the poor will drive the agenda, through participatory planning at grassroots level, implementation of their own plans, reviewing and generating further plans based on their experiences. The plans will not only be demand driven, they will also be dynamic."
NRLM is one of the major programme run by Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). But it has some serious shortcomings.

"William G. ""Slicky Bill"" Greene, Jr. (1812–1894) was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and a businessman in Menard County, Illinois. Greene founded Tallula, Illinois in 1857, and Greenview, Illinois is named after him."
"Greene, along with his brother L.M. Greene, and William F. Berry, attended Illinois College in Jacksonville."
"By September 1831, Greene's parents lived 2 miles (3 km) southwest of New Salem; Greene, then age 19, was hired by recent arrival Abraham Lincoln to assist at Lincoln's mill and store. In early January 1833, Greene bought the inventory of Reuben Radford's store in New Salem for $400; Lincoln drew up and witnessed the mortgage. The same day, Greene sold the same inventory to Lincoln and Berry, now Lincoln's store partner, for over $600. When Lincoln had a debt judgement entered against him in 1834, requiring Lincoln to surrender his horse, Greene turned in his own horse instead; this horse was probably the one Lincoln had paid him with in 1833. Lincoln eventually paid Greene back after becoming an attorney."
"Greene was also an acquaintance of Richard Yates, and introduced Yates and Lincoln in New Salem; Yates became Governor of Illinois during the Civil War and Lincoln became President."
"Greene and Lincoln remained friends; though Greene was a Democrat, Lincoln, as president, appointed Greene as internal revenue collector for the Peoria district. In ""Lincoln's New Salem"", author Benjamin Thomas relates a story in which Lincoln introduced Greene to Secretary of State William H. Seward by saying that Greene had taught Lincoln grammar: When Greene later reminded Lincoln that all Greene had done was held the grammar book and checked the answers, and was not very good at grammar himself, Lincoln is said to have replied ""Well, that was all the teaching of grammar I ever had."""
"Greene had nine children. By March 1853, Greene and his wife, Louisa Green, lived on a farm near Havana, Illinois; their seventh child, Gaines Greene (1853–1918), was born there on March 3. Sons Carlin, McNult, Byrd, and Vance, and daughter Julia Greene, died before Gaines; sons Scott and Frank and daughter J. S. Noble outlived Gaines."
"Within months after the birth of Gaines Green, the family moved near Tallula, and William Greene spent most of his life in Tallula Precinct. Greene, along with Yates, J. G. Greene, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears, laid out the village of Tallula itself in late 1857. William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877."
"Greenview was laid out in October 1857. It was named after William Greene because he convinced the railroad to come through the town: located on the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis Railroad, Greenview was incorporated by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in May 1869."

This occasional employment continued until the 2nd Latvian Brigade was formed from six Latvian battalions, four of which had combat experience. At the end of April 1943 a three battalion formation fighting under name of Latvian Legion was withdrawn from the front line and renamed 1st Volunteer Regiment of the SS (Latvian), with a change of Wehrmacht ranks to those of Waffen-SS.

"The law of Illinois consists of several levels, including constitutional, statutory, and regulatory law, as well as case law and local law. The ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"" (ILCS) form the general statutory law."
"The Constitution of Illinois is the foremost source of state law. Legislation is enacted by the Illinois General Assembly, published in the ""Laws of Illinois"", and codified in the ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"" (ILCS). State agencies publish regulations (sometimes called administrative law) in the ""Illinois Register"", which are in turn codified in the ""Illinois Administrative Code"". Illinois's legal system is based on common law, which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Appellate Court, which are published on the website of the Supreme Court. Counties, townships, cities, and villages may also promulgate local ordinances. There are also several sources of persuasive authority, which are not binding authority but are useful to lawyers and judges insofar as they help to clarify the current state of the law."

"""No Good Advice"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystrøm Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

The Easter Island butterflyfish is native to the waters around Easter Island and is found nowhere else. Its preferred habitat is on reefs and among volcanic boulders heavily clad in brown algae at depths down to about . Juvenile fish are sometimes found among corals in rock pools.
"Juvenile Easter Island butterflyfish have been observed to act as cleaner fish, picking parasites off the skin of larger fish. During the breeding season, male and female adult fish form pair bonds."
"The Easter Island butterflyfish is a bottom feeding fish. Examination of its stomach contents have shown that it feeds on polycheaete worms, shrimps, fish eggs and barnacles, and fragments of the black sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. were also found. This was unexpected as butterfly fish are not known to feed on sponges, however the explanation may be that the sponge was ingested in error when the fish was feeding on the barnacles which had become entangled in the sponge."
"At one time this fish was listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their Red List of Threatened Species but in 2010, this was changed to being of ""Least Concern"". The reason given for this change was that, although its range was very limited, this fish was quite common within that range and did not face any significant threats. A small number of fish were collected for the reef aquarium trade but the number was not believed to reduce the population to any great extent."

Since that time, the core group of this de facto new-media think tank has included members from Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Croatia, Lithuania, the UK, and Sweden; its larger network has attracted people from around the world."
"Since 2004 FoAM has positioned itself as the only Flemish ""Hybrid Reality Lab,"" with a primary focus on the field of hybrid reality (technologies, media and materials entangling the physical and the digital)."
"It staged lectures and performances for a distinguished audience of aristocrats, grand bourgeois and intelligentsia."
Charles Bodinier (1844–1911) was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"From 1888 he was director of the Théâtre d'Application, a small theater for students of the Conservatory on rue Saint-Lazare."
"In 1890 he opened a theater called ""La Bodinière"", which staged performances until 1902."
La Bodinière's audience including members of the Parisian upper class and the intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries""."
"Speakers at these events included literary figures such as the poet Maurice Bouchor, the poet and ""conteur"", Paul Armand Silvestre, the writer and critic Ferdinand Brunetière, the poet and novelist Anatole France, the poet and novelist François Coppée, the dramatist Maurice Donnay and the journalist and critic Francisque Sarcey."
The historian and feminist Léopold Lacour gave well-attended talks on fashionable subject of feminism.
"Charles Bodinier invited the poet and dandy Robert de Montesquiou to give a lecture on 17 January 1894, assisted by Sarah Bernhardt."
"The event attracted an audience that included aristocrats, professors, actors, poets and artists,"
including Paul Verlaine and the sculptor Édouard Houssin.
La Bodinière had a varied program.
"The Société Théâtrical with Émile Goudeau staged the play ""Le Gardénia""."
"Bodinier put on shadow shows such as ""La Marche au Soleil"" based on the poem by Léon Durocher with music by Georges Fragerolle."
The popular singer Yvette Guilbert was engaged by the theater in January 1891 for five performances where the journalist Hugues Le Roux gave lectures and Guilbert performed.
"Yvette had huge success with this audience, who would not have wanted to be seen at the more low-brow venues where the singer usually performed."
"Bodinier staged a series of similar combined lectures and recitals after the success of Guilbert's performance,"
"including Félicia Mallet, the well-known pantomime artist and singer."
The poet and playwright Maurice Lefèvre introduced Mallet at these events.

= = = Masterpiece (Roy Lichtenstein) = = =
Masterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.
"According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ""Masterpiece"" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring ""Drowning Girl"", ""Portrait of Madame Cézanne"" and other works from 1962 and 1963 When discussing another work (""I Know...Brad""), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of cliched oversimplification. ""Drowning Girl"" is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject."
"The source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said ""But someday the bitterness will pass..."""
"""Masterpiece"" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented ""Masterpiece"" as part of their announcement of the retrospective."
"In January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting ""Masterpiece"", which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The painting is currently one of the 15 highest prices ever to be paid for a piece of artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen."
"""Masterpiece"" is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered ""witty and yet eerily prescient"" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, the blonde female's speech bubble, ""Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!"" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of ""The Guardian"" says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and ""the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist"". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in ""Mr. Bellamy"". According to Roberta Smith of ""The New York Times"", ""Masterpiece"" was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced ""faint and uneven"" Ben Day dots."

Aside from Grand Prix, where he won four matches at the round-robin qualifying stage and finished third in his group, he was to struggle for wins during his debut season and was relegated from the tour."
"With the introduction of Q School, Patrick came agonisingly close to regaining his tour place, twice losing his final match both in 2011 and 2012. Nevertheless thanks to his high Q School ranking Patrick was able to compete in all the major ranking tournaments of the 2012/13 season as an amateur. He enjoyed his best ever performance at the 2013 German Masters, where he beat Michael White and Martin Gould to qualify to the venue stages and was leading Ali Carter 3–1 before eventually losing 5–3. He also recorded an impressive 10–6 win against Luca Brecel at the World Championship qualifiers. Patrick was to end the season on a high note, as in the final round of Q School Event 3 he edged out Ashley Carty 4–3 to regain his place on the main tour."
"Patrick managed to win just three matches during the 2013/2014 season, all of them in the minor-ranking European Tour events, to end up ranked world number 119."
"His 2014/2015 season was much better as he started it by beating Jimmy White 5–2 to qualify for the 2014 Wuxi Classic. In Patrick's debut at a Chinese ranking event he lost 5–3 to Sam Baird. He whitewashed Stuart Bingham 4–0 at the minor-ranking Paul Hunter Classic and then defeated Matthew Stevens 4–3 and Jamie Jones 4–1 to reach the last 16, where Rod Lawler ended his run 4–0.<ref name=""2014/15""></ref> Patrick won his first ever match at the venue stage of a ranking event by seeing off Jamie Burnett 6–4 at the UK Championship.

In his second last 32 appearance at a ranking event he lost 6–3 to Judd Trump. Patrick qualified for the Indian Open, but lost 4–2 to Jamie Cope in the first round. Patrick could not get into the top 64 in the world rankings (he was 77th), but by finishing 40th on the European Order of Merit he earned himself a new two-year tour place."
"Patrick began the 2015/2016 season by whitewashing Michael Williams 5–0 and beating Tom Ford 5–1 to reach the third qualifying round of the Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 5–3 to David Morris.

"At the 2016 English Open, Patrick eliminated Zak Surety 4–1 and James Wattana 4–2 and then narrowly lost 4–3 to John Higgins in the third round. He reached the same stage of the Northern Ireland Open after only conceding one frame during wins over Marc Davis and Duane Jones, but he was thrashed 4–0 by Barry Hawkins. Patrick lost the final two frames both times in his 6–5 and 5–4 first round defeats to Michael White and Mark Joyce at the UK Championship and China Open respectively.

= = = Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang = = =
The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year."
Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."

"He Zhen was from Wuyuan County, but spent much of his time in Nanjing. He had a wide-ranging influence, and founded the Huizhou (Xingyuang) or Wan (Anhui) school of seal-carving."
"He's work aspired to an antique, ancient appearance, and he was known to chip or otherwise artificially weather his seals to create the impression of age. He created this effect by exploiting natural fracture lines in the stone, or by emphasising the knife-marks made whilst incising the inscription. His calligraphy attempted to echo that of the Han Dynasty, and he used the simplicity of that script to ameliorate the elaborate stylistic flourishes of the popular Yuan-style calligraphy that had previously been used for Ming-era seals."
