"Don't, don't put that on very loud, I've got a bit of a headache."
You'll have a lot of headache by the time I've finished.

"Oh, that's really worrying, isn't it?"
"I shouldn't be able to do that, ah."
"Yeah, so she said it's a bit, cos she only got an E for French, and she's not very good at it."
"Oh God,"
"So, she is finding it hard."
Yeah.
I bet she is.
"So erm,sh I don't know, she might be alright."
"She's not said about me being out of it, but erm, see if you do that, you see, you get a year in France."
Really?
"That's like your brother, he's doing Spanish isn't he?"
Yeah.

Yeah.

But I don't know what she's gonna do.
"But erm, I haven't seen much of her at all this week, because erm, they've all been out, I mean, they went up to London to see Miss Saigon, and they were gonna go out for a meal up there, and"
"Bloody hell, that takes some money, don't it?"
"Yeah, but they've got it."
"Yeah, exactly."
"You know, she's got fifty quid coming in every week."
"Yeah, that's true."
Plus a grant.
"Yeah, she's well away."

Up here.
Hey!

Goes in.
"Ah so I see, yes."
Goes in about an inch.
Mm.
Mm.
He was saying to me it was very difficult to do.
Well I can't understand why.
"I mean really what he should have done if it, if it was that difficult he should have gone back another half a brick  and the j bricked it up all the way"
Mm.
"level, instead of putting bits and pieces in."
Surely
Yeah.
he could have half bricked it all the way up?
Mm.
Instead of saying how difficult it was putting bits and pieces in.
I would have thought that's what I would have done.
"You know, just come straight up with a row of bricks."
Logical thing to do.
Yeah.
Ay
We ought to have bought some knitting wool.
And done something.
"Well never mind, you got trousers to shorten."
And that  .
Well you might as well do it and press the two together.
Two together.
Ey ou got two to shorten now!
Oh God!
"Sally says that  cardigan that I knit , that black one, she said tha i , it's lovely to wear she said!"
It's heavy!
"And it doesn't stretch and it  er er er  it looks, it feels good she says!"
Aha!
What's that one?
You know that black one?
She wore it
Oh yes.

Oh that cottony thing?
The cotton.
Mm.
It's lovely stuff to wear!
I said how much is it?
One eighty a ball she said!
Oh!
I said I was thinking of making a waistcoat or something out of one.
And she said it doesn't go bubbly.
"The only, if anything  it might shrink a little."
Oh!
Not much.
But you'd have to hand wash it?
Yeah.
I've been to see him.
Mhm.
Definitely would be a technique.
You could never dance with a .
I remember the day we went.
Oh yeah.
"Oh, we were sitting there amazed!"
"Me, Fiona and Richard all sitting."
How's the taxis?
Stra strange.

"Aye, that's the new one in Galbally now."
"But, they burnt out one there was"
We have had a right .
No.
Like the B and Q store .

I don't really know.
There you are.
How the  but I looked at the .

"And, she says, just me   and"
I think I'll keep it.
But he he
"I would like to, I would like to try it."
Well it's alright for a while but  that's alright for a wee while now.
"He's a de , a dead nice bloke."
"You know, very  very  doesn't  put himself above anybody else, airs and graces and all, when you see him."
Speaks very politely.
"but  Mrs  the other day  it was something like  two o'clock, Mrs  said to her, she went to lunch one till two  Mrs  oh have you had your lunch?"
"She said  no, are you off lunch yet?"
"She said  not until five past, Mrs  said you can get up them stairs, she said you go at  ten minutes early every day!"
She said I'm sure you're gonna quibble about five minutes  lunch hour!
Oh she actually told her then?
Yeah  But bu oh she's just   !
Yeah.
Idle!
Yeah.
"I said to Mrs , she said I don't know she's a funny girl, I said I don't think she's funny I think she's idle!"
Yeah.
"I thought, why should we work to pay her wages?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she don't do nothing!
Yeah.
Yeah  Does she do any hairdressing yet or?
A little bit  but  she really winds me up she does.
Yeah that's how I
Yeah.
I   !
"And then she said to me  Mrs  gives us  erm sometimes an extra ten pound, she gets a Y T S allowance"
Yeah.
"and she ooh I don't know I'm gonna have to something to her cos some weeks I get it and some weeks I don't, I said you ought to think yourself lucky you get an extra ten pound, I said, we don't!"
"I said we bring them, we're earning the money   cos she don't earn her own money does she"
No.
just shampooing.
No.
No.
She said I want to know whether I'm gonna get it regular or not!
I said think yourself lucky you get any extra at all!
Mm  yeah .
"Black shoes, grey trousers and that?"
I don't care!
It's your
What about black trousers?

Put it somewhere.
Oh!
A cloak.
Or do you reckon that shirt?
"Oh that's looks alright, leave it."
What that one?
"You know the ones you have it tied, sort of half round your neck, you know."
Like that.
"Do you think that, that one maybe?"
I dunno.
If you like.
Do you reckon she'll prefer it in that colour?
"No, I'm taking  not bothering."
"I mean, nobody's gonna bother to check the colour of your shirt with about twenty other people on stage ?"
There's my  Global Hypercolour.
What a !
"Ooh there again, what do you reckon to these?"
I've never worn these?
Neither have I.

"We didn't ask, but he said not to."
"Oh aye, yeah."
Quick and easy recipe book

Yeah.
What does he want

Eh?

"They cost me three hundred and fifty, they're brand new."
"And I said to him you can have it for two, two fifty."
You've saved an hundred quid.
I'll tell him

Yeah.
gonna have to save like mad then to buy them.
"He will do if he gets it into his head but  he got in trouble you see, got in with the wrong crowd and"
Mm.
a lot of money off him and all this lot.
He just learnt  learning now.
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
"`` The dog is mine , and I shall do with him as I think fit ."
"He is sold , and that is all there is about it ."
Go on with your dinner . ''
But Ernest for the first time did not obey .
"He snatched his cap from the back of his chair , dashed it down over his eyes , and ran from the kitchen with a sob choking his breath ."
"Uncle Richard looked angry , but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him ."
"`` Do n't be vexed with the boy , Richard , '' she said ."
`` You know he is very fond of Laddie .
"He 's had to do with him ever since he was a pup , and no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him ."
I 'm rather sorry myself that you have sold the dog . ''
"`` Well , he is sold and there 's an end of it ."
I do n't say but that the dog is a good dog .
"But he is of no use to us , and twenty dollars will come in mighty handy just now ."
"He 's worth that to Bob , for he is a good watch dog , so we 've both made a fair bargain . ''"
Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie .
"I had taken no part in the discussion , for I felt no great interest in the matter ."
"Laddie was a nice dog ; Ernest was a quiet , inoffensive little fellow , five years younger than myself ; that was all I thought about either of them ."
I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard 's farm on the Nova Scotian Bay of Fundy shore .
"I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard , partly because he had been much attached to my mother , his only sister , partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son , who had died several years before ."
"Uncle Richard was a stern , undemonstrative man , but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me , and I always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place ."
"`` What are you going to do this afternoon , Ned ? ''"
"he asked , after the disturbance caused by Ernest 's outbreak had quieted down ."
"`` I think I 'll row out to Island Rock , '' I replied ."
`` I want to take some views of the shore from it . ''
Uncle Richard nodded .
He was much interested in my new camera .
"`` If you 're on it about four o'clock , you 'll get a fine view of the ` Hole in the Wall ' when the sun begins to shine on the water through it , '' he said ."
`` I 've often thought it would make a handsome picture . ''
"`` After I 've finished taking the pictures , I think I 'll go down shore to Uncle Adam 's and stay all night , '' I said ."
"`` Jim 's dark room is more convenient than mine , and he has some pictures he is going to develop tonight , too . ''"
I started for the shore about two o'clock .
"Ernest was sitting on the woodpile as I passed through the yard , with his arms about Laddie 's neck and his face buried in Laddie 's curly hair ."
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite understand -- a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the circumstances that hedged her in .
`` Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not content you ? ''
he said gently .
"`` But it does content me , '' said Lynde imperiously ."
"`` I want no other -- I wish this life to go on forever -- forever , do you understand ?"
"If I were sure that it would -- if I were sure that no change would ever come to me , I would be perfectly content ."
It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched .
Oh ! ''
She shuddered and put her hands over her eyes .
Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be alone in the world .
He wanted to comfort her -- reassure her -- but he did not know how .
"One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and , seeing the Captain in the living room , he stepped in unannounced ."
"Captain Anthony was sitting by the table , his head in his hands ; at Alan 's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face , blackened by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence ."
`` What do you want here ? ''
"he said , following up the demand with a string of vile oaths ."
"Before Alan could summon his scattered wits , Lynde glided in with a white , appealing face ."
"Wordlessly she grasped Alan 's arm , drew him out , and shut the door ."
"`` Oh , I 've been watching for you , '' she said breathlessly ."
`` I was afraid you might come tonight -- but I missed you . ''
`` But your father ? ''
said Alan in amazement .
`` How have I angered him ? ''
`` Hush .
Come into the garden .
I will explain there . ''
He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white roses were now in full blow .
"`` Father is n't angry with you , '' said Lynde in a low shamed voice ."
`` It 's just -- he takes strange moods sometimes .
Then he seems to hate us all -- even me -- and he is like that for days .
He seems to suspect and dread everybody as if they were plotting against him .
You -- perhaps you think he has been drinking ?
"No , that is not the trouble ."
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
An hour passed away .
`` Hang them ! ''
said the captain .
`` This is as dull as the doldrums .
"Gray , whistle for a wind . ''"
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
"`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? ''"
`` I told you so ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility ."
"Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face ."
"So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired ."
"The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure ."
"Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before ."
"Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes ."
`` Did you hit your man ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce ."
"`` I believe not , sir . ''"
"`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett ."
"`` Load his gun , Hawkins ."
"How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? ''"
"`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
`` Three shots were fired on this side .
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . ''
`` Three ! ''
repeated the captain .
"`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
But this was not so easily answered .
"There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray ."
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
"It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ."
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
"`` Gone , '' shouted Mrs. Palmer , `` gone ."
She left on the train Mollie come on .
"Gracious me , has the man gone crazy ?"
He has n't seemed like himself at all this afternoon . ''
Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the lane .
Blind fool -- unspeakable idiot that he had been !
"To take her for Mrs. Palmer 's niece -- that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any situation , which marked the woman of the world , with the fine appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of culture -- to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth !"
"He had been blind , besottedly blind ."
And now he had lost her !
She would never forgive him ; she had gone without a word or sign .
"As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the apple trees , a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope ."
"`` Mr. Murray , Mr. Murray , '' Mollie Booth called breathlessly ."
`` Will you please come here just a minute ? ''
Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily .
He did not want to talk with Mollie Booth just then .
"Confound it , what did the girl want ?"
Why was she looking so mysterious ?
Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine hiding place and handed it over the paling .
"`` She give me this at the station -- Miss Mannering did , '' she gasped , `` and asked me to give it to you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see ."
"I could n't get a chanst when you was in , but as soon as you went I slipped out by the porch door and followed you ."
You went so fast I near died trying to head you off . ''
"`` You dear little soul , '' said Murray , suddenly radiant ."
`` It is too bad you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account .
But I am immensely obliged to you .
The next time your young man wants a trusty private messenger just refer him to me . ''
"`` Git away with you , '' giggled Mollie ."
`` I must hurry back ` fore Aunt Emily Jane gits wind I 'm gone .
I hope there 's good news in your girl 's letter .
"My , but did n't you look flat when Aunt said she 'd went ! ''"
Murray beamed at her idiotically .
When she had vanished among the trees he opened his letter .
"`` Dear Mr. Murray , '' it ran , `` your unblushing audacity of the morning deserves some punishment ."
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
There could n't be a better child and you 'd hardly know she was in the house . ''
"`` Dora is too good , '' said Anne ."
`` She 'd behave just as well if there was n't a soul to tell her what to do .
"She was born already brought up , so she does n't need us ; and I think , '' concluded Anne , hitting on a very vital truth , `` that we always love best the people who need us ."
Davy needs us badly . ''
"`` He certainly needs something , '' agreed Marilla ."
`` Rachel Lynde would say it was a good spanking . ''
"XI Facts and Fancies `` Teaching is really very interesting work , '' wrote Anne to a Queen 's Academy chum ."
`` Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I do n't find it so .
"Something funny is almost sure to happen every day , and the children say such amusing things ."
"Jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches , which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous ."
This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell ` speckled ' and could n't manage it .
"` Well , ' he said finally , ' I ca n't spell it but I know what it means . ' ''"
` What ? '
I asked . ''
"` St. Clair Donnell 's face , miss . '"
"`` St. Clair is certainly very much freckled , although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it ... for I was freckled once and well do I remember it ."
But I do n't think St. Clair minds .
It was because Jimmy called him ` St. Clair ' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school .
"I heard of the pounding , but not officially , so I do n't think I 'll take any notice of it ."
`` Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition .
"I said , ` If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other , how many would you have altogether ? ' '"
"A mouthful , ' said Lottie ."
"And in the nature study class , when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads should n't be killed , Benjie Sloane gravely answered , ` Because it would rain the next day . '"
"`` It 's so hard not to laugh , Stella ."
"I have to save up all my amusement until I get home , and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause ."
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began .
`` Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE ?
Rose Bell says he was ... also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament .
Claude White says a ` glacier ' is a man who puts in window frames !
"`` I think the most difficult thing in teaching , as well as the most interesting , is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things ."
One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves .
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
said Nat innocently .
"`` Well , I do n't know about that , '' began Mrs. Bhaer , rather startled by the coolness of the proposition ."
"`` Why , I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you , and be kind to 'em as you were to me , '' said Nat , looking surprised and alarmed ."
"`` So I do , but I like to know something about them first ."
"I have to choose them , because there are so many ."
I have not room for all .
I wish I had . ''
"`` I told him to come because I thought you 'd like it , but if there is n't room he can go away again , '' said Nat , sorrowfully ."
"The boy 's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer , and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope , and spoil his kind little plan , so she said , `` Tell me about this Dan . ''"
"`` I do n't know any thing , only he has n't got any folks , and he 's poor , and he was good to me , so I 'd like to be good to him if I could . ''"
"`` Excellent reasons every one ; but really , Nat , the house is full , and I do n't know where I could put him , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her ."
"`` He could have my bed , and I could sleep in the barn ."
"It is n't cold now , and I do n't mind , I used to sleep anywhere with father , '' said Nat , eagerly ."
"Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his shoulder , and say in her kindest tone : `` Bring in your friend , Nat ; I think we must find room for him without giving him your place . ''"
"Nat joyfully ran off , and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy , who slouched in and stood looking about him , with a half bold , half sullen look , which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself , after one glance , `` A bad specimen , I am afraid . ''"
"`` This is Dan , '' said Nat , presenting him as if sure of his welcome ."
"`` Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us , '' began Mrs. Jo , in a friendly tone ."
"`` Yes , '' was the gruff reply ."
`` Have you no friends to take care of you ? ''
`` No . ''
"`` Say , ` No , ma'am , ' '' whispered Nat ."
"`` Sha n't neither , '' muttered Dan ."
`` How old are you ? ''
`` About fourteen . ''
`` You look older .
What can you do ? '' ''
` Most anything . ''
"`` If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do , work and study as well as play ."
Are you willing to agree to that ? ''
`` Do n't mind trying . ''
"`` Well , you can stay a few days , and we will see how we get on together ."
"Take him out , Nat , and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home , when we will settle about the matter , '' said Mrs. Jo , finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person , who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard , suspicious expression , sorrowfully unboyish ."
"It seems there was a ship lost in those parts ; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands , when he came upon a lad that was half drowned ."
"Well , he brought him to ; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld , ruined castle , where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends ."
"My friends are a wee wild-like , and not so particular about the law as some that I could name ; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk , and was your born nephew , Mr. Balfour , they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter ."
"And I may tell ye at the off-go , unless we can agree upon some terms , ye are little likely to set eyes upon him ."
"For my friends , '' added Alan , simply , `` are no very well off . ''"
My uncle cleared his throat .
"`` I 'm no very caring , '' says he ."
"`` He wasnae a good lad at the best of it , and I 've nae call to interfere . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Alan , `` I see what ye would be at : pretending ye do n't care , to make the ransom smaller . ''"
"`` Na , '' said my uncle , `` it 's the mere truth ."
"I take nae manner of interest in the lad , and I 'll pay nae ransome , and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care . ''"
"`` Hoot , sir , '' says Alan ."
"`` Blood 's thicker than water , in the deil 's name !"
"Ye cannae desert your brother 's son for the fair shame of it ; and if ye did , and it came to be kennt , ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side , or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` I 'm no just very popular the way it is , '' returned Ebenezer ; `` and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt ."
"No by me , onyway ; nor yet by you or your friends ."
"So that 's idle talk , my buckie , '' says he ."
"`` Then it 'll have to be David that tells it , '' said Alan ."
`` How that ? ''
"says my uncle , sharply ."
"`` Ou , just this way , '' says Alan ."
"`` My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it , but if there was nane , I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased , and be damned to him ! ''"
"`` Ay , but I 'm no very caring about that either , '' said my uncle ."
`` I wouldnae be muckle made up with that . ''
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
`` And what for why ? ''
asked Ebenezer .
"`` Why , Mr. Balfour , '' replied Alan , `` by all that I could hear , there were two ways of it : either ye liked David and would pay to get him back ; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him , and would pay for us to keep him ."
"It seems it 's not the first ; well then , it 's the second ; and blythe am I to ken it , for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends . ''"
"`` I dinnae follow ye there , '' said my uncle ."
`` No ? ''
said Alan .
"He rushed to Anne , hurled himself into her lap , flung his arms around her neck , and burst into tears ."
"`` I did n't know it was wrong to tell whoppers , '' he sobbed ."
`` How did you expect me to know it was wrong ?
"All Mr. Sprott 's children told them REGULAR every day , and cross their hearts too ."
"I s ` pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I 've been trying awful hard to be as good as him , but now I s ` pose you 'll never love me again ."
But I think you might have told me it was wrong .
"I 'm awful sorry I 've made you cry , Anne , and I 'll never tell a whopper again . ''"
Davy buried his face in Anne 's shoulder and cried stormily .
"Anne , in a sudden glad flash of understanding , held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla ."
"`` He did n't know it was wrong to tell falsehoods , Marilla ."
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what is n't true again . ''
"`` I never will , now that I know it 's bad , '' asseverated Davy between sobs ."
"`` If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can ... '' Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance ... `` you can skin me alive , Anne . ''"
"`` Do n't say ` whopper , ' Davy ... say ` falsehood , ' '' said the schoolma'am ."
`` Why ? ''
"queried Davy , settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained , investigating face ."
`` Why ai n't whopper as good as falsehood ?
I want to know .
It 's just as big a word . ''
`` It 's slang ; and it 's wrong for little boys to use slang . ''
"`` There 's an awful lot of things it 's wrong to do , '' said Davy with a sigh ."
`` I never s ` posed there was so many .
"I 'm sorry it 's wrong to tell whop ... falsehoods , 'cause it 's awful handy , but since it is I 'm never going to tell any more ."
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time ?
I want to know . ''
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla .
"`` I do n't want to be too hard on the child , '' said Marilla ."
"`` I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies , and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him ."
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you could n't expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct .
I suppose we 'll just have to assume he does n't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning .
"But he 'll have to be punished for shutting Dora up , and I ca n't think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we 've done that so often ."
"Ca n't you suggest something else , Anne ?"
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
"Some of them quite costly , too ; that is , they will cost me something , but I know I 'll be better off and richer after I 've paid the price ."
"That is what Mr. Grierson would call a paradox , is n't it ?"
I 'll explain all about it to you on Christmas Day . ''
"On Christmas Day , Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy 's ."
"It was a faded brown Christmas after all , for the snow had not come ."
But Clorinda did not mind ; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned .
She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor before she went into the sitting room .
"Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire , and Clorinda sat down beside her ."
"`` I 've come to tell you all about it , '' she said ."
Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own .
"`` From your face , dear girl , it will be pleasant hearing and telling , '' she said ."
Clorinda nodded .
"`` Aunt Emmy , I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy ."
"And then one evening it just came to me , without any thinking at all , and I knew that I could give some gifts after all ."
I thought of something new every day for a week .
"At first I did n't think I could give some of them , and then I thought how selfish I was ."
"I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it , but I was n't willing to pay what I had ."
"I got over that , though , Aunt Emmy ."
Now I 'm going to tell you what I did give .
"`` First , there was my teacher , Miss Mitchell ."
I gave her one of father 's books .
"I have so many of his , you know , so that I would n't miss one ; but still it was one I loved very much , and so I felt that that love made it worth while ."
"That is , I felt that on second thought ."
"At first , Aunt Emmy , I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book , worn with much reading and all marked over with father 's notes and pencillings ."
I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present .
And yet somehow it seemed to me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed -- that old book which father had loved and which I loved .
"So I gave it to her , and she understood ."
"I think it pleased her so much , the real meaning in it ."
She said it was like being given something out of another 's heart and life .
"`` Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope , my dear Sunday School teacher ."
"She married a home missionary , and they are in a lonely part of the west ."
"Well , I wrote her a letter ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
"`` I take care of myself and Boo , and she looks after you ."
The house goes any way . ''
`` I should think so !
I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall to-night .
What is it there for ? ''
Molly laughed .
"`` That 's the joke , sir , Miss Bat is cleaning house , and I 'm sure it needs cleaning , for it is years since it was properly done ."
I thought you might have told her to . ''
`` I 've said nothing .
Do n't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it .
I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint .
Is she going to upset the whole place ? ''
"asked Mr. Bemis , looking alarmed at the prospect ."
"`` I hope so , for I really am ashamed when people come , to have them see the dust and cobwebs , and old carpets and dirty windows , '' said Molly , with a sigh , though she never had cared a bit till lately ."
"`` Why do n't you dust round a little , then ?"
No time to spare from the books and play ? ''
"`` I tried , father , but Miss Bat did n't like it , and it was too hard for me alone ."
"If things were once in nice order , I think I could keep them so ; for I do want to be neat , and I 'm learning as fast as I can . ''"
"`` It is high time someone took hold , if matters are left as you say ."
"I 've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was , to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town , and wondering what I could give the old lady ."
"Now I find you are the one to be thanked , and it is a very pleasant surprise to me . ''"
"`` Give her the present , please ; I 'm satisfied , if you like what I 've done ."
"It is n't much , and I did n't know as you would ever observe any difference ."
"But I did try , and now I guess I 'm really getting on , '' said Molly , sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks , for she , too , found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes ."
"`` You certainly are , my dear ."
"I 'll wait till the house-cleaning is over , and then , if we are all alive , I 'll see about Miss Bat 's reward ."
"Meantime , you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need , and send the bills to me ; '' and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar , as if that matter was settled ."
"`` Oh , thank you , sir !"
That will be splendid .
"Merry always has pretty things , and I know you will like me when I get fixed , '' said Molly , smoothing down her apron , with a little air ."
`` Seems to me you look very well as you are .
Is n't that a pretty enough frock ? ''
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
"`` It is the ruin of this kind land , '' a woman said ."
"`` If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . ''"
"`` If they live , '' returned the woman , `` that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? ''"
"`` They can not better die than for their natural lord , '' said Dick ."
"`` No natural lord of mine , '' said the man in the smock ."
"`` I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas ."
And now I must side with Brackley !
It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ?
"But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver -- that knows more of law than honesty -- I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him !"
-- the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . ''
"`` Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , '' answered Dick , `` to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel ."
But King Harry -- praised be the saints !
"-- has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained ."
"And as for Sir Daniel , y ' are very brave behind his back ."
But I will be no tale-bearer ; and let that suffice . ''
"`` I say no harm of you , Master Richard , '' returned the peasant ."
"`` Y ' are a lad ; but when ye come to a man 's inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket ."
"I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel 's neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! ''"
"`` Clipsby , '' said Richard , `` you speak what I can not hear with honour ."
"Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . ''"
"`` Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? ''"
returned Clipsby .
`` On whose side is Sir Daniel ? ''
"`` I know not , '' said Dick , colouring a little ; for his guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of that period , and every change had brought him some increase of fortune ."
"`` Ay , '' returned Clipsby , `` you , nor no man ."
"For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . ''"
"Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron , and the party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping -- a brown-faced , grizzled fellow , heavy of hand and grim of mien , armed with sword and spear , a steel salet on his head , a leather jack upon his body ."
"He was a great man in these parts ; Sir Daniel 's right hand in peace and war , and at that time , by his master 's interest , bailiff of the hundred ."
"`` Clipsby , '' he shouted , `` off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate ."
Bowyer will give you jack and salet .
We must ride before curfew .
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
He shall down .
Mum ! ''
And he bent over his oars .
"They pulled a long way up the river , turned the tail of an island , and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank ."
Then Hugh held water in midstream .
"`` I must land you here among the willows , '' he said ."
"`` Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Master Shelton , '' replied Hugh , `` I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now ."
"He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow ."
"All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits ."
I heard him swear it by the rood .
"An I had not known you of old days -- ay , and from so high upward -- I would ` a ' let you go on ; but for old days ' remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that 's not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole ."
"Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! ''"
"Hugh was still speaking , lying on his oars , when there came a great shout from among the willows on the island , and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly through the wood ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried Hugh .
`` He was on the upper island all the while ! ''
He pulled straight for shore .
"`` Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , '' he added ."
"`` I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! ''"
The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a crash .
"Matcham , pale , but steady and alert , at a sign from Dick , ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore ; Dick , taking the horse by the bridle , sought to follow , but what with the animal 's bulk , and what with the closeness of the thicket , both stuck fast ."
"The horse neighed and trampled ; and the boat , which was swinging in an eddy , came on and off and pitched with violence ."
"`` It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , '' cried Dick ; but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket and the startled animal ."
"A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island , a long-bow in his hand ."
"Dick saw him for an instant , with the corner of his eye , bending the bow with a great effort , his face crimson with hurry ."
`` Who goes ? ''
he shouted .
"`` Hugh , who goes ? '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , John , '' replied the ferryman ."
"`` Stand , Dick Shelton ! ''"
bawled the man upon the island .
"cried I. `` Rum , '' he repeated ."
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
"I ran to fetch it , but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and I broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while I was still getting in my own way , I heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor ."
"At the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me ."
Between us we raised his head .
"He was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour ."
"`` Dear , deary me , '' cried my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !"
And your poor father sick ! ''
"In the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger ."
"I got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron ."
"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in , on his visit to my father ."
"`` Oh , doctor , '' we cried , `` what shall we do ?"
Where is he wounded ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
said the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
"The man has had a stroke , as I warned him ."
"Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it ."
"For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''"
"When I got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain 's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm ."
It was tattooed in several places .
"`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it -- done , as I thought , with great spirit ."
"`` Prophetic , '' said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger ."
"`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood ."
"Jim , '' he said , `` are you afraid of blood ? ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein ."
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
"First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved ."
"But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''"
`` Never mind .
Please push up my table .
"I must write a letter , and I want you to post it for me to-night , and never say a word till I give you leave . ''"
"`` Oh , now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious , and get into a mess , are you ? ''"
"and Frank looked down at her with a suspicious air , though he was intensely curious to know what she was about ."
`` Go away till I 'm done .
"You will have to see the outside , but you ca n't know the inside till the answer comes ; '' and propping herself up , Jill wrote the following note , with some hesitation at the beginning and end , for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing , except by sight , and it was rather awkward : -- `` Robert Walker ."
"`` Dear Sir , I want to ask if Jack Minot came to see you last Friday afternoon ."
He got into trouble being seen with Jerry Shannon .
He paid him some money .
"Jack wo n't tell , and Mr. Acton talked to him about it before all the school ."
"We feel bad , because we think Jack did not do wrong ."
"I do n't know as you have anything to do with it , but I thought I 'd ask ."
Please answer quick .
"Respectfully yours , `` Jane Pecq '' To make sure that her despatch was not tampered with , Jill put a great splash of red sealing-wax on it , which gave it a very official look , and much impressed Bob when he received it ."
`` There !
"Go and post it , and do n't let any one see or know about it , '' she said , handing it over to Frank , who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand ."
"When his eye fell on the address , he laughed , and said in a teasing way , -- `` Are you and Bob such good friends that you correspond ?"
What will Jack say ? ''
"`` Do n't know , and do n't care !"
"Be good , now , and let 's have a little secret as well as other folks ."
"I 'll tell you all about it when he answers , '' said Jill in her most coaxing tone ."
`` Suppose he does n't ? ''
`` Then I shall send you up to see him .
"I must know something , and I want to do it myself , if I can . ''"
`` Look here ; what are you after ?
"I do believe you think -- '' Frank got no farther , for Jill gave a little scream , and stopped him by crying eagerly , `` Do n't say it out loud !"
"I really do believe it may be , and I 'm going to find out . ''"
`` What made you think of him ? ''
"and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter , as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that Jill 's quick wits had jumped at ."
`` Come here and I 'll tell you . ''
"Holding him by one button , she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim , with a look at the rug , -- `` No !"
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
"`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath ."
"`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey ."
"`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? ''"
`` Heard of him ! ''
cried the squire .
"`` Heard of him , you say !"
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
Blackbeard was a child to Flint .
"The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman ."
"I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''"
"`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor ."
"`` But the point is , had he money ? ''"
`` Money ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Have you heard the story ?
What were these villains after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? ''
"`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor ."
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
"What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''"
"`` Amount , sir ! ''"
cried the squire .
"`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''"
"`` Very well , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table ."
"The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors ."
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper .
"`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor ."
"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search ."
"On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice ."
"One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible ."
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
"He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed ."
"Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings ."
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
"He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy ."
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
"`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid ."
"You are a lucky girl , Kate ."
"But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?"
I had a letter from him yesterday .
"He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at ."
He 's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I 've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
"I think you 'll like him , for he 's just your style . ''"
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith 's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
"`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically ."
"`` You did n't expect it , did you ?"
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it was n't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
"He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa ."
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
"They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora ."
"This involved more long , companionable expeditions ."
"Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she ."
"Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
`` Let us run . ''
"`` Not so , '' returned Dick ."
`` See ye not ?
-- he is stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
"Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not ."
"Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''"
"`` I will pity him when he is by , '' replied Matcham ."
"The blind leper was now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face ."
"He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness , and even now he walked with a vigorous step ."
"The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , filled the lads ' bosoms with dismay ; and at every step that brought him nearer , their courage and strength seemed to desert them ."
"As he came about level with the pit , he paused , and turned his face full upon the lads ."
`` Mary be my shield !
He sees us ! ''
"said Matcham , faintly ."
`` Hush ! ''
whispered Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
"He is blind , fool ! ''"
"The leper looked or listened , whichever he was really doing , for some seconds ."
"Then he began to move on again , but presently paused once more , and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads ."
"Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes , as if by the mere sight he might become infected ."
"But soon the bell sounded , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods ."
"`` He saw us , '' said Matcham ."
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
"returned Dick , recovering some sparks of courage ."
`` He but heard us .
"He was in fear , poor soul !"
"An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried ` Peep . ' ''"
"`` Dick , good Dick , he saw us , '' repeated Matcham ."
"`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick ."
She dared not say it was impossible .
But Aunt Emma had no such scruples .
"With a great clatter and racket , that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty 's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements ."
"`` Goodness me , doctor , do you think you 're talking to millionaires ?"
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the country ?
"I ca n't afford it , that is certain ."
"I think I do pretty well to give Marcella and Patty their board free , and I have to work my fingers to the bone to do that ."
"It 's all nonsense about Patty , anyhow ."
What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better .
She does n't -- she just mopes and pines .
She wo n't eat a thing I cook for her .
How can anyone expect to get better if she does n't eat ? ''
Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that she had propounded an unanswerable question .
A dull red flush rose to Marcella 's face .
"`` Oh , Aunt Emma , I ca n't eat ! ''"
said Patty wearily .
"`` It is n't because I wo n't -- indeed , I ca n't . ''"
`` Humph !
I suppose my cooking is n't fancy enough for you -- that 's the trouble .
"Well , I have n't the time to put any frills on it ."
I think I do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up before me .
But some people imagine that they were born to be waited on . ''
"Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room , slamming the door behind her ."
The doctor shrugged his shoulders .
He had become used to Miss Gibson 's tirades during Patty 's illness .
"But Marcella had never got used to them -- never , in all the three years she had lived with her aunt ."
They flicked on the raw as keenly as ever .
This morning it seemed unbearable .
It took every atom of Marcella 's self-control to keep her from voicing her resentful thoughts .
It was only for Patty 's sake that she was able to restrain herself .
"It was only for Patty 's sake , too , that she did not , as soon as the doctor had gone , give way to tears ."
"Instead , she smiled bravely into the little sister 's eyes ."
"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
"`` Why , what can you do ? ''"
asked Madge forlornly .
Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused .
`` You 'll see .
I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself .
He is the most contrary man the Lord ever made .
I went to school with him .
"I learned how to manage him then , and I have n't forgotten how ."
I 'm going straight up to interview him . ''
`` Are you sure that will do any good ? ''
said Madge doubtfully .
"`` If you go to him and take Burton 's and my part , wo n't it only make him worse ? ''"
"`` Madge , dear , '' said Miss Susan , busily twisting her scanty , iron-grey hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge 's glass , `` you just wait ."
"I 'm not young , and I 'm not pretty , and I 'm not in love , but I 've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will have ."
You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something .
You 'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis . ''
"Burton had returned to the turnip field , but old John Ellis was taking his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of his house ."
"Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a cutting sarcasm contained therein , he saw a tall , angular figure coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and flutter of shawl and skirt ."
"`` Old Susan Oliver , as sure as a gun , '' said old John with another chuckle ."
`` She looks mad clean through .
I suppose she 's coming here to blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers .
"She 's been angling and scheming for it for years , but she will find who she has to deal with ."
"Come on , Miss Susan . ''"
John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile .
Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them .
She did indeed look angry and disturbed .
Without any preliminary greeting she burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe 's breath .
"`` Look here , John Ellis , I want to know what this means ."
"I 've discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours , who ought to be in short trousers yet , has been courting my niece , Madge Oliver , all summer ."
He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry her .
"I wo n't have it , I tell you , and you can tell your son so ."
Marry my niece indeed !
"When I left the man , I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer , but I thrashed his boy , and then the old man thrashed me , and I ran off again and walked here . ''"
`` All the way ? ''
"`` Yes , the man did n't pay me , and I would n't ask for it ."
"Took it out in beating the boy , '' and Dan laughed , yet looked ashamed , as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands ."
`` How did you live ?
"It was a long , long tramp for a boy like you . ''"
"`` Oh , I got on well enough , till I hurt my foot ."
"Folks gave me things to eat , and I slept in barns and tramped by day ."
"I got lost trying to make a short cut , or I 'd have been here sooner . ''"
"`` But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us , what were you going to do ? ''"
"`` I thought I 'd like to see Teddy again , and you ; and then I was going back to my old work in the city , only I was so tired I went to sleep on the hay ."
"I 'd have been gone in the morning , if you had n't found me . ''"
`` Are you sorry I did ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry , half reproachful look , as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot ."
"The color came up into Dan 's face , and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate , as he said very low , `` No , ma'am , I 'm glad , I wanted to stay , but I was afraid you -- '' He did not finish , for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity , as she saw his foot , for it was seriously hurt ."
`` When did you do it ? ''
`` Three days ago . ''
`` And you have walked on it in this state ? ''
"`` I had a stick , and I washed it at every brook I came to , and one woman gave me a rag to put on it . ''"
"`` Mr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once , '' and Mrs. Jo hastened into the next room , leaving the door ajar behind her , so that Dan heard all that passed ."
"`` Fritz , the boy has come back . ''"
`` Who ?
Dan ? ''
"`` Yes , Teddy saw him at the window , and he called to him , but he went away and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn ."
"I found him there just now fast asleep , and half dead with weariness and pain ."
"He ran away from Page a month ago , and has been making his way to us ever since ."
"He pretends that he did not mean to let us see him , but go on to the city , and his old work , after a look at us ."
"It is evident , however , that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing , and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back . ''"
`` Did he say so ? ''
"`` His eyes did , and when I waked him , he said , like a lost child , ` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . '"
"I had n't the heart to scold him , and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold ."
"I may keep him , Fritz ? ''"
"They were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them , and he had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse ."
"` George , Nana is a treasure . '"
"` No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies . '"
"` Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ' '"
"I wonder , ' Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , ' I wonder . '"
"It was an opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy ."
"At first he pooh-poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow ."
"` It is nobody I know , ' he said , examining it carefully , ` but he does look a scoundrel . '"
"` We were still discussing it , you remember , ' says Mr. Darling , ` when Nana came in with Michael 's medicine ."
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault ."
"Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine ."
"If he had a weakness , it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly ; and so now , when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , ` Be a man , Michael . '"
"` Wo n't ; wo n't , ' Michael cried naughtily ."
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him , and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness ."
"` Mother , do n't pamper him , ' he called after her ."
"` Michael , when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur ."
"I said `` Thank you , kind parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . '' '"
"He really thought this was true , and Wendy , who was now in her night-gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage Michael , ` That medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? '"
"` Ever so much nastier , ` Mr. Darling said bravely , ` and I would take it now as an example to you , Michael , if I had n't lost the bottle . '"
He had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there .
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it , and put it back on his wash-stand . '"
"I know where it is , father , ' Wendy cried , always glad to be of service ."
"` I 'll bring it , ' and she was off before he could stop her ."
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way .
"` John , ' he said , shuddering , ` it 's most beastly stuff ."
"It 's that nasty , sticky , sweet kind . '"
"` It will soon be over , father , ' John said cheerily , and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass . '"
"I have been as quick as I could , ' she panted ."
"` You have been wonderfully quick , ' her father retorted , with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her ."
"` Michael first , ' he said doggedly ."
"` Father first , ' said Michael , who was of a suspicious nature . '"
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
"She could run faster than Anne , who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt , and soon overtook her ."
Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison 's heart when he should see it .
"`` Anne , for mercy 's sake , stop , '' panted poor Diana ."
`` I 'm right out of breath and you are wet to the skin . ''
"`` I must ... get ... that cow ... out ... before ... Mr. Harrison ... sees her , '' gasped Anne ."
`` I do n't ... care ... if I 'm ... drowned ... if we ... can ... only ... do that . ''
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground .
No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field .
"`` Head her off , '' screamed Anne ."
"`` Run , Diana , run . ''"
Diana did run .
"Anne tried to , and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed ."
"Privately , Diana thought she was ."
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane .
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment .
"Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane , wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody and his son , both of whom wore a broad smile ."
"`` I guess you 'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week , Anne , '' chuckled Mr. Shearer ."
"`` I 'll sell her to you now , if you want her , '' said her flushed and disheveled owner ."
`` You may have her this very minute . ''
`` Done .
"I 'll give you twenty for her as I offered before , and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody ."
She 'll go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening .
Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow . ''
"Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road , and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars ."
`` What will Marilla say ? ''
asked Diana .
"`` Oh , she wo n't care ."
Dolly was my own cow and it is n't likely she 'd bring more than twenty dollars at the auction .
"But oh dear , if Mr. Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again , and after my giving him my word of honor that I 'd never let it happen !"
"Well , it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows ."
A cow that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence could n't be trusted anywhere . ''
"Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde 's , and when she returned knew all about Dolly 's sale and transfer , for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest ."
Also that there were very few birds in winter .
"` Of course they might want your clothes , ' he had to admit rather falteringly ."
She was somewhat indignant at this .
"` They are always thinking of their nests , ' he said apologetically , ` and there are some bits of you ' -- he stroked the fur on her pelisse -- ` that would excite them very much . '"
"` They sha n't have my fur , ' she said sharply ."
"` No , ' he said , still fondling it , however , ` no ."
"O Maimie , ' he said rapturously , ` do you know why I love you ?"
It is because you are like a beautiful nest . '
Somehow this made her uneasy . '
"I think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now , ' she said , holding back , and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird ."
"` After all , ' she said , ` you are only a Betwixt-and-Between . '"
"But it hurt him so much that she immediately added , ` It must be a delicious thing to be . '"
"` Come and be one , then , dear Maimie , ' he implored her , and they set off for the boat , for it was now very near Open-Gate time ."
"` And you are not a bit like a nest , ' he whispered to please her ."
"` But I think it is rather nice to be like one , ' she said in a woman 's contradictory way ."
"` And , Peter , dear , though I ca n't give them my fur , I would n't mind their building in it ."
Fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it !
"O Peter , how perfectly lovely ! '"
"-LSB- Illustration : Building the house for Maimie -RSB- But as they drew near the Serpentine , she shivered a little , and said , ` Of course I shall go and see mother often , quite often ."
"It is not as if I was saying good-bye for ever to mother , it is not in the least like that . '"
"` Oh no , ' answered Peter , but in his heart he knew it was very like that , and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her ."
"He was so fond of her , he felt he could not live without her ."
"` She will forget her mother in time , and be happy with me , ' he kept saying to himself , and he hurried her on , giving her thimbles by the way ."
"But even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness , she still talked tremblingly about her mother ."
"` You know quite well , Peter , do n't you , ' she said , ` that I would n't come unless I knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to ?"
"Peter , say it . '"
"He said it , but he could no longer look her in the face ."
"` If you are sure your mother will always want you , ' he added rather sourly ."
` The idea of mother 's not always wanting me ! '
"Maimie cried , and her face glistened ."
"` If she does n't bar you out , ' said Peter huskily ."
"` The door , ' replied Maimie , ` will always , always be open , and mother will always be waiting at it for me . '"
Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving .
"`` Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over , '' said poor Anne with bitter resignation ."
"`` You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it , '' said Leslie ."
"`` Friends will come there , as they have come here -- happiness will glorify it for you ."
"Now , it 's just a house to you -- but the years will make it a home . ''"
Anne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened Little Jem .
Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again .
"`` But it will be rompers next -- and then trousers -- and in no time he will be grown-up , '' she sighed ."
"`` Well , you would not want him to stay a baby always , Mrs. Doctor , dear , would you ? ''"
said Susan .
"`` Bless his innocent heart , he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses , with his dear feet sticking out ."
"And think of the save in the ironing , Mrs. Doctor , dear . ''"
"`` Anne , I have just had a letter from Owen , '' said Leslie , entering with a bright face ."
"`` And , oh !"
I have such good news .
He writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in .
"Anne , are you not glad ? ''"
"`` Oh , Leslie , ` glad ' is n't the word for it !"
It seems almost too good to be true .
"I sha 'n' t feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe , or left to tumble down in decay ."
"Why , it 's lovely !"
It 's lovely ! ''
One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house .
The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare .
Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell .
Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture .
The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows .
"`` It has all such a heart-broken , reproachful look , has n't it ? ''"
said Anne .
"`` Oh , I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight ! ''"
"`` We have been very happy here , have n't we , Anne-girl ? ''"
"said Gilbert , his voice full of feeling ."
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
`` A bell ! ''
"said Dick , sitting up ."
"`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''"
"A little after , the bell clanged again , but this time somewhat nearer hand ; and from that time forth , and still drawing nearer and nearer , it continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning ."
"`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''"
"said Dick , who was now broad awake ."
"`` It is some one walking , '' returned Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever as he moves . ''"
"`` I see that well , '' said Dick ."
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
"Jack , '' he added , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note ."
"An the day were not come '' -- But just then the bell , quickening its pace , began to ring thick and hurried , and then it gave a single hammering jangle , and was silent for a space ."
"`` It is as though the bearer had run for a pater-noster while , and then leaped the river , '' Dick observed ."
"`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Nay , '' returned Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack ."
'T is a man that walketh you right speedily .
"'T is a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business ."
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
"`` It is now close by , '' said Matcham ."
"They were now on the edge of the pit ; and as the pit itself was on a certain eminence , they commanded a view over the greater proportion of the clearing , up to the thick woods that closed it in ."
"The daylight , which was very clear and grey , showed them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse ."
"It passed some hundred yards from the pit , and ran the whole length of the clearing , east and west ."
"By the line of its course , Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House ."
"Upon this path , stepping forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appeared ."
"It paused a little , and seemed to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it began to draw near across the heath ."
At every step the bell clanked .
"Face , it had none ; a white hood , not even pierced with eye-holes , veiled the head ; and as the creature moved , it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick ."
"Fear fell upon the lads , as cold as death ."
`` A leper ! ''
"said Dick , hoarsely ."
"`` His touch is death , '' said Matcham ."
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
"Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone ."
"`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?"
Because it does n't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth 's only reply to this was a shocked look .
"To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore ."
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
"Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland ."
"She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter ."
"Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her ."
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
"`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly ."
`` You 'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you do n't look out . ''
"`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he 's drunk ."
What am I to do ? ''
"`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger ."
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
"Why , it 's madness . ''"
Katherine 's indignation got the better of her fear .
"`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible ."
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
"He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk ."
"`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly ."
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
"He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine ."
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I do n't .
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
"But when she came out again Susan was sitting on the veranda , loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time ."
`` Have you got your baby to sleep ? ''
she asked kindly .
Your baby !
"Really , Susan might have more tact ."
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla shortly ."
"Susan laid her parcels on the reed table , as one determined to do her duty ."
She was very tired but she must help Rilla out .
"Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out , and `` the poor child '' had had to entertain him alone ."
But Susan had come to her rescue -- Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was .
"`` Dear me , how you have grown up , '' she said , looking at Ken 's six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe ."
"Susan had grown used to khaki now , and at sixty-four even a lieutenant 's uniform is just clothes and nothing else ."
`` It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up .
"Rilla here , now , is almost fifteen . ''"
"`` I 'm going on seventeen , Susan , '' cried Rilla almost passionately ."
She was a whole month past sixteen .
It was intolerable of Susan .
"`` It seems just the other day that you were all babies , '' said Susan , ignoring Rilla 's protest ."
"`` You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw , Ken , though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb ."
Do you remember the day I spanked you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Ken ."
"`` Oh well , I suppose you would be too young -- you were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried ."
"I had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed , and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve ."
So I picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well .
You howled at the top of your voice but you left Nan alone after that . ''
Rilla was writhing .
Had n't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the Canadian Army ?
Apparently she had not .
"Oh , what would Ken think ?"
"`` I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either , '' continued Susan , who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening ."
"`` I shall never , no never , forget it ."
"She was up here one night with you when you were about three , and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten ."
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
"`` Nay , it is the way of England ."
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster ."
Even in our last reverses he stood firm . ''
"`` An it pleased you , then , '' said Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale ."
"The effect upon the earl 's countenance was instant ; he lowered like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutched at his dagger ."
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he asked .
"`` Even so , '' said Dick ."
`` It is your lordship 's own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
"`` It is my own estate , even as ye say ! ''"
returned the earl .
`` I am your bedesman for this letter .
It hath shown me a fox 's hole .
"Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom ."
"Go , a Mary 's name !"
"But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless ."
"The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . ''"
"`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' pleaded Dick ."
"`` It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' said the earl ."
`` He hath been gallows-ripe this score of years .
"And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? ''"
"`` Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , '' answered Dick , `` and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . ''"
"`` Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , '' replied the earl , severely ."
`` It is an evil way to prosper in this world .
"Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you ."
"Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town ."
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saints confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
"`` My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' replied Dick , as he turned from the apartment ."
"CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham held his garrison , the evening had already come ."
"`` Oh , if Susan and you are both banded together against me ! ''"
said Anne helplessly .
"One day the glorious news came that the Canadians had taken Courcelette and Martenpuich , with many prisoners and guns ."
Susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that Haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job .
The others dared not feel exultant .
Who knew what price had been paid ?
"Rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out , her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep ."
Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time .
The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder .
Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows .
"There was no wind , and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station ."
Was it Dog Monday ?
"And if it were , why was he howling like that ?"
Rilla shivered ; the sound had something boding and grievous in it .
"She remembered that Miss Oliver said once , when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl , `` When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing . ''"
Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart .
It was Dog Monday -- she felt sure of it .
Whose dirge was he howling -- to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell ?
Rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep .
All day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone .
"She went down to see Dog Monday and the station-master said , `` That dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird ."
I dunno what got into him .
I got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no ` tention to me .
"He was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform , and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggar 'd lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking ."
He never did it afore -- always slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train .
But he sure had something on his mind last night . ''
Dog Monday was lying in his kennel .
He wagged his tail and licked Rilla 's hand .
But he would not touch the food she brought for him .
"`` I 'm afraid he 's sick , '' she said anxiously ."
She hated to go away and leave him .
But no bad news came that day -- nor the next -- nor the next .
"`` There is no sense in believing a thing just because you 'd like to believe it , Susan Baker ."
The British have lost millions of men at the Somme and how far have they got ?
"Look facts in the face , Susan Baker , look facts in the face . ''"
`` They are wearing the Germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west .
"I am not , '' admitted Susan in tremendous humility , `` I am not a military expert , Sophia Crawford , but even I can see that , and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything ."
The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world .
"Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum 's son Roderick , from the Upper Glen ?"
He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week .
"He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on , till you would have supposed everything was lovely ."
"But when he signed his name , right in between Roderick and MacCallum , he wrote two Gaelic words that meant ` all lies ' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy 's name ."
"So he let it pass , never dreaming how he was diddled ."
"Well , I am going to leave the war to Haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake ."
And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf .
The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it .
We had company for tea that night and when I went to get my cake what a sight did I behold ! ''
`` Has that pore orphan 's father never been heerd from yet ? ''
asked Cousin Sophia .
"`` Yes , I had a letter from him in July , '' said Rilla ."
"`` He said that when he got word of his wife 's death and of my taking the baby -- Mr. Meredith wrote him , you know -- he wrote right away , but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost . ''"
"`` It took him two years to begin to think it , '' said Susan scornfully ."
`` Some people think very slow .
"Jim Anderson has not got a scratch , for all he has been two years in the trenches ."
"A fool for luck , as the old proverb says . ''"
"`` He wrote very nicely about Jims and said he 'd like to see him , '' said Rilla ."
"`` So I wrote and told him all about the wee man , and sent him snapshots ."
Jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck . ''
"`` You did n't used to be very fond of babies , '' said Cousin Sophia ."
"`` I 'm not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever I was , '' said Rilla , frankly ."
"`` But I do love Jims , and I 'm afraid I was n't really half as glad as I should have been when Jim Anderson 's letter proved that he was safe and sound . ''"
`` You was n't hoping the man would be killed ! ''
cried Cousin Sophia in horrified accents .
`` No -- no -- no !
Subject : ` Is summer or winter best fun ? '
A lively pow-wow .
About evenly divided .
J. Flint fined five cents for disrespect to the Chair .
A collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the door-step .
"E. Devlin was chosen Secretary for the coming year , and a new book contributed by the Chairman . ''"
`` That 's all . ''
`` Is there any other business before the meeting ? ''
"asked Frank , as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table ."
"Ed rose , and glancing about him with an appealing look , said , as if sure his proposition would not be well received , `` I wish to propose the name of a new member ."
"Bob Walker wants to join , and I think we ought to let him ."
"He is trying to behave well , and I am sure we could help him ."
Ca n't we ? ''
"All the boys looked sober , and Joe , otherwise Brickbat , said , bluntly , `` I wo n't ."
"He 's a bad lot , and we do n't want any such here ."
Let him go with chaps of his own sort . ''
`` That is just what I want to keep him from !
"He 's a good-hearted boy enough , only no one looks after him ; so he gets into scrapes , as we should , if we were in his place , I dare say ."
"He wants to come here , and would be so proud if he was let in , I know he 'd behave ."
"Come now , let 's give him a chance , '' and Ed looked at Gus and Frank , sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point ."
"But Gus shook his head , as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan , and Frank said gravely : `` You know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight , and we can not break it . ''"
`` You need n't .
"I ca n't be here half the time , so I will resign and let Bob have my place , '' began Ed , but he was silenced by shouts of `` No , no , you sha n't ! ''"
`` We wo n't let you off ! ''
"`` Club would go to smash , if you back out ! ''"
"`` Let him have my place ; I 'm the youngest , and you wo n't miss me , '' cried Jack , bound to stand by Ed at all costs ."
"`` We might do that , '' said Frank , who did object to small boys , though willing to admit this particular one ."
"`` Better make a new rule to have ten members , and admit both Bob and Tom Grant , '' said Ralph , whereat Grif grinned and Joe scowled , for one lad liked Merry 's big brother and the other did not ."
`` That 's a good idea !
"Put it to vote , '' said Gus , too kind-hearted to shut the door on any one ."
"`` First I want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by Bob , out of the club as well as in , for it wo n't do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street , '' said Ed , heartily in earnest about the matter ."
`` I will ! ''
"There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''"
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
"`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried ."
"I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it ."
"Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him ."
"`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us ."
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roared Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man cursed the money .
"`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried ."
"`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man ."
"`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? ''"
cried the blind man again .
"At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn ."
"`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . ''"
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I had put his eyes out ! ''
"cried the blind man , Pew ."
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it .
"Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''"
"`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window ."
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
"reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road ."
"Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found ."
"And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated ."
"I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger ."
"`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one ."
`` Twice !
"We 'll have to budge , mates . ''"
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
"asked Gilbert , who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh ."
"Anne colored , and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions ."
`` Nothing very dreadful .
"I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts , as Professor Hamilton advised me , but I could n't get them to please me ."
They seem so still and foolish directly they 're written down on white paper with black ink .
"Fancies are like shadows ... you ca n't cage them , they 're such wayward , dancing things ."
But perhaps I 'll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying .
"I have n't a great many spare moments , you know ."
"By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions , I do n't always feel like writing any of my own . ''"
"`` You are getting on splendidly in school , Anne ."
"All the children like you , '' said Gilbert , sitting down on the stone step ."
"`` No , not all ."
Anthony Pye does n't and WO N'T like me .
"What is worse , he does n't respect me ... no , he does n't ."
He simply holds me in contempt and I do n't mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably .
"It is n't that he is so very bad ... he is only rather mischievous , but no worse than some of the others ."
He seldom disobeys me ; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it was n't worthwhile disputing the point or he would ... and it has a bad effect on the others .
I 've tried every way to win him but I 'm beginning to fear I never shall .
"I want to , for he 's rather a cute little lad , if he IS a Pye , and I could like him if he 'd let me . ''"
`` Probably it 's merely the effect of what he hears at home . ''
`` Not altogether .
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things .
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good .
"Well , we 'll see what patience and kindness will do ."
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work .
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others .
"That child is a perfect darling , Gilbert , and a genius into the bargain ."
"I 'm persuaded the world will hear of him some day , '' concluded Anne in a tone of conviction ."
"`` I like teaching , too , '' said Gilbert ."
"`` It 's good training , for one thing ."
"Why , Anne , I 've learned more in the weeks I 've been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself ."
"A whistle sounded thrice , and then again twice ."
It was repeated from another quarter .
"The woods on either side became full of the sound of people bursting through the underwood ; and a bewildered deer ran out into the open , stood for a second on three feet , with nose in air , and then plunged again into the thicket ."
"Selden still ran , bounding ; ever and again an arrow followed him , but still would miss ."
It began to appear as if he might escape .
"Dick had his bow armed , ready to support him ; even Matcham , forgetful of his interest , took sides at heart for the poor fugitive ; and both lads glowed and trembled in the ardour of their hearts ."
"He was within fifty yards of them , when an arrow struck him and he fell ."
"He was up again , indeed , upon the instant ; but now he ran staggering , and , like a blind man , turned aside from his direction ."
Dick leaped to his feet and waved to him .
`` Here ! ''
he cried .
`` This way !
here is help !
"Nay , run , fellow -- run ! ''"
"But just then a second arrow struck Selden in the shoulder , between the plates of his brigandine , and , piercing through his jack , brought him , like a stone , to earth ."
"`` O , the poor heart ! ''"
"cried Matcham , with clasped hands ."
"And Dick stood petrified upon the hill , a mark for archery ."
"Ten to one he had speedily been shot -- for the foresters were furious with themselves , and taken unawares by Dick 's appearance in the rear of their position -- but instantly , out of a quarter of the wood surprisingly near to the two lads , a stentorian voice arose , the voice of Ellis Duckworth ."
`` Hold ! ''
it roared .
`` Shoot not !
Take him alive !
It is young Shelton -- Harry 's son . ''
"And immediately after a shrill whistle sounded several times , and was again taken up and repeated farther off ."
"The whistle , it appeared , was John Amend-All 's battle trumpet , by which he published his directions ."
"`` Ah , foul fortune ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` We are undone .
"Swiftly , Jack , come swiftly ! ''"
And the pair turned and ran back through the open pine clump that covered the summit of the hill .
"CHAPTER VI -- TO THE DAY 'S END It was , indeed , high time for them to run ."
"cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement , `` I 'm going to stay . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched , for Nan was a kindred spirit , and he foresaw `` larks '' in the future ."
"`` I can bat ; let me play , '' said Nan , who could turn her hand to any thing , and did not mind hard knocks ."
"`` We ai n't playing now , and our side beat without you . ''"
"`` I can beat you in running , any way , '' returned Nan , falling back on her strong point ."
`` Can she ? ''
asked Nat of Jack .
"`` She runs very well for a girl , '' answered Jack , who looked down upon Nan with condescending approval ."
`` Will you try ? ''
"said Nan , longing to display her powers ."
"`` It 's too hot , '' and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted ."
`` What 's the matter with Stuffy ? ''
"asked Nan , whose quick eyes were roving from face to face ."
"`` Ball hurt his hand ; he howls at every thing , '' answered Jack scornfully ."
"`` I do n't , I never cry , no matter how I 'm hurt ; it 's babyish , '' said Nan , loftily ."
`` Pooh !
"I could make you cry in two minutes , '' returned Stuffy , rousing up ."
`` See if you can . ''
"`` Go and pick that bunch of nettles , then , '' and Stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall ."
"Nan instantly `` grasped the nettle , '' pulled it up , and held it with a defiant gesture , in spite of the almost unbearable sting ."
"`` Good for you , '' cried the boys , quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex ."
"More nettled than she was , Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow , and he said tauntingly , `` You are used to poking your hands into every thing , so that is n't fair ."
"Now go and bump your head real hard against the barn , and see if you do n't howl then . ''"
"`` Do n't do it , '' said Nat , who hated cruelty ."
"But Nan was off , and running straight at the barn , she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat , and sounded like a battering-ram ."
"Dizzy , but undaunted , she staggered up , saying stoutly , though her face was drawn with pain , `` That hurt , but I do n't cry . ''"
"`` Do it again , '' said Stuffy angrily ; and Nan would have done it , but Nat held her ; and Tommy , forgetting the heat , flew at Stuffy like a little game-cock , roaring out , `` Stop it , or I 'll throw you over the barn ! ''"
and so shook and hustled poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels .
"`` She told me to , '' was all he could say , when Tommy let him alone ."
"`` Never mind if she did ; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl , '' said Demi , reproachfully ."
`` Ho !
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"Finally Mr. Barry shook his head , with a relieved air ."
`` She ca n't be down there .
"It 's a mighty curious thing where she could have got to , though ."
"Look here , young man , are you sure you 've no idea where your sister is ? ''"
"`` I 've told you a dozen times that I have n't , '' said Davy , with an injured air ."
`` Maybe a tramp come and stole her . ''
"`` Nonsense , '' said Marilla sharply , relieved from her horrible fear of the well ."
"`` Anne , do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr. Harrison 's ?"
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over . ''
"`` I ca n't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I 'll go over and see , '' said Anne ."
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face .
"He quietly slipped off the gate and ran , as fast as his fat legs could carry him , to the barn ."
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind .
"The house was locked , the window shades were down , and there was no sign of anything living about the place ."
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly .
"Ginger , in the kitchen behind her , shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness ; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a toolhouse ."
"Anne flew to the door , unhasped it , and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg ."
"`` Oh , Dora , Dora , what a fright you have given us !"
How came you to be here ? ''
"`` Davy and I came over to see Ginger , '' sobbed Dora , `` but we could n't see him after all , only Davy made him swear by kicking the door ."
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door ; and I could n't get out .
"I cried and cried , I was frightened , and oh , I 'm so hungry and cold ; and I thought you 'd never come , Anne . ''"
`` Davy ? ''
But Anne could say no more .
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart .
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy 's behavior .
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned .
But Davy had told falsehoods ... downright coldblooded falsehoods about it .
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it .
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment .
She had grown to love Davy dearly ... how dearly she had not known until this minute ... and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood .
Marilla listened to Anne 's tale in a silence that boded no good Davy-ward ; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with .
"I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island ."
"`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters ."
"Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself ."
"But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet ."
"You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?"
No ?
"Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . ''"
"`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . ''"
"All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature ."
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
"`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? ''"
he repeated .
"`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? ''"
"`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply ."
"`` And right you was , '' he cried ."
"`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? ''"
"`` Jim , '' I told him ."
"`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently ."
"`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of ."
"Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered ."
"`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious ."
"And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another ."
"And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones !"
"That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !"
But it were Providence that put me here .
"I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety ."
"You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have ."
"I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to ."
"And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . ''"
"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich !"
`` The first week in June was another dreadful one .
"The Austrians seemed just on the point of overrunning Italy : and then came the first awful news of the Battle of Jutland , which the Germans claimed as a great victory ."
Susan was the only one who carried on .
"` You need never tell me that the Kaiser has defeated the British Navy , ' she said , with a contemptuous sniff ."
` It is all a German lie and that you may tie to . '
"And when a couple of days later we found out that she was right and that it had been a British victory instead of a British defeat , we had to put up with a great many ' I told you so 's , ' but we endured them very comfortably ."
`` It took Kitchener 's death to finish Susan .
For the first time I saw her down and out .
We all felt the shock of it but Susan plumbed the depths of despair .
The news came at night by ` phone but Susan would n't believe it until she saw the Enterprise headline the next day .
"She did not cry or faint or go into hysterics ; but she forgot to put salt in the soup , and that is something Susan never did in my recollection ."
"Mother and Miss Oliver and I cried but Susan looked at us in stony sarcasm and said , ` The Kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving ."
So the world is not left wholly desolate .
"Why cry , Mrs. Dr. dear ? '"
"Susan continued in this stony , hopeless condition for twenty-four hours , and then Cousin Sophia appeared and began to condole with her . ''"
"` This is terrible news , ai n't it , Susan ?"
We might as well prepare for the worst for it is bound to come .
"You said once -- and well do I remember the words , Susan Baker -- that you had complete confidence in God and Kitchener ."
"Ah well , Susan Baker , there is only God left now . '"
`` Whereat Cousin Sophia put her handkerchief to her eyes pathetically as if the world were indeed in terrible straits .
"As for Susan , Cousin Sophia was the salvation of her ."
She came to life with a jerk . ''
"` Sophia Crawford , hold your peace ! '"
she said sternly .
` You may be an idiot but you need not be an irreverent idiot .
It is no more than decent to be weeping and wailing because the Almighty is the sole stay of the Allies now .
"As for Kitchener , his death is a great loss and I do not dispute it ."
But the outcome of this war does not depend on one man 's life and now that the Russians are coming on again you will soon see a change for the better . '
`` Susan said this so energetically that she convinced herself and cheered up immediately .
But Cousin Sophia shook her head . ''
"` Albert 's wife wants to call the baby after Brusiloff , ' she said , ` but I told her to wait and see what becomes of him first ."
Them Russians has such a habit of petering out . '
"` Please , sir , ' Peter explained , ' a lady lies very ill . '"
"She was lying at their feet , but Slightly had the sense not to see her ."
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' he said , ` where does she lie ? '"
` In yonder glade . ' '
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth , ' said Slightly ; and he made-believe to do it , while Peter waited ."
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn .
` How is she ? '
inquired Peter .
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' said Slightly , ` this has cured her . ' '"
"I am glad , ' Peter cried . '"
"I will call again in the evening , ' Slightly said ; ` give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it ' ; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty ."
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy 's feet .
"` If only we knew , ' said one , ` the kind of house she likes best . '"
"` Peter , ' shouted another , ` she is moving in her sleep . '"
"` Her mouth opens , ' cried a third , looking respectfully into it ."
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ' said Peter ."
"` Wendy , sing the kind of house you would like to have . '"
"Immediately , without opening her eyes , Wendy began to sing : ' I wish I had a pretty house , The littlest ever seen , With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green . '"
"They gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground was carpeted with moss ."
"As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves : ` We 've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door , So tell us , mother Wendy , What are you wanting more ? '"
"To this she answered rather greedily : ` Oh , really next I think I 'll have Gay windows all about , With roses peeping in , you know , And babies peeping out . '"
"With a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves were the blinds ."
But roses -- ?
"` Roses , ' cried Peter sternly ."
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls .
Babies ?
"To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : ` We 've made the roses peeping out , The babes are at the door , We can not make ourselves , you know , ` Cos we 've been made before . '"
"Peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his own ."
"The house was quite beautiful , and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within , though , of course , they could no longer see her ."
"Peter strode up and down , ordering finishing touches ."
Nothing escaped his eagle eye .
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
"`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . ''"
"`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying ."
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? ''
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure ."
"Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands ."
I keep her under the white rock .
"If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark ."
Hi ! ''
he broke out .
`` What 's that ? ''
"For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon ."
`` They have begun to fight ! ''
I cried .
`` Follow me . ''
"And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly ."
"`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim !"
Under the trees with you !
Theer 's where I killed my first goat .
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn .
Ah !
"And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant ."
`` You see the mounds ?
"I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo ."
"It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . ''"
"So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer ."
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
"Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood ."
PART FOUR -- The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA .
"The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin ."
"Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea ."
"But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest ."
"`` Now here , '' he cried , `` on my right hand , I swear to avenge it !"
"If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men 's souls for each , may this hand wither from my body !"
"I broke this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggared him to his door ; I burned the thatch above his head ; I drove him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ?"
"Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! ''"
"He was silent for some time , his face working ."
`` Eat ! ''
"he cried , suddenly ."
"`` And you here , '' he added to Matcham , `` swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . ''"
"`` I will pledge mine honour , '' replied Matcham ."
`` What make I with your honour ? ''
cried the knight .
`` Swear me upon your mother 's welfare ! ''
"Matcham gave the required oath ; and Sir Daniel re-adjusted the hood over his face , and prepared his bell and staff ."
To see him once more in that appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions .
But the knight was soon upon his feet .
"`` Eat with despatch , '' he said , `` and follow me yarely to mine house . ''"
"And with that he set forth again into the woods ; and presently after the bell began to sound , numbering his steps , and the two lads sat by their untasted meal , and heard it die slowly away up hill into the distance ."
`` And so ye go to Tunstall ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` Yea , verily , '' said Matcham , `` when needs must !"
I am braver behind Sir Daniel 's back than to his face . ''
"They ate hastily , and set forth along the path through the airy upper levels of the forest , where great beeches stood apart among green lawns , and the birds and squirrels made merry on the boughs ."
"Two hours later , they began to descend upon the other side , and already , among the tree-tops , saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House ."
"`` Here , '' said Matcham , pausing , `` ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y ' are to see no more ."
"Come , Dick , forgive him what he did amiss , as he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . ''"
`` And wherefore so ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . ''"
"`` Ye 'll never again see poor Jack Matcham , '' replied the other , `` that was so fearful and burthensome , and yet plucked you from the river ; ye 'll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! ''"
"He held his arms open , and the lads embraced and kissed ."
"`` And , Dick , '' continued Matcham , `` my spirit bodeth ill ."
"Y ' are now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly , and fortune followed him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he runs the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of us ."
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt ."
"At this point Mr. Harrison arose and , with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot , carried Ginger 's cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ."
"Ginger shrieked , swore , and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation , but finding himself left alone , relapsed into sulky silence ."
"`` Excuse me and go on , '' said Mr. Harrison , sitting down again ."
`` My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners . ''
`` I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen .
"Mr. Harrison , '' ... Anne leaned forward , clasping her hands with her old childish gesture , while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr. Harrison 's embarrassed face ... `` I found my cow still shut up in the pen ."
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison , in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion ."
`` What a VERY extraordinary thing ! ''
"`` Oh , it is n't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes , '' said Anne mournfully ."
`` I 'm noted for that .
You might suppose I 'd have grown out of it by this time ... I 'll be seventeen next March ... but it seems that I have n't .
"Mr. Harrison , is it too much to hope that you 'll forgive me ?"
"I 'm afraid it 's too late to get your cow back , but here is the money for her ... or you can have mine in exchange if you 'd rather ."
She 's a very good cow .
And I ca n't express how sorry I am for it all . ''
"`` Tut , tut , '' said Mr. Harrison briskly , `` do n't say another word about it , miss ."
It 's of no consequence ... no consequence whatever .
Accidents will happen .
"I 'm too hasty myself sometimes , miss ... far too hasty ."
But I ca n't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me .
"If that cow had been in my cabbages now ... but never mind , she was n't , so it 's all right ."
"I think I 'd rather have your cow in exchange , since you want to be rid of her . ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'm so glad you are not vexed .
I was afraid you would be . ''
"`` And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me , after the fuss I made yesterday , hey ?"
"But you must n't mind me , I 'm a terrible outspoken old fellow , that 's all ... awful apt to tell the truth , no matter if it is a bit plain . ''"
"`` So is Mrs. Lynde , '' said Anne , before she could prevent herself ."
`` Who ?
Mrs. Lynde ?
"He gave his hat to Liza , who took it scornfully ; for she had no imagination , and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man ."
"Outside , the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering , and he was naturally not unmoved ."
"`` Listen to them , '' he said ; `` it is very gratifying . ''"
"`` Lots of little boys , '' sneered Liza ."
"`` There were several adults to-day , '' he assured her with a faint flush ; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her ."
Social success had not spoilt him ; it had made him sweeter .
"For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel , talking with Mrs. Darling of this success , and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it ."
"`` But if I had been a weak man , '' he said ."
"`` Good heavens , if I had been a weak man ! ''"
"`` And , George , '' she said timidly , `` you are as full of remorse as ever , are n't you ? ''"
"`` Full of remorse as ever , dearest !"
See my punishment : living in a kennel . ''
"`` But it is punishment , is n't it , George ?"
You are sure you are not enjoying it ? ''
`` My love ! ''
"You may be sure she begged his pardon ; and then , feeling drowsy , he curled round in the kennel ."
"`` Wo n't you play me to sleep , '' he asked , `` on the nursery piano ? ''"
"and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly , `` And shut that window ."
I feel a draught . ''
"`` O George , never ask me to do that ."
"The window must always be left open for them , always , always . ''"
"Now it was his turn to beg her pardon ; and she went into the day-nursery and played , and soon he was asleep ; and while he slept , Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room ."
Oh no .
"We have written it so , because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship ; but something must have happened since then , for it is not they who have flown in , it is Peter and Tinker Bell ."
Peter 's first words tell all .
"`` Quick Tink , '' he whispered , `` close the window ; bar it !"
That 's right .
Now you and I must get away by the door ; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out ; and she will have to go back with me . ''
"Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me , why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland ."
This trick had been in his head all the time .
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee ; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing .
"He whispered to Tink , `` It 's Wendy 's mother !"
"When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John ."
"There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me ."
"Feared he was , and proud ."
"They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them ."
"Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers ."
"Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . ''"
"`` Well , I tell you now , '' replied the lad , `` I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . ''"
"`` And a brave lad you were , and smart too , '' answered Silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . ''"
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms .
"By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard ."
"But on this point I was soon to be relieved , for Silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party ."
"`` Dick 's square , '' said Silver ."
"`` Oh , I know 'd Dick was square , '' returned the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands ."
"`` He 's no fool , is Dick . ''"
And he turned his quid and spat .
"`` But look here , '' he went on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?"
"I 've had a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder !"
"I want to go into that cabin , I do ."
"I want their pickles and wines , and that . ''"
"`` Israel , '' said Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever was ."
"But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough ."
"Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? ''"
growled the coxswain .
"`` What I say is , when ?"
That 's what I say . ''
`` When !
By the powers ! ''
cried Silver .
"`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when ."
"The last moment I can manage , and that 's when ."
"Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us ."
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
"`` Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood !"
Stand !
"Back out , Hugh Ferryman . ''"
Dick cried a taunting answer .
"`` Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , '' returned the man ; and he let drive an arrow ."
"The horse , struck by the shaft , lashed out in agony and terror ; the boat capsized , and the next moment all were struggling in the eddies of the river ."
"When Dick came up , he was within a yard of the bank ; and before his eyes were clear , his hand had closed on something firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward ."
"It was the riding-rod , that Matcham , crawling forth upon an overhanging willow , had opportunely thrust into his grasp ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"cried Dick , as he was helped ashore , `` that makes a life I owe you ."
I swim like a cannon-ball . ''
And he turned instantly towards the island .
"Midway over , Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his upturned boat , while John-a-Fenne , furious at the ill-fortune of his shot , bawled to him to hurry ."
"`` Come , Jack , '' said Shelton , `` run for it !"
"Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of 'em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . ''"
"And adding example to his words , he began to run , dodging among the willows , and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock ."
"He had no time to look for his direction ; all he could do was to turn his back upon the river , and put all his heart to running ."
"Presently , however , the ground began to rise , which showed him he was still in the right way , and soon after they came forth upon a slope of solid turf , where elms began to mingle with the willows ."
"But here Matcham , who had been dragging far into the rear , threw himself fairly down ."
"`` Leave me , Dick ! ''"
"he cried , pantingly ; `` I can no more . ''"
"Dick turned , and came back to where his companion lay ."
"`` Nay , Jack , leave thee ! ''"
he cried .
"`` That were a knave 's trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life ."
"Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I would ` a ' saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . ''"
`` Can ye so ? ''
"cried Dick , with open eyes ."
It was the one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable .
"In the order of the things that he admired , next to having killed a man in single fight came swimming ."
"`` Well , '' he said , `` here is a lesson to despise no man ."
"He was a tall , broad-shouldered man of forty , and looking no younger , with dark grey eyes and a tanned , clean-cut face , clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache ."
"Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man , and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married ."
"They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm , with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion , for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions , and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them ."
"One of Jeffrey 's dogs was with him now -- the oldest one , with white breast and paws and a tawny coat ."
"He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf , but , with one exception , he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller , for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly , chubby little pup years ago ."
They came down the hill together .
"A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow , discussing Colonel Stuart 's funeral of the day before ."
Jeffrey caught Sara 's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen .
"Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart 's name were pronounced above him , his heart would give a bound of life ."
"`` Yes , the old kunnel 's gone at last , '' Christopher Jackson was saying ."
"`` He took his time dyin ' , that 's sartain ."
"Must be a kind of relief for Sara -- she 's had to wait on him , hand and foot , for years ."
But no doubt she 'll feel pretty lonesome .
Wonder what she 'll do ? ''
`` Is there any particular reason for her to do anything ? ''
asked Alec Churchill .
"`` Well , she 'll have to leave Pinehurst ."
"The estate 's entailed and goes to her cousin , Charles Stuart . ''"
There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this .
"Jeffrey drew nearer , absently patting his dog 's head ."
He had not known it either .
"`` Oh , yes , '' said Christopher , enjoying all the importance of exclusive information ."
`` I thought everybody knew that .
Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir .
The old kunnel felt it keen that he had n't a son .
"Of course , there 's plenty of money and Sara 'll get that ."
But I guess she 'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home .
"Sara ai n't as young as she used to be , neither ."
Let me see -- she must be thirty-eight .
"Well , she 's left pretty lonesome . ''"
"`` Maybe she 'll stay on at Pinehurst , '' said Job Crowe ."
`` It 'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there . ''
"'T is a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' are weak , forsooth !"
"Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !"
Tut !
fool words ! ''
"`` And yet ye beat me not , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Let be , '' said Dick -- `` let be ."
I will instruct you .
"Y ' ` ave been ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river ."
"Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself ."
"But , come , let us on ."
"An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . ''"
"But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham had forgiven him nothing ."
"His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he had slain -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , were things not easily to be forgotten ."
"`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' said Matcham ."
"`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone ."
"Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson ."
Fare ye well ! ''
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''"
"Each turned aside , and they began walking off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel ."
"But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was called , and Matcham came running after ."
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` it were unmannerly to part so coldly ."
"Here is my hand , and my heart with it ."
"For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you ."
Fare ye right well . ''
"`` Well , lad , '' returned Dick , taking the hand which was offered him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may ."
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' are too disputatious . ''
So then they separated for the second time ; and presently it was Dick who was running after Matcham .
"`` Here , '' he said , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''"
`` A cross-bow ! ''
said Matcham .
"`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it ."
`` Why do n't you go ? ''
the old one asked politely .
"`` I suppose , '' said Peter huskily , `` I suppose I can still fly ? ''"
"You see , he had lost faith ."
"`` Poor little half-and-half , '' said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , `` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . ''
`` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? ''
Peter asked tragically .
`` How could you get across ? ''
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
`` Then I sha 'n' t be exactly a human ? ''
Peter asked .
`` No . ''
`` Nor exactly a bird ? ''
`` No . ''
`` What shall I be ? ''
"`` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , '' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once , then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs , and so it went on forever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , `` Greedy !"
Greedy ! ''
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
Peter wore no night-gown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
I did n't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his moods .
But it 's time something was done .
She 's woman grown and this is no life for her .
"And there 's nobody to do anything but me and I 'm not able , even if I knew what to do ."
I wonder why she hates men so .
Perhaps it 's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen .
This man is -- but then he 's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between them in another way .
I 've seen the love of man and woman bridge some wider gulfs though .
"But it ca n't with Lynde , I 'm fearing ."
She 's so bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage .
I ca n't think why .
"I 'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together , and that was all she 's ever seen of marriage ."
But I thought when she told me of meeting this young man on the shore there was something in her look I 'd never noticed before -- as if she 'd found something in herself she 'd never known was there .
But she 'll never make friends with him and I ca n't .
"If the Captain was n't so queer -- '' She stopped abruptly , for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the shore ."
Lynde waved her hand as she drew near .
"`` Oh , Emily , I 've had such a splendid sail ."
It was glorious .
"Bad Emily , you 've been carrying water ."
Did n't I tell you never to do that when I was away ? ''
`` I did n't have to do it .
That young minister up at Rexton met me and brought it up .
"He 's nice , Lynde . ''"
Lynde 's brow darkened .
She turned and walked away to the house without a word .
On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore road .
She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the needles for a cushion .
"Yet the thought came into Alan 's mind that she was spying on him and , although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy , it continued to lurk there ."
"For a week he avoided the shore , but there came a day when its inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly ."
"It was a warm , windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous , the lake misty and blue ."
There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it .
"The Captain 's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was generally anchored and , though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs made Alan 's heart beat expectantly , he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver ."
"""Very well,"" said the crow, ""open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down and see."" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very quickly. ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach,"" said the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. ""Oh, jackal,"" said the Rohu, ""do tell me what I have inside me."""
"""How can I tell?"" said the jackal. ""I cannot see unless I go inside you."" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."" So off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. ""Oh,"" says the fish, ""do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.'"""
"The snake said, ""Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it is."" The snake went down: when he returned he said, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you."" ""If you do that, I shall die,"" said the Rohu. ""Oh, no,"" said the snake, ""you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again."" So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili."
"She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and they asked her what she wanted. ""I want King Majnun,"" she said."
"So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, ""An old woman outside says she wants you."" ""I cannot leave this place,"" said he; ""send her in here."" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted."
"""I want to marry you,"" she answered. ""Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for you."" Prince Majnun said, ""Very good."""
"""Pray to Khuda,"" said Laili, ""to make us both young again, and then we shall be married."" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, ""Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire, she and you will become young again."" When he touched Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again."
"And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother."
"Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, ""Laili, Laili, Laili."" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time with him."
"They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves."
"One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, ""Let us go through this jungle."""
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle."
"And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, ""I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see."" So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes."
"Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. ""I will only have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,"" said Prince Majnun."
"""How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"" said the father."
"""Then I'll not have any wife at all,"" said Prince Majnun."
"Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."""
"At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said to Khuda, ""Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'"
"and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun."""
"""Well,"" said Khuda, ""you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed."""
"So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal's garden. ""Now,"" he said, ""it is Khuda's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a little white dog."" He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form."
"Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when he married Laili."
"As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. ""Oh, look, look!"" he cried, ""see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us."" Laili looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness; but this only frightened Majnun the more. ""It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them."
"""What nonsense,"" said his father. ""Fancy two grown men being so frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten you."" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more."
"The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed."
"But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, ""What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!"" Poor Laili answered, ""Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more."" Majnun, however, said ""How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,"" and he was in great terror."
"In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. ""An old woman! an old woman! always an old woman!"" said his father. ""You do nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?"" However, when he saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back at night, he advised him to say to her, ""I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as you are?"""
"That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog, crying ""Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you."" ""Well,"" said Majnun, ""if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry you."""
"Laili said, ""Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on."" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and disappeared in the garden."
"Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit."
"""Oh!"" said the Prince, ""I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."""
"The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards."
"""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!"""
"""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And he nearly began to cry."
"Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared."
"""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!"""
"But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone."
"""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?"""
"For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home."
"Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."
"And then, one day, the Boy was ill."
"His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close."
"Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him."
"It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long."
"But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress."
"It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking."
"The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt."
"""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!"" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles."
Just then Nana caught sight of him.
"""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked."
"""That?"" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!"""
Anxious Times
"And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot."
"That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else."
"And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground."
"And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup."
"It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy."
"She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying."
"""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"""
"The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where."
"""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real."""
"""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit."
"""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one."""
"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade."
"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the Babes in the Wood, or the Norfolk Tragedy, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad and he will come to no good."
"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom."
"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master."
"""What is it, Fido good little elephant then?"" said Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood."
"""Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the lookout."" And he was."
"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole perhaps just behind them or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!"
"A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a speech. He said: ""Friends fellow citizens I cannot disguise from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a is no end of a dragon."""
"The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, ""Hear, hear."""
"Uncle James went on: ""Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless member of our community. We don't know what has happened."""
"Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned."
"""The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"" said Uncle James."
Everyone thought of the poor army.
"""There is only one thing to be done."" Uncle James was warming to his subject. ""Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits or even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect nothing, however sacred."""
"Everyone thought of themselves and they said, ""What is the simple precaution?"""
"Then Uncle James said: ""Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and never come back."""
The crowd cheered wildly and the Princess from her balcony clapped her hands.
"""The present the dragon expects,"" said Uncle James, cheerfully, ""is rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess will only show how generous you are."""
"The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted."
"The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday present especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he was so angry."
He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.
Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the downs there were hardly any rabbits playing there now and then he gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and looked out.
"""Come up and kiss me,"" she said."
"So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the window, and said: ""Many happy returns of the day."""
"Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: ""Oh, Tom how can you? When you know quite well """
"""Oh, don't,"" said Tom. ""Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess what do you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything. You've only got to do as you are told."""
"""Is that all?"" said the Princess. ""Oh that's easy I've often done that!"""
"Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and again. ""Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"" she said. ""How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"""
"The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it he was a magician, and he had a bright taste in vests and he called with a cab to take the Princess out."
"""Come, little birthday present,"" he said tenderly. ""The dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon, far from his home and friends."""
The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
"""I think,"" remarked a Red-headed Woodpecker, ""that I have the best wing feathers now that I ever had. They seem to be a little longer, and they hook together so well. I almost wish I were going South to try them on a long journey."""
"""Mr. Woodpecker's wing feathers are certainly excellent,"" said his wife, who was always glad to see him well dressed. ""I am sure that the strongest wind will never part them. I don't see how the Owls can stand it to wear their feathers unhooked so that some of the air passes through their wings each time they flap them. It must make flying hard."""
"""Well, if you were an Owl you would understand,"" chuckled the Crow. ""If their great wings were like ours, the noise of their flying would scare every creature within hearing, and there would not be much fun in hunting."""
"And so they chatted on, while from the meadow came the sound of the happy insects piping in the sunshine. It was chilly now at night and in the early morning, and they could give concerts only at noonday. The next day the Wild Turkeys came and there was great excitement in the forest. The Squirrels were busier than ever storing up all the acorns that they could before the newcomers reached the oak trees; and the Blue Jays were so jealous of the Turkeys that they overate every day for fear there would not be enough to go around. As though there were any danger!"
"The Ground Hog was getting so sleepy now that he would doze off while people were talking to him, and then he would suddenly straighten up and say: ""Yes, yes, yes! Don't think that I was asleep, please. The colors of the trees are so bright that they tire my eyes and I sometimes close them."" The dear old fellow really never knew how he had been nodding."
"The Snakes, too, were growing dull and slow of motion, while the Bats talked freely of hanging themselves up for the winter. The Grouse and Quail made daily trips to the edges of the grain-fields, and found rich picking among the stubble. You could almost fancy that they came home each night fatter than when they went away in the morning."
"Life went on in this way for many days, and the birds had all stopped singing. There were no more happy concerts at sunrise and no more carols at evening; only chirrupings and twitterings as the feathered people hopped restlessly from one perch to another. All could see that they were busily thinking and had no time for music. The truth was that each bird who was not to spend the winter in the Forest felt as though something were drawing drawing drawing him southward. It was something they could not see or hear, and yet it was drawing drawing drawing all day and all night. They spoke of it often to each other, and the older birds told the young ones how, before long, they would all start South, and fly over land and water until they reached their winter home."
"""How do we know where to go?"" asked the children."
"""All that you have to do,"" the older ones said, ""is to follow us."""
"""And how do you know?"" they asked."
"""Why, we have been there before,"" they answered; ""and we can see the places over which we pass. But perhaps that is not the real reason, for sometimes we fly over such great stretches of water that we can see nothing else and it all looks alike. Then we cannot see which way to go, but still we feel that we are drawn South, and we only have to think about that and fly onward. The fathers and sons can fly the faster and will reach there first. The mothers and daughters come a few days later."
"We never make a mistake."""
"""It is wonderful, wonderful,"" thought a young Rabbit on the grass below."
"""I must watch them when they go."""
"The very next morning the Forest People awakened to find a silvery frost on the grass and feel the still air stirred by the soft dropping of damp red, brown, and yellow leaves from the trees. Over the river and all the lowland near it hung a heavy veil of white mist."
"""It is time!"" whispered the Robins to each other."
"""It is time!"" cooed the Mourning Doves."
"""It is time!"" cried the Cowbirds in their hoarse voices."
"All through the forest there was restlessness and quiet haste. The Juncoes had already come from the cold northland and were resting from their long flight. The Ground Hogs, the Rabbits, and the Squirrels were out to say good-by. The Owls peeped from their hollow trees, shading their eyes from the strong light of the sun. And then the travellers went. The Robins started in family parties. The Mourning Doves slipped quietly away. The Cowbirds went in a dashing crowd. And the Crows, after much talking and disputing on the tree-tops, took a noisy farewell of the few members of the flock who were to remain behind, and, joining other flocks from the North, flew off in a great company which darkened the sky and caused a shadow to pass over the stubble-field almost like that of a summer cloud."
"""They are gone!"" sighed the Ground Hog and his wife. ""We shall miss them sadly. Well, we can dream about them, and that will be a comfort."""
"""Jay! Jay!"" shrieked a handsome-crested fellow from the tree above."
"""What if they are gone? They will be back in the spring, and we have plenty to eat. What is the use of feeling sad? Jay! Jay!"""
"But all people are not so heartless as the hungry Blue Jays, and the song-birds had many loving friends who missed them and longed for their return."
THE RUFFED GROUSE'S STORY
"The Ruffed Grouse cocked his crested head on one side and looked up through the bare branches to the sky. It was a soft gray, and in the west were banks of bluish clouds. ""I think it will snow very soon,"" said he. ""Mrs. Grouse, are the children all ready for cold weather?"""
"""All ready,"" answered his cheerful little wife. ""They have had their thickest feathers on for quite a while. The Rabbits were saying the other day that they had never seen a plumper or better clothed flock than ours."" And her beautiful golden-brown eyes shone with pride as she spoke."
"Indeed, the young Ruffed Grouse were a family of whom she might well be proud. Twelve healthy and obedient children do not fall to the lot of every Forest mother, and she wished with a sad little sigh that her other two eggs had hatched. She often thought of them with longing. How lovely it would have been to have fourteen children! But at that moment her brood came crowding around her in fright."
"""Some cold white things,"" they said, ""came tumbling down upon us and scared us. The white things didn't say a word, but they came so fast that we think they must be alive. Tell us what to do. Must we hide?"""
"""Why, that is snow!"" exclaimed their mother. ""It drops from the clouds up yonder quite as the leaves drop from the trees in the fall. It will not hurt you, but we must find shelter."""
"""What did I tell you, Mrs Grouse?"" asked her husband. ""I was certain that it would snow before night. I felt it in my quills."" And Mr. Grouse strutted with importance. It always makes one feel so very knowing when he has told his wife exactly what will happen."
"""How did you feel it in your quills?"" asked one of his children. ""Shall I feel it in my quills when I am as old as you are?"""
"In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England."
"He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once."
"Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and threw him into prison."
"And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started."
"""Surely,"" said he, ""that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that is the song we used to sing together."" When the song was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend."
"Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon Richard was set free, and went back to his own land."
The White Ship
"The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing, when the White Ship set sail from the shore of France. Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king."
"The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting."
"There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry."
"But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking."
"Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. ""Save us!"""
"shrieked the terrified people. ""Save the prince,"" cried the captain, ""the rest of us must die!"" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her."
"""Go back!"" shouted he. The boat was rowed back, but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned."
"Soon the White Ship sank also, and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved."
"When King Henry heard that his only son was dead, he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face."
Joan of Arc
"In a village in the green country of France, there once lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep."
"At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince."
"When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her."
"""How can a poor girl help the prince?"" asked they."
"""I do not know,"" replied Joan; ""but I must go, for God has sent me."" So she went to the prince, and said: ""Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France."""
"They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles."
Then the prince was crowned King of France.
"When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. ""I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,"" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten."
AFLOAT WITH A TIGER.
"A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence, during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house, situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close at hand."
"The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were; but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing, however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with their cries and the noise of their rushing wings."
"He found the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope."
"The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no better with him."
"No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him, which so frightened him that he also turned back."
"The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he went through fire and water, right on till he came to the bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket, but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that direction."
"When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world."
"First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing here?"" said the Princess. ""Heaven preserve you! what do you want?"""
"""I want to set you free and get you out of the mountain,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once; he has three heads,"" said she."
"""I do not care if he has four,"" said the soldier. ""I am here, and here I shall remain."""
"""Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I can help you,"""
said the Princess.
She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.
"""And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in,"""
"she said. ""But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table."" No, it was too heavy, he could not even move it."
"He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he was just able to stir it, so he took another draught, and then he could lift it. At last he took a right, big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as anything."
All at once the troll came home; he walked so heavily that the palace shook.
"""Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house,"" said he."
"""Yes,"" answered the Princess, ""a raven flew past here just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells."""
"""So it does,"" said the troll."
"""But come and lie down and I'll scratch your heads,"" said the Princess; ""the smell will be gone by the time you wake."""
"The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll."
"The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler, and went with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door."
"""Here you must enter: here she is,"" said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the second sister at a silver spinning-wheel."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear!"" she said. ""What do you want here?"""
"""I want to set you free from the troll,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay, but go,"" said the Princess. ""If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot."""
"""That would be awkward that is if I don't take his first,"" said the soldier."
"""Well, since you will stay,"" she said, ""you will have to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens."""
"First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the troll's sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin."
"Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in."
"""No,"" answered the Queen-Mother, ""I don't. You see, I have so much to think about, and happy thoughts make tasks light. And then, you know, it is not always the same kind of egg, and that makes a pleasant change for me. I will give you a motto to remember: 'As long as a Bee is well, work is pleasant when done faithfully.'"""
"""Perhaps that is the matter with me,"" said the Worker, raising her drooping head. ""I have been careless lately when I thought nobody was looking. I will try your way."""
"When she had gone, the Queen-Mother smiled to herself and said: ""Poor child! When work is no longer a pleasure, life is indeed sad. But any Larva should know better than to work carelessly when she is not watched."""
THE HAUGHTY GROUND HOG
"Not far from the home of the Rabbits was another burrow where the Ground Hog lived, and there was a very kindly feeling between the neighbors."
"They liked the same food, and as there was plenty for all, they often nibbled together near the edge of the forest. The little Rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. Once the biggest little Rabbit had run into the Ground Hog's burrow by mistake when he was frightened, and that was the beginning of a great friendship between them."
"They were a queer-looking couple, for the Rabbit was small and quick and dainty, while the Ground Hog, with his stout body covered with thick, reddish fur, his broad, flat head, and his short legs, was a clumsy fellow. To be sure, he could get out of sight quickly if he had to, but he never scampered around and kicked up his heels for the fun of it, as the Rabbits did. He was too dignified to do that. He came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. There were but few people in the forest who could do that; so, of course, he could not frisk like his neighbors."
"Perhaps if the Ground Hog had not belonged to so old a family, he might have had a better time. Yet the thought that he could remember his grandfather was a great pleasure to him, and when he was talking he would often remark in the most careless way, ""as my grandfather used to say""; or, ""That reminds me of something my grandfather once did."" Some people said that he did this to show off; but it may be that they were envious."
"However that may have been, the Ground Hog was certainly a haughty fellow, and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. Only once had he been known to get angry, and that was when a saucy young Chipmunk had spoken of him as a Woodchuck."
"""Woodchuck! Woodchuck!"" he had grunted. ""You young Bushy-tail, I am a Ground Hog, and the Ground Hog family lived in this forest long before you ever opened your eyes. People with good manners do not call us 'Woodchucks.' We do not like the name. My grandfather could not endure it."""
"It was not very long after this that he told the wondering young Rabbits about his grandfather. When talking, the Ground Hog rested by the edge of his burrow, sitting on his haunches, and waving his queer little forepaws whenever he told anything especially important. And this was the story:"
"""Perhaps you may have heard me speak of my grandfather. Ah, he was a Ground Hog worth seeing! He was large, and, although when I knew him the black fur on his back was streaked with gray, he was still handsome. He was clever, too. I have often heard my father say that he could dig the deepest and best burrow in the forest. And then he had such fine manners! There was not another Ground Hog in the country around who could eat as noisily as he, and it is said that when he was courting my grandmother she chose him because of the elegant way in which he sat up on his haunches. I have been told, children, that I am very much like him."""
"Just here, a Red-headed Woodpecker gave a loud ""Rat-a-tat-tat"" on the tree above the Ground Hog's head, and there was a look around her bill as though she wanted to laugh. The Ground Hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. ""Quite a good-looking young person,"" he said, ""but badly brought up. She should know better than to disturb those who are talking. What was I saying, children?"""
"""You were telling how well your grandfather sat up on his haunches,"""
said the smallest little Rabbit.
"""So I was! So I was! I must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. When he was only a young fellow, he made his home for a time by a Hen house, and so heard the talk of the barn-yard people."
"Once he heard them tell how the farmer watched on a certain winter day to see my grandfather come out of his burrow. Of course, you children all know how we Ground Hogs do; in the fall we are very fat, and when the cold weather comes we go to sleep in our burrows to wait for spring."
"Sometimes we awaken and stretch, but we go to sleep again very soon."
"Then, when spring comes we are slender and have healthy appetites."
"""The Hens treated my grandfather with great politeness, and the Black Brahma Cock showed plainly how honored they felt to have him there. They said that they were so glad my grandfather stayed out of his burrow awhile on this winter day when the farmer was watching, because they were in a hurry for warm weather. My grandfather did not know what they meant by that, but he was too wise to say so, and he found out by asking questions, that if a Ground Hog leaves his burrow on this certain day in winter, and sees his shadow, and goes back again, it will be cold for a long time after that. If he does not see his shadow, and stays out, it will soon be warm."
"""You see now, children, how important our family is; and yet we are so modest that we had not even known that we made the weather until the Hens told my grandfather. But that is the way! Really great people often think the least of themselves."""
"""And do you make the weather?"" asked the smallest little Rabbit."
"""I suppose we do,"" said the Ground Hog, with a smile. ""It is a great care. I often say to myself: 'Shall I have it warm, or shall I have it cold?' It worries me so that sometimes I can hardly eat."""
"""And how do you know when the day comes for you to make the weather?"""
said the smallest little rabbit.
"""Ahem! Well-er! I am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us, so I have to guess at that. But to think that we Ground Hogs make the weather for all the other people! It is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. I suppose I might have been a Weasel, a Fox, an Owl, or an Oriole. And it is a great thing to have known one's grandfather."""
"The little Rabbits sat very still, wishing that they had known their grandfather, when suddenly the biggest one said: ""If you should stay out of your burrow when that day comes, and another Ground Hog should go back into his burrow, how would the weather know what to do?"""
"""Children,"" said the old Ground Hog, ""I think your mother is calling to you. You might better go to see. Good-by."" And he waved his paw politely."
"The seven little Rabbits scampered away, but their mother was not calling them. She wasn't even there, and when they went back they couldn't find the Ground Hog. They wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. The Red-headed Woodpecker who came along at about that time, twisted her head on one side and said: ""Made-a-mistake! Rat-a-tat-tat!"
"Not he!"""
"""YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT IS,"" said the North Wind; ""once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn't blow a puff for ever so many days, after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither."""
"Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn't be at all afraid."
"""Very well, then,"" said the North Wind, ""but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get thither at all."""
"Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world's end."
"Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds."
"So they tore on and on no one can believe how far they went and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels."
"""Are you afraid?"" said the North Wind."
"""No!"" she wasn't."
"But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again."
"Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have the Prince."
"""What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?"" said the Long-nose, and threw up the window."
"""It's not for sale, for gold or money,"" said the lassie."
"""If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,"" said the Princess."
"""Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,"" said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought."
"Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again."
"So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince and be with him that night, the Princess should have it."
"But when she went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with the long nose, and chased her out again."
"So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under the castle window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it."
"Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running, and they told that to the Prince."
"That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither."
"""Ah,"" said the Prince, ""you've just come in the very nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it."""
"So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said:"
"""First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."""
"""Yes!"" said the step-mother, with all her heart."
"""Well,"" said the Prince, ""I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she can't, she's not worth having."""
"Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew."
"""Ah!"" said the old hag, her mother, ""you can't wash; let me try."""
"But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand before it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt."
"Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney."
"""Ah!"" said the Prince, ""you're none of you worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie, I'll be bound she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN, LASSIE!"""
he shouted.
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! don't take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Very well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
But just then up came the big billy-goat Gruff.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him."
"""WHO'S THAT tramping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""IT'S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF,"" said the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the Troll."
"""Well, come along! I've got two spears,             And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;             I've got besides two curling-stones,             And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones."""
"That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew at the Troll and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side. There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again; and if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why they're still fat; and so:"
"Snip, snap, snout,                         This tale's told out."
THE THREE PRINCESSES IN THE BLUE MOUNTAIN
"There were once upon a time a King and Queen who had no children, and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. One day the King stood in the portico and looked out over the big meadows and all that was his. But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since he did not know what would become of it after his time. As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven's name. She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the King, since he looked so sad."
"""You can't do anything to help me, my good woman,"" said the King; ""it's no use telling you."""
"""I am not so sure about that,"" said the beggar woman. ""Very little is wanted when luck is in the way. The King is thinking that he has no heir to his crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that account,"""
"she said. ""The Queen shall have three daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not come out under the open heavens before they are all fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and carry them away."""
"When the time came the Queen had a beautiful baby girl; the year after she had another, and the third year she also had a girl."
"The King and Queen were glad beyond all measure; but although the King was very happy, he did not forget to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the Princesses should not get out."
"As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful, and all went well with them in every way. Their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. For all they begged and prayed their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it was of no avail; go out they must not before they were fifteen years old, all of them."
"So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of the youngest Princess, the King and the Queen were out driving, and the Princesses were standing at the window and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out, happen what might. So they begged and entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that he should let them down into the garden. ""He could see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy weather could come on such a day."" Well, he didn't think it looked much like it either, and if they must go they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be for a minute, and he himself would go with them and look after them."
"When they got down into the garden they ran up and down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves, the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they must have that also. But just as they bent down to take the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away."
"There was great mourning over the whole country, and the King made known from all the churches that any one who could save the Princesses should have half the kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess he liked to choose."
"You can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain; so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no one who could find the Princesses, or even get any tidings of them."
"When all the grand and rich people in the country had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The King fitted them out both with silver and gold, and wished them success on their journey."
"Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt one night that he also was trying to find the Princesses. When the morning came he still remembered what he had dreamt, and told his mother about it."
"""Some witchery must have got hold of you,"" said the woman, ""but you must dream the same thing three nights running, else there is nothing in it."" And the next two nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream, and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace. It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had set out."
"""You had better go home again,"" said the King, ""the Princesses are beyond your reach, I should say; and besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I have nothing left to-day. You had better come back another time."""
"""If I go, I must go to-day,"" said the soldier. ""Money I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some food in my wallet,"" he said; ""but it must be a good walletful as much meat and bacon as I can carry."""
"Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted."
"So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before he overtook the captain and the lieutenant."
"""Where are you going?"" asked the captain, when he saw the man in uniform."
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
"What tangles they did get into! Each little Rabbit had four legs, two short ones in front, and two long ones behind to help him take long jumps from one place to another. So, you see, there were twenty-eight legs there, pushing, catching in the hay, kicking, and sometimes just waving in the air when their tiny owners chanced to roll over on their backs and couldn't get right side up again. Then Mamma Rabbit would come and poke them this way and that, never hurting any of them, but getting the nest in order."
"""It is a great deal of work to pick up after children,"" she would say with a tired little sigh, ""but it will not be long before they have homes of their own and are doing the same thing."""
"Mamma Rabbit was quite right when she said that, for all of their people set up housekeeping when very young, and then the cares of life begin."
"One fine morning when the children were alone in their burrow, the biggest little Rabbit had a queer feeling in his face, below and in front of his long ears, and above his eager little nose. It almost scared him at first, for he had never before felt anything at all like it. Then he guessed what it meant. There were two bunchy places on his face, that Mamma Rabbit had told him were eyes. ""When you are older,"""
"she had said to him, ""these eyes will open, and then you will see."" For the Rabbit children are always blind when they are babies."
"When his mother told him that, the biggest little Rabbit had said, ""What do you mean when you say I shall 'see'? Is it anything like eating?"""
"And Mamma Rabbit said, ""No, you cannot taste things until you touch them, but you can see them when they are far away."""
"""Then it is like smelling,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""No, it is not like smelling, either, for there are many things, like stones, which one cannot smell and yet can see."""
"""Then it surely is like hearing,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed his mother, who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. ""It is not a bit like hearing. You could never hear a black cloud coming across the sky, but you could see it if you were outside your burrow. Nobody can make you understand what seeing is until your eyes are open, and then you will find out for yourself without asking."""
"This made the biggest little Rabbit lie still for a while, and then he said: ""What is a black cloud, and why does it come across the sky? And what is the sky, and why does it let the cloud come? And what is "" But he did not get any answer, for his mother ran out of the burrow as fast as she could."
"And now his eyes were surely opening and he should see! His tiny heart thumped hard with excitement, and he rubbed his face with his forepaws to make his eyes open faster. Ah! There it was; something round and bright at the other end of the burrow, and some queer, slender things were waving across it. He wondered if it were good to eat, but he dared not crawl toward it to see. He did not know that the round, bright thing was just a bit of sky which he saw through the end of the burrow, and that the slender, waving ones were the branches of a dead tree tossing in the wind. Then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. He would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time."
"""I can see!"" he cried. ""I can see everything that there is to see! I'm ahead of you! Don't you wish that you could see, too?"""
"That was not a very kind thing to say, but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldn't see. Even while he was speaking and looking toward the light, he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him, and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. How frightened he was then! He pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. He thought something dreadful was about to happen."
"""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come,"" he squeaked, shutting his eyes as closely as he could. ""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come."""
"""Why, here I am,"" she answered. ""What are you afraid of?"""
"The biggest little Rabbit opened his eyes, and there was the creature who had frightened him so, and it was his own mother! You can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open."
"""I will call in some of my Rabbit friends,"" she said, ""and let you see them, if you will promise not to be afraid."""
"The next day four of the other little Rabbits had their eyes open, and the day after that they all could see each other and the shining piece of sky at the end of the burrow. It was not so very long afterward that the Rabbit family went out to dine in the forest, and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. Often when their mother left them alone in the burrow she had pulled grass and leaves over the opening to hide it from him, for Rabbit fathers do not love their children until they are old enough to go out into the great world, and it would never do for them to know where their babies are kept. Then their father taught them how to gnaw tough bark to wear their teeth down, for Rabbits' teeth grow all the time, and if they were to eat only soft food, their teeth would get too long. He taught them, too, how to move their ears in the right way for keen hearing, and told them that when chased they must run for the burrow or the nearest thicket. ""Then crouch down on some leaves that are the color of your fur,"" he said, ""and you may not be seen at all."""
"""Why should we run?"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Because you might be caught if you didn't."""
"""What might catch us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh, a Hawk, perhaps, or a Weasel."""
"""What does a Hawk look like?"""
"""Like a great bird floating in the sky,"" said Papa Rabbit. ""Now, don't ask me a single question more."""
"""Does a Hawk look like that bird above us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"His father gave one look upward. ""Yes!"" he said. ""Run!"""
"And just as the Hawk swooped down toward the ground, he saw nine white-tipped tails disappear into a burrow near by."
THE LITTLE BAT WHO WOULDN'T GO TO BED
"""Come,"" said Mamma Bat, flying toward her home in the cave, ""it is time that you children went to bed. The eastern sky is growing bright, and I can see the fleecy clouds blush rosy red as the sun looks at them."""
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."
"When Mr. Red Squirrel first came to the forest, he knew nothing of the way in which they do, and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. You see, Mr. Red Squirrel was born in the forest, but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. From that time until he was grown, he had never set claw upon a tree, and all he could see of the world he had seen by peeping through the bars of a cage. His cousins in the forest learned to frisk along the fence-tops and to jump from one swaying branch to another, but when this poor little fellow longed for a scamper he could only run around and around in a wire wheel that hummed as it turned, and this made him very dizzy."
"He used to wonder if there were nothing better in life, for he had been taken from his woodland home when he was too young to remember about it."
"One day he saw another Squirrel outside, a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. That made him care more than ever to be free, and when he curled down in his cotton nest that night he dreamed about her, and that they were eating acorns together in a tall oak tree."
"The next day Mr. Red Squirrel pretended to be sick. He would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. When his master came to look at him, he moaned pitifully and would not move one leg. His master thought that the leg was broken, and took limp little Mr. Red Squirrel in his hand to the window to see what was the matter. The window was up, and when he saw his chance, Mr. Red Squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. His poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage, but how he ran! His heart thumped wildly under the soft fur of his chest, and his breath came in quick gasps, and still he ran, leaping, scrambling, and sometimes falling, but always nearer the great green trees of his birthplace."
"At last he was safe and sat trembling on the lowest branch of a beech-tree. The forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat, old Gray Squirrel. The Gray Squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great, great deal, and want others to think so too. He was so very knowing and important that, although he answered all of Mr. Red Squirrel's questions, he really did not tell him any of the things which he most wanted to know, and this is the way in which they talked:"
"""What is the name of this place?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""This? Why this is the forest, of course,"" answered the Gray Squirrel."
"""We have no other name for it. It is possible that there are other forests in the world, but they cannot be so fine as this, so we call ours 'the forest.'"""
"""Are there pleasant neighbors here?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""Very good, very good. My wife and I do not call on many of them, but still they are good enough people, I think."""
"""Then why don't you call?"""
"""Why? Why? Because they are not in our set. It would never do."" And the Gray Squirrel sat up very straight indeed."
"""Who is that gliding fellow on the ground below?"" asked the newcomer."
"""Is he one of your friends?"""
"""That? That is the Rattlesnake. We never speak to each other. There has always been trouble between our families."""
"""Who lives in that hollow tree yonder?"""
"""Sh, sh! That is where the Great Horned Owl has his home. He is asleep now and must not be awakened, for Squirrels and Owls cannot be friendly."""
"""Why not?"""
"""Because. It has always been so."""
"""And who is that bird just laying an egg in her nest above us?"""
"""Speak softly, please. That is the Cowbird, and it is not her nest. You will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. She can't help it."
"She has to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, but they don't like it."""
"Mr. Red Squirrel tried very hard to find out the reason for this, but there are always some things for which no reason can be given; and there are many questions which can never be answered, even if one were to ask, ""Why? why? why?"" all day long. So Mr. Red Squirrel, being a wise little fellow, stopped asking, and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. He had good eyes and keen ears, and he learned very fast without making many mistakes. He had a very happy life among the forest people, and perhaps that was one reason. He learned not to say things which made his friends feel badly, and he did not ask needless questions. And after all, you know, it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer, and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself."
"It is in the forest as in the world outside. We can know that many things are, but we never know why they are."
WHY MR GREAT HORNED OWL HATCHED THE EGGS
"If the Rattlesnake is the king of the forest in the daytime, the Great Horned Owl is the king at night. Indeed, he is much the more powerful of the two, for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes, while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there."
"There was but one pair of Great Horned Owls in the forest, and they lived in the deepest shade, having their great clumsy nest in the hollow of a tall tree. You might have walked past it a hundred times and never have guessed that any Owls lived there, if you did not notice the round pellets of bone and hair on the grass. They are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. Then their tough little stomachs go to work, rolling all the pieces of bone and hair into balls and sending them back to be cast out of the Owls' mouths to the ground."
"The Great Horned Owl was a very large bird. His whole body was covered with brown, dull yellow, and white feathers. Even his feet and legs were covered, and all that you could see besides were his black claws and his black hooked bill. Yes, at night you could see his eyes, too, and they were wonderful great eyes that could see in the dark, but they were shut in the daytime when he was resting. His wife, who was the queen of the forest at night, looked exactly like him, only she was larger than he. And that is the way among Owls, the wife is always larger than her husband."
"Every night when the sun had gone down, the Great Horned Owl and his wife would come out of their hollow tree and sit blinking on a branch near by, waiting until it got dark enough for them to see quite plainly."
"As the light faded, the little black spots in their eyes would grow bigger and bigger, and then off they would go on their great soft, noiseless wings, hunting in the grass and among the branches for the supper which they called breakfast."
"Mrs. Owl could not be gone very long at a time, for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. Her husband was on the wing most of the night, and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. He was really a kind-hearted fellow, although you could never have made the small birds think so. Sometimes his wife would sigh and tell how tired she was of sitting still, and how glad she would be when the eggs were hatched and she could go more with him. When she began to speak of that, the Great Horned Owl would get ready for another flight and go off saying: ""It is too bad. I am so sorry for you. But then, one would never have young Owlets if one didn't stick to the nest."" He was always proud of his children, and he thought himself a very good husband. Perhaps he was; still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting."
"He had a good mind to try it. There was nobody to watch him, and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. It was a foolish thing to do, and he knew it, but young Rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise."
"""I will hold my hind legs very still,"" he thought, ""and flap my forelegs for wings."" With that he jumped off and came crashing down upon the dry leaves. He felt weak and dizzy, and as he picked himself up and looked around he hoped that nobody had seen him. ""It may be a great deal of fun to fly,"" he said, ""but it is no fun alighting from your flight unless you have real feather wings. It is too bumpy when you fly with your legs."""
"At this minute he heard an old Gobbler call out, and saw the flock of Turkeys coming toward him. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he cried to the Ground Hog. But the Ground Hog never moved."
"Still the Turkeys came nearer. The Rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others, and that here and there a young or weak Turkey had to drop into the river and swim, because his wings were tired. They got so near that he could see the queer little tufts of wiry feathers which the Gobblers wear hanging from their breast, and could see the swaying scarlet wattles under their beaks. He called again to the Ground Hog, and getting no answer, poked him three times with his head."
"The Ground Hog turned over, stretched, yawned, moved his jaws a few times as though he dreamed of eating fresh spring grass, and then fell asleep once more. After that the Rabbit left him alone."
"The first to alight were the Gobblers, and they began at once to strut and chatter. Next came the mother Turkeys and their young, and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. It was a fine sight to see them come in. The swimmers spread their tails, folded their wings tightly, stretched their necks, and struck out swiftly and strongly with their feet."
"The young Rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. ""The Gobblers are growing quite fond of the children,"" said one."
"""Yes,"" said another; ""my husband told me yesterday that he was very proud of our little ones."""
"""Well, it is the season for them to begin to walk together,"" said the first speaker; ""but I never in my life had such a time as I had this spring. I thought my husband would break every egg I laid."""
"""I had a hard time too,"" said the other. ""None of my eggs were broken, but after my chicks were hatched I had to hurry them out of their father's sight a dozen times a day."""
"""It is very trying,"" said a third mother Turkey with a sigh; ""but that is always the way with the Gobblers. I suppose the dear fellows can't help it;"" and she looked lovingly over at her husband as he strutted around with his friends. You would not have believed if you had seen her fond looks, and heard her husband's tender ""Gobble,"" that they had hardly spoken to each other all summer. To be sure, it was not now as it had been in the springtime. Then he would have beaten any other Gobbler who came near her, he loved her so; still, the Rabbit could see as he watched them that when he found some very large and fine acorns, this Gobbler would not eat them all, but called his wife to come and share with him; and he knew that they were happy together in their own Turkey way of being happy."
At this minute the Ground Hog opened his eyes and staggered to his feet.
"The loud talking had awakened him. He did not look very dignified just now. His fur was rumpled, and he blinked often from sleepiness. There was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears, too, that made him look very odd. The Rabbit wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so. The Ground Hog walked toward the Gobblers, and raised himself on his haunches."
"""Good-evening, good-evening,"" said he (it was really morning, you know). ""We are very glad to welcome you to the forest. Make yourselves perfectly at home. The grass is not so tender as it was a while ago, yet I think that you will find good feeding,"" and he waved his paws politely."
"""Thank-you, thank-you!"" answered the Gobblers, while the mothers and young Turkeys came crowding up to look at the Ground Hog. ""We came for the acorns and nuts. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves."""
"""That is right,"" said the Ground Hog heartily. ""We have a very fine forest here. You will pardon me for remarking it. The Pond People have a saying that is very true: 'It's a mighty poor Frog that won't croak for his own puddle.' And my grandfather used to say that if a Ground Hog didn't love his own home he was a very poor Hog indeed. Good-night, my friends, good-night."" And he trotted happily away, followed by the Rabbit."
"When he was gone, the Turkeys said: ""How very kind of him!"" and ""What fine manners!"" And the young Rabbit thought to himself: ""It is queer. He was sleepy and his fur was rumpled, and that leaf bobbed around his ear when he talked. He said 'evening' instead of 'morning,' and spoke as though Turkeys came here to eat grass. And yet they all liked him, and were pleased by what he said."""
You see the young Rabbit had not yet learned that the power of fine manners is more than that of looks; and that people could not think of the Ground Hog's mistakes in speaking because they knew his kindness of heart.
THE TRAVELLERS GO SOUTH
"One night a maple tree, the very one under which Mr. Red Squirrel sat when he first came to the forest, dreamed of her winter resting-time, and when she awakened early in the morning she found that her leaves were turning yellow. They were not all brightly colored, but on each was an edging, or a tip, or a splash of gold. You may be sure that the Forest People noticed it at once."
"""I told you so,"" chirruped a Robin to her mate. ""The Orioles went long ago, and the Bobolinks start to-day. We must think about our trip to the South."" When she said this, she hopped restlessly from twig to twig with an air of being exceedingly busy."
"Her husband did not answer, but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. Perhaps he was used to her fussy ways and thought it just as well to keep still. He knew that none of the Robins would start South until the weather became much colder, and he did not think it necessary to talk about it yet. Perhaps, too, Mr. Robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. In that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors."
"Later in the day, a Bobolink came up from the marsh to say good-by. He had on his travelling suit of striped brown, and you would never have known him for the same gay fellow who during the spring and early summer wore black and buff and sang so heartily and sweetly. Now he did not sing at all, and slipped silently from bush to bush, only speaking when he had to. He was a good fellow and everyone disliked to have him go."
"Mrs. Cowbird came up while they were talking. Now that she did not care to lay any more eggs, the other birds were quite friendly with her. They began to talk over the summer that was past, and said how finely the young birds were coming on. ""By the way,"" said she, in the most careless manner possible, ""I ought to have a few children round here somewhere."
"Can anybody tell me where they are?"""
"Mrs. Goldfinch looked at her husband and he looked at the sky. The Warblers and the Vireos, who had known about the strange egg in the Goldfinches' nest, had already left for the winter, and there seemed to be no use in telling their secret now or quarrelling over what was past."
"Some of the other birds might have told Mrs. Cowbird a few things, but they also kept still."
"""It is a shame,"" she said. ""I never laid a finer lot of eggs in my life, and I was very careful where I put them. I wish I knew how many there were, but I forgot to count. I have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock; I was sure I should know them if I saw them. Mothers have such fine feelings, you know, in regard to their children."" (As though she had any right to say that!)"
"The Mourning Doves were there with their young son and daughter, and you could see by looking at them that they were an affectionate family. ""We shall be the last to go South,"" they cooed. ""We always mean to come North in the very early spring and stay as late as possible. This year we came much later than usual, but it could not be helped."" They had spoken so before, and rather sadly. It was said that they could tell a sorrowful story if they would; but they did not wish to sadden others by it, and bore their troubles together bravely and lovingly."
"""How do the new feathers work?"" asked a Crow, flying up at this minute and looking blacker than ever in his fall coat. Then all the birds began to talk about dress. As soon as their broods were raised, you know, their feathers had begun to drop out, and they had kept on moulting until all of the old ones were gone and the new ones on. When birds are moulting they never feel well, and when it is over they are both happy and proud."
"""I changed later than usual this year,"" said the Crow, ""and I feel that I have the very latest fashions."" This was a joke which he must have picked up among the Barnyard People, and nobody knows where they got it. Fashions never change in the Forest."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, “What God does, is well done!” But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, “What God does, is well done.”"
"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
“To thy death art thou sped Until God’s word be said.
"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years."
"In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, “Go thy way, foundling.”"
"Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing."
"“Good day, mother,” said the boy."
"“Many thanks,” said she."
“Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.”
“And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?” said the woman.
“God knows.”
"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
"When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, “Good day, mother.”"
"“Many thanks,” replied the old woman."
"“May God help you with your fishing,” said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, “Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.” The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall."
"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
"The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, “Who has given thee leave to hunt here?”"
"“Oh, no one.”"
"“To whom dost thou belong, then?”"
“I am the fisherman’s son.”
“But he has no children.”
"“If thou wilt not believe, come with me.”"
"That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,"
"“The mother sits alone There in the prison small, O King of royal blood, These are thy children all."
"The sisters twain so false, They wrought the children woe, There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go.”"
"Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince."
The Fairy Flower
And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood.
"It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her."
"""I've brought you a new playfellow,"" the Fairy said. ""You must be very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!"""
And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass.
"""Run and play, little Rabbit!"" she said."
But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.
"For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece. He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it."
"And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass."
"He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone."
"He was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits."
At Last! At Last!
"Autumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days grew warm and sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all over, but the other had strange markings under his fur, as though long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through. And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that the Boy thought to himself:"
"""Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet fever!"""
"But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be Real."
The Book of DRAGONS
I. The Book of Beasts
"He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket."
"And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, ""Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."""
"Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, ""Oh, don't, Nurse,"" and, ""I'm sure my ears are quite clean,"" or, ""Never mind my hair, it's all right,"" and, ""That'll do."""
"""You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"""
said Nurse.
"The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts."
"They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: ""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."""
"""Yes, please, sir,"" said Lionel, ""when does it begin?"""
"""You will be crowned this afternoon,"" said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other."
"""Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?"" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea."
"""Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."""
"The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No."
"7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up."
"One bright delirious moment’s space,"
And then she passed: I followed slow
"Across the heath, and up and round,"
And watched the splendid death of day
"Upon the summits far away,"
And in her fateful beauty found
The fierce wild beauty of the light
"That startles twilight on the hills,"
"And lightens all the mountain rills,"
And flames before the feet of night.
IN THE ORATORY.
"THE incense mounted like a cloud,"
A golden cloud of languid scent;
"Robed priests before the altar bowed,"
Expecting the divine event.
"Then silence, like a prisoner bound,"
"Rose, by a mighty hand set free,"
"And dazzlingly, in shafts of sound,"
Thundered Beethoven’s Mass in C.
She knelt in prayer; large lids serene
"Lay heavy on the sombre eyes,"
As though to veil some vision seen
CHAPTER I
_The Red Spot_
"[Sidenote: What is the mystery centered in Jupiter's famous ""Red"
"Spot""? Two fighting Earthmen, caught by the ""Pipe-men"" like their"
"vanished comrades, soon find out.]"
"Commander Stone, grizzled chief of the Planetary Exploration Forces,"
acknowledged Captain Brand Bowen's salute and beckoned him to take a
seat.
"Brand, youngest officer of the division to wear the triple-V for"
"distinguished service, sat down and stared curiously at his superior."
He hadn't the remotest idea why he had been recalled from leave: but
that it was on a matter of some importance he was sure. He hunched his
big shoulders and awaited orders.
"""Captain Bowen,"" said Stone. ""I want you to go to Jupiter as soon as"
"you can arrange to do so, fly low over the red area in the southern"
"hemisphere, and come back here with some sort of report as to what's"
"wrong with that infernal death spot."""
He tapped his radio stylus thoughtfully against the edge of his desk.
"""As you perhaps know, I detailed a ship to explore the red spot about"
"a year ago. It never came back. I sent another ship, with two good men"
spring. The illumination showed a moldy chamber with water dripping from
the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"
The sound of voices and footsteps now echoed loudly through the cavern.
mind.  Vaviloff also liked Petunikoff's straightforward manner of
"addressing him without any pretensions, as if he were his own brother,"
"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"
"being only a soldier.  Looking at him, he grew fonder and fonder of"
"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred
"roubles and signed the paper, he threw the pen down on the table and"
"said, bitterly:"
"""Now I will have a nice time!  They will laugh at me, they will cry"
"shame on me, the devils!"""
King Merriwig of Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls.  He
"lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him, selected a"
trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.
"""Ah,"" said the King, ""here you are, my dear.""  He searched for his"
"napkin, but the Princess had already kissed him lightly on the top of"
"the head, and was sitting in her place opposite to him."
"""Good morning, Father,"" she said; ""I'm a little late, aren't I?  I've"
"been riding in the forest."""
"""Any adventures?"" asked the King casually."
"""Nothing, except it's a beautiful morning."""
"""Ah, well, perhaps the country isn't what it was.  Now when I was a"
"young man, you simply couldn't go into the forest without an adventure"
"of some sort.  The extraordinary things one encountered!  Witches,"
"giants, dwarfs----.  It was there that I first met your mother,"" he"
added thoughtfully.
"""I wish I remembered my mother,"" said Hyacinth."
The King coughed and looked at her a little nervously.
"""Seventeen years ago she died, Hyacinth, when you were only six months"
old.  I have been wondering lately whether I haven't been a little
"remiss in leaving you motherless so long."""

3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.

8. Psalm Versions.
"The use of the psalms in singing, first on the Continent, then in"
"England and Scotland, and later in America, brought forth many metrical"
"versions of the psalter, the principal ones being the following:"
"a. _The Genevan Psalter_, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It was"
"made at the request of John Calvin by Clément Marot, court poet of"
"France, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book"
"for the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the"
most famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was
issued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of
"tongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., “Old"
Hundredth.”
"b. _The Anglo-Genevan Psalter_, Geneva, 1556. This was used by John"
"Knox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions"
"of “Bloody Mary,” and formed a congregation at Geneva. The book"
incorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which were in
"use in England, and added others."
"c. _The Old Version_, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562. Used in"
"England for 134 years. It is entitled, _The Whole Booke of Psalmes_, but"
"her life; she was never quite happy. It was all my doing. Still, I think"
"she was happier with me, in spite of it."""
"A movement of impatience escaped from Alicia. Seeing it he added,"
"""I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think hardly of her."""
"""I don't want to think of her at all. Was she--was she like Daisy?"""
"""Yes; but prettier."""
"""I don't know what you expect me to say,"" she exclaimed. ""I know--I"
suppose some men don't think much of--of a thing like that. To me it is
"horrible. You simply followed your-- Ah, I can't speak of it!"" and she"
seemed to put him from her with a gesture of disgust.
"He walked beside her in silence, his face set in the bitter smile it"
always wore when fate dealt hardly with him.
"""I think I'll go straight home,"" she said, stopping suddenly. ""You can"
"join the others."""
"""Yes, that will be best. I'm not due at the Council just yet."""
"""I suppose I ought to thank you for telling me the truth. I--"" Her false"
composure suddenly gave way. With a sob she stretched out her hands
"towards him, crying, ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and before he"
"could answer her she turned and walked swiftly away, leaving him"
standing still on the pathway.
She was hardly inside the gates of Government House when she saw Eleanor
"Scaife, who hurried to meet her."
her completely naked.
"Dennis went clumsily to his knees, his arms around her, and he pulled"
"her to the floor. She sobbed, but the tears were gone now and they were"
"dry, wracking sobs."
"""Undress me."""
She fumbled with his jacket and pulled it off while he knelt there in
"anticipation of he knew not what; wondering, wanting, knowing only an"
urge he could not understand but which had become a compulsion.
She took off his necktie and unbuttoned his shirt. Frank Corson stirred
"but did not regain consciousness. ""Please,"" Rhoda said, ""let me help"
"him."""
"In answer, Dennis put his arms around her and drew her to him. ""We will"
"make love."""
"""Yes--yes, we will make love--"""
"The ring of the doorbell was like thunder in the room. Dennis tensed,"
"his eyes widened, and he got to his feet and stood swaying. Looking up"
"at him, Rhoda saw a trapped animal, but the excitement was still there"
and she wanted to take him in her arms and hold him and protect him from
the world.
But he had forgotten her. A cunning sneer took the place of the
slavering animal look and he ran to the kitchen to reappear moments
later with a butcher knife in his hand.
"The bell rang again. Dennis snarled at the door and, in some kind of"
The orator finished his speech and looked upon his hearers with his
"dark, pathetic eyes, seeming to apologise to them for some unknown"
crime.
The public understands it.  They understand the morale of the creature
"who was once a man, the morale of the public-house and much misfortune."
"""Well, brother Yashka, did you understand?  See how true it is!"""
Yakov understood that to beat her incautiously might be injurious to
"his wife.  He is silent, replying to his companions' jokes with"
confused smiles.
"""Then again, what is a wife?"" philosophises the baker, Mokei Anisimoff."
"""A wife ... is a friend ... if we look at the matter in that way.  She"
"is like a chain, chained to you for life ... and you are both just like"
"galley slaves.  And if you try to get away from her, you cannot, you"
"feel the chain ..."""
"""Wait,"" says Yakovleff; ""but you beat your wife too."""
"""Did I say that I did not?  I beat her...  There is nothing else"
handy...  Do you expect me to beat the wall with my fist when my
"patience is exhausted?"""
"""I feel just like that too..."" says Yakov."
"""How hard and difficult our life is, my brothers!  There is no real"
"rest for us anywhere!"""
"""And even you beat your wife by mistake,"" some one remarks humorously."
"Whereupon Rollo addressed himself to the others, setting clearly before"
them the gravity of the situation.
John Mortimer shook his head gravely. He could not approve.
"""How often has my father told me that the first loss is the least! This"
all comes of trying to make up my disappointment about the Abbot's
"Priorato!"""
Etienne shrugged his shoulders and philosophically quoted a Gascon
proverb to the effect that who buys the flock must take the black sheep
also.
El Sarria simply recollected that his gun and pistols were in good
"order, and waited for orders."
The conference therefore resolved itself into a trio of
"consultants--Rollo because he was the leader, Sergeant Cardono because"
"he knew the country, and Concha--because she was Concha!"
They were within an hour or two's rapid march of La Granja over a pass
in the Guadarrama. The sergeant volunteered to lead them down into the
gardens in that time. He knew a path often travelled by smugglers on
their way to Segovia.
"""It is clear that if we are to carry away the Queen-Regent and her"
"daughter, we must forestall the gipsies,"" said Rollo."
Concha clasped her hands pitifully.
"""Ah, the poor young Queen!"" she cried. ""Praise to the saints that I was"
"The horseman leaned against his horse, his arm hooked over its neck."
He pointed to the valley.
"""Yonder lies Narni. Beyond the Campanile of St. Juvenal is a"
sanctuary. You can see it yonder by the ford. Two holy women dwell
"therein. To them, my lord, I commend you!"""
"""You know more!"""
The voice that spoke was terrible.
"""Spare me, my lord! The words are for women's lips, not for mine!"""
"""So be it!"""
"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.
"""But what was the cause of it all?""  I demanded.  ""You surely know the"
"reason?"""
"""No, we cannot yet tell,"" he answered.  ""The marks puzzle us.  That mark"
on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."
"""Personally, I think there can be no doubt."""
"""But by whom?  No one called here after my departure."""
"""It is that mystery which we must elucidate,"" he said.  ""All I fear is,"
"however, that she may render us no assistance."""

It is very pleasant here at harvest time. Scythes are being sharpened in
"the field, men and women are at work; they go thinly clad and bareheaded,"
and call to one another and laugh; sometimes they drink from a bucket of
"whey, then set to work again. There is the familiar fragrance of hay,"
"which penetrates my senses like a song of home, drawing me home, home,"
“But if it will kill you?”
"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”

"when she broke off, and the scissors that had been snipping their way"
steadily through the rough linen jagged and dropped on the table. She
picked them up immediately and went on with an impatient exclamation

"a loud report from outside in the darkness, and a smothered scream."
Lois put down her knife.

"Beatrice nodded, and letting the heavy head sink back among the"

"""How brave you are!"" she said in a whisper. ""You seem so cool and"
"collected, just as though you believed your sandwiches would ever be"
"eaten!"""
"""I am not braver than you are. Look how steady your hand is--much"
"steadier than mine."""
Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.
"""I am not afraid,"" she said, ""but not because I am brave. There is no"
"room for fear, that is all."" She paused an instant, and then suddenly"
"the hand fell on Lois'. The two women looked at each other. ""Lois, I"

"""It's already been said."" Regin Naylo looked pointedly at Linus Brein."
"""A day or so ago you claimed that you'd picked up some primitive"
infrawave emission that looked as though someone might be trying to
"develop a detecting and ranging device."""
"""Yes."""
"""Then it is my contention that any moves we make against this race"
should be made before anybody down there gets such a detector and
"ranger working."""
"""Why?"" demanded Viggon Sarri."
"Regin Naylo looked at his commander. ""We're losing a technical"
advantage. Whether we go in with a benign and peaceful-looking air and
"show them how big and fast we are, or whether we plunge in and hit 'em"
"with every battery we've got and reduce 'em to submission, we've got to"
do it before anybody succeeds in making an infrawave space detector.
"""What is your name, Girl--your real name?"""
"""Min--Minnie; my father's name was Smith,"" she told him, her eyes cast"
down under delicately tremulous lids.
"""Oh, Minnie Sm--"""
"""But 'twa'n't his right name,"" quickly corrected the Girl, and"
"unconsciously both rose to their feet. ""His right name was Falconer."""
"""Minnie Falconer--well, that is a pretty name,"" commented Johnson; and"
raising her hand to his lips he pressed them against it.
"""I ain't sure that's what he said it was--I ain't sure o' anythin' only"
"jest you,"" she said coyly, burying her face in his neck."
"""You may well be sure of me since I've loved--"" Johnson's sentence was"
"cut short, a wave of remorse sweeping over him. ""Turn your head away,"
"Girl, and don't listen to me,"" he went on, gently putting her away from"
"him. ""I'm not worthy of you. Don't listen but just say no, no, no, no."""
"The Girl, puzzled, was even more so when Johnson began to pace the"
floor.
"""Oh, I know--I ain't good enough for you !"" she cried with a little"
"tremour in her voice. ""But I'll try hard, hard . . . If you see"
"anythin' better in me, why don't you bring it out, 'cause I've loved you"
"ever since I saw you first, 'cause I knowed that you--that you were the"
"right man."""
"""The right man,"" repeated Johnson, dismally, for his conscience was"
"Ilaria stirred in her sleep. Her mouth quivered, her hair stirred"
"sudden under the heather, like tendrils of gold shivering in the sun."
"Even as the light increased, Francesco knelt and looked down upon her."
"Hope and life, glorious, sudden, seemed to fall out of the east, a"
radiant faith begotten of spirit-power. Banners of gold were streaming
"in the sky. The gloom fled. A vast expectancy hung solemn, breathless,"
upon the red lips of the day.
"A sigh, and the long, silken lashes quivered. The lips moved, the eyes"
opened.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"Sudden silence followed, a vast hush as of undreamed hope. The woman's"
eyes were silently searching the man's face. He bent and cowered over
"her as one who weeps. His hands touched her body, yet she did not"
stir.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"It was a hoarse, passionate outcry that broke the golden stupor of the"
"dawn. A sudden light leaped lustrous into the woman's eyes, her face"
shone radiant in its etherealized beauty.
"""Francesco!"""
"""Ah! At last!"""
A great shudder passed through her body. Her eyes grew big with fear.

“Dead—better.”
"“I wonder you could tear yourself away so soon,” said Trent, viciously."
“You’d better be careful. She might make a new will.”
“Don’t worry. I spent the happiest fifteen minutes of my life with her

FOSSILS AND WHAT THEY TEACH
"""I have shown it you before.""  Vaviloff looked up suspiciously and"
closely scanned the Captain's face.
"""Show it me!"" shouted the Captain, striking the bar with his fist and"
sitting down on a stool close by.
"""But why?"" asked Vaviloff, knowing that it was better to keep his wits"
about him when Kuvalda got excited.
"""You fool!  Bring it at once."""
"Vaviloff rubbed his forehead, and turned his eyes to the ceiling in a"
tired way.
"""Where are those papers of yours?"""
"There was no answer to this on the ceiling, so the old sergeant looked"
"down at the floor, and began drumming with his fingers on the bar in a"
worried and thoughtful manner.
"""It's no good your making wry faces!"" shouted the Captain, for he had"
"no great affection for him, thinking that a former soldier should"
rather have become a thief than an eating-house keeper.
"""Oh!  Yes!  Aristid Fomich, I remember now.  They were left at the High"
"Court of Justice at the time when I came into possession."""
"""Get along, Egorka!  It is to your own interest to show me the plan,"
"the title-deeds, and everything you have immediately.  You will"
"probably clear at least a hundred roubles over this, do you understand?"""
Vaviloff did not understand at all; but the Captain spoke in such a
"fine--it made me ashamed of my silly standards, my fears."""
"""And Lavender is best of all--"""
Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.
"""I'm cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted something different but I"
didn't want all _this_ to happen! You see I _made_ Lavender and Mart
believe it was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was probably
"only a case of rum--"""
"Suddenly Trude straightened. ""I almost forgot. A boy came here and said"
a Captain Davies wanted you to come down to Rockman's wharf as soon as
you could. That was two hours ago. You see it is nearly noon now. You'd
"better dress quickly and I'll go out and fix you some breakfast."""
Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's
support for Sunset Lane was thronged with curious men and women; as
to his shoulders.
I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;
every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable
"soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the"
"blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,"
when I suddenly got scared right through.
His eyes.
They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.
Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did
"it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a"
surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it
opened two long tooth-studded jaws.
"""Green shatas!"" he said suddenly. ""Only a tadpole. I must be getting"
"jumpy enough to splash."""
Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly
"leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted"
"to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes."
"I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. ""My name is Ferdinand"
"Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--"""
"""Hope for your sake,"" he said to me, ""that you aren't what you"
"seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura."""
"""_What?_"""
"""A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come"
"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?"
Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”
"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell"
over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his
youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was
"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not"
for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone
rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of
"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"
I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”
"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."
Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.
"""Have you ever heard the like of it? She told me to get out! I shall leave"
"tomorrow."""
"""Have you found the galoshes?"" I asked."
"""Of course,"" he replied. ""They were right in the passage. 'Here they are,'"
"I said to her. 'Yes, yes,' she said. 'Right under your nose,' I said."
"'Yes, yes, go away,' she said, and began to cry. So I went away."""
"""She'll get over it."""
"""Do you think so? Yes, I expect she will. Oh, well, it's my opinion nobody"
"can understand women, anyhow. But they're a mighty sex, the women, a"
"mighty sex. They certainly are."""
"He sat on a while, but he had no peace of mind, and soon went out again."

That evening the lady was in the dining room before us; she was there when
"we came in, and we all nodded slightly in greeting. To the actor she was"
"very kind, quite making up for her petulance of the afternoon."
When he sat down he found a letter in his table napkin: a written note
folded into the napkin. He was so surprised that he dropped everything he
"was doing to unfold and read it. With an exclamation and a smile, his"
"blue, delighted eyes splashed over her; but she was looking down into her"
"lap with her forehead wrinkled, so he put the note away in his vest"
pocket.
"Then it probably dawned on him that he had betrayed her, and he tried to"
cover it up somehow.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"""You've been very good to me--yes, very good."""
He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going
"to speak, but he did not."
"""Whatever happens, I shall always remember that with--with deep"
"gratitude."""
"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"
"one another now, as he replied gravely,"
"""Whatever you ask--let it be what it will--I will answer, truthfully."" A"
pause before the last word perhaps betrayed a momentary struggle.
"""What right have I? Why should you?"""
"""The right my--my desire to have your regard gives you. How can I ask"
"for that, unless I am ready to tell you all you can wish to know?"""
"""I have heard,"" she began falteringly, ""I have been told by--by people"
"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his
"trouble, but he came to her rescue."
"""I don't know how it reached you,"" he said. ""Perhaps I think you might"
have been--you need not have known it. But there is only one thing you
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
“There is my husband.”
"“_Nom de Dieu!_” cried Bazouge, stifling a guffaw before the austere"
"decorum of the English churchman. “_Ça?_ Oh, my poor Yvonne!” She shook"
"hands rapidly with him and turned away. He bowed gracefully, including"
the new-comers in his salute. The Canon responded severely. Mrs.
Winstanley stared at him through her tortoise-shell lorgnette.
"“We have been looking all over the place for you,” said the Canon,"
"as they passed through the window into the _salle des jeux_, leaving"
Bazouge in the corner of the verandah.
"“I’m sorry,” said Yvonne penitently."
“And who was that rakish-looking little Frenchman you were talking to?”
"“An old friend--I used to know him,” said Yvonne, struggling with her"
agitation. “A friend of my first husband--I had to speak to him--we went
"there to be quiet. I could n’t help it, Everard, really I could n’t.”"
"“My dear child,” said the Canon, kindly, “I was not scolding you--though"
he did look rather undesirable.”
“I suppose you had to mix with all kinds of odd Bohemian people in your
professional days?” said Mrs. Winstanley.
"“Of course,” faltered Yvonne."
They went through the great hall. At the door they parted with Mrs.
"Winstanley, who was waiting for the Wilmingtons. “We will call for you"
"on our way to the concert this afternoon,” said the Canon."
"“Oh, dear! I wish they would not fight at your school, Tom. Didn't it"
hurt you?”
"“Hurt me? No,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large"
"pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at"
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added:
“I gave Spooner a black eye--that's what he got for wanting to leather
me. I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered me.”
"“Oh! how brave you are, Tom. I think you are like Samson. If there came"
"a lion roaring at me, I think you'd fight him, wouldn't you, Tom?”"
"“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no lions"
only in the shows.”
"“No, but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa where it's"
"very hot, the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book"
where I read it.”
"“Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”"
"“But if you hadn't got a gun?--we might have gone out, you know, not"
"thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might come"
"towards us roaring, and we could not get away from him. What should you"
"do, Tom?”"
"Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying: “But the"
lion _isn't_ coming. What's the use of talking?”
This passage illustrates also the difference between the
right under the window of his sitting-room. An Indian voice greeted
"him, ""Don' shoot; me killi him."""
"""Who in h---- are you?"" swore Searles, at a present."
"""Don' shoot, me Ahhæta--all same Sharp-Nose--don' shoot--me killi him."""
"""Killi who? Who have you killed? Talk up quick!"""
"""Me killi him. You come--you see."""
By this time the crowd drew in with questions and eager to help. A
"sergeant arrived with a lantern, and the guard laid rude hands on the"
"Crow scout, Sharp-Nose, who was well known. He was standing over the"
"prostrate figure, and continued to reiterate, ""Me killi him."""
"The lantern quickly disclosed the man on the ground to be John Ermine,"
"late scout and fugitive from justice, shot through the heart and dead,"
with his blanket and rifle on the ground beside him. As he looked
"through the window, he had been stalked and killed by the fool whom he"
"would not allow to shake hands with Katherine Searles, and a few moments"
"later, when Sharp-Nose was brought into her presence, between two"
"soldiers, she recognized him when he said, ""Mabeso, now you shake"
"hands."""
"""Yes, I will shake hands with you, Sharp-Nose,"" and half to herself, as"
"she eyed her malevolent friend, she muttered, ""and he kept you to"
"remember me by."""
sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York.
It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.”
The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.
“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to
call time on him sharp?”
“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at
"least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long,"
officer.”
"“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat,"
trying doors as he went.
"There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from"
its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir
in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars
turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store
"the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain"
"almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and"
waited.
"About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,"
"with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite"
side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.
"“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."
"“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s"
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"
"adventures with him around! He's their regular hanging-out place!"""
"Gates came up, and seemed vastly amused when we told him of our hopes."
"""He doesn't look like much of an adventurer, sir, but he's certainly a"
"change from the great run of people I've met. Still, I carn't see how"
"we're going to keep him against his will!"""
"""Neither can I, Tommy."""
"""Use a little persuasion."""
"""But suppose he won't persuade?"""
"“Oh, don't you?” cried Sir Oliver, in sinister exultation. “Then your"
whole historical fabric of the Crucifixion must fall to the ground.”
"“I don't see why you need be irreverent and blasphemous,” said Lady"
Blount.
"Herold laid his hand on Lady Blount's and looked at her, with his head"
on one side.
"“But do you believe in Stellamaris, Julia.”"
"His smile was so winning, with its touch of mockery, that she grew"
mollified.
"“I believe she has bewitched all of us,” she said."
Which shows how any woman may be made to eat her words just by a little
kindness.
"So the talk went back to Stella and her ways and her oddities, and the"
question of faith in Pontius Pilate being necessary for salvation was

Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"
"eye to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed his horses to"
his ancient cab and had them ready for an emergency.
After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.
"""Now give me some inkling of what started this crazy adventure. Thank"
God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still
"fighting for his life! Answer me, Sidney."""
But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"
"when she spoke, came with a childish tremor."
"""Oh, Lavender _can't_ die. If he does--it will be all my fault! I"
"started everything. I--I told him about the diamonds--"""

The clang of an ambulance bell outside told that the aid summoned by

We left the body in charge of the surgeon and of a policeman who
"arrived about the same time, and followed Winters."
Muller lived in a cheap boarding house in a shabbily respectable street
"downtown, and without announcing ourselves we climbed the stairs to his"
room. He looked up surprised but not disconcerted as we entered.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
"“Muller,” shot out Winters, “we have just found Mr. Schloss dead!”"
“D-dead!” he stammered.
The man seemed speechless with horror.
"“Yes, and with his grips packed as if to run away.”"
"Muller looked dazedly from one of us to the other, but shut up like a"

"“My wife has a deadly hatred for all of them,” said Giovanni Battista,"
laughing.
“And why so?” asked Cæsar.
“Because we talk politics and sometimes they ask me for a few
pennies....”
"“Your wife must have a lively temper,...” said Cæsar."
"“Yes, an unhappy disposition; good, awfully good; but very"
superstitious. Christianity has produced nothing but superstitions.”
"“Giovanni Battista is a pagan, as his wife well says,” asserted Kennedy."
“What superstitions has your wife?” asked Cæsar.
“All of them. Romans are very superstitious and my wife is a Roman. If
"you see a hunchback, it is good luck; if you see three, then your luck"
is magnificent and you have to swallow your saliva three times; on the
"other hand, if you see a humpbacked woman it is a bad omen and you must"
spit on the ground to keep away the _jettatura_. Three priests together
"is a very good sign. We ought all to get along very well in Rome,"
because we see three and up to thirty priests together.”
"“A spider is also very significant,” said Kennedy; “in the morning it is"
"of bad augury, and in the evening good.”"
“And at noon?” asked Cæsar.
"“At noon,” answered Lanza, laughing, “it means nothing to speak of. But"
"“What very stupid and false ideas,” exclaimed Laura. “Really I"
appreciate having a brother who talks in such a vulgar way.”
“You are an aristocrat and the truth doesn’t please you. But such are
the facts. I can see the chief of the bureau of Papal titles. What fun
he must have thinking up the most appropriate title for a magnate of
Yankee tinned beef or for an illustrious Andean general! How magnificent
it would be to gather all the Bishops _in partibus infidelium_ and all
the people with Papal titles in one drawing-room! The Bishop of Nicaea

“You are a clown!” said Laura.
"“He is a finished satirist,” added Kennedy."
_CÆSAR’S PLAN_
"After lunch, Laura, Kennedy, and Cæsar went into the salon, and Laura"
introduced the Englishman to the San Martino girls and the Countess
"Brenda. They stayed there chatting until four o’clock, at which time the"
"San Martinos got ready to go out in a motor car, and Laura, with the"
"Countess and her daughter, in a carriage."
Cæsar and Kennedy went into the street together.

The duke regarded his host out of half-shut watery eyes.
"""My own choice is Chianti!"""
"""A difference of five years in purgatory!"""
Thereupon the duke blew the froth of his wine in the Abbot's face.
"""Purgatory!--A mere figure of speech!"""
The Abbot emptied his tankard.
"""The figures of speech are the pillars of the Church!"""
He beckoned to the custodian.

The lean friar came and disappeared noiselessly.
They drank for a time in heavy silence. After a time the Abbot
"sneezed, which caused Beelzebub, the Abbot's black he-goat, who had"
"been browsing outside, to peer through the crescent-shaped aperture in"
the casement and regard him quizzically.
"The duke, who chanced to look up at that precise moment, saw the red"
"inflamed eyes of the Abbot's tutelar genius, and, mistaking the goat"
"for another presence, turned to his host."

"Type sizes in the present day are determined by the point system, the"
fundamental unit of which is the point. This is obtained by dividing
"a length of 13⅘ inches into 996 equal parts, each one being called a"
point. One point is therefore .0138 of an inch or 72.46 points are
equal to 1 inch.
"For purposes of convenience, a point is expressed as being 1/72 of an"
"inch. Thus 6-point type occupies 6/72 of an inch of space, 12-point"
"12/72 and so on. This does not mean, however, that the actual printed"
"face occupies six points on the paper, but that it is six points from"
the base to the top of the body carrying the face.
"In other words, one may say that it is 12 points from the bottom of"

Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.

The mate looked the skipper up and down.

The great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in
length--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes
were as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now
passed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.
Scorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.
"The limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,"
"crinoids, and brachiopods."
With the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes
"to a close, giving place to the Devonian, the AGE OF FISHES."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEVONIAN
In America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any
mountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period
passed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so
"closely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,"
that geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which
divides them.

in New York and southward by the following five series. We add the

days were over. Michael had given him a perfect opportunity to start
building a new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break
loose.

"He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like it."
"Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track."
"They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the sixth floor of"
the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held overnight in
"the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled to"
deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for
"the delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He"
wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would
have much preferred being without the company of Vera Karanova.
One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal with great
finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier

of the Rogans caught her by the wrists and dragged her forward.
"""They have come to question you,"" Greca lamented to Brand. ""And they"
"want to do it through me. But I will not! I will not!"""
Brand smiled at her though his lips were pale.
"""You are powerless to struggle,"" he said. ""Do as they ask. You cannot"
"help us by refusing, and, in any case, I can promise that they won't"
"learn anything from us."""

"to play, was Greca."
At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to
"Greca, though his stony eyes were kept intently on the Earthmen."
"""He says,"" exclaimed Greca telepathically, ""to inform you first that"
"he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this"
"globe must do as he commands."""
Brand nodded to show he understood the message.
"""He says he is going to ask you a few questions, and that you are to"
"answer truthfully if you value your lives:"""
"""First, he wants to know what the people of your world are like. Are"
"they all the same as you?"""

"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
"After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. ""You're right. I've also"
"become a male outside the law. We're in this together."""
He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found
myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis
insists such things have always had for men.
"""Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll"
"call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown."""
"I liked the sound of Ford. ""Is Butt a nickname, too?"""
"""Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a"
"blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the"
eighties--the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named
"all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the"
"name they were saving for a girl."""
"""You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?"""
"He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. ""Oh, a nestful. Of course, they"
were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys--all
except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.
Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down
"the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up."""
I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of
"the blaster above the firing button. ""Have you killed a lot of men with"
"that, Mr. Butt?"""
"""Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford."" He frowned and sighted at"
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
the door yawned open.
Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.
The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the doorway;
and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.
"Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting with a"
grave smile of surprise.
"“Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?” he asked."
"The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking into the"
corners of the old mouth again:
"“He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,” she said--“will you go"
up and see him?”
"Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him with"
a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the little
"sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly figure of the"
little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room and kissed the
"jealousy out of this old woman’s heart, came back to him like the"
"fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he could not speak what"
he would have said.
"“It was only the other day,” she said, “that you were boys together...."
To me it is only yesterday that he was a--little one--in my--arms.”
Her eyes filled with tears. “But it is all gone.... This passing of
youth is as strange as death....” And she added after awhile: “I think
he--was glad--to come back.”
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
"""But the diamonds!"" she cried."
"""_Diamonds_--"" Cap'n Davies stared at her, his mouth open."
"""Why, yes, they're on this boat. They _must_ be! We were in the forward"
cabin watching and Jed Starrow came on board and they talked right
where we could hear. They were going to take them off and then they
decided it wasn't safe and they'd wait and they went away. And then
they must have cut the boat adrift. But we're _sure_ they're on this
"boat."""
"""So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly tricks! Well, never mind"
"your diamonds, now. We got to get back to shore and let a few folks"
"know--"""
"""But I won't _go_ until we've looked!"" Sidney protested, almost in"
"tears. ""Why, that was why we risked everything! And Lav wants to save"
"the name of the Cape--the--the way--you do! Oh, please look!"""
"The old Captain dropped his hold of the girl's arm. ""Well, I'll be"
"ding-blasted!"" he stormed. But he motioned to Saunders. ""Climb aboard"
and give us a hand. 'Taint likely they'd hide their stuff above deck.
You look round the stern and the girls and me'll give a hunt forward.
"Of all the stubborn, crazy-headed female pieces you'll beat 'em all!"""
While Saunders searched the stern of the schooner the Captain and
"Sidney and Mart searched the fo'castle cabin. Sidney, tugging away the"
"heavy tarpaulins, disclosed a small wooden box."
"""I'm _sure_ it wasn't there before--"" she cried. ""Why--why, I was"
"_sitting_ on it--"""
He looked down the scuttle at the clock.
"""Why, you owe me twenty."""
Simcox flew out with pretended politeness.
"""Oh, make it half an hour!  Don't let's haggle about such a trifle."
What's it matter if I stand here waiting?  Can't I keep the whole
"bloomin' watch for you?"""
"""Go to hell,"" said Lampert sulkily."
And Simcox went below.
"""To be a sailor is to be a natural born fool,"" said Lampert,"
"addressing the bitter and unkindly elements at large, ""and to be on"
"board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd, from the old man down"
"to the cook, is very trying.  It's very trying."""
"The wind took off a little later, but the weather was still thickish."
"""It's like lookin' through a haystack,"" grunted Lampert, ""but there,"
bar an island or so there's nothing to speak of in our way.  And if
"the skipper will crack on, and it a week since we saw the sun, it's"
"the owners' look out, not mine."""
"He spoke with a certain bitterness, as though he would really enjoy"
"being wrecked, in the trust that the _Potluck_ was not insured, and"
"that old Jones would get his certificate cancelled, or at least"
suspended.

"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.
"TYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN."
A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some
"time he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the"
Indian Ocean.
Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"

before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"
"ship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the"
Welsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the
"_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on"
"the Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and"
"her cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns."
"Alves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor"
"of Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but"
by way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a
Scotch one and not a Portuguese.
"PHILLIPS, CAPTAIN."
"In 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the"
Banks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by
"Phillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John"
"Fillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,"
"Edward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and"
"the two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was"
taken to Boston.
"PHILIPS, JAMES."
Of the Island of Antigua.
"Formerly of the _Revenge_, and afterwards in the _Royal Fortune_ (Captain"
Roberts). When the _Royal Fortune_ surrendered in 1722 to H.M.S.
"_Swallow_, Philips seized a lighted match and attempted to blow up the"
"ship, swearing he would ""send them all to Hell together,"" but was"
"prevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35."
no wish but to spend some pleasant hours with the Torsen type.
He strolled about the garden waiting for her to get ready. Once she was
"visible through the doorway, and he called to her:"
"""Aren't you coming soon? Don't forget we've got to cross the mountain!"""
"""Well, I can't go bareheaded,"" she replied."
He was impatient.
"""No, you've got to put your hat on, and what a lot of time that takes!"
"Ugh!"""
She measured him coldly and said:
"""You're very--familiar."""
If he had paid her back in the same coin there would have been weeping and
"gnashing of teeth and cries of ""Go away! Go alone!"" and an hour's delay,"
"and reconciliation and embraces. But the actor's manner changed at once,"
"and he replied docilely, as his nature was,"
"""Familiar? Well--perhaps. Sorry!"""
"Then he strolled about the garden again, humming occasionally and swinging"
"his stick. I took note of the oddly feminine shape of his knees, and the"
unusual plumpness of his thighs; there was something unnatural about this
"plumpness, as though it did not belong to his sex."
"His shoes were down at the heel, and his collar was open. His raincoat"
"hung regally from his shoulders and flapped in the wind, though it was not"
confronted by Sonora when about to return to the others.
"""Well, I tho't I seen him,"" evaded Nick with considerable uneasiness. ""I"
"couldn't swear to it. You see it was dark, an'--Moses but the Sidney"
"Duck's a liar!"""
"At length, Ashby decided that the man had in all probability been snowed"
"under, ending confidently with:"
"""Something scared him off and he lit out without his horse."" Which"
"remark brought temporary relief to the Girl, for Nick, watching her, saw"
the colour return to her face.
"Unconsciously, during this discussion, the Girl had risen to her feet,"
"but only to fall back in her chair again almost as suddenly, a sign of"
nervousness which did not escape the sharp eye of the Sheriff.
"""How do you know the man's a road agent?"" A shade almost of contempt was"
in the Girl's question.
Sonora breathed on his badly nipped fingers before answering:
"""Well, two greasers jest now were pretty positive before they quit."""
Instantly the Girl's head went up in the air.
"""Greasers!"" she ejaculated scornfully, while her eyes unfalteringly met"
Rance's steady gaze.
"""But the woman knew him,"" was the Sheriff's vindictive thrust."
The Girl started; her face went white.
"""Vera, my love,"" Eva said, cutting her off, ""if you try and double-"
"cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You seem to forget we've"
got that protocol. What we didn't get around to telling you is that
"we've deciphered it."""
"""You--?"""
"""That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going to like what"
"it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story before"
"you read about it in The Times day after tomorrow."""
"Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. ""Michael, Tanzan Mino's people"
are probably headed here by now. Unless they go to the main office on
"King William Street first."" He was nervously glancing out the window."
"""We're running out of time."""
"The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take charge."
"But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85, a"
"lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his"
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.
The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers weren't
supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.
"""Michael,"" he said as he glanced over, ""would you kindly give me a hand"
"and take those two .38's? We really must get this party moving."""
"Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. ""I don't know how far you think"
"you will get with this."""

"Besides the windows, the till and the shelves had been cleared, and"
empty drawers and boxes had been thrown on to the floor. We went down
into the cellar. All the cases had been opened and the stone floor was
littered with empty and broken bottles. The girl began to sob again when
she saw the ruin that had been inflicted:
"""All gone, all gone--ve poor now."""
"""Why don't you complain to the Town Major?"" one of us suggested."
"""Complain?--vat's de use complain?--de Town Major, he nice man, he kind"
"to us, but he no find de soldiers dat come, and if he find zem he punish"

"and ve all killed--ah, dis var, dis var! Vat's de use fighting? All for"

"We ascended the cellar stairs. The mother was in the main room, wiping"
"her eyes. We said good-bye to her and her daughter, feeling ashamed of"
"our uniforms, and walked out into the street."
A mass of French cavalry were galloping past. It was growing dark. The
cannonade had become deafening. Over the town a few miles off there was
a crimson glare in the sky.
"Kilshaw's got a gadfly that does instead, and of course, Coxon, I add"
"you to the list."""
"""Much obliged for your testimonial,"" said Coxon sourly."
"""I add any man I'm talking to, to the list,"" continued the Chief"
"Justice. ""I expect him to do the same by me. But, honestly, I add you"
even in your absence. You're not a man who puts party ties above
"everything."""
"Mr. Coxon darted a suspicious glance at the head of his profession, but"
the Chief Justice's air was blandly innocent.
"""My party's my party,"" he remarked, ""just so long as it carries out my"
"principles. I don't say either party does it perfectly."""
"""I dare say not; but of course you're right to act with the one that"
"does most for you."""
Again the Chief Justice had hit on a somewhat ambiguous expression.
"Coxon detected a grin on the face of Captain Heseltine, who was sitting"
"near, but he could not hold Sir John's grave face guilty of the"
Captain's grin.
"""I see,"" remarked the Captain, perhaps in order to cover the retreat of"
"his grin, ""that they've discharged the woman who was arrested last night"
"for the murder."""
"""Really no evidence against her,"" said the Chief Justice. ""But,"
"Heseltine, wasn't this man Benham the fellow Medland had a sort of"
"shindy with at that flower-show?"""
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
clever enough? Then the situation stimulated her. She held out her hand
to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"
soon.”
"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next
generation and write your own biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have not had justice done you.”
“Ha! ha!” said Trent.
"It relieves me to know she is alive, revives me, and makes me"
"superlatively brave: if he has dared to kill her, I will report it at"
once. I shall not spare him. I shall accuse him of both her death and the
lawyer's. I shall go further: I shall accuse others--the thief of last
"winter, the man that stole the sides of bacon from a tradesman and sold me"
"rolls of tobacco out of his bag. No, I shall not keep silence about"
anything then....

"When it grew light, Solem went to the kitchen, had his breakfast, settled"
"his business with Paul and the women, and returned to his room. He was in"
"no hurry; though it was no longer early in the day, he took his time about"
"tying his bundles, preparatory to leaving. Lingeringly he looked into the"
windows of the south wing as he passed.
Then Solem was gone.
A little later Miss Torsen came in to breakfast. She asked at once about
Solem. And why might she be so interested in Solem? She had certainly
stopped in her room intentionally so as to give him time to leave; if she
wanted to see him she could have been here long ago. But was it not safest
"to seem a little angry? Supposing, night owl that I was, that I had seen"
something!
"""Where is Solem?"" she asked indignantly."
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
"""Thank you, sir."""
"After Frank Corson left, Superintendent Maynard sorted a memo out of the"
pile on his desk. The memo concerned Frank Corson. Superintendent
Maynard reread it and thought how well things usually worked out. Now it
wouldn't be necessary to have that talk with Corson about sloppy work.
Obviously there had been something on the young intern's mind for weeks
"now. Too bad. But let the Minnesota hospital, wherever it was, worry"
about the trouble and perhaps put Corson on the right track again.
He was their baby now.
Maynard took Corson's card from the files and wrote across it: _Transfer

Brent Taber stood in the shelter of a doorway on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan and watched an entrance across the street. He had been there
for over an hour.
Another hour passed and Taber shifted from one aching foot to the other
as a man in a blue suit emerged from the entrance and moved off down the
street.
"When the man had turned a corner, Taber crossed over and looked up at"
the brownstone. It was a perfect place to hide--one of the many rooming
"houses in the city where, if you paid your rent and kept your peace, no"
one cared who you were or where you came from.

Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"

his evil purpose.

*CHAPTER VIII.*
*A STARTLING DISCOVERY.*
As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BURGLAR’S MICROPHONE
"That night I was sitting, brooding over the case, while Craig was"
studying a photograph which he made of the smudge on the glass door
down at Schloss’. He paused in his scrutiny of the print to answer the
telephone.
"“Something has happened to Schloss,” he exclaimed seizing his hat and"
coat. “Winters has been watching him. He didn’t go to the Recherche.
Winters wants me to meet him at a place several blocks below it Come
on. He wouldn’t say over the wire what it was. Hurry.”
"We met Winters in less than ten minutes at the address he had given, a"
bachelor apartment in the neighborhood of the Recherche.
"“Schloss kept rooms here,” explained Winters, hurrying us quickly"
upstairs. “I wanted you to see before anyone else.”
As we entered the large and luxuriously furnished living room of the
"jeweler’s suite, a gruesome sight greeted us."
"There lay Schloss on the floor, face down, in a horribly contorted"
"position. In one hand, clenched under him partly, the torn sleeve of a"
woman’s dress was grasped convulsively. The room bore unmistakable
"traces of a violent struggle, but except for the hideous object on the"
floor was vacant.
"Kennedy bent down over him. Schloss was dead. In a corner, by the door,"
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”
“Then it was sent up by this crooked messenger boy with the intention of
"getting us out to look for you. He believed, of course, that we would"
regard the call for help as coming from you and rush away from camp.”
"“Don’t be too sure of that,” warned Ned. “There’s something about that"
"boy I rather like. Besides, he really is a member of the Wolf Patrol,"
New York.”
“My own patrol?” exclaimed Jimmie. “I never saw him at the club room. He
"told me that he belonged to the Wolf Patrol, but I didn’t believe it. I"
think he’s a fake.”
"“Time alone will tell,” answered Ned. “I’m going to believe in the boy"
until I get some positive proof that he really is crooked.”
Jimmie was about to continue the argument when a succession of shrieks
and calls for help came from the forest on the slope below.
"“Now, what’s that?” demanded Jimmie. “That isn’t any of our boys!”"
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the voice.
"“No,” Ned agreed, “our boys don’t make a racket like that.”"
"“Say!” Jimmie shouted, springing to his feet. “I bet you the next dollar"
"I don’t find that that’s the fat clerk, Gilroy!”"
"“The voice sounds like that of a fat man,” Ned laughed."
“Gilroy’s fat all right!” Jimmie exclaimed. “He’s got one of those pink
baby faces that make you hungry to look at. He makes me think of a roast
and then tell me how much probable space volume that so-called response
"represents."""
"The tech thought a minute. ""We've never run this gear anywhere"
"but at Radiation, right at Mojave labs, on Earth. Our spacial"
"coordinates--well, I'm afraid we--"" His voice trailed away unhappily."
Wilson picked up the interphone and barked a call.
"""Weston? Look, Hugh, can you get over here quick with a couple of your"
top astrogators? We've got a bunch of longhairs with a fancy infrawave
"detector and ranger, but the damned coordinates are set axially with"
"the ship."""
He listened to Hugh Weston's reply.
"""Yeah,"" he said then. ""We know where the target is with respect to the"
"ship, but we don't know the spacial attitude of the ship with respect"
"to the galactic check points. Right over? Good."""

"As Wilson hung up the dome flickered, then went into a regular"

“I say I sup with the gods to-night--and mix the hats--and set the
table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear them call.... God
"bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine----”"
Rippley stepped to the door:
"“Quick!” said he in a hushed whisper, “make a line, quick there,"
"you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door. Here comes"
Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old nobility.... Come along.
Blotte--don’t look like a broken-down anarchist in an advanced stage
"of pip. You must affect the smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner,"
expectant of a fee.”
"As Blotte’s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed, and there"
stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure of their host.
"Pangbutt halted, perplexed."
He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in white silks
before him--turned to the solemn countenances of the four waiters:
"“May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in this house?”"
he asked.
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"
"me--I imagine you are in diplomacy, as I noticed you went through"
"with a Red passport.--I am Vivien Warren, just out of prison, and an"
"outlaw, more or less."""
"""'The outlaws of to-day are the in-laws of to-morrow,' as the"
English barrister said when he married the Boer general's daughter.
I have thought I recognized you. I have heard you speak at Lady
Maud's and also at Lady Feenix's Suffrage parties. My name is Hawk.
I suppose you've been in prison for some Suffrage offence? So has my
"aunt, for the matter of that."""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but in her case they only sentenced her to the First"
"Division; whereas _I_ have been doing nine months' hard."""
"_Hawk_: ""What was your crime?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I admit nothing, it is always wisest. But I was accused of"
"burning down Mr. ----'s racing stables--and other things..."""
"_Hawk_: ""_That_ beast. Well, I suppose it was very wrong. Can't"
"quite make up my mind about militancy, one way or the other. But"
"here we are up against the biggest war in history, and such"
"peccadilloes as yours sink into insignificance. By the bye, my aunt"
"was amnestied and so I suppose were you?"""
"_Vivie_: ""Yes, but not so handsomely. I was requested to go away"
"from England for a time, so here I am, about to join my mother in"
"Brussels--or in a little country place near Brussels."""
"_Hawk_: ""Well, I've been Secretary of Legation there. I'm just going"
"back to--to--well I'm just going back."""

The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into

last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"

Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.

"I must go, Dad."""
Winton nodded.
"""Well, I'll come too,"" he said.  ""The girl can go back in the cab and say"
"we're on the way."""
"Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS"
"is my fate, and no getting out of it!'  On the journey, she and Winton"
were quite silent--but she held his hand tight.  While the cook was
"taking up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at"
her garden.  Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above
"her pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat!"
"Slipping her hand through Winton's arm, she said:"
"""Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss.  He couldn't help himself,"
"I suppose.  What does it matter, too?"""
"A moment later Rosek entered.  Before she could speak, Winton was saying:"
"""Thank you for letting us know, sir.  But now that my daughter is here,"
"there will be no further need for your kind services.  Good-day!"""
"At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward."
She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
"paper.  He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out."
Winton followed--precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in
"the hall.  When the outer door was shut, he said:"
"""I don't think he'll trouble you again."""
"Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion.  After all, his"
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's

_A Terrifying Tale Of Horror In The Skies_
THE FLYING EYES
By J. Hunter Holly
Author of ENCOUNTER and THE GREEN PLANET
Linc Hosler was sitting in a packed football stadium when the Flying
Eyes appeared and cast their hypnotic power over half the crowd.
Thousands of people suddenly began marching zombie-like into the woods
where they vanished into a black pit.
Linc used every resource of the Space Research Lab and the National
"Guard to destroy the Eyes. But nothing could stop them, for they proved"
immune to bullets and bombs.
"In desperation, Linc captured an Eye and found a way to communicate with"
it through his mind. He learned that radiation was fuel for the
creatures' lives. And then they issued their terrible ultimatum: Explode
a series of atom bombs to supply them with radiation or they would turn
the world's population into mindless robots.
It gave the world two harrowing choices--self-destruction via fallout
from the bombs or annihilation via the sinister Flying Eyes....

"At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When"

upon the other’s face.
The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.

And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:

I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday. By the time
you get this letter I shall have left my house in the clouds. Last

"without means, except the sweating pay of mean industries on which"

dancing with life--not with a desire to cower in sweating-dens.
"She was drifting. I gave her all these things that I might, last"
night--and she is now asleep here.
"Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she is not"
alone. She will babble all her news to you--it will be better for her
than babbling it to me.

am not so sure. Is it an exception?

ALL LIFE IS ONE
"'I heard a voice that cried,"
"""Balder the Beautiful"
"Is dead, is dead,"""
And through the misty air
Passed like the mournful cry
Of sunward-sailing cranes.'
TEGNER'S _Drapa_.
"All romance has died out of our woods and hills in England, all our"
fairies are dead long ago. Knowledge so far has brought us only death.
Later on it will bring us a new life. It is even now showing us how this
"may be, and is bringing us face to face again with Nature, and teaching"
us to know and understand the life that there is about us. Science is
"telling us again what we knew long ago and forgot, that our life is not"
"apart from the life about us, but of it. Everything is akin to us, and"
"when we are more accustomed to this knowledge, when we have ceased to"
"Gratefully yours,"
Robert Ashburton.
"The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy."
"“De gent wants an answer,” said the messenger. “Wot’s de word?”"
"The lady’s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet."
"“Tell that guy on the other bench,” she said, with a happy, tremulous"
"laugh, “that his girl wants him.”"
THE FURNISHED ROOM
"Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of"
the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.
"Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to"
"furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in"
"heart and mind. They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry"
their _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a
picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
"Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,"
"should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but"
it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the
wake of all these vagrant guests.
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
"HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd"
Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears
"All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears"
"In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud."
"Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,"
And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;
And in his face and gesture there appears
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.
"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,"
He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?
Is the long darkness darker for that light.
The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?
"Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,"
Pleading in his reproachful misery.
THE OLD LABOURER.
"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,"
His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;
His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits
Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke.
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;
He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;
He saw his masters flourish through his toil;
He held their substance in his horny hand.
“He’s after us now all right!” whispered Jimmie.
"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
"""When do you propose to make the start, Colonel?"" Nicholson asked."
"""Within an hour. The night favors us. The women must be kept in the"
center as much as possible. I have given Geoffries special charge over
them. They will be told at the last moment. There is no use in
"spoiling what little rest they have had."" He drew out a pencil and"
"began to scribble a despatch on the back of an old letter. ""I advise"
"you gentlemen to do likewise,"" he said. ""Very often a piece of paper"
"gets through where a man can not, and it is our bounden duty to supply"
"the morning periodicals with as much news as possible."""
For some minutes there was no sound save that of the pencils scrawling
the last messages of men with the seal of death already stamped upon
"their foreheads. All three had forgotten Travers, and yet from the"
moment they had begun to speak he had been awake and listening. He sat
"up now, leaning upon his elbow."
"""Nicholson!"" he said faintly."
Nicholson turned and came to his side.
"""Hullo!"" he said. ""Awake, are you? How are you?"""
Travers made no immediate answer; he took Nicholson's hand in a
feverish clasp and drew him nearer.
"""I am in great pain,"" he said. ""You don't need to pretend. I know. The"
fear of death has been on me all day. Just now I am not afraid. Is
"there no hope?"""
"""You mean--for us? None."""
world.
Before the flotilla regained Dover Harbour the remaining seaplanes
came in sight. Unfortunately their efforts at pursuit were futile.
The Zeppelin developing a turn of speed far in excess of which she
"had been credited by her detractors, had shaken off the British"
"aircraft, and when last seen she was high over the Belgian coast."
"Nevertheless, her wings had been clipped, although she survived to"
tell the tale that the hated English were still able vigorously and
successfully to dispute the mastery of the air.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"""LIEUTENANT AUBYN, R.N., D.S.O."""
"ON the evening following the return of the ""Sunderland"" to Dover,"
Terence obtained leave to go ashore in order to visit a
"brother-officer who, owing to his ship being under repairs, was"
temporarily installed in the Lord Warden Hotel.
Aubyn was proceeding along the Admiralty Pier when his progress was
"barred by a tall, bronzed young fellow in the uniform of a"
flight-lieutenant of the Naval Air Service.
"""Hullo, Aubyn, old man!"" exclaimed the latter cordially, as he"
"extended his hand. ""Forgotten me already?"""
For an instant Brand was dumbfounded. For here was language he could
understand--which was incredible on this far-flung globe. Then he
suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd
had some experience with telepathy on Venus; but theirs was a crude
thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl
before him.
"""Who are you?"" he asked wonderingly."
"""I am Greca""--it was very hard to grasp names or abstract terms--""of"
"the fourth satellite."""
"""Then you are not of these monsters of Jupiter?"""
"""Oh, no! I am their captive, as are all my people. We are but slaves"
"of the tall ones."""
"Brand glanced at Dex. ""Here's a chance to get some information,"
"perhaps,"" he murmured."
Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."
"""I shall be happy to tell you anything in my power to tell,"" she"
"informed him. ""But you must be quick. I can only remain with you a"
"little while."""
She sat down on the floor with them--the few bench-like things
obviously used by the tall creatures as chairs were too high for
"""What's the use of crossing bridges,"" Tommy grinned. ""If he won't"
"persuade, then sit on his head--anything, I don't care! The main thing"
"is--keep him!"""
CHAPTER III
THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ
"Next morning began the conversion, or rather the persuasion, of Monsieur"
Dragot to remain a while longer with the _Whim_. Pete started off with
another triumphant breakfast and before our guest had gone far with it
his face was agleam with pleasure. Tommy and I put ourselves out to be
"agreeable, telling him jokes that sometimes registered but frequently"
"did not. Yet we were on most affable terms when, stuffed to repletion,"
we leaned back and lighted cigarettes.
"""Professor,"" Tommy suggested, ""I think if you stay with us you'll have a"
"better chance to find that child!"""
"Our guest beamed agreeably at the appelative, then looked toward me."
"""I'm sure of it,"" I said. ""We've nowhere to go but anywhere, and that"
"ought to fall in with your plans."""
"""_Pardieu_, you overwhelm me! You mean I may sail about with you,"
"searching?"""
"""Nothing simpler,"" I assured him. ""We've rather taken a fancy to you,"
"what's the use of jaw?  I say get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"""
"""Don't ask me,"" said old Mac.  ""I was thinkin' that mighty soon we'd"
"be able to settle that question about the buildin' of the _Potluck_."""
And as by this time Jones was calming down and was rather inclined to
"cry, Lampert came up to the restive crowd."
"""You dry up, Hart,"" he said roughly.  ""Until the ship's broken up,"
"you're on the articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."""
"""Yes, sir,"" said Hart respectfully."
"Until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and foc'sle,"
"discussing whether they were on one of the Crozets or what, and"
"whether they would stay long there, and if so what, and so on."
And just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful
surprise.  They saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level
with the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where it had gone short
in the cap.
"""The bloomin' hisland's in'abited,"" cried a foremast hand, and every"
one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
"""Wod's the bloke say?"" asked the crowd.  ""Oh, say it again!""  And the"
stranger said it again.
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.

"where's Dutchy?"""
"instant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables"
and sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship
"commenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was"
still aboard her.
"In the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,"
"but nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and"
landing and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by
a Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight
"Rackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal."
"On November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,"
convicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed
"as men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate"
"fashion, to Rackam."
"On the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,"
"to visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was ""that she was"
"sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have"
"been hanged like a Dog."""

Richards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by
their outrageous and swaggering conduct.
"RICHARDSON, JOHN."
"His father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of"
"cooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he"
served both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated
"blackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,"
"when, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come"
there with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve
"as ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called"
"Coyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most"
"brutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate"
Richardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at
"Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738."

The front matter is often put into type after the composition of
"the body has been completed, so that the number of pages is rarely"
"definitely determined at the beginning of the work. For this reason,"
publishers have favored the expedient of numbering the preliminary
"pages with roman folios, using the arabic folios for the text itself."
The front matter and the chapter pages running through the book
offer opportunities for embellishment and distinctive typographical
"treatment, and therefore should be kept in exact accord, whether"
elaborate decorations are used or the severest form of typographical
simplicity.

"'Then now go! Go out, do you hear?' she cried, stamping her foot with"
passion. 'I want nothing. Go!'
I turned and crept towards the door like a beaten hound. But I was not
"to go; when my hand was on the latch, her mood changed."
"'No, stay,' she said in a different tone. 'You may come back. After"
"all, Martin, I had rather it was you than any one else.'"
"She dried her tears as she spoke, standing up very straight and proud,"
and hiding nothing. I felt a pang as I looked at her. I had neglected
her of late. I had been thinking more of others.
"'It is nothing, Martin,' she said after a pause, and when she had"
quite composed her face. 'You need not be frightened. All women cry a
"little sometimes, as men swear,' she added, smiling."
"'You have been looking at that thing outside,' I said, grumbling."
"'Perhaps it did upset me,' she replied. 'But I think it was that I"
felt--a little lonely.'
"That sounded so strange a complaint on her lips, seeing that the echo"
"of the young sparks' laughter was barely dead in the room, that I"
"stared. But I took it, on second thoughts, to refer to Fraulein Max,"
"whom she had kept at a distance since our escape, never sitting down"
"with her, or speaking to her except on formal occasions; and I said"
bluntly--
"'You need a woman friend, my lady.'"
"Perhaps half an hour we waited, still puzzling over the scraps of"
paper. Suddenly I felt a nudge from Kennedy. Antoinette Moulton was
standing in the doorway across the street. Evidently she preferred not
"to ride in her own car, for a moment later she entered a taxicab."
"“Follow that black cab,” said Kennedy to our driver."
"Sure enough, it stopped in front of the Recherche Apartments and Mrs."
Moulton stepped out and almost ran in.
"We waited a moment, then Kennedy followed. The elevator that had taken"
her up had just returned to the ground floor.
"“The same floor again,” remarked Kennedy, jauntily stepping in and"
nodding familiarly to the elevator boy.
"Then he paused suddenly, looked at his watch, fixed his gaze"
"thoughtfully on me an instant, and exclaimed. “By George—no. I can’t go"
"up yet. I clean forgot that engagement at the hotel. One moment, son."
Let us out. We’ll be back again.”
"Considerably mystified, I followed him to the sidewalk."
"“You’re entitled to an explanation,” he laughed catching my bewildered"
look as he opened the cab door. “I didn’t want to go up now while she
"is there, but I wanted to get on good terms with that boy. We’ll wait"
"until she comes down, then go up.”"
“Where?” I asked.
“That’s what I am going through all this elaborate preparation to find
"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the"
"captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the"
quartermasters.
"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told"
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
"watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying"
his deckload of wood.
And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
"the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard"
anything more of them.
NOTE
"A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of ""Storm Magic"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 248. From the vicinity of"
"Christiania, told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the ""Fritjof"
"Legend"" the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches,"
who call up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know
"the inner context of the cabin-boy's counter magic, and why it is"
"that the birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the"
power to destroy the witches.

THE FOUR-SHILLING PIECE

"Later in the forenoon Eilert returned home. He was alone, but he came up"
the path carrying one of the knapsacks--the larger one. He was in a
"furious temper, and kept saying they'd better not try it on him--no,"
they'd just better not.
Of course it was the bill again.
"""She'll probably have a good deal of this sort of trouble,"" I thought to"
"myself, ""but no doubt she'll get used to it, and take it as nonchalantly"
"as it should be taken. There are worse things."""
"But the fact remains that it was I that upset them, I that had driven them"
away without their clothes; perhaps they had really expected some money to
be sent here--who knows?
"I got hold of Eilert. How big was the bill? What, was that all? ""Good"
"heavens! Here you are, here's your money; now row across to them at once"
"with their clothes!"""
"But it all proved in vain, for the strangers had gone; they had arrived"
"just in time for the boat, and were aboard it at that very moment."
"Well, there was no help for it."
"""Here's their address,"" says Eilert. ""We can send the clothes next"
"Thursday; that's the next trip the boat goes south again."""
In the wind.
"""A passable enough rendering, if I may say, though I don't necessarily"
"accept your analogy."" He reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed"
"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""
"He set down two black _raku_ saucers and began to pour. ""Now, alas, we"
"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."
"""Dr. Michael Vance."" He lifted his saucer in a toast. ""A scholar of the"
"lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of the Central"
"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last
"encounter."""
"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.
"""It's kind of you to have remembered."" Mino drank once more, then"
for himself.
"""Congratulations."""
"""Thank you."""
"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"
protocol's financial grab ought to sail through the Supreme Soviet. You
prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your
"profits."""
"""So I would like to think,"" he nodded. ""Of course, one never knows how"
"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"
of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"
"us."""

"""Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind me,"" he went on calmly,"
"despite the flicker of anger in his eyes. ""The completion of this"
"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”

"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"
*       *       *       *       *
The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"
"mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth"
oaths exploded from his lips.
The character of his relations towards them was confirmed by the
"appearance of his clothes, which, as a rule, were tidy, and cleaner"
"than those of his companions.  And now, sitting at the door of the"
"dosshouse, he boastingly related that for a long time past Redka had"
"been asking him to go and live with her, but he had not gone because he"
did not want to part with the company.  They heard this with jealous
"interest.  They all knew Redka.  She lived very near the town, almost"
"below the mountain.  Not long ago, she had been in prison for theft."
"She was a retired nurse; a tall, stout peasant woman, with a face"
"marked by smallpox, but with very pretty, though always drunken, eyes."
"""Just look at the old devil!"" swore Abyedok, looking at Simtsoff, who"
was smiling in a self-satisfied way.
"""And do you know why they love me?  Because I know how to cheer up"
"their souls."""
"""Do you?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""And I can make them pity me....  And a woman, when she pities!  Go and"
"weep to her, and ask her to kill you ... she will pity you--and she"
"will kill you."""
"""I feel inclined to commit a murder,"" declared Martyanoff, laughing his"
dull laugh.
"""Upon whom?"" asked Abyedok, edging away from him."
"""It's all the same to me ... Petunikoff ... Egorka ... or even you!"""
"""And why?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"and Lady Eynesford, and all the rest, but what do I care if I have you"
"and him?"""
"""Me and him, Daisy?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered, smiling boldly. ""He's asked me to marry him--just"
"to show he didn't mind--and I think I will, father. We three against the"
"world! What need we care? Father, we'll beat Sir Robert!"" and she seized"
his two hands and laughed.
In vain Medland tried to tell her what he had come to say. Mighty as his
"relief and joy were, he still felt a burden lay on him. She would not"
hear.
"""Don't you see I'm happy?"" she cried. ""It can't be your duty to make me"
"unhappy. Jack doesn't mind, I don't mind!"" Her voice sank a little and"
"she added, ""It can't hurt mother now. Oh, don't be unhappy about it,"
"dear--don't, don't!"""
"They were standing now, and his arm was about her. Looking up at him,"
"she went on,"
"""They shan't beat us! They shan't say they beat us. We three, father!"""
He stooped and kissed her. There is love that lies beyond the realm of
"giving or taking, of harm or good, of wrong, or even of forgiveness."
"With all his faults, this love he had won from his daughter, and it"
"stood him in stead that night. He drew himself up to his height, and the"
air of despondency fell from him. The girl's brave love braced him to
meet the world again.
"""No, by Jove, we're not beat yet, Daisy!"" he said, and she kissed him"
"""But there's jest one thing you've overlooked explainin', Mr. Johnson."
It shows exactly what you are. It wasn't so much your bein' a road agent
"I got against you. It's this:"" And here she stamped her foot excitedly."
"""You kissed me--you got my first kiss."""
Johnson hung his head.
"""You said,"" kept on the Girl, hotly, ""you'd ben thinkin' o' me ever"
"since you saw me at Monterey, an' all the time you walked straight off"
"an' ben kissin' that other woman."" She shrugged her shoulder and laughed"
"grimly. ""You've got a girl,"" she continued, growing more and more"
"indignant. ""It's that I've got against you. It's my first kiss I've got"
against you. It's that Nina Micheltoreña that I can't forgive. So now
"you can git--git!"" And with these words she unbolted the door and"
concluded tensely:
"""If they kill you I don't care. Do you hear, I don't care . . ."""
At those bitter words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide
"their misery, the Girl's face became colourless."
"With the instinct of a brave man to sell his life as dearly as possible,"
"Johnson took a couple of guns from his pocket; but the next moment, as"
if coming to the conclusion that death without the Girl would be
"preferable, he put them back, saying:"
"""You're right, Girl."""
The next instant he had passed out of the door which she held wide open
for him.
"“No, French.”"
"“Ah, then, you needn’t be surprised. A Frenchman has no obligation to"
understand anything that’s not French.”
“Nevertheless he was an intelligent man.”
“Did he perhaps have a good deal of veneration?”
"“No, he boasted of not having any.”"
“Doubtless he did have without suspecting it. With a man who had no
"veneration, what difference would it make whether there was one bad"
thing among a lot of good ones?”
"The German with the green hat, who understood something of the"
"conversation, was indignant at Cæsar’s irreverent ideas. He asked him"
"if he understood Latin, and Cæsar told him no, and then, in a strange"
"gibberish, half Latin and half Italian, he let loose a series of facts,"
"dates, and numbers. Then he asserted that all artistic things of great"
"merit were German: Greece. Rome, Gothic architecture, the Italian"
"Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, Velázquez, all German."
"The snub-nosed young person, with his cape and his green hat with its"
"cock-feather, did not let a mouse escape from his German mouse-trap."
"The data of the befeathered German were too much for Cæsar, and he took"
his leave of the painters.
"""I well remember it,"" he went on.  ""I quite recollect how, on one"
"occasion, you came over to London, and while dining together at Jimmy's"
"you told me of your infatuation, and showed me her photograph.  Do you"
"remember the night when you told me of your engagement to her?"""
"""Perfectly."""
"""And as time went on you suddenly dropped her--for what reason I know"
"not.  We are pals, but I have never attempted to pry into your affairs."
"If she really loved you, it must have been a hard blow for her when she"
"heard that you had forsaken her for Edith Austin."""
"""You reproach me,"" I said.  ""But you do not know the whole truth, my"
"dear fellow.  I discovered that Yolande possessed a second lover."""
"He nodded slowly, with pursed lips."
"""And that was the reason of your parting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""The sole reason?"""
"""The sole reason."""
"""And you have no suspicion that she may have committed suicide because"
"of her love for you?  Such things are not uncommon, remember, with girls"
"of a certain temperament."""
"""If she has committed suicide, it is not on my account,"" I responded in"
a hard voice.
"""I do not interfere in the councils of the Gitano,"" she cried; ""I am"
"old, but not old enough to desire death!"""
"But more grim and lack-lustre than ever, the face of Sergeant Cardono"
"was turned upon her, and more starrily twinkled the sloe-like eyes"
"(diamonds set in Cordovan leather) as he replied:--""The councils of the"
"Rom are as an open book to me. If they are life, they are life because I"
"will it; if death, then I will the death!"""
The old gipsy stared incredulously.
"""Long have I lived,"" she said, staring hard at the sergeant, ""much have"
"I seen, both of gipsy and Gorgio; but never have I seen or heard of the"
"man who could both make that boast, and make it good!"""
She appeared to consider a moment.
"""Save one,"" she added, ""and he is dead!"""
"""How did he die?"" said the Sergeant, his tanned visage like a mask, but"
never removing his eyes from her face.
"""By the _garrote_"" she answered, in a hushed whisper. ""I saw him die."""
"""Where?"""
"""In the great _plaza_ of Salamanca,"" she said, her eyes fixed in a stare"
"of regretful remembrance. ""It was filled from side to side, and the"
"balconies were peopled as for a bull-fight. Ah, he was a man!"""
"""His name?"""

"She rushed from the room and down the stairs, in terrible anxiety lest"
"he should have already left the hotel. To her intense relief, she saw"
him sitting in one of the cane chairs in the vestibule smoking his
after-lunch cigar. He threw it away as he caught sight of her at the
"head of the stairs, breathless, and holding the balusters, and went up"
to meet her.
"“My poor child,” said he in an anxious tone. “What is the matter?”"
"“Oh, Everard--I don’t want any more to be left alone. Don’t think me"

“And Madrid?”

“And in Rome what do you find?”
"“Here one finds a mixture of pornography, romanticism, and politics."
"A heart pierced by an arrow and poetic phrases, alternate with some"
enormous piece of filthiness and with hurrahs for Anarchy or for the

“Well done!” said Kennedy; “I can see that the branch of epigraphy you
practise amounts to something. It should be systematized and given a
name.”
“What do you think we should name it? Wallography?”
“Very good.”
“And one of these fine days we can systematize it. Now we might go and
get dinner.”

"in mine.  ""But I have been thinking to-day--thinking ever so much."""

The finding of the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of

Acquitted                                 74
Executed                                  52

"A number of the prisoners signed a ""humble petition"" begging that, as"
"they, being ""unhappily and unwisely drawn into that wretched and"
"detestable Crime of Piracy,"" they might be permitted to serve in the Royal"
"African Company in the country for seven years, in remission of their"
"crimes. This clemency was granted to twenty of the prisoners, of which"
Scot was one.
“Do you go in for modern epigraphy?” asked Kennedy.
"“Yes. It is one of the things I take pleasure in reading, in the towns"
I go to; the advertisements in the newspapers and the writings on the
wall.”
“It’s a good kind of curiosity.”
"“Yes, I believe one learns more about the real life in a town from such"
inscriptions than from the guide- and text-books.”
“That’s possible. And what conclusions have you drawn from your
observations?”
“They are not of much value. I haven’t constructed a science of
"wall-inscriptions, as that fake Lambroso would have done.”"
"“But you will construct it surely, when you have lighted on the"
underlying system.”
“You think my epigraphical science is on the same level as my financial
science. What a mistake!”
“All right. But tell me what you have discovered about different towns.”
"“London, for instance, I have found, is childish in its inscriptions and"
somewhat clownish. When some sentimental foolishness doesn’t occur to a
"Londoner of the people, some brutality or rough joke occurs to him.”"
"“You are very kind,” said Kennedy, laughing."
"“Paris has a vulgar, cruel taste; in the Frenchman of the people you"
Pangbutt’s handsome studio had been cleared for a reception; and the
"deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors, walked"
stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye round the brilliantly
lighted details in a last complacent survey before the near arrival of
the guests.
"He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his watch:"
“I hope they are arriving early enough!” said he. “It comes of arsking
these here artists to the house.... They’re always hungry and they’re
"always noisy, and they’re always thirsty. Even if I suffered from these"
here afflictions I’d have the manners not to show it.” He shrugged his
shoulders. “I call it letting ourselves down. They don’t even know how
to put on their clothes like Christians.”
"He straddled stiffly out of the room, grumbling and mumbling."
"“Leastwise not like Christians of the Established Church,” he"
growled....
He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome
"doorway, ushering in four guests."
"When they had entered, he said stiffly:"
"“Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes, gentlemen;"
he has only just come in to dress.”
"He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it aggressively."
"“How long since you left the camp?” Ned asked, after Jimmie had"
introduced the two.
"“Perhaps half an hour ago,” was the answer. “When I went to sleep, the"
"boys were sitting by the fire, but when I woke there was no one in"
sight. I came out to look for them.”
“I understand you came on a mission for Jack Bosworth’s father?” asked
Ned after a pause.
"“Yes,” was the reply, “at the request of my employer I came on this most"
dangerous mission. I shall be glad to see New York again.”
Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:
“Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you about a set of documents he
wished us to bring to light?”
"“He did not,” was the answer."
"“His purpose in sending you, then, was to secure, by means of our help,"
proof connecting a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts which
have been or may be committed in this section?”
“That is exactly the idea!” answered Gilroy.
"“Come on,” Jimmie shouted, “let’s get back to camp. I begin to feel"
hungry already. Perhaps the boys have returned.”
Before Gilroy would move out of the forest he insisted on pinning up
certain rents in his clothing and combing out his mussed up hair with
"his fingers. There were also numerous scratches on his face, caused by"
"""Yolande--Yolande!""  I called, touching her cheek in an effort to awaken"
"her, for I could not believe that she was actually dead."
But there was no response.  Those blanched lips and the coldness of
those cheeks told their own tale.  She had passed to that land which
lies beyond the range of human vision.
How long I stood there I cannot tell.  My thoughts were inexpressibly
"sad ones, and the discovery had utterly upset me, so that I scarcely"
knew what I said or did.  The blow of thus finding her lifeless crushed
"me.  The affair was mysterious, to say the least of it.  Of a sudden,"
"however, the sobs of the grief-stricken Countess aroused me to a sense"
"of my responsibility, and taking her hand I led her from the bedside"
into an adjoining room.
"""How has this terrible catastrophe occurred?""  I demanded of her"
"breathlessly.  ""Only two hours ago she was well and happy."""
"""You mean when you saw her?"" she said.  ""What was the object of your"
"call?"""
"""To see her,"" I responded."
"""And yet you parted ill friends in Brussels?"" she observed in a tone of"
"distinct suspicion.  ""You had some motive in calling.  What was it?"""
I hesitated.  I could not tell her that I suspected her daughter to be a
spy.
"""In order to assure her of my continued good friendship."""
"While walking from the Bridge to the Old Swan, I remarked to Frances, ""My"
"engagement with Mary Hamilton is likely to be broken by her family."""
"""Why, Baron Ned?"" she asked in surprise."
"""Count Hamilton has challenged me to a duel, to be fought when he"
"returns, and you see, if I kill him or if he kills me, well--"" I"
"answered, shrugging my shoulders."
"She was much alarmed at my disclosure, but was reassured when I made"
"light of the affair, probably because there was no danger in it to George"
"Hamilton, and, perhaps, because if I should kill Count Hamilton, George"
would inherit the title and estates.
"""But poor Mary! She will grieve,"" said Frances."
"""I think you need waste no tears for her sake,"" I answered. ""She is a"
"fine, pretty little creature, who will take what comes her way without"
excess of pain or joy. She is incapable of feeling keenly. God has been
"good to her in giving her numbness."""
"""No, no, cousin Ned, you are wrong!"" she returned. ""Life without pain"
"is not worth living. I have heard that the Arabs have a saying, 'All"
sunshine makes the desert.' God is good to us when he darkens the sun
"now and then and gives us the sunshine afterwards."""
"""Perhaps you are right, Frances,"" I returned. ""But you and I are in the"
"cloud now, and a little sunshine would be most welcome."""
"""Not enough sunshine to make a desert,"" she answered."

"""Say, Girl, was your answer final to-night about marrying me?"""
Without turning round the Girl answered coyly:
"""I might think it over, Jack."""
"Instantly the man's passion was aroused. He strode over to her, put his"
arms around her and kissed her forcibly.
"""I love you, I love you, Minnie!"" he cried passionately."
"In the struggle that followed, the Girl's eyes fell on the bottle on the"
mantel. With a cry she seized it and raised it threateningly over her
"head. Another second, however, she sank down upon a chair and began to"
"sob, her face buried in her hands."
"Rance regarded her coldly; at last he gave vent to a mirthless laugh,"
the nasty laugh of a man whose vanity is hurt.
"""So, it's as bad as that,"" he sneered. ""I didn't quite realise it. I'm"
"much obliged to you. Good-night."" He snatched up his coat, hesitated,"
"then repeated a little less angrily than before: ""Good-night!"""
"But the Girl, with her face still hidden, made no answer. For a moment"
"he watched the crouching form, the quivering shoulders, then asked, with"
sudden and unwonted gentleness:
"""Can't you say good-night to me, Girl!"""
"Slowly the Girl rose to her feet and faced him, aversion and pity"
"struggling for mastery. Then, as she noted the spot where he was now"
"""I suppose so."""
"""And the way I phrased it. I actually said I'd bought the lower right"
"hand drawer and hadn't used it--take me with you, Frank."""
"""Rhoda, I was so wrong in--"""
"""_I_ was wrong, Frank. I was trying to mold you into my way of life. I"
"wanted you, but only as a part of my own eager little world. I had money"
"so I furnished my apartment. I put this here and that there, and hung a"
"toothbrush over the sink as necessarily functional, and then I decided I"
needed a man in the same way and so I picked you.
"""But I found out that the man in the bed was the most important part of"
it and without him there wasn't anything. Without him I didn't want any
of the other. Now ... I want to be a wife. A wife is a person who goes
where her husband goes and lives where he lives and shares what he has.
You don't barter and trade--this for that--give up this part to get
that. You give up everything and yet it isn't like that at all because
"you're really getting everything."""
He took out another cigarette.
"""Oh, Frank, it's all mixed up and I'm going to cry, I think."""
"""It's not mixed up at all,"" he said quietly. He turned to look at her,"
"half frowning, half smiling. ""Now why in the hell couldn't you have"
given me a little notice? Twenty minutes to plane time and I've got to
"get another reservation."""
"""I'm sorry, Frank."""
he speaks with La Giralda in a tongue which neither I nor Don Rollo
"understand."""
"""But I thought,"" said El Sarria, astonished for the first time, ""that"
both you and Don Rollo understood the crabbed gipsy tongue! Have I not
"heard you speak it together?"""
"""As it is commonly spoken--yes,"" she replied, ""we have talked many a"
time for sport. But this which is spoken by the Sergeant and La Giralda
"is deep Romany, the like of which not half a dozen in Spain understand."
"It is the old-world speech of the Rom, before it became contaminated by"
"the jargon of fairs and the slang of the travelling horse-clipper."""
"""Then,"" said El Sarria, slowly, ""it comes to this--'tis you and not I"
"who mistrust these two?"""
"""No, that I do not,"" cried Concha, emphatically; ""I have tried La"
"Giralda for many years and at all times found her faithful, so that her"
bread be well buttered and a draught of good wine placed alongside it.
"But the Sergeant is a strong man and a secret man----"""
"""Well worth the watching, then?"" said El Sarria, looking her full in the"
face.
Concha nodded.
"""Carlist or no, he works for his own hand,"" she said simply."
"""Shall ye mention the matter to Don Rollo?"" asked El Sarria."
"""Nay--what good?"" said Concha, quickly; ""Don Rollo is brave as a bull of"
"Jaen, but as rash. You and I will keep our eyes open and say nothing."
He has taken his staff for the Pilgrim's way.
"His sandals are girt on his tender feet,"
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.
"What will you give to him, Fate Divine?"
What for his scrip on the winding road?
"A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?"
"A sword to wield, or is gold his load?"
What will you give him for weal or woe?
What for the journey through day and night?
"Give or withhold from him power and fame,"
But give to him love of the earth's delight.
Let him be lover of wind and sun
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;
"With a singing heart for the pride of noon,"
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.
Let him be lover of you and yours--
"The Child and Mary; but also Pan,"
"And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,"
And the god that is hid in his fellow-man.
"Love and a song and the joy of earth,"
These be the gifts for his scrip to keep
"Till, the journey ended, he stands at last"
"In the gathering dark, at the gate of sleep."
_Ethel Clifford._
And so our stories should contain all the essentials for the child's
"scrip on the road of life, providing the essentials and holding or"
take pleasure in restoring your rings.”
"She took from her handkerchief a beautiful little casket of blue onyx,"
"upon which reposed the Pendleton crest in diamonds, touched a spring,"
and revealed four rings sparkling about as many velvet cushions. The
four men stood speechless; not one dared protest his sincerity and see
ridicule in the eyes of his neighbour.
"Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial air, and taking the ruby between her"
"fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing a prize."
"“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe this belongs to you;” and she handed"
the ring to the stupefied author. He put it in his pocket with never a
word.
"She raised the emerald. “Mr. Trent, this is yours?—or is it the"
sapphire?”
"[Illustration: “‘WELL, WHY DON’T YOU GO?’”]"
"“The emerald,” snorted Trent."
"She dropped it in his nerveless palm with a gracious bend of the head,"
and turned to Teddy.
"“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,” she said sweetly. “A most"
"appropriate gift, for it is the ideal life.”"
"Teddy looked as if about to burst into tears, gave her one beseeching"
"glance, then took his ring and strode feebly over the cliffs. Trent and"
"Boswell hesitated a moment, then hurried after."
"has the time. Then one evening someone finds him reading under a lamppost,"
"stops suddenly and stares, takes a few steps toward him, and bends"
forward searchingly.
"""Isn't it--? Oh, no, excuse me, I thought--"""
"""Yes, it is. Good evening, Miss Torsen."""
"""Why, good evening. I thought it looked like you. Good evening. Yes, thank"
"you, very well. And thanks for the knapsack; I understood all at once--I"
"quite understand--"""
"""Do you live here? What a strange coincidence!"""
"""Yes, I live here; those are my windows. You wouldn't like to come up,"
"would you? No, perhaps you wouldn't."""
"""But I know where there are some benches down by the shore. Unless you're"
"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""
"We went down to a bench, looking like a father and daughter out walking."
"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.
"Then she told me first the short chapter of her journey home, some of it"
"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"
"deeply bowed, sometimes, when I asked a question, replying by a brief word"
or a shake of the head. I write it down from memory; it was important to
"her, and it became important for others as well."
"""Waynsford, by Jove!"" ejaculated Terence. ""Bless you, Dick, I never"
"expected to see you here and in this rig. What has happened?"""
"""Oh, I chucked the Motor Boat Reserve,"" declared Waynsford. ""It was a"
"bit too dull. They sent me to Southampton, and that was the limit. A"
"superannuated postman could have done my job, which was delivering"
letters to transports. So I applied for the Naval Air Service. It's
"more in my line."""
"""Been across yet?"" asked Terence, indicating the twenty odd mile"
strip of water that separated Great Britain from the scene of land
hostilities.
"""Dunkirk twice,"" replied Waynsford. ""Was there when the Germans"
started shelling the place. But we're off again early to-morrow
"morning."""
"""Yes, I heard,"" said Aubyn. ""Big operations. We are to engage the"
Zeebrugge and Ostend batteries while the Allied airmen play with the
"German lines of communication. So I may see something of you."""
"""I hope so--after the fun is over,"" replied the young airman. ""Well,"
I must be moving. Early hours and a good night's rest are essential
"to this sort of work."""
"The two friends parted, Terence making for the hotel, while Waynsford"
"walked off in the direction of the castle, in which the airmen"
detailed for the great raid were temporarily quartered.
Precisely at one hour before sunrise the first British waterplane
rose from the surface of Dover Harbour. Almost simultaneously an Army
"aeroplane ""kicked off"" from the sloping ground beyond the chalk"
"3° Edith CAVELL, directrice d'un institut médical à"
Bruxelles;
"4° Louis SEVERIN, pharmacien à Bruxelles;"
"5° Comtesse JEANNE DE BELLEVILLE, à Montignies."
À LA PEINE DE MORT
*       *       *       *       *
Vivie then went on to read with eyes that could hardly take in the
words a list of other names of men and women condemned to long terms
of hard labour for the same offence--assisting young Belgians to
"leave the Belgium that was under German occupation. And further,"
"the information that of the five condemned to death, _Philip Bauck_"
and _Edith Cavell_ had already been _executed_.
*       *       *       *       *
The monsters! Oh that von Bissing. How gladly she would die if she
might first have the pleasure of killing him! That pompous old man
"of seventy-one with the blotched face, who had issued orders that"
wherever he passed in his magnificent motor he was to be saluted
"with Eastern servility, who boasted of his ""tender heart,"" so that"
he issued placards about this time punishing severely all who split
the tongues of finches to make them sing better. Edith Cavell--she
did not pause to consider the fate of patriotic Belgian women--but
"Edith Cavell, directress of a nursing home in Brussels, known far"
"and wide for her goodness of heart. She had held aloof from Vivie,"
but was that to be wondered at when there was so much to make her
"suspect--living, seemingly, under the protection of a German"
"week...!"""
"""Das macht nichts. The rooms are wanted and I won't have you on the"
"premises. Off you go, or these soldiers shall take you both round to"
"the Kommandantur."""
"""But our luggage? _Surely_ you will let me go up to our room and"
"pack it--and take it away? We..."""
"""Your luggage has been packed and is in the corridor. If you send"
"round for it, it shall be delivered to your messenger. But you are"
"not to stop on the premises another minute. You understand?"" he"
almost shrieked.
"""But--"""
"For answer, the soldiers took them by the shoulders and whirled"
"them through the revolving door on to the pavement, where a crowd"
"began to collect, as it does in peace or war if you cough twice or"
"sneeze three times in Brussels. ""Englische Hure! Englische"
"Küpplerin,"" shouted the soldiers as they retreated and locked the"
revolving door. Mrs. Warren turned purple and swayed. Vivie caught
her round the waist with her strong arm.... Thus was Mrs. Warren
ejected from the once homely inn which she had converted by her
"energy, management and capital into the second most magnificent"
hostelry of Brussels; thus was Vivie expelled from the place of her
birth....
Hearing the shouting and seeing the crowd a Belgian gendarme came
"up. To him Vivie said, ""Si vous êtes Chrétien et pas Allemand--"""
"""Prenez garde, Madame,"" he said warningly--""Vous m'aiderez à porter"
"ma mère à quelqu' endroit ou elle peut se remettre..."""
"""It ain't,"" said the crew suspiciously."
"""And even if it's all right, we bein' strangers might be led into"
makin' a treaty without knowin' all there is to know.  I vote waitin'
"till the officers comes up."""
They squatted down on rocks and on the lumps of tussac grass till the
captain and the two mates came along with the rest of the Frenchmen.
"Hart communicated his suspicions to the skipper, who was decidedly"
under the influence of alcohol.
"""That's all right,"" said the Guffin thickly.  ""_We_ can manage"
Frenchmen.  They ain't goin' to make no French Shore question on no
more of our islands.  One Newfoundland's enough for me.  I'll show
"you n'gotiations--'gotiashuns is my forte!""  And he led the way over"
the hill.  Below them they saw the wreck of a French barquantine.
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, with a frown, ""if they 'aven't got the best"
"part of our hisland!"""
"It was not to be endured by any lot of Englishmen under the sun, that"
"the best part of this rock should be occupied by their natural foes,"
and soon there was evidence that in any attempt to turn the Frenchmen
out the British leader would have a united nation at his back.
"The Guffin and the two mates argued it, and Lampert was the"
Opposition.
"""W'y, wot's this you're sayin'?"" asked the disgusted skipper; ""did I"
think to 'ave shipped a Verning 'Arcourt among my lot?  You're a
"Little Englander, and nothin' but it, Lampert."""
"trumpet brayed, though a host had scattered in search of a woman's"
face.
"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"
"out!"""
Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.
"The Frenchmen ""jabbered"" a bit among themselves."
"""Quoi donc?  Marcher?"" asked their skipper."
"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"
quit.  We gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do you
"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.
"""Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"" he bellowed.  ""What's"
their captain say to the _statues quo_?  Don't they know the first
thing about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare for peace we makes
"war."""
"""War it is,"" said Hart, and he launched himself at a crowd of"
"Frenchmen, as his mates came tumbling down the hill."
"The fight was short, sharp, and pretty decisive, for the _Potluck's_"
"crowd numbered ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two boys, or"
"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"Dawson came back after a few minutes, picked up another cigar from"
"Cary's box, and sat down. ""You see, I have a letter from him. I found"
"it in his quarters where I went straight from the _Malplaquet_."""
"""May we read it?"" I asked gently. ""I was greatly taken with Trehayne"
"myself. He was a clean, beautiful boy. He was an enemy officer on"
"Secret Service; there is no dishonour in that. If he were alive, I"
could shake his hand as the officer of the firing party shook the hand
"of Lody before he gave the last order."""
"Dawson took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to me. ""Read it"
"out,"" said he; ""I can't."""
CHAPTER VIII
TREHAYNE'S LETTER
I took the letter from Dawson and glanced through it. The first sheet
and the last had been written very recently--just before the boy had
left his quarters for the last time to go on board the _Malplaquet_;
the remainder had been set down at various times; and the whole had
"been connected up, put together, and paged after the completion of the"
"last sheet. Trehayne wrote a pretty hand, firm and clear, the writing"
of an artist who was also a trained engineer. There was no trace in
the script of nervousness or of hesitation. He had carried out his
"Orders, he saw clearly that the path which he had trod was leading him"
"to the end of his journey, but he made no complaint. He was a Latin,"
He opened a drawer of his desk and reached for the Scotch bottle.
*       *       *       *       *
At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his
suitcase.
"She wore a plain, black suit with a ridiculous little black hat and she"
was so beautiful he was angry with her. He hated her. This good-bye
wasn't necessary. Why had she come?
"""You need not assure me of that,"" I answered, taking Betty's hand. ""I"
"already know it. I am glad you--"""
"But here I was interrupted by a soft cry from Bettina, and by a"
"half-smothered scream from Frances, both of whom deserted me suddenly"
"and ran toward the door I had just entered. Turning, I saw Frances with"
"her arms about the Abbé's neck, and Bettina clasping one of his hands."
"I thought the two had gone mad, but when Bettina saw my look of surprise"
"and inquiry, she dropped his hand, came to me, and asked:--"
"""Did you want us to pretend that we did not know him? If so, you should"
"have told us."""
"""But you don't know him,"" I declared."
"""Perhaps I don't,"" she returned, laughing softly and shrugging her"
"shoulders, ""but evidently your cousin does. If not, she should take her"
"arms from around his neck."""
"""But she is mistaken,"" I insisted."
"""She seems to be convinced,"" answered Bettina, with a curious little"
"glance up to me, half laughing, half inquiring. Evidently she was"
doubtful whether I spoke in jest or in earnest.
"Frances still clung to the Abbé, her head resting on his shoulder, so I"
"started toward her, intending to correct her mistake. Bettina, seeing my"
"purpose, caught me by the arm, saying:--"
"""Don't you really know?"""
"The Abbé turned his face toward me, and when I caught a glimpse of his"
"hand to Craig, she added, “Mr. Kennedy, if there is anything I can do"
"to help you, I beg that you will call on me.”"
"“I shall not forget,” he answered, relinquishing the hand reluctantly."
"Then, as she thanked him, and turned again to her guest, he added in a"
"low tone to me, “A remarkable girl, Walter, a girl that can be depended"
on.”
We followed Miss Sears down the hall.
"“Who was that young man in the music room?” asked Kennedy, when we were"
out of earshot.
"“Duncan Baldwin,” she answered. “A friend and bosom companion of"
Reginald.”
"“He seems to think more of Betty than of her brother,” Craig remarked"
dryly.
"Miss Sears smiled. “Sometimes, we think they are secretly engaged,” she"
"returned. We had almost reached the door. “By the way,” she asked"
"anxiously, “do you think there are any precautions that I should take"
for Mrs. Blake—and the rest?”
"“Hardly,” answered Kennedy, after a moment’s consideration, “as long as"
"you have taken none in particular already. Still, I suppose it will do"
no harm to be as antiseptic as possible.”
"“I shall try,” she promised, her face showing that she considered the"
affair now in a much more serious light than she had before our visit.
"“And keep me informed of anything that turns up,” added Kennedy handing"
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?
"girl's getting on. She's dependent upon her own labor."" As she spoke"
she spread out the sheet. A sketch dropped to the table.
Trude drew a long breath. She had not known how worried she was. She
wanted to laugh aloud now from sheer relief. Because she had to do
"something she took up the sketch with a murmured: ""May I?"""
"""Laura writes it's a little sketch she made in class. 'This will show"
you I am improving. It's from life. It will give you an idea of the
"delightful types we find around here, types that you will not find"
anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds whom you see almost
anytime on the beach or around the wharves--as wild and free and
"beautiful as the seagulls--'"""
Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take the sketch and exclaimed
aloud at Trude's face. It had gone deathly white.
"""My _dear_, what is it?"""
For a moment Trude could not answer. She was staring at the sketch as
though she could not take her eyes from it.
"""Read that again! These are types--you find these girls any time on the"
"wharves--wild--vagabonds! Oh, Aunt Edith that's--_that's_--_Sidney_!"""
"""Why, it _can't_ be, Trude. You said--"""
"Trude shook her head. ""I can't help what I said. It's Sidney. I--know."
The likeness is true--there can't be anyone else who looks like Sidney!
But she's barefooted--and--and so--_slovenly_--and--_her hair_! She's
"cut her beautiful hair!"""
"in it, to check up on the disappearance of the first. That ship, too,"
never came back. Almost with the second of its arrival at the edge of
the red area all radio communication with it was cut off. It was never
heard from again. Two weeks ago I sent Journeyman there. Now _he_ has
"been swallowed up in a mysterious silence."""
An exclamation burst from Brand's lips. Sub-Commander Journeyman!
"Senior officer under Stone, ablest man in the expeditionary forces,"
and Brand's oldest friend!
"Stone nodded comprehension of the stricken look on Brand's face. ""I"
"know how friendly you two were,"" he said soberly. ""That's why I chose"
"you to go and find out, if you can, what happened to him and the other"
"two ships."""
Brand's chin sank to rest on the stiff high collar of his uniform.
"""Journeyman!"" he mused. ""Why, he was like an older brother to me. And"
"now ... he's gone."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was silence in Commander Stone's sanctum for a time. Then Brand
raised his head.
"""Did you have any radio reports at all from any of the three ships"
"concerning the nature of the red spot?"" he inquired."
"""None that gave definite information,"" replied Stone. ""From each of"
the three ships we received reports right up to the instant when the
red area was approached. From each of the three came a vague
description of the peculiarity of the ground ahead of them: it seems
"Yes, they were all satisfied. The Lieutenant pronounced it ""blendend"""
(dazzling). They had not eaten so much and such good food for months and
"months. Oh it was good to be out of the fighting. Yes, their treatment"
was perfect--except for the thieving. Why were British soldiers allowed
"to steal the buttons, caps, rings, and watches belonging to their"
prisoners?
"A German private, a tall thin man with bushy eyebrows, who had not"
"spoken hitherto, said he didn't mind losing a few buttons--but to rob a"
"man of his marriage ring, that was very mean--eine Gemeinheit--his"
marriage ring had been taken from him: he would have lost anything
"rather than that, for it always reminded him of home."
The boy from East Prussia said he didn't care what they took from him as
long as they didn't take his life. He was safe now and nothing else
mattered. He spoke with a Polish accent.
I asked him what town he came from.
"""Allenstein."""
"""Did you see anything of the Russians in 1914?"""
"""Jawohl""--he had seen plenty of Russian troops. They behaved very well."
"""Die sind besser als die Deutschen--They're better than the Germans...."""
"But the theatre orderly interrupted us and asked us to ""send two or"
"three across."""
I went to the Prep. to see if there were any new arrivals. It was full
once again and the wounded were streaming into the station.
"I nodded ‘That will do’ to the twain, and dismissed them; and, they"
"being dismissed, I whistled long."
Naughty old gentleman!...
The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed. Evening stole
on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors of the address in St.
John’s Wood from mine hansom cab.
"I must preach the decencies; thus I, strengthening the intention as I"
rang.
"‘Sir Pompey Malahide is here,’ said I sternly to the smart maid that"
opened the door.
"‘Yes, sir,’ said she."
"‘I desire to see my father,’ said I, and marched boldly towards the"
furious racket that filled the room near at hand--the paternal roar
"distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried small coal."
I flung open the door--burst upon the riot----
On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three children
"rolling over him--three, no less!--another in his arms--Sir Pompey"
"Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a she-bear, his"
"coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his teeth, and"
growling like an ass in pain--and seated on the immaculate waistcoat of
the dark mysterious Bartholomew the most beautiful young woman I have
ever seen. The din infernal--and Pa the worst part of the din.
was lying.  As we entered she lifted her hand slowly to me in sign of
"recognition, and in an instant I was at her side."
"""Yolande!""  I cried, taking her hand, so different now that death had"
"been defeated by life.  ""Yolande! my darling,"" I burst forth"
"involuntarily, ""you have come back to me!"""
"A sweet, glad smile spread over her beautiful face, leaving an"
"expression of calm and perfect contentment, as in a low, uncertain"
"voice, as though of one speaking afar off, she asked:"
"""Gerald, is it actually you?"""
"""Yes,"" I said, ""of course it is.  These two gentlemen are doctors,"" I"
"added.  ""This is my old friend Deane; and the other is Doctor Trepard,"
"of whom I daresay you have heard."""
She nodded to them both in acknowledgment of their kind expressions;
then in a few low words inquired what had happened to her.  She seemed
in utter ignorance of it all.
"""You were found lying on the floor of the little salon soon after I"
"left, and they thought you were dead,"" I explained.  ""Cannot you tell us"
"how it occurred?"""
"A puzzled expression settled upon her face, as though she were trying to"
remember.
"""I recollect nothing,"" she declared."
"""But you surely remember how you were attacked?""  I urged."
"“Phoebe,” she said, when the angular and jilted maid appeared, “we are"
"going to keep house for my nephew, Mr. Risca, and a young lady whom"
he has adopted. Will you tell me one thing? Is the lady of the house
supposed to clean the gentlemen's pipes?”
"“My father is a non-smoker, as well as a teetotaler, miss,” replied"
Phoebe.
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Lindon. “It's going to be a great puzzle.”
CHAPTER VII
"IT was a puzzle to John as much as to the palpitating lady, and in the"
maze of his puzzledom the gleam of humour that visited him during
"their interview lost its way. Walter Herold's eyes, however, twinkled"
maliciously when he heard John's account at once rueful and pig-headed.
Then he grew serious.
“It will be comic opera all the time. It can't be done.”
"“It 's going to be done,” said John, obstinately. “There's nothing else"
"to do. If I were a rich man, I could work wonders with a scratch in my"
cheque-book. I could hire an unexceptionable colonel's or clergyman's
widow to do the business. But I'm not. How I'm going to get the house

"suddenly, and raise his night-glasses; Boyd laid his hand on Cherry's"
arm. Presently the Captain crossed to them and said:
"""Yonder seems to be a launch making out. See? I wonder what's up."""
"Almost in their path a tiny light was violently agitated. ""By Jove!"
"They're signalling."""
"""You won't stop, will you?"" questioned Emerson."
"""I don't know, I am sure. I may have to."""
"The two boats were drawing together rapidly, and soon those on the"
bridge heard the faint but increasing patter of a gasoline exhaust.
"Carrying the same speed as _The Bedford Castle_, the launch shortly"
came within hailing distance. The cyclopean eye of the ship's
"searchlight blazed up, and the next instant, out from the gloom leaped"
"a little craft, on the deck of which a man stood waving a lantern. She"
"held steadfastly to her course, and a voice floated up to them:"
"""Ahoy! What ship?"""
"""_The Bedford Castle_, cannery-tender for Bristol Bay,"" Peasley shouted"
back.
"The man on the launch relinquished his lantern, and using both palms"
"for a funnel, cried, more clearly now: ""Heave to! We want to come"
"aboard."""

"The window at which I had seen Marie was farthest from the door, on"

perhaps for that reason I stood the longer. At last I went and
"knocked, and waited in a fever for some one to come. The street was a"
thoroughfare. There were a number of people passing. I thought that
all the town would go by before a dragging foot at last sounded
"inside, and the great nail-studded door was opened on the chain. A"
"stout, red-faced woman showed herself in the aperture."
'What is it?' she asked.
"'You have a girl in this house, named Marie Wort,' I answered"
"breathlessly. 'I saw her a moment ago at the window. I know her, and I"
wish to speak to her.'
The woman's little eyes dwelt on me stolidly for a space. Then she
made as if she would shut the door. 'For shame!' she said spitefully.
'We have no girls here. Begone with you!'
But I put my foot against the door. 'Whose house is this?' I said.

'Is he at home?'
"'No, he is not,' she retorted; 'and if he were, we have no baggages"
of pure knowledge and Christian meekness in a near future speaks from
the preface of Erasmus's edition of the New Testament.
How clear did the future look in those years! In this period Erasmus
"repeatedly reverts to the glad motif of a golden age, which is on the"
point of dawning. Perennial peace is before the door. The highest
"princes of the world, Francis I of France, Charles, King of Spain, Henry"
"VIII of England, and the emperor Maximilian have ensured peace by the"
strongest ties. Uprightness and Christian piety will flourish together
with the revival of letters and the sciences. As at a given signal the
mightiest minds conspire to restore a high standard of culture. We may
"congratulate the age, it will be a golden one."
But Erasmus does not sound this note long. It is heard for the last time
in 1519; after which the dream of universal happiness about to dawn
gives place to the usual complaint about the badness of the times
everywhere.

ERASMUS'S MIND
Thursday 2:34 P.M.
Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like plucking
"of a Japanese _koto_, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime."
"Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured"
"surface. It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the"
weave he knew it was _tatami_. Then he felt the soft cotton of the
padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in
the room was faintly spiced with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.
"I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think I am."
He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper lamp on
"the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a"
"_tokonoma _art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small,"
round _shoji_ window in the _tokonoma  _shed a mysterious glow on its
"hanging scroll, the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a"
shallow stream.
Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors
"with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped that it"
"was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation."
Jesus!
"He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember"
"what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . ."
"the flagship and ask instructions. I'm feeling deucedly queer."""
"""Why, you're wounded!"" exclaimed the sub-lieutenant, noticing a dark"
and increasing patch upon Aubyn's coat.
"""Am I?"" asked Terence incredulously."
"Turning his head to ascertain the nature of his injury, of which"
"hitherto he was unconscious, his shoulder slipped along the curved"
steel wall. Garboard was only just in time to save him from
collapsing inertly upon the deck of the ship he had brought safely
out of action.
"""Congratulations, old man. You'll have to get your tailor to make"
"some alteration in your uniform."""
"""What do you mean?"" asked Terence."
Two months had elapsed since the day on which Lieutenant Aubyn had
received a dangerous wound in his right side in the fight off Ostend.
"He was sitting in the grounds of the Royal Naval Hospital at Chatham,"
having made a fairly rapid recovery.
"The officer who offered his congratulations was Oswestry, the"
"torpedo-lieutenant of the ""Sunderland,"" who was also a convalescent,"
having managed to intercept a flying fragment of metal during the
momentous engagement.

John Dennis showed human surprise as Frank Corson lunged at him. He had
"either been lax in using the controlling power he'd been given, or else"
Frank Corson had an exceptional resistance.
"Dennis released Rhoda, swayed drunkenly under Frank Corson's clumsy"
"football-type tackle, and swung his arm like a pivoting beam. The blow"
"was a lucky one. His fist smashed low on Corson's jaw, numbing the"
nerves of his neck on the left side.
"Corson went down and, as he lay helpless, Dennis kicked him twice--once"
"in the side and once, viciously effectively, in the head. Corson rolled"
over and lay still.
"Dennis looked down at him in a drunken daze. ""They will make an army and"
"bring it here."""
"Rhoda, standing in the center of an emotional maelstrom, watched the"
struggle from the prison of her own horror. At that moment she was
"physically, mentally and spiritually ill; a human being caught in the"
midst of forces beyond her knowledge and control.
"Dennis laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""I want to make love."""
"""No--no. Please--"""
The drunkenness ebbed slightly and his eyes emptied. They looked into
Rhoda's. She shivered. He took the neck of her brunch coat in his fist
and jerked downward. She had just come from the shower when she'd first
"opened the door for Frank Corson, and the vicious denuding gesture left"

"""Ours was a foolish infatuation,"" she answered with an effort.  ""It is"
"best that we should both of us forget."""
"""Forget!""  I cried.  ""But I can never forget you, Yolande.  You are my"
"love.  You are all the world to me."""
"Her eyes were grave, and I saw that tears stood in them."
"""No,"" she protested quietly; ""do not say that.  I cannot be any more to"
"you than other women whom you meet daily.  Besides, I know well that in"
the diplomatic service marriage is a serious drawback to any save an
"ambassador."""
"""When a man is in love as I am with you, dearest, he throws all thoughts"
of his career to the winds; personal interests are naught where true
"love is concerned."""
"""You must not--nay, you shall not--wreck your future on my account,"" she"
"declared in a low, intense voice.  ""It is not just either to yourself or"
"to the Englishwoman who loves you."""
"""Why do you taunt me with that, Yolande?""  I asked reproachfully.  ""I do"
not love her.  I have never truly loved her.  I was lonely after you had
"gone out of my life, and she was amusing,--that was all."""
"""And now you find me equally amusing--eh?"" she remarked, with just a"
touch of bitter sarcasm.
"""Why should you be jealous of her?""  I asked.  ""You might just as well"
"be jealous of Sibyl, Lord Barmouth's daughter."""
"""With the latter you are certainly on terms of most intimate"
"He told her--he told her all he knew. She listened, horror-stricken,"
regarding him with open mouth and streaming eyes.
"“And what do you think is my duty?” asked John, abruptly."
Miss Lindon shook her head. “I 'm sure I don't know what to advise
"you, dear. I 'll try to find out some kind Christian people who want a"
servant.”
"“I don't want any kind Christian people at all,” said John. “I'm going"
to make up in ease and happiness for all the wrongs that humanity has
"inflicted on her. I am going to adopt her, educate her, fill her up with"
the good things of life.”
"“That's very fine of you, John,” said Miss Lindon. “Some people are"
as fond of their adopted children as of their own. I remember Miss
"Engleshaw adopted a little child. She was four, if I remember right,"
and she used to dress her so prettily. I used to go and help her choose
frocks. Really they were quite expensive. Now I come to think of
"it, John, I could help you that way with little Unity. I don't think"
gentlemen have much experience in choosing little girls' frocks. How old
is she?”
"“Nearly sixteen,” said John."
"“That's rather old,” said Miss Lindon, from whose mind this new interest"
seemed to have driven the tragic side of the question. “It's a pity you
could n't have begun when she was four.”
"“It is,” said John."
"“Only if you had begun with her at four, you would n't be wanting to"
"Nick rose high above the other sounds of the night, calling,"
"""Min-Minnie-Girl, let us in!"" she hurriedly brushed past him and yelled"
through the door:
"""What do you want?"""
Again Johnson's hand went up imperatively.
"""Don't let him come in!"" he whispered."
"But even then she heard not his warning, but silently, tremulously"
"listened to Sonora, who shouted through the door: ""Say, Girl, you all"
"right?"" And not until her answering voice had called back her assurance"
that she was safe did she turn to the man at her side and whisper in a
voice that showed plainly her agitation and fear:
"""Jack Rance is there! If he was to see you here--he's that jealous I'd"
"be afraid--"" She checked her words and quickly put her ear close to the"
"door, the voices outside having become louder and more distinct."
"Presently she spun round on her heel and announced excitedly: ""Ashby's"
"there, too!"" And again she put her ear to the door."
"""Ashby!"" The exclamation fell from Johnson's lips before he was aware of"
it. It was impossible to deceive himself any longer--the posse had
tracked him!
"""We want to come in, Girl!"" suddenly rang out from the well-known voice"
of Nick.
"""But you can't come in!"" shouted back the Girl above the noise of the"
"storm; then, taking advantage of a particularly loud howl of the blast,"
"she turned to Johnson and inquired: ""What will I say? What reason will I"
the other end of the eyot.
"'I shall sleep,' Steve said drowsily."
"The insects were beginning to hum. The horses stood huddled together,"
swishing their long tails.
'You think they won't track us?' I asked.
"'Certain,' he said. 'There are six hundred yards of mud and water,"
"eel-holes, and willow shoots between us and the road.'"
The Waldgrave assented mechanically; it seemed so to me too. And
"by-and-by, worn out with the night's work, I fell asleep, and slept, I"
"suppose, for a good many hours, with the sun and shade passing slowly"
"across my face, and the bees droning in my ears, and the mellow warmth"
of the summer day soaking into my bones. When I awoke I lay for a time
"revelling in lazy enjoyment. The oily plop of a water-rat, as it dived"
"from a stump, or the scream of a distant jay, alone broke the laden"
silence. I looked at the sun. It lay south-west. It was three o'clock
then.
[Illustration: We were alone.... I whispered in her ear ...]
"A light touch fell on my knee. I started, looked down, and for a"
"moment stared in sleepy wonder. A tiny bunch of blue flowers, such as"
"I could see growing in a dozen places on the edge of the island, lay"
"on it, tied up with a thread of purple silk. I started up on my elbow,"
"and--there, close beside me, with her cheeks full of colour, and the"
"sunshine finding golden threads in her dark hair, sat Marie, toying"
SHADES OF ORSON WELLS' MARTIAN
SCARE STALKS CAPITOL CORRIDORS.
Crane tossed the paper aside listlessly and picked up the second one:
SENATORS VOICE CONCERN FOR SANITY
OF COLLEAGUE
CRANE IN STUNNING TIRADE
WARNS OF SCIENCE-FICTION
DISASTER.
"The third paper featured an internationally syndicated columnist, famous"
for his biting wit:
*       *       *       *       *
Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America
space-conscious. If there was any Madison Avenue thinking behind the
launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast
roomful of newspapermen--the Senator invented a race of creatures called
"androids. These androids, it seems, look exactly like Tom Smith down the"
block except that they'd just as soon cut your throat as not.
We fear the Senator must have been watching the wrong television
"shows--knives yet, ugh!--possibly _Jim Bowie_, because there wasn't a"
ray gun nor a disintegrator in his whole bag of exhibits.
"All in all, it would appear that the project was pointed toward making"
the people Senator Crane-conscious rather than aiming their attention at
"She was not to see me again, for I asked permission of the queen to"
"withdraw, and immediately left the ball."
"While I was crossing the park on my way back to Whitehall, the wind"
moaned and groaned--it did not breathe. The stars did not twinkle--they
glared. The nightingales did not sing--they screamed. And the roses were
odorless. Perhaps all this change to gloom was within me rather than
"without, but it existed just the same, and I went home and to bed, hating"
"all the world save Bettina, whom I vowed for the hundredth time never to"
see again.
"The next day at noon De Grammont came to my closet, where I had waited"
for him all morning.
"""Welcome to you, dear count!"" I cried, leading him by the hand to a"
chair.
"""Perhaps you will not so warmly welcome me,"" he returned, ""when you learn"
"my errand."""
"""I already know your errand, Count Grammont, and it makes you doubly"
"welcome,"" I answered, drawing a chair for myself and sitting down in"
front of him.
"""Ah, that is of good,"" he returned, rubbing his hands. ""You already know"
"the purpose of my visit?"""
"""Yes, I do, my dear count, but any purpose would delight me which brings"
"the pleasure of your company."""
"""Ah, it is said like a civilized man,"" he returned, complimenting"
"It was a grief to Dick to part from his master; but he saw the need, and"
he loved the horse only second to Grey himself.
"""I will do your behest, master.  Nay, I want no money; I have plenty for"
all my needs.  I too have made some modest wealth here in this great
"city. Only tell me where I may find you, and I will be gone, and do what"
"can be done for the poor beast."""
"""You shall always get news of me at Wills’ Coffee House, good Dicon,"""
"was the answer.  ""Where I go and how I live, I know not yet; but I will"
"leave word there for you.  So now, farewell.  I turn a new page in my"
"life from this day forth."""

"Grey Dumaresq, having settled matters with his servant, and adjusted the"
"disarray of his own dress and person, turned towards a group of men who"
"were standing round Lord Sandford, making believe to laugh and jest, but"
showing some vague symptoms of uneasiness as they cast sidelong glances
in the direction of their erstwhile comrade.
"Grey walked straight up to Lord Sandford, and looked him full in the"
eyes.  Did the glance of the other quail ever so little before his?  He
"thought so, but could scarce be certain."
"orientation spin. He rolled to the side, flailing an arm to try and"
"recover his balance, but the room was in rotation, his vision playing"
tricks.
"The one thing he did see was Vera Karanova standing over him, a blurred"
"image his mind tried vainly to correct. Her face was faltering, the"
indistinct outlines of a desert mirage. Was she real or was he merely
dreaming?
". . . Now the room was growing serene, a slow-motion phantasmagoria of"
"pastel colors and soft, muted sounds. He tried to reach out, but there"
"was nothing. Instead he heard faint music, dulcet beckoning tones. The"
"world had entered another dimension, a seamless void. He wanted to be"
"part of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion"
"lifting him up. A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of"
darkness. He heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red
"mist. He was floating, on a journey he had long waited to take, to a"
"place far, far away. . . ."

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Eva. Where was she?
"He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap anese,"
"the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A"
classic.
But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.
The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up and headed
for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized that
the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.
"But across, opposite the _tokonoma_, was another set of sliding doors."
"As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing _tabi_, light"
"cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned"
"_yukata_  robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-"
dressed.
"This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms lay beyond,"
"and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He"
"moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming"
"disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it."
"""Wake up."" He shook her again. ""The party just got moved. Wait'll you"
"get a load of the decor."""
"""What . . ."" She rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes. Then"
she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was appointed
"identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the _tokonoma_"
"different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. ""My God."""
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""
"He started to walk with long strides through the sad, empty streets."
"He went toward the river and met Kennedy, who was coming back, he told"
"him, from the studio of a sculptor friend of his."
“You look like desolation. What has happened to you?”
"“Nothing, but I am in a perfectly hellish humour.”"
“I am melancholy too. It must be the weather. Let’s take a walk.”
"They went along the bank of the Tiber. Full of clay, more turbid than"
"ever, and very high between the white embankments hemming it in, the"
river looked like a big sewer.
“This is not the ‘coeruleus Tibris’ that Virgil speaks of in the
"Aeneld, which presented itself to Aeneas in the form of an ancient man"
"with his head crowned with roses,” said Kennedy."
"“No. This is a horrible river,” Cæsar opined."
"They followed the shore, passed the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the bridge"
with the statues.
"From the embankment, to the right, they could now see narrow lanes, sunk"
"almost below the level of the river. On the other bank a new, white"
edifice towered in the rain.
"They went as far as the Piazza d’Armi, and then came back at nightfall"
to Rome. The rain was gradually ceasing and the sky looked less
threatening. A file of greenish gaslights followed the river-wall and
then crossed over the bridge.
"The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was"
"in for it. ""I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's"
"library,"" I told her in a hurry."
"""No doubt,"" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. ""But"
you aren't going to tell me that you read about _dunging_ in the ship's
library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of
Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible
young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed--this Terran
"Agent--"""
"""Paddlefoot,"" I sneered."
"Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. ""Now that's a term,"" she said"
"carefully, ""that is used only by Venusian riffraff."""
"""They're not!"""
"""Not what?"""
"""Riffraff,"" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the"
time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!
"""They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building"
"Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like"
"Venus."""
"""Does it, now?"" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow"
"a second pair of ears. ""Tell me more."""
"""You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start"
civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid
to make their own law if necessary--with their own guns. That's where
But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he
said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are
"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes

"“Yes, that is true.”"
"“It really is pretty; you seem to see the pallor of the saint’s face,"
"the circles under her eyes, the relaxation of all her muscles. Then the"
angel is a little joker who stands there smiling at the ecstasy of the

"“Yes, that’s true,” said Kennedy; “it is all the more admirable for the"
"very reason that it is tender, sensual, and charming, all at once.”"
"“However, this sort of thing is not healthy,” murmured Cæsar, “this"
kind of vision depletes your life-force. One wants to find the same

"""Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just"

the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers

He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were
bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just
about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.
He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the
first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I
told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood
listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked
"disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World"

"The manufacturer stayed with us for the promised three days, and then made"
ready to travel again. His mood never changed; he was contented and
entertaining the whole time. Every evening one whisky and soda was brought
"him--no more. Before their bedtime, his little girls had a wildly"
hilarious half-hour with him. At night a tremendous snoring could be heard
"from his cottage. Before his arrival, the little girls had spent a good"
"deal of time with me, but now they no longer knew I existed, so taken up"
with their father were they. He hung a swing for them between the two
"rowan trees in the field, taking care to pack plenty of rag under the rope"
so as not to injure the tree.
He also had a talk with Paul; there were rumors that he was intending to
"take his money out of the Tore Peak resort. Paul's head was bent now, but"
he seemed even more hurt that the manufacturer should have paid a visit to

"can't; no matter how willing I might be, I can't, I swear to you."

"take you too, and--you'll never come back."

like a captured bird.
a case of a woman of her caliber gone wrong.
“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.
"""And what did they say, Lav? Oh, tell me quick!"""
"""I could only get scraps of it. I didn't dare look, I didn't dare move."
But one fellow called the other Jed. I heard 'em say something about
'risk' and a 'stranger from Boston asking too many questions 'round
"Rockman's to be healthy,' and Jed Starrow--I'm dead sure it was his"
"voice--said, sort of blustering like, 'Let them search the _Puritan_!"
They won't find anything on her _now_!' And the other fellow answered
"him: 'There's too much in this, Jed, to take any chances.' That's what"
"they said, Sid, and then they went on."""
"""Oh, Lav, they're pirates!"""
"""Well, not exactly pirates, but they're up to _something_ that's sure."
Maybe they're rum-runners. There's a lot of that going on. I thought
"you were crazy, but I guess you weren't."""
Sidney's lips trembled with eagerness. As long as Lavender knew what he
knew she felt that she would be justified in telling him what Cap'n
Davies had told her.
"""It isn't rum--Lav,"" she whispered, ""It's _diamonds_!"""
"""Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that stuff?"""
"""It's diamonds, Lav."" Then Sidney solemnly repeated what the old"
"Captain had told her concerning the letter and the reward. ""He asked me"
"not to tell a soul, but you're different because you know. And he said"
that the reward would be posted everywhere in two weeks at least and
"it's that long now. Everyone will know soon."""
"""Sid, five thousand dollars!"" Lavender whistled."
on his chin.
The butler touched him upon his shirt-sleeve in dignified despair:
"“Gentlemen,” said he--“this is not decent. I repeat--it is not honest.”"
"“Go hon!” said Rippley, punching the old man in the ribs with his"
"elbow, and working away at the fixing of his throat-beard. “Look here,"
"Fluffy,” he called hurriedly--“you and Doome _must_ run this pompous"
old dolt downstairs and shoot him into the cellar--and lock him in.
Quick! or the people will be arriving.... I hear carriage-wheels.”
Robbins and Doome seized the shocked old man and hurried his protesting
stiff being out of the room and down the stairs.
"Rippley followed them to the top of the stairs, making up his disguise"
as he went:
"“Look here, boys,” he called down in a hoarse whisper--“if the old"
fool will swear not to move away from the hall door until we release
him you needn’t put him in the cellar.... What?... Eh?... He says he
surrenders? That’s all right then. Now back with you--quick! or the
guests will be here--or Pangbutt himself.”
There was a loud ring at the door-bell.
Rippley skipped back to the cabinet: and from the cabinet he ran to
Andrew Blotte:
"“Blotte, old boy,” said he, pulling a red wig over the gloomy man’s"
head and combing the lank red hair down the sides of his pale
face--“you must look after the cloak-room and change the tickets and
"""Grapple the days to come!"" he said. ""Let Scripture and ethics rot! My"
"men are at your command! Let them ride by stream and forest, moor and"
"mere! Let them ride in quest of your lost one, ride like the wind!"""
Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""
CHAPTER VIII
THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a
and Anti-vivisectionists and Vegetarians and other miserable
"Little-Englanders, denounced him as a Turk, an assassin, a"
"seventeenth-century Spanish _conquistador_ of the bloodiest type, and"
"held him up to popular execration, and recalled him, and put him on a"
beggarly pension years before he had reached his age limit. He could
tell them stories which seemed (and in truth deserved to be) incredible.
"“John,” said Lady Blount, “has heard all this a thousand times,”--as"
"indeed he had,--“and must be sick to death of it. He is not going out to"
Australia as governor-general.”
"“Who said he was, my dear?” said Sir Oliver."
"“If you did n't imply it, you were talking nonsense, Oliver,” Lady"
Blount retorted.
"“Anyhow, Oliver, do you think John is taking a wise step?” Herold"
hastily interposed.
"“I do,” said he; “a very wise step.”"
"“I don't agree with you at all,” said Lady Blount, with a snap of"
finality.
"“Your remark, my dear,” replied Sir Oliver, “does not impress me in the"
least. When did you ever agree with me?”
"“Never, my dear Oliver,” said Lady Blount, with the facial smile of"
the secretly hostile fencer. “And I thank Heaven for it. I may not be a
"brilliant woman, but I am endowed with common sense.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at her for a moment, with lips parted, as if to"
"“Powder,” answered the Canon. “She has been using her puff too freely.”"
"“She has been putting it on with a _muff_,” cried Yvonne."
He laughed. Yvonne had such a triumphant air in delivering herself of
little witticisms.
"A magnificently dressed woman, in a great feathered hat and low-dress,"
"with diamonds gleaming at her neck, passed by. “You are right, I fear,"
"about the two worlds,” said the Canon."
“Are n’t there crowds of them? I like to look at them because they wear
such beautiful things. And they fit so. And then to rub shoulders with
"them makes one feel so delightfully wicked. You know, I knew a girl"
once--she went in for that life of her own accord and she was awfully
happy. Really. Is n’t it odd?”
"“My dear Yvonne!” said the Canon, somewhat shocked, “I sincerely trust"
"you did not continue the acquaintance, afterwards.”"
"“Oh, no,” she replied, sagely. “It would not have done for me at all."
A lone woman can’t be too careful. But I used to hear about her from my
dressmaker.”
Her point of view was not exactly the Canon’s. But further discussion
"was stopped by the arrival of the Wilmingtons, who carried off Yvonne"
"to the dancing-room. The Canon, drawing the line at his own appearance"
"there, strolled back contentedly to the hotel to finish the evening over"
a book.
Two mornings afterwards Yvonne was walking by herself along the _digue_.
"They were to leave for Switzerland the next day, and she determined to"
"""I'll do anything you say,"" promised Pola. ""I'm so curious that I'm"
"fairly bursting."""
"""I don't care, but you'll have to take off your shoes and stockings,"""
"muttered Lav, scarcely looking at Pola."
"""Oh, I'll do that! I'll do _anything_!"" Pola flopped upon the beach and"
"commenced removing her sport shoes. ""And I won't even ask any questions"
"until you're ready to tell me."" Rising, her small feet pink against the"
"sand, she saluted Lav with mock solemnity."
"""There, Captain Lavender Green, I'm at your command."""
Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If any doubt assailed
"them as to the prudence of letting Pola go, their admiration for Pola's"
gameness stilled it. Sidney rolled Pola's shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs. Then the little party
waded out to the dory and embarked.
"""We're going to the _Arabella_,"" Sidney whispered to Pola. She felt"
"Pola shiver, but the girl made no protest. ""We have to go 'round this"
"way so's no one can see us from the harbor. Sh--h!"""
"Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last. With the line from"
the dory in his hand the boy considered.
"""If anyone comes up and sees the dory they'll know someone's aboard."""
"""That's true. What'll we do?"" whispered Sidney, anxiously."
"""We can set her adrift. It's an old tub anyway."""
"Whereupon, Johnson went over to the window and put his face close to"
hers on the frosted panes; a great sea of white snow met his gaze!
"""This means--"" he said, turning away from the window and meeting her"
"glance--""surely it doesn't mean that I can't leave Cloudy to-night?"""
"""It means you can't get off the mountain to-night,"" calmly answered the"
Girl.
"""Good Lord!"" fell from the man's lips."
"""You can't leave this room to-night,"" went on the Girl, decidedly. ""Why,"
you couldn't find your way three feet from this door--you a stranger!
"You don't know the trail anyway unless you can see it."""
"""But I can't stay here?"" incredulously."
"""Why not? Why, that's all right! The boys'll come up an' dig us out"
"to-morrow or day after. There's plenty o' wood an' you can have my bed."""
"And with no more ado than that, the Girl went over to the bed to remove"
the covers and make it ready for his occupancy.
"""I wouldn't think of taking that,"" protested the man, stoutly, while his"
face clouded over.
The Girl felt a thrill at the note of regard in his voice and hastened
to explain:
"""I never use it cold nights; I always roll up in my rug in front of the"
"fire."" All of a sudden she broke out into a merry little laugh. ""Jest"
"think of it stormin' all this time an' we didn't know it!"""
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
SPIRITUS JUNIPERI COMPOSITUS--COMPOUND SPIRIT OF JUNIPER
"DERIVATION.--Oil of juniper, 8; oil of caraway, 1; oil of fennel, 1;"
"alcohol, 1,400; water to make 2,000."
Compound spirit of juniper is similar to gin in its therapeutic action.
Contains about 15 per cent more alcohol. Gin is made by distillation of
fermented malt and juniper berries. Gin differs from the other alcoholic
preparations therapeutically in being more diuretic.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
RUM (not official)
Rum is made from a fermented solution of molasses by distillation. It
"contains, by weight, from 40 to 50 per cent of absolute alcohol. Rum"
does not differ physiologically from alcohol. There is no authoritative
Latin name for rum.
DOSE.--Same as that for whisky.
VINUM ALBUM--WHITE WINE
DERIVATION.--An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting the juice of fresh
"grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera, free from seeds, stems and skins."
"PROPERTIES.--A pale amber or straw-colored liquid, having a pleasant"
fraught with significance. Lavender took the precaution to beach the
dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.
"""Just as well not to show ourselves 'round Rockman's."""
"""When can we go out to the _Arabella_?"""
"""Not 'till four o'clock. We can go out to swim just like we always do."
Even if they see us they won't think it's funny for us to do that.
"They'd think it funnier if we didn't."""
"Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered how she could live"
until four o'clock!
"As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded Lavender that, because of"
"their promise, they ought to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the"
Calkins' house they found that Mart had already gone to Gert Bartow's.
"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Sidney, with an added pang of remorse."
At four o'clock Sidney and Lavender went out to the _Arabella_ to swim
as they had done always before Pola's coming. Except for a brightness
"in Sidney's eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and the occasional"
significant glances that passed between them they both appeared quite
normal. Lav talked casually of the heat of the day.
"""Gee, the water'll feel great. This is the hottest day we've had yet."""
"""I can't wait to get in."" Most certainly Jed Starrow, had he been"
"listening, could not have guessed how closely Nemesis pressed upon his"
heels!

"When Castlemain was gone, we all laughed save the king. Presently he left"
"us, and I saw him beckon Wentworth and Berkeley to his side. I followed"
"him as though going to the other side of the gallery, but walked slowly"
when I approached him and the two worthy villains. I was rewarded by
hearing his Majesty say:--
"""Odds fish! But you made a mess of it! You got the wrong woman! Who in"
"the devil's name did you pick up?"""
"I could not stop to hear the rest of this interesting conversation, but"
"two days later I heard from Rochester, who had it from Wentworth, that"
the following occurred:--
"""We thought we had her,"" answered Berkeley, nodding towards Frances, ""but"
"the woman wore a full vizard and was wrapped in furs to her ears, so that"
"we did not see her face."""
"""Do you suppose we could have made a mistake?"" asked Wentworth."
"""You surely did,"" answered the king. ""She has established an alibi. At"
"what hour did you leave Baynard's Castle?"""
"""Near one o'clock,"" returned Berkeley."
"""One o'clock! She was playing cards with the duchess till four,"""

"""No, by God, you'll not introduce her to the king! I'll explode the whole"
"affair, and Dunkirk may go to the devil before you shall introduce Betty"

"""Yet you are willing that I should meddle in the dangerous affair?"
"Evidently you love her more than you love me?"""
"""Only a few hundred million times more,"" I answered sullenly."
"""Is it that way with you, my dear brother?"" she asked, coming to me as I"
"stood gazing out the window, seeing nothing save Bettina's face. Frances"
"put her hand on my shoulder and said coaxingly: ""Forgive me. No harm"
"shall come to her through me."""
"Of course I was sorry that I had allowed myself to become angry, and at"
once made my apology as well as I could.
"""Let us go to see Betty, anyway,"" said Frances. And I assenting, she went"
"to fetch her cloak, hat, and vizard."
"But when she returned, I had changed my mind and declined to go, telling"
Frances that I must see Bettina no more.
"""Why?"" asked Frances."
"""Because I would not win a love from her which I cannot accept."""
"""Baron Ned, there are few men who would be so considerate."""

the human world or the world of nature.
When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the
uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and
"memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging"
"in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the"
beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the
waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering—perhaps a lost—odour—a
"delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment"
"immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own, and"
hers only.
"The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of"
finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next
room—twenty steps away.
"“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her"
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to
cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.
"She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,"
and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk.
He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was
above his ear.
"“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I"
"Colonel Carmichael thrust her behind him, and an instant later she"
heard the report of his revolver. There was no answering volley. A
"dark, scantily-clad figure sprang through the trees, waving one hand"
as though in imperative appeal.
"""Don't fire--don't fire! It's me!"""
"The Colonel's still smoking revolver sank, and the supposed native"
"swayed toward him, only to sink a few yards farther on to the ground."
Carmichael ran to his side and lifted the fainting head against his
shoulder.
"""Good God, Geoffries! Don't say I've hit you! How on earth was I to"
"know!"""
"""That's all right, Colonel. Only winded--don't you know--never hurried"
so much in life. Have been in the midst of the beggars--just managed
"to slip through. O Lor', give me something to drink, will you?"""
Colonel Carmichael put his flask to the parched and broken lips.
"""Thanks, that's better. We got your message, and are coming on like"
fun. The regiment's only an hour off. You never saw Saunders in such a
"fluster--it's his first big job, you know."" He took another deep"
"draft, and wiped his mouth with the corner of his ragged tunic. ""I"
"say--don't look at me, Miss Lois. I'm not fit to be seen."" He laughed"
"hoarsely. ""These clothes weren't made in Bond Street, and Webb assured"
"me that the fewer I had the more genuine I looked. I say, Colonel,"
"this is a lively business!"""
Colonel Carmichael nodded as he helped the gasping and exhausted man
into the bungalow.
"“No, indeed,” the Englishman proclaimed."
Cæsar and Kennedy disagreed about everything.
"Susanna discussed her plans, and constantly referred to Paul Bourget’s"
"novel _Cosmopolis_, which had obviously influenced her in her"
inclination for Catholicism.
“Are there many Jewish ladies who aspire to be baptized and become
"Catholics, as Bourget says?” asked Susanna."
“Bah!” exclaimed Cæsar.
“You do not believe that either?”
"“No, it strikes me as a piece of naïvety in this good soul of a"
"novelist. To become a Catholic, I don’t believe requires more than some"
few pesetas.”
"“You are detestable, as a Cardinal’s nephew.”"
“I mean that I don’t perceive that there are any obstacles to prevent
"anybody from becoming a Catholic, as there are to prevent his becoming"
"rich. What a high ambition, to aspire to be a Catholic! While nobody"
anywhere does anything but laugh at Catholics; and it has become an
axiom: ‘A Catholic country is a country bound for certain ruin.’”
Kennedy burst out laughing.
"Susanna said that she had no real faith, but that she did have a great"
"enthusiasm for churches and for choirs, for the smell of incense and"
"want you to know. I tried to keep it from you, Everard! Don’t look at me"
like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.
“Will you forgive me?”
The poor little commonplace fell in the midst of devastating
emotions--pathetically incongruous.
series of rapid flashes followed by an equal number of detonations. The
"upper air was filled with a blending of high notes--a whizzing, droning,"
"and sibilant buzzing, and pipings that died down in faint wails. The"
"little white speck moved on. It entered a film of straggling cloud, but"
soon re-emerged. It grew smaller and smaller. Our eyes lost it for a
moment and found it again. Then they lost it altogether and nothing
remained save the whitish blurs in the blue sky and a hardly audible
booming in the far distance.

"PULLING, CAPTAIN JOHN."
"Commanded the _Fame_, which set out in 1703 in company with Dampier in the"
_St. George_ on a plundering expedition to the South Seas. Their
commissions were to attack only Spanish and French ships. The two
"captains quarrelled at the very beginning of the voyage, while lying off"
"the Downs, and Pulling slipped away by himself to go a-pirating amongst"
the Canary Islands.

In the sixteenth century this pirate became notorious for his piracies off
"the coast of Wales, and with Calles and Clinton, two other pirates, ""grew"

A native of Massachusetts Colony.
"In 1703 was one of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_, eighty tons,"
"owned by some leading citizens of Boston, and fitted out to go"
privateering off the coasts of Arcadia and Newfoundland. On leaving
"Marblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected"
"Quelch their commander. They sailed to the south, and shortly afterwards"
"threw the captain overboard. They hoisted a flag, the ""Old Roger,"""

She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then she flung out her arms
with a low glad cry that was half sob.
"""Trude--_Oh, Trude!_"""
"Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn head, murmuring"
soothing words. Finally Sidney wriggled from her.
"""Have you come to take me home? But how could they send for you so"
"quickly? How long have I been asleep? Oh, Lavender--is he--is he--"""
"""One question at a time, Sid. Lavender is better. He'll be all right,"
"the doctor says, after a good rest. Yes, I think I'd better take you"
"home. No, they did not send for me."" Briefly, as though now that"
"earlier concern was of little consequence, Trude told of the sketch"
that had so bewildered and alarmed her.
"""I couldn't understand,"" she finished."
"""I couldn't either, at first. You see the boarder--the man who has"
boarded here so long and is dreadfully fond of Aunt Achsa wrote that
"letter to me and wrote it _nice_ so as to please her, and, at"

"really, truly, even though they are poor--"""
"""Hush, Sidney."" Trude's eyes darkened with feeling. ""You do not have to"
"tell me that. I have learned _that_ in only a few hours. Oh, I have"
"seen straight into souls--those kind men on the street, as concerned as"
"though you belonged to them, and here--Aunt Achsa with her great"

"""Come on, let's sit down here and have a coffee--we needn't stop long."""
"All the smaller tables were occupied, but there was one long table that"
stretched across the room and only a few men were sitting at the far end
of it. The officers sat down at the near end and ordered coffee. They
"seemed a little embarrassed at first, but they soon began to talk freely"
to each other:
"""I wonder if there's a war on in these parts--I hear the Huns have made"
"a bit of a push."""
"""Curse the blighters--they'll mess up my leave, it's due in a week's"
"time."""
"""Jolly good coffee, this! Here, Marie, bring us another two cups--der"
"coop der caffay--that's right, isn't it?"""
"""Dat's right,"" said the girl, ""you speak goot French--vous avez tout a"
"fait l'accent parisien."""
"Suddenly her sister came running into the room, sobbing loudly:"
"""English soldier come round from Commandant--he tell us Shermans"

"Scurvilegs, does not spare her; but that she had her great qualities I"
should be the last to deny.
"She had been writing poetry that morning, and she wore green.  She"
"always wore green when the Muse was upon her: a pleasing habit which,"
"whether as a warning or an inspiration, modern poets might do well to"
imitate.  She carried an enormous diary under her arm; and in her mind
several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to
the Palace.
"""Good morning, dear Countess,"" said the King, rising only too gladly"
"from his nibs; ""an early visit."""
"""You don't mind, your Majesty?"" said the Countess anxiously.  ""There"
was a point in our conversation yesterday about which I was not quite
"certain----"""
"""What _were_ we talking about yesterday?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty,"" said the Countess, ""affairs of state,"" and she"
"gave him that wicked, innocent, impudent, and entirely scandalous look"
"which he never could resist, and you couldn't either for that matter."
"""Affairs of state, of course,"" smiled the King."
"""Why, I made a special note of it in my diary."""
She laid down the enormous volume and turned lightly over the pages.
"""Here we are! '_Thursday._  His Majesty did me the honour to consult"

"out of the blue, what's happened to Vera? She's been European point"
woman for this whole scam. Where's she now?
"Mino continued. ""Therefore I must now either take you into my"
"organization or . . ."" He paused. ""It's that simple. Which, I wonder,"
"will it be?"""
"Vance studied him. ""A lot depends on what happens to Eva."""
"""The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your decision. So perhaps I"
"should give you some time to think it over."" He leaned back. ""Or"
"perhaps some inducement."""
Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and looked
behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
"of Tanzan Mino's personal _kobun_, two of whom he recognized from"
"London. The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but"
he needed no translation as they moved forward.
"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”

"several times, he openly confessed:"
"""I cannot play without cheating ... it is a habit of mine."""
"""Habits do get the better of you,"" assented Deacon Taras.  ""I always"
"used to beat my wife every Sunday after Mass, and when she died I"
cannot describe how extremely dull I felt every Sunday.  I lived
"through one Sunday--it was dreadful, the second I still controlled"
"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the
"fourth Sunday, I beat her just as if she were my own wife!  After that"
"I gave her ten roubles, and beat her according to my own rules till I"
"married again!"" ..."
"""You are lying, Deacon!  How could you marry a second time?"""
interrupted Abyedok.
"""Ay, just so...  She looked after my house...."""
"""Did you have any children?"" asked the teacher."
"""Five of them....  One was drowned ... the oldest ... he was an amusing"
boy!  Two died of diphtheria ...  One of the daughters married a
student and went with him to Siberia.  The other went to the University
"of St. Petersburg and died there ... of consumption they say. Ye--es,"
"there were five of them.... Ecclesiastics are prolific, you know.""  He"
"began explaining why this was so, and they laughed till they nearly"
"burst at his tales. When the laughter stopped, Aleksei Maksimovitch"
Simtsoff remembered that he too had once had a daughter.
"""Her name was Lidka ... she was very stout ...""  More than this he did"
"""You say that all I must do in the meantime is to sign some papers,"" she"
"interrupted. ""You say you won't ask me to marry you right away. Will you"
"wait--a year?"""
"""A year! I couldn't, Sallie!"" he cried, and her pale lips drooped"
piteously again.
"""How long, then?"" she asked in a whisper. ""Six months?"""
"He had made up his mind to be generous, and he felt that he had not"
"failed in his intention as he answered, ""Three months, and not a day"
"longer, Sallie."""
"She sat still and silent for a while, considering that, and then, ""All"
"right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""Take me safe home, and I'll marry you three"
months from the day we get there--if we're both alive when the time
"comes."""
He turned away from her for a moment. He had won all he wanted in the
"meantime, and he could scarcely contain himself. When he presently held"
"out a hand to her, she took it, to bind that bargain."
"""And you won't have any cause to regret it, Sallie,"" he assured her, his"
voice somewhat hoarse in spite of his effort to speak quite naturally.
"""So now, as soon as you're ready, we'll all go ashore together, and--"""

"we are determining what our death will be; if we have lived well, we"

the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"
"shall gain the great Deliverance. He shall have perfect Peace, perfect"
"rest, perfect happiness, he and his, in that heaven where his teacher"
went before him long ago.
"And if we should say that this Deliverance from life, this Great Peace,"
"is Death, what matter, if it be indeed Peace?"

"in Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught"
"by the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed."
Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and

"After that they were nothing to me, but I went with the rest. Our lair"
"was in some rocks overhanging the road. By the time we looked over,"
"the horsemen were below us, and we could see nothing of them; though"
"the sullen tramp of their horses, and the jingle of bit and spur,"
reached us clearly. Presently they came into sight again on the road
"beyond, riding steadily away with their backs to us."
'That is not General Tzerclas?' my lady muttered anxiously.
'Nor any of his people!' Steve said with an oath.
"That led me to look more closely, and I saw in a moment something that"
lifted me out of my moodiness. I sprang on the rock against which I
was leaning and shouted long and loudly.
"'Himmel!' Steve cried, seizing me by the ankle. 'Are you mad, man?'"
"But I only shouted again, and waved my cap frantically. Then I slipped"
"down, sobered. 'They see us,' I cried. 'They are Leuchtenstein's"
"riders. And Count Hugo is with them. You are safe, my lady.'"
"She turned white and red, and I saw her clutch at the rock to keep"
herself on her feet. 'Are you sure?' she said. The troop had halted
and were wheeling slowly and in perfect order.
"'Quite sure, my lady,' I answered, with a touch of bitterness in my"
tone. Why had not this happened yesterday or the day before? Then my
girl would have been saved. Now it came too late! Too late! No wonder
I felt bitterly about it.
The general shrugged his shoulders and laughed grimly. 'Why not?' he
"said. 'What are waiting-women and the like made for, if not to be"
bribed--or slapped?'
She hated him for that sly hit--if never before; but she controlled
herself. She would throw the burden on him.
"He read the thought, and it led him to change his tone. There was a"
"gloomy fire in his eyes, and smouldering passion in his voice, when he"
spoke again.
"'Well, Countess,' he said, 'I am here for your answer.'"
'To what?'
"'To the question I asked you some time ago,' he rejoined, dwelling on"
her with sullen eyes. 'I asked you to be my wife. Your answer?'
"'Prythee!' she said proudly, 'this is a strange way of wooing.'"
"'It is not of my choice that I woo in company,' he answered, shrugging"
his shoulders. 'My answer; that is all I want--and you.'
"'Then you shall have the first, and not the last,' she exclaimed on a"
"sudden impulse. 'No, no--a hundred times no! If you do not see that by"
"pressing me now,' she continued impetuously, 'when I am alone,"
"friendless, and unprotected, you insult me, you should see it, and I"
do.'
"For a moment there was silence. Then he laughed; but his voice,"
"notwithstanding his mastery over it and in spite of that laugh, shook"
"with rage and resentment. 'As I expected,' he said. 'I knew last night"
"same meaning to her ear: ""You have helped to do this--this is your"
"work."""
"""No help will come,"" Mrs. Carmichael said, shaking her head at the"
"darkness. ""When a whole province rises as this has done, it takes"
"months to organize a sufficient force, and we shan't last out many"
days. I wonder what people in England are saying. How well I can see
"them over their breakfast cups! Oh, dear, I mustn't think of breakfast"
"cups, or I shall lose my nerve."" She laughed under her breath, and"
there was a long silence.
"Presently the door of the bungalow opened, letting in a stream of"
"moonlight. It was closed instantly, and soft footfalls came over the"
boarded floor.
"""Who is it?"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered."
"""I--Lois,"" was the answer. The new-comer crept down by Beatrice's side"
"and leaned her head against the warm shoulder. ""I am so tired,"" she"
"said faintly. ""I have been with Archibald. He has been moaning so. Mr."
"Berry says he is afraid mortification has set in. It is terrible."""
"""Poor little woman!"" Beatrice put her arm about the slender figure and"
"drew her closer. ""Lay your head on my lap and sleep a little. You can"
"do no good just now."""
"""Thank you. I will, if you don't mind. You will wake me if anything"
"happens, won't you?"""
"""Yes, I promise."" It gave Beatrice a sense of comfort to have Lois"
"near her. Very gently she passed her hand over the aching forehead,"
and presently Lois fell into a sleep of absolute exhaustion.
adorably red. There was a new and brilliant light in her eye; and after
"one curiously comprehensive glance at the company, she turned about to"
"look for her companion, La Giralda, who presently cantered up on a"
"lumbering Estramenian gelding. La Giralda sat astride as before, her"
"lower limbs, so far as these were apparent, being closely clad in"
"leather, a loose skirt over them preserving in part the appearance of"
sex.
Rollo was dumb with sheer astonishment. He could only gaze at the
"flushed cheek, the tingling electric glances, the air completely"
unconscious and innocent of the girl before him.

"imagined you were safe at the Convent of the Holy Innocents!"""

"and reddening, his stammering tongue and altered demeanour, with the"
utmost satisfaction.
"""Good--good,"" he muttered under his breath to El Sarria; ""he will make a"
true general yet. The saints be praised for this weakness! If only he
"were fonder of his dinner all might yet be well!"""

THE MISSION OF THE SEÑORITA CONCHA
"""I too have a mission, I would have you know,"" said Concha, a dangerous"
"preparations for the night. He was about to make some remark, however,"
when to his well-attuned ears there came the sound of approaching
footsteps. In an instant he was standing in the parting made by the
"curtains, his face eager, animated, tense."
"""What's that?"" he whispered."
"""That's snow slidin',"" the Girl informed him without the slightest trace"
of anxiety in her voice.
"""God bless you, Girl,"" he murmured, and retreated back of the curtains."
"It was only an instant before he was back again with: ""Why, there is"
"something out there--sounded like people calling,"" he again whispered."
"""That's only the wind,"" she said, adding as she drew her robe tightly"
"about her: ""Gettin' cold, ain't it?"""
"But, notwithstanding her assurances, Johnson did not feel secure, and it"
was with many misgivings that he now directed his footsteps towards the
bed behind the curtains.
"""Good-night!"" he said uneasily."
"""Good-night!"" unconsciously returned the Girl in the same tone."
Taking off her slippers the Girl now put on a pair of moccasins and
"quietly went over to her bed, where she knelt down and made a silent"
prayer.
"""Good-night!"" presently came from a little voice in the rug."
"""Good-night!"" answered the man now settled in the centre of the"
and said to the eating-house keeper:
"""Egor Terentievitch Vaviloff?  Are you he?"""
"""I am,"" answered the sergeant, leaning on the bar with both arms as if"
intending to jump over it.
"""I have some business with you,"" said Petunikoff."
"""Delighted.  Please come this way to my private room."""
"They went in and sat down, the guest on the couch and his host on the"
chair opposite to him.  In one corner a lamp was burning before a
"gigantic icon, and on the wall at the other side there were several oil"
"lamps.  They were well kept and shone as if they were new.  The room,"
"which contained a number of boxes and a variety of furniture, smelt of"
"tobacco, sour cabbage, and olive oil.  Petunikoff looked around him and"
"made a face.  Vaviloff looked at the icon, and then they looked"
"simultaneously at one another, and both seemed to be favourably"
"impressed.  Petunikoff liked Vaviloff's frankly thievish eyes, and"
"Vaviloff was pleased with the open, cold, determined face of"
"Petunikoff, with its large cheeks and white teeth."
"""Of course you already know me, and I presume you guess what I am going"
"to say to you,"" began Petunikoff."
"""About the lawsuit? ... I presume?"" remarked the ex-sergeant,"
respectfully.
"""Exactly!  I am glad to see that you are not beating about the bush,"
"but going straight to the point like a business man,"" said Petunikoff,"
encouragingly.
“It must be such an adventure. It must make you hold your breath and
your heart beat.”
John wondered grimly whether a certain doer of wickedness had felt this
"ecstatic rapture. She, too, must have seen the gray dawn, but creeping"
through prison-bars into her cell. God of Inscrutability! Was it
"possible that these two co-watchers of the dawn, both so dominant in his"
"life, were of the same race of beings? If the one was a woman born of"
"woman, what in the name of mystery was Stellamaris?"
"“Don't look so grave, Great High Belovedest,” she said, squeezing a"
finger. “I only spoke in fun. It must really be horrid to be wicked.
When I was little I had a book about Cruel Frederick--I think it
"belonged to grandmama. It had awful pictures, and there were rhymes--"
"He tore the wings off little flies,"
And then poked out their little eyes.
And there was a picture of his doing so. I used to think him a
detestable boy. It made me unhappy and kept me awake when I was quite
"small, but now I know it's all nonsense. People don't do such things, do"
they?”
"Risca twisted his glum face into a smile, remembering the Unwritten Law."
"“Of course not, Stellamaris,” said he. “Cruel Frederick is just as much"
"of a mythical personage as the Giant Fee-fo-fum, who said:"
"I smell the blood of an Englishman,"
"And be he alive or be he dead,"
He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
"guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir Tankerton"
"Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man mincingly, and"
said affectedly:
"“Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton--d’you know, I feel such an awful ass--but"
they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.”
"Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity at the"
"thing before him, sniffed."
“Go away!” he said testily.
Ffolliott went away.
"As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway, an"
"absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his elbow,"
followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of withered
"prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve inquiringly, said:"
"“My good man--before you announce our names, will you tell me which is"
the host? I have never seen my host before--in fact----”
"“Poof--poof!” squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted into the room."
“Dear me!” The little old gentleman turned to his little old lady; and
added in a confidential undertone:
“A most extraordinary person--a most extraordinary _house_!... But I
"have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a strange country.... In"
"fact, Charlotte, it’s _rather_ thrilling, is it not?”"
aid. The thought of either was unendurable. I hated him—yet was
dependent on him.
"“To-night I met him, in his empty apartment, alone. I knew that he had"
"what was left of his money with him, that everything was packed up. I"
went prepared. I would not elope. My plan was no less than to make him
pay the balance on the necklace that he had lost—or to murder him.
"“I carried a new pistol in my muff, one which Lynn had just bought. I"
don’t know how I did it. I was desperate.
"“He told me he loved me, that Lynn did not, never had—that Lynn had"
"married me only to show off his wealth and diamonds, to give him a"
social! position—that I was merely a—a piece of property—a dummy.
“He tried to kiss me. It was revolting. I struggled away from him.
"“And in the struggle, the revolver fell from my muff and exploded on"
the floor.
“At once he was aflame with suspicion.
"“‘So—it’s murder you want!’ he shouted. ‘Well, murder it shall be!’"
“I saw death in his eye as he seized my arm. I was defenseless now. The
old passion came over him. Before he killed—he—would have his way with
me.
“I screamed. With a wild effort I twisted away from him.
"“He raised his hand to strike me, I saw his eyes, glassy. Then he sank"
back—fell to the floor—dead of apoplexy—dead of his furious emotions.

"The accident became widely known. Newspapermen came from the city, and"
Solem had to pilot them up the mountain and show them the spot where it
"had taken place. If the body had not been removed at once, they would have"
"written about that, too."
Children and ignoramuses might be inclined to think it foolish that Solem
"should be taken from the work in the fields at harvest time, but must not"
the business of the tourist resort go before all else?
"""Solem, tourists!"" someone called to him. And Solem left his work. A flock"
"of reporters surrounded him, asked him questions, made him take them to"
"the mountains, to the river. A phrase was coined at the farm for Solem's"
absences:
"""Solem's with death."""
"But Solem was by no means with death; on the contrary, he was in the very"
"midst of life, enjoying himself, thriving. Once again he was an important"
"personage, listened to by strangers, doling out information. Nor did his"
"audience now consist of ladies only--indeed, no; this was something new, a"
"change; these were keen, alert gentlemen from the city."
"To me, Solem said:"
"""Funny the accident should have happened just when the scratch on my nail"
"has grown out, isn't it?"""
all. 'And your gold chain is gone. I believe you have nothing but the
"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because
"you love me,' she whispered, shutting her eyes."
And I did not gainsay her.
CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
"""This idea is hopelessly haywire,"" Wilson said unhappily."
"""It sure is,"" said Space-Tech Maury Allison. ""But everything is, at"
"first."""
"""You hope to make something out of it?"""
"""We hope,"" replied Allison. ""We can't be sure."""
"""But surely this pile of junk has been tested before?"""
Allison nodded.
"""Any results?"""
"""Some. We've had as much as five minutes of constant operation out of"
"it."""
"As he spoke, the hemisphere over their heads flashed a full bright"
"green, then went black. A bell tinkled somewhere and a couple of techs"
dropped their tools and headed for the back room on the double. A
couple of others stood up from their work and lit cigarettes because
their instruments had gone dead. Some of the rest continued to nurse
their particular circuits because that section was still running.
[Illustration: The dome became a riot of flaming green.]
"After scanning the operation to see which section had gone blooey,"
"Allison went on. ""We've never tested this outfit under anything"
but ideal conditions. We've had spacecraft sent out to specified
"distances, fired up the gizmo and found fragments of response right"
"where there should be a response."""
Sidney he admired the girl's gameness though he was beginning to wish
they had not let her come.
"""How long do you think we'll have to wait? And what if no one comes?"""
"""We'll have to wait until most morning anyway before the tide is out."
"And if no one comes tonight we'll have to come out again, that's all."
"We're not in this business for any fun!"""
"""Oh--h!"" sighed Pola, clinging closer to Sidney."
The wind howled over their heads with increasing velocity and Sidney
thought involuntarily of the snugness of Miss Letty's buggy. Miss Letty
was probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa thought she was with
her!
"""Is--is the boat tied tight?"" asked Pola; and Lav assured her that it"
"was. ""The wind could get a lot worse and you'd be as safe out here as"
"in your bed at home."""
"After a long while Mart muttered, ""What's that?"" The others leaned"
forward in the blackness of the cabin. They had all felt rather than
heard a soft thud as though something had touched the side of the boat.
And in a few moments heavy footsteps came straight toward the fo'castle.
"""Oh, will they come _here_?"" breathed Pola, shaking. And for answer"
Sidney caught Pola's arm with a warning clutch.
For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must descend to the cabin.
"But at the companionway they halted. A voice came, heavy and thick."
"""I tell you it ain't safe to take it off now. They got a man on"
out. I have no more idea than you have.”
It could not have been more than twenty minutes later when Mrs. Moulton
"emerged rather hurriedly, and drove away."
While we had been waiting I had observed a man on the other side of the
"street who seemed unduly interested in the Recherche, too, for he had"
"walked up and down the block no less than six times. Kennedy saw him,"
"and as he made no effort to follow Mrs. Moulton, Kennedy did not do so"
either. In fact a little quick glance which she had given at our cab
had raised a fear that she might have discovered that she was being
followed.
Kennedy and I paid off our cabman and sauntered into the Recherche in
the most debonair manner we could assume.
"“Now, son, we’ll go up,” he said to the boy who, remembering us, and"
now not at all clear in his mind that he might not have seen us before
"that, whisked us to the tenth floor."
"“Let me see,” said Kennedy, “it’s number one hundred and—er——”"
"“Three,” prompted the boy."
He pressed the buzzer and a neatly dressed colored maid responded.
"“I had an appointment here with Mrs. Moulton this morning,” remarked"
Kennedy.
"“She has just gone,” replied the maid, off her guard."
"“And was to meet Mr. Schloss here in half an hour,” he added quickly."
"There was no one about, and a few children's faces at a window suddenly"
"disappeared. Everything here was small and poor, though only the barn was"
of peat; the house was a timbered fisherman's home. As I entered the
"house, I saw that though it was as poor within as without, the floor was"
clean and covered with pine twigs. There were many children here. The
mother was busy cooking something over the fire.
"I was offered a chair, and sitting down, began to chat with a couple of"
"small boys. As I was in no hurry and asked for nothing, the woman said:"
"""I expect you want a boat?"""
"""A boat?"" I said in my turn, for I had not come by boat on my last visit;"
I had walked instead over fjelds and valleys many miles from the sea.
"""Yes, why not?"" I said. ""But where does it go?"""
"""I thought you wanted a boat to go to the trading center,"" she replied,"
"""because that's where the steamer stops. We've rowed over lots of people"
"this year."""
Great changes here; the motor traffic in Stordalen must have completely
altered all the other traffic since my last visit ten months ago.
"""Where can I stop for a few days?"" I asked."
"""At the trading center, the other side of the islands. Or there's Eilert"
and Olaus; they're both on this side. You could go there; they've got big
"houses."""
"She showed me the two places on this side of the water, close to the"
"shore, and I proceeded thither."

and social and scientific prestige. When an exposé of the methods
employed by him in furthering his schemes for the glorifying of the

"of veal, and he’s got a cute little round bald spot on the top of his"
head. And he wants to be dignified and speaks his words impressively.
"Say, Ned,” the boy continued, “I wouldn’t mind having that fellow get"
into some kind of a mixup out here!”
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the voice from the forest.
"“That’s Gilroy, all right enough!” Ned declared. “Why don’t you go down"
"and see what he wants, Jimmie?” he added."
"“Aw, he ain’t talking to me!” cried the boy."
"“Then I presume I’ll have to go,” Ned said, rising from his seat in"
front of the barrier. “Perhaps he’s been stung by a bee.”
"“He didn’t get crippled in his shrieker,” Jimmie suggested."
Ned stepped into the cave and secured an automatic revolver to replace
"the one taken from him at the old mission, and also passed one to"
Jimmie. Then the two hastened into the forest in the direction of the
sounds.
"The call for help continued to come, although the voice of the man came"
hoarser at every call. When the boys finally came close enough to
"distinguish words spoken in low tones, they heard a warning."
“Shoot!” he cried. “There’s a lot of bears under this tree!”
"Although convulsed with laughter, the boys moved more cautiously after"
this. At last they came to the pine from which the voice proceeded.
"There was a rustle in the thicket as they advanced, and they saw a black"
object shambling away.
"On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on"
"their new grass petticoats (sevata'i) specially made for this occasion,"
enter the water and approach the canoes to unload them. No special
greetings pass between them and their husbands. They are interested
"in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in the sago."
People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet the
incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
"with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and"
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
"natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of"
the arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
"over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables"
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
"Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters."
CHAPTER XVI
THE RETURN VISIT OF THE DOBUANS TO SINAKETA
I
interpret it.
"Steve rode by me, and his face too was moody. I suppose that we should"
all of us have thanked God the peril was past. But my lady rode in
another part with Count Leuchtenstein and the Waldgrave; and Steve
"yearned, I fancy, for the old days of trouble and equality, when there"
was no one to come between us.
"I saw Count Hugo that night. He sent for me to his quarters at Hesel,"
and told me frankly that he would have let me go back had he thought
good could come of it.
"'But it would have been looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, my"
"friend,' he continued. 'Tzerclas' men would have picked you up, or the"
"peasants killed you for a soldier, and in a month perhaps the girl"
"would have returned safe and sound, to find you dead.'"
"'My lord!' I cried passionately, 'she saved your child. It was to her"
as her own!'
"'I know it,' he answered with gravity, which of itself rebuked me."
'And where is my child?'
I shook my head.
'Yet I do not give up my work and the task God and the times have
"given me, and go out looking for it!' he answered severely. 'Leaving"
"Scot, and Swede, and Pole, and Switzer to divide my country. For"
"shame! You have your work too, and it lies by your lady's side. See to"
"it that you do it. For the rest I have scouts out, who know the"
country; if I learn anything through them you shall hear it. And now
"of another matter. How long has the Waldgrave been like this, my"
"name is Villiers. Mr. Alwyn is my guest,--but he is at present very"
"much occupied,--and unless your business is extremely urgent..."""
"""Certainly it is urgent""--said the lady decisively.. ""otherwise I"
"should not have come. And so you are NOT Mr. Alwyn! Well, I thought you"
"couldn't be! Now then, will you have the kindness to tell Mr. Alwyn I"
"am here?"""
"By this time Villiers had recovered his customary self-possession, and"
he met her commanding glance with a somewhat defiant coolness.
"""I am not aware to whom I have the honor of speaking,"" he said"
"frigidly. ""Perhaps you will oblige me with your name?"""
"""My name doesn't in the least matter,"" she replied calmly--""though I"
will tell you afterward if you wish. But you don't seem to understand
"I..._I_ am 'Tiger-Lily'!"""
The situation was becoming ludicrous. Villiers felt strongly disposed
to laugh.
"""I'm afraid I am very ignorant!""--he said, with a humorous sparkle in"
"his blue eyes,--""But really I am quite in the dark as to your meaning."
"Will you explain?"""
"The lady's nose grew deeper of tint, and the look she shot at him had"
quite a killing vindictiveness. With evident difficulty she forced a
smile.
"""Oh, you MUST have heard of me!""--she declared, with a ponderous"
"attempt at playfulness--""You read the papers, don't you?"""
red glow illumined the sky.
"The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly."
"""We're here,"" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms."
"""We are,"" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster."
The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin
"sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter"
"glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it,"
and wondered what it held.
"They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles"
"away. Watery white light from the satellites, ""that jitter around in"
"the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,"" as Dex put it, was now the"
sole illumination.
"They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the"
five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to
"illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year,"
had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they
"waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger"
"they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell"
them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous
one--with their mother planet.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Red spot ten miles away,"" said Brand in the transmitter. ""We're"
"approaching it slowly."""
“There’s Gilroy’s flock of bears!” Jimmie shouted.
"“And a little bit of a black bear at that,” Ned laughed. “If Gilroy had"
"made an ugly face at him, he’d have run away!”"
The tree into which the fat confidential clerk had climbed was not a
"large one. In fact, it was swaying dangerously under his weight. As he"
"moved his position at sight of the black back of the bear, the slender"
upshoot to which he clung gave way and he came clattering down through
the few lower branches.
“Oh my! oh my! oh my!” he shouted. “I never should have come into this
blasted country! I shall be eaten alive!”
"Instead of rushing to Gilroy’s assistance, his rescuers, boy-like, sat"
down on the mat of pine needles which strewed the ground and roared with
laughter. Gilroy eyed them angrily without attempting to rise to his
feet. His rage only made the scene more amusing.
“Why didn’t you shoot him?” he demanded at length.
“Shoot him?” repeated Jimmie. “That bear is a great deal more frightened
"than you are. At the rate of speed he’s now going, he’ll strike the"
arctic circle at exactly four-fifteen tomorrow morning!”
"“He chased me up the tree,” whined Gilroy. “He nipped at my heels as I"
"left the ground, and I heard his teeth grinding together in the most"
frightful manner. I’ll never get over this!”
“I guess he would have climbed the tree after you in about another
"minute,” Jimmie declared, with a sly wink at Ned. “You see, it’s just"
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the
tribe of the Manhattans.
"The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until"
"she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,"
facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary
gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a
handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously
out the window.
"“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered."
“When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you
ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat. Mamma has been so
"alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,"
thoughtless Puss.”
"The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“Don’t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use"
mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie’s hat were just
"what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
“I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not
"walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better."
That is why I was so long.”
"The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the"
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said Larsen, carelessly. ""Him and me used to"
"fish together."" And as if this were a sufficient explanation, he turned"
"back to his conversation, leaving Emerson to proceed on his way,"
"vaguely displeased at the episode, yet reflecting that heretofore he"
had never had occasion to doubt Larsen's loyalty.
"He found Cherry at home, and, flinging himself into one of her"
"easy-chairs, relieved his mind of the day's occurrences."
"""Marsh is building those traps purely out of spite,"" she declared,"
"indignantly, when he had finished. ""He doesn't need any more fish--he"
"has plenty of traps farther up the river."""
"""To be sure! It looks as if we might have to depend upon the"
"gill-netters."""
"""We will know before long. If the fish strike in where George expects,"
"Marsh will be out a pretty penny."""
"""And if they don't strike in where George expects, we will be out all"
"the expense of building that trap."""
"""Exactly! It's a fascinating business, isn't it? It's a business in"
which the unexpected is forever happening. But the stakes are high
"and--I know you will succeed."""
"Boyd smiled at her comforting assurance, her belief in him was always"
stimulating.
"""By-the-way,"" she continued, ""have you heard the historic story about"
"the pink salmon?"""
that did not feel--a happy world!
She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window.
She got up from the tea-table to let him in.  Why do faces gazing in
"through glass from darkness always look hungry--searching, appealing for"
what you have and they have not?  And while she was undoing the latch she
thought: 'What am I going to say?  I feel nothing!'  The ardour of his
"gaze, voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even"
more comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
"""Please take care; I'm still brittle!""  Then she sat down again and"
asked:
"""Will you have some tea?"""
"""Tea!  I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp!  Do you"
know what I have felt like all this time?  No; you don't know. You know
"nothing of me--do you?"""
A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips--without her knowing it was
there.  She said:
"""Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?""  And, without her will,"
"against her will, the words slipped out: ""I'm afraid you've missed the"
"music-room!"""
His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
"""Missed!  Missed everything!  I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no"
"idea how miserable.  Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!""  With each"
"repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer.  And kneeling down in"
"front of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind"
blow he could.
"""I know some people are very ready to be at his feet,"" he said, with a"
sneering smile.
His shaft hit the mark. Alicia flushed and sat speechless. A glance at
Lady Eynesford's face told him the scene had lasted too long: he rose
"and took his leave, paying Alicia the homage of a bow, but not seeking"
"her hand. She took no notice of his salute, and Lady Eynesford only"
"gasped ""Good-bye."""
The two sat silent for some moments after he had gone; then Lady
"Eynesford remarked,"
"""Were you mad, Alicia? See what you laid yourself open to! Oh, of course"
"a gentleman wouldn't have said it, but you yourself didn't treat him as"
"if he was a gentleman. Really, I can make a great deal of allowance for"
"him. Your manner was inexcusable."""
Alicia did not attempt to defend herself.
"""You are out of temper,"" continued her sister-in-law, ""and you choose to"
hit the first person within reach; if you can do that you care nothing
for my dignity or your own self-respect. You parade your--your interest
"in this man----"""
"""I shall never speak to him again."""
"""I'm glad to hear it, and, if you come into my drawing-room, I will"
"thank you to behave yourself properly and be civil to my guests,"" and"
Lady Eynesford walked out of the room.
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"
"two grim faces behind them, were convincing; in a moment he obeyed."
"""Mart!"" she cried. ""It's _not_ Jed Starrow! It's--it's--Cap'n Phin"
"Davies! And that means that--_Lav_--_made_--_it_!"" And happy tears ran"
down her cheeks.
Under the skilled guidance of the man at its wheel the _Sally_ soon
came alongside of the _Arabella_. Cap'n Davies promptly boarded the
schooner and the next instant Sidney was in his arms.
"""All I'll say is praise be to God!"" the old mariner muttered. ""And now"
I cal'late you and your mates here are 'bout ready to abandon your
"cruisin'--"""
"""Lav, is he--all right?"" demanded Sidney, still clinging to Cap'n Phin."
"""Well, he jest about made port and how he is now I can't say for I"
didn't waste any time shippin' in the _Sally_. Lucky for us it was
"lyin' there at Rockman's. Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on"
"this cargo of distress!"" A roughness in the old man's voice betrayed"
that the big heart was not as light as he would have the girls think.
For hours they had searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others had been ready to
"abandon the search as futile, but the Captain had held them stubbornly"
to it.
Pola needed no urging but leaped into the _Sally_ and sank to its
bottom with a long gasp of relief. Sidney and Mart were about to follow
her example when a word from Cap'n Davies held Sidney.
"""We'll let a government boat pick up the _Arabella_. We'll take no"
"chances tryin' to tow her in with the _Sally_."" And then Sidney thought"
of the treasure.
"A door opened, and through it (though dimly) Rollo could see the great"
"waterfall glimmering and above the stars, chill over the snowy shoulder"
"of Peñalara. He could not make out who had opened the door, but there"
was enough light to discern that a lady wrapped in a mantilla went out
"first. Then followed another, stouter and of shorter stature, apparently"
carrying a burden. Then the whole doorway was obscured by the tall
figure of a man.
"""Muñoz himself, by Heaven!"" thought Rollo."
"And with a leap he was after him, in his headlong course dashing to the"
ground some other unseen person who confronted him in the hall.
In a moment more he had caught the tall man by the collar and swung him
impetuously round back within the doorway.
"""Move one sole inch and your blood be on your own head!"" he muttered."
"And the captive feeling Rollo's steel cold at his throat, remained"
prudently silent. Not so the lady without. She uttered a cry which rang
about the silent château.
"""Muñoz! My husband! Fernando, where art thou? Oh, they have slain him,"
"and I only am to blame!"""
"She turned about and rushed back to the door, which she was about to"
"enter, when a cry far more sudden and terrible rang out behind her."
"""_They have killed the Princess! Some one hath slain my darling!_"""
"At the word Rollo abandoned the man whom he was holding down, and with"
"shouts of ""Cardono!"" ""El Sarria!"" ""To me! They are upon us!"" he flung"
"such Regulations as may from Time to Time be made, by order in Council,"
as to the Custody and Disposal of Money so paid.

"Finally, however, the nature of the battle changed. The tallest of the"
attackers opened his tiny mouth and piped a signal. The ring of
weaving tall bodies surrounding the two opened and became a U. The
"creatures in the curve of the U raised their shock-tubes and, with"
"none of their own kind behind the victims to share in its discharge,"
released whatever power it was that lurked in them.
The shock was terrific. Without the glass and metal of the ship to
"protect them, out in the open and defenceless, Brand and Dex got some"
indication of its real power.
"Writhing and twitching, feeling as though pierced by millions of red"
"hot needles, they went down. A swarm of pipe-like bodies smothered"
"them, and the fight was over."

The numbing shock from the tubes left the Earthmen's bodies almost

to observe only too clearly all that went on from the point of their
capture.

"what's become of Gaspard?"""
"""Ah, that they don't know. He's supposed to have taken ship, and they've"
"cabled to search all ships that left the port that morning."""

"""Well, the Superintendent said they were going to have a thorough search"

"The grace of her attitude, the intimacy of the scene, the pleasantness"
"of her greeting, made his task hateful."
"“No,” he said, with an asperity directed towards the disinvited guest."
“We shall dine alone to-night.”
"But his tone made Yvonne’s heart give a great throb, and she turned to"
him quickly.
“Has anything happened?”
"“A great deal,” said the Canon."
"Where he stood in the dusk of the doorway, the shadow accentuated the"
stern lines of his face and deepened the sombreness of his glance. His
brows were bent in perplexities of repugnance. It was horrible to demand
"of her such explanations. To Yvonne’s scared fancy, his brows seemed"
bent in accusation. That was the pity of it. For a few seconds they
"looked at one another, the Canon severely, Yvonne in throbbing suspense."
“What?” she asked at length.
"He paused for a moment, then threw his hat and the crumpled Visitors’"
List on to the table and plunged into the heart of things--but not
before Yvonne had glanced at the paper with a sudden pang of intuition.
"“Emmeline has discovered, Yvonne, that the man--”"
"He got no further. Yvonne rushed to him with a cry of pain, clung to his"
"arm, broke into wild words."
“Don’t say any more--don’t--don’t. Spare me--for pity’s sake. I did not

"Frances turned to me, asking indignantly, ""Why did not you tell me?"""
"""Because I did not know,"" I answered, hardly able to believe the truth."
"But we had important business before us, and I knew that we should"
"prepare for it before Lilly came in. So George, Bettina, Frances, and"
I went to a window at the far end of the room to hold a consultation.
"""Since I did not recognize you, perhaps Lilly will not,"" I suggested. ""I"
"trust the Doctor, but perhaps we had better leave him under the"
impression that you are Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise and give no intimation
"of the truth."""
"""I had not hoped that my disguise would deceive you, Baron Ned,"" said"
"George, ""but since it has, it is just as well that we leave Lilly in the"
"dark if we can."""
"""But he will know. The stars will tell him,"" suggested Bettina, opening"
her eyes very wide.
"""The stars will tell him what he is paid to hear,"" I remarked. Then"
"turning to Frances, I asked, ""How is it that you were able to recognize"
"him?"""
"""By his eyes!"" exclaimed Frances and Bettina in concert."
"""That gives me a valuable hint,"" said George, hastily adjusting his"
"colored spectacles. ""Now, how about it?"""
"As he walked, he thought again about the new rumor he'd heard in the"
commissary at lunch. Gossip kept the Soviet staff going--an instinct
from the old days--but this one just might be true. Some lower-level
staffers even claimed they'd seen him. The Chief.
Word was Tanzan Mino himself--none other than the CEO of the Daedalus
"Corporation--had flown in this morning, together with his personal"
bodyguards and aides. The story was he wanted hands-on control of the
"first hypersonic test flight, wanted to be calling the shots in Flight"
Control when _Daedalus I _made history.
Finally. The Big Man has decided to show his face.
"""Yuri Andreevich, just a minute. Slow down."""
He recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see Nikolai
"Vasilevich Grishkov, the portly Soviet chief mechanic, just emerging"
from the West Quadrant. His bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of Siberian
musk-ox horns above his gleaming dark eyes.
"""Have you seen her?"" Grishkov was shuffling toward him."
"""Seen who?"" He examined the mechanic's spotless white coveralls. Jesus!"
"Even the support crews on this project were all sanitized, high-tech."
"""The new woman. _Kracevia, moi droog. Ochen kracevia_. Beautiful beyond"
"words. And she is important. You can tell just by looking."""
"""Nikolai, there's never been a woman in this facility."" He laughed and"
"continued on toward Security. ""It's worse than a goddam troop ship."
"You've finally started hallucinating from lack of _pezdyonka_."""
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha!"" laughed the other sprout."
"Yes, truly, they had acquired dashing ways among their sporting"
acquaintances.
"It rained for three weeks; then came two fine days, and then rain again"
"for a fortnight. The sun was not to be seen, the sky was invisible, the"
mountain tops had disappeared; we saw nothing but rain. The roofs at the
Tore Peak resort began to leak more and more.
"The hay that still lay spread on the ground was black and rotting, and the"
stacks had gone moldy.
The cotters had got their hay indoors during the patient spell. They had
"carried it, man, woman, and child, on their backs."
The men from Bergen and Mrs. Brede with her children have left for home.
The little girls curtsied and thanked me for taking them walking in the
hills and telling them stories. The house is empty now. Associate Master
"Höy and Mrs. Molie were the last to go; they left last week, traveling"
"separately, though both were going to the same small town."
He went by way of the village--a very roundabout route--while she crossed
"the field. It is very quiet now, but Miss Torsen is still here."
Why do I not leave? Don't know. Why ask? I'm here. Have you ever heard
"anyone ask: ""How much is a northern light?"" Hold your tongue."
Where should I go if I did leave? Do you imagine I want to go to the town
"again? Or do you think I'm longing for my old hut and the winter, and"
Madame? I'm not longing for any specific place; I am simply longing.
and the miracle of children’s being born from their mothers. The other
miracles I do not believe in. What for? They are so insignificant beside
the works of Nature!”
"“He is a pagan,” Kennedy again stated."
_YOUNG PAINTERS_
"They were chatting, when three young lads came into the tavern, all"
"three having the air of artists, black clothes, soft hats, flowing"
"cravats, long hair, and pipes. “Two of them are fellow-countrymen of"
"yours,” Kennedy told Cæsar."
"“They are Spanish painters,” the old man added. “The other is a sculptor"
"who has been in the Argentine, and he talks Spanish too.”"
The three entered and sat down at the same table and were introduced to
"Cæsar. Everybody chattered. Buonacossi, the Italian, was a real type."
"Of very low stature, he had a giant’s torso and strong little legs. His"
"head was like a woe-begone eagle, his nose hooked, thin, and reddish,"
"eyes round, and hair black."
"Buonacossi proved to be gay, exuberant, changeable, and full of"
vehemence.
"He explained his artistic ideas with picturesque warmth, mingling them"
with blasphemies and curses. Things struck him as the best or the worst
in the world. For him there doubtless were no middle terms.
"One of the two Spaniards was serious, grave, jaundiced, sour-visaged,"
"""Oh, well...."" she said. ""No, let's not tonight,"" she added suddenly;"
"""some other time. Yes? In a few days? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good"
"night."""
"For the first time it struck me: she wants to rouse you, too, settled man"
though you are; she wants to make you as mad as the others! That's what
she's after!
"And now I remember, before the lawyer arrived, when there was Tradesman"
"Batt--I remember how during his first few days here, she would give me a"
"kind word or a look that was quite out of the picture, and as unmistakable"
"as her pride would permit. No, she had no objections to seeing old age"
wriggle. And listen to this: before this she had been intent to show a
"well-behaved indifference to sex, but that was finished; was she not at"
"this moment resisting only faintly, and raising definite hopes? ""Not"
"tonight, but some other time,"" she had said. Yes, a half-refusal, a mere"
"postponement, that I was meant to hear. She was corrupt, but she was also"
"cunning, with the cunning of a madman. So corrupt."
"Dear child, Pharaoh laughs before his pyramids; standing before his"
"pyramids he laughs. He would laugh at me, too."

Next day we three remaining guests were sitting in the living room. The
lady and the actor read one book; I read another.
"""Will you,"" she says to him, ""do me a great favor?"""
"""With pleasure."""
"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
"RAYNER, CAPTAIN."
"In a letter to the Lords of Trade, dated from Philadelphia, February 28th,"
"1701, William Penn mentions that several of Captain Kidd's men had settled"
as planters in Carolina with Rayner as their captain.
"RAYNOR, WILLIAM."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.
"READ, CAPTAIN."
Commanded a brigantine which had its headquarters at Madagascar. Rescued
the pirate Thomas White. Read died at sea.
"READ, MARY. Woman pirate."
Born in London of obscure parentage; all that is known for certain is that
"her mother was a ""young and airy widow."" Mary was brought up as a boy, and"
at the age of 13 was engaged as a footboy to wait on a French lady. Having
"a roving spirit, Mary ran away and entered herself on board a man-of-war."
"Deserting a few years later, she enlisted in a regiment of foot and fought"
"in Flanders, showing on all occasions great bravery, but quitted the"
service to enlist in a regiment of horse. Her particular comrade in this
"regiment was a Fleming, with whom she fell in love and disclosed to him"
"the secret of her sex. She now dressed as a woman, and the two troopers"
"were married, ""which made a great noise,"" and several of her officers"
attended the nuptials. She and her husband got their discharge and kept an
"eating house or ordinary, the Three Horseshoes, near the Castle of Breda."
"We went down into the road on foot, a little party of nine--four women"
"and five men. The horsemen, as they came up, looked at us in wonder."
"Our clothes, even my lady's, were dyed with mud and torn in a score of"
"places. We had not washed for days, and our faces were lean with"
famine. Some of the women were shoeless and had their hair about their
"ears, while Steve was bare-headed and bare-armed, and looked so huge a"
ruffian the stocks must have yawned for him anywhere. They drew up and
"gazed at us, and then Count Hugo came riding down the column and saw"
us.
"My lady went forward a step. 'Count Leuchtenstein,' she said, her"
"voice breaking; she had only seen him once, and then under the mask of"
"a plain name. But he was safety, honour, life now, and I think that"
she could have kissed him. I think for a little she could have fallen
into his arms.
"'Countess!' he said, as he sprang from his horse in wonder. 'Is it"
really you? Gott im Himmel! These are strange times. Waldgrave! Your
pardon. Ach! Have you come on foot?'
"'Not I. But these brave men have,' my lady answered, tears in her"
voice.
He looked at Steve and grunted. Then he looked at me and his eyes
lightened. 'Are these all your party?' he said hurriedly.
"'All,' my lady answered in a low voice. He did not ask farther, but he"
"sighed, and I knew that he had looked for his child. 'I came north"
"upon a reconnaissance, and was about to turn,' he said. 'I am thankful"
that I did not turn before. Is Tzerclas in pursuit of you?'
men.
*       *       *       *       *
"Brand stared sympathetically at her. ""They treat them very badly?"" he"
asked gently.
"""Terribly! Terribly!"" said Greca, shuddering again."
"""But you seem quite privileged,"" he could not help saying."
"She shook her dainty head pathetically. ""I am of high rank among my"
"people. I am a priestess of our religion, which is the religion of The"
"Great White One who rules all the sky everywhere. The Rogans"" (it was"
the best translation Brand could make of her mental term for the slimy
"tall things that held them captive) ""--the Rogans hold my fate over"
"the heads of my race. Should they rebel, I would be thrown to the"
monster in the pen. Of course the Rogans could crush any revolt with
"their terrible tubes, but they do not want to kill their slaves if"
they can help it. They find it more effective to hold their
"priestesses in hostage."""
Brand turned from personal history to more vital subjects.
"""Why,"" he asked Greca, ""are the shining red squares of metal laid"
"everywhere over this empire of the Rogans?"""
"""To make things light,"" was the reply. ""When the Rogans first came to"
"this mighty sphere, they could hardly move. Things are so heavy here,"
somehow. So their first thought was to drive my enslaved people to the
casting and laying of the metal squares and the metal beams that
"connect them, in order to make things weigh less."""
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
Lavender pulled up alongside of the _Arabella_ and deliberately made
the boat fast.
"""We got to act as though we haven't found the knife, y'see,"" he warned."
"""As though we were going just swimming."""
In her eagerness to board the _Arabella_ Sidney stumbled. Lavender had
to clutch her to keep her from tumbling into the water.
"""Oh!"" They both cried in one sound as they clambered to the deck--for"
the knife was gone!
"""Well, _that_ means they'd been on the _Arabella_. Jed Starrow dropped"
"that knife and he missed it and came back to look for it!"""
"""Lav, I believe they've hidden their treasure on the _Arabella_!"""
Sidney still reverted to the more romantic terms of buccaneering.
"""Let's look for it now!"""
"""With 'em watching maybe from the _Puritan_? I guess not. We got to go"
"ahead and swim the way we always do, Sid. Don't let's even appear to be"
"talking about anything. Come on, I'll beat you in!"""
For the space of the few minutes while the water closed about her with
delicious coolness Sidney forgot everything in an intoxication of
delight. Presently she came back to the _Arabella_ and climbed aboard
"with a sigh of utter content. ""Thank goodness _I_ haven't any"
"complexes,"" she laughed, shaking the salt drops from her bobbed head."
"""And now what?"""
Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn over his bathing suit.
"“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"“Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They"
left a week ago Tuesday.”
“And before they occupied it?”
"“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business."
He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two
"children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,"
whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a
"year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The
essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had
"departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house"
"furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,"
singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the
sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly
into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut
"he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself"
gratefully upon the bed.
It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched
it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where
house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.
"“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy,"
almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
worth while to add that the next suite was his own.
"""A thousand pardons,"" repeated M. Dubois, very penitently. ""I am too"
stupid! But mademoiselle will perhaps be so gracious as to forgive me
"this time."""
"He bowed to Sallie again and to Slyne, and disappeared, sharply scanning"
the latter's face to the last.
"""Who's that son of a sea-cook?"" snapped Captain Dove, and Mr. Jobling"
looked wanly up out of one eye.
"""A French detective,"" Slyne answered reflectively. But Sallie felt sure"
"that he was afraid of M. Dubois, and wondered why."
"""Well, he has nothing against me that I'm aware of,"" the old man"
"declared. ""And now--what about this wire? Does it mean that some other"
fellow has scooped the pool--and that I've had all my trouble for
"nothing, eh?"" He clenched his fist again and shook it in the lawyer's"
face.
"""No, no,"" gasped Mr. Jobling. ""Don't be so hasty. It makes no difference"
"at all, now that we have Lady Josceline with us. I told you that the"
"American, Carthew, is of no account against her--and how he has ever"
"cropped up again I can't conceive. In any case--"""
"""In any case, you'd better be off to your room and ring for a bit of"
"beefsteak to doctor that eye with,"" Slyne interposed in a tone of"
intense annoyance.
"""And I wish to goodness, Dove!"" he added savagely, ""that you would"
"behave a little more like a reasonable human being and less--"""
"""I do not speak of these men, I am thinking of Judas Petunikoff, who is"
"one of them...."""
"""And you say you have nothing to do with them?"" asks the teacher,"
quietly.
"""But do you think that I do not live?  Aha!  I do live, but I suppose I"
ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of
"all freedom by these men."""
"""And they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the Captain, a man"
"living in retirement?"" says Abyedok, teasingly."
"""Very well!  I agree with you that I am foolish.  Being a creature who"
"was once a man, I ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings"
"that once were mine.  You may be right, but then how could I or any of"
"you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings?"""
"""Now then, you are talking sense,"" says the teacher, encouragingly."
"""We want other feelings and other views on life.... We want something"
"new ... because we ourselves are a novelty in this life...."""
"""Doubtless this is most important for us,"" remarks the teacher."
"""Why?"" asks Kanets.  ""Is it not all the same whatever we say or think?"
"We have not got long to live ...  I am forty, you are fifty ... there"
"is no one among us younger than thirty, and even at twenty one cannot"
"live such a life long."""
"""And what kind of novelty are we?"" asked Abyedok, mockingly."
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
"assistance were indispensable; and to others, too numerous to mention,"
who in any way facilitated the completion of the work.
"The book, written during spare moments of a busy pastorate, is sent"
"forth with the prayer that, in spite of errors and imperfections, it may"
inspire all who use it to sing with greater devotion the praises of Him
who loved us and redeemed us.

The patrolman wanted to believe. He most pathetically wanted to believe.
"""Honest?"""
"""It's the God's honest truth. No man could have stood in front of that"
killer and pulled a trigger. He's a master hypnotist. You're all right.
We won't say a word about what happened in here. And you'll have no
"trouble in the future."""
"The patrolman shook his head. ""Still, I gotta do something about it."""
"""Talk to your psychiatrist,"" Taber said. ""In the meantime, keep that"
"crowd out there from spilling in here."""
Taber pushed out through the choked entrance to the areaway and went
back up the street. It was alive with activity now and he passed
unnoticed. No one recognized him as the man who had given chase in the
bloody business that would make headlines that evening in every New York
newspaper.
And yet the radio and TV news commentators gave it no special attention.
It went in along with other items of the day's news as a more or less
routine big-city happening.
"One national-hookup headliner stated: ""In New York City today, a man"
"identified as John Dennis, address unknown, went berserk in a"
"fashionable Upper East Side apartment. Dennis, wielding a knife, killed"
"a man and a woman, and seriously wounded another man before he was cut"
down by police bullets.
"""A jet airliner, down in the North Atlantic today, imperiled the lives"
"uprooting of all your habits,” said he, in a softened voice."
"She smiled. “I can bring them with me,” she said cheerfully. “You won't"
"mind Dandy, will you? He'll soon get used to you. And as for Dickie,”"
"she added, with a touch of wistfulness, “I 'm sure I can find a nice"
home for him.”
John put his arm round her shoulder and gave her the kiss of a shy bear.
"“My good soul,” he cried, “bring fifty million Dickies if you like.” He"
laughed. “There's nothing like the song of birds for the humanizing of
the cockney child.”
"He looked around and beheld the little, gimcrack room with a new vision."
"After all, it was as much an expression of her individuality, and as"
"genuine in the eyes of the high gods, as Herold's exquisitely furnished"
"abode was of Herold's, or the untidy jumble of the room in Fenton Square"
was of his own. And all she had to live upon was a hundred and fifty
"pounds a year, and no artistic instincts or antecedents whatsoever."
“I feel a brute in asking you to give up this little place now that
"you've made it so pretty,” he said."
"Her face brightened at the praise. “It is pretty, is n't it?” Then she"
sighed as her eyes rested fondly on her possessions. “I suppose it would
be too tiny for us all to live here.”
"“I'm afraid it would,” said John. “Besides, we must live in London, on"
account of my work.”
“In London?”
"“We might begin,” replied John, “with more elementary accomplishments.”"
"“I could teach her botany,” said Miss Lindon, pensively. “I got first"
"prize for it at school. I still have the book in a cupboard, and I"
could read it up. And I'm so glad I have kept my two volumes of pressed
"flowers. It's quite easy to learn, I assure you.”"
"“I'm afraid, my dear,” said John, “you 'll first have to teach her to"
"eat and drink like a Christian, and blow her nose, and keep her face"
clean.”
"“Ah, that reminds me. My head's in a maze, and I can't think of"
"everything at once, like some clever people. What kind of soap do"
"gentlemen use? I 'll have to know, so as to supply you with what you"
like.”
"“Any old stuff that will make a lather,” said John, rising."
"“But some soaps are so bad for the skin,” she objected anxiously."
“Vitriol would n't hurt my rhinoceros hide.”
"He laughed, and held out his hand. Further discussion was useless."
Miss Lindon accompanied him to the front gate and watched him stride
down the perky terrace until he disappeared round the corner. Then she
"went slowly into the house and uncovered the canary, who blinked at her"
"in oblique sullenness, and did not respond to her friendly “cheep” and"
the scratching of her finger against the rails of his cage. She turned
"to Dandy, who, snoring loud, was equally unresponsive. Feeling lonely"
"and upset, she rang the bell."
"in slashed clothes, which were parti-coloured, red, yellow, and black."
Some of them carried lances and others swords.
“Why are the guards here dressed differently?” asked Cæsar.
“Because this belongs to the Dominions of the Pope.”
“And what kind of guards are these?”
“These are pontifical Swiss guards.”
"“They look comic-opera enough,” said Cæsar."
"“My dear man, don’t say that. This costume was designed by no one less"
than Michelangelo.”
"“All right. At that time they probably looked very well, but now they"
have a theatrical effect.”
"“It is because you have no veneration. If you were reverential, they"
would look wonderful to you.”
"“Very well, let us wait and see whether reverence will not spring up in"
"me. Now, you go on and explain what there is here.”"
"“This first room, the Hall of Audience, or of the Popes, does not"
"contain anything notable, as you see,” said Kennedy; “the five we are"
"coming to later, have been restored, but are still the same as at the"
time when your countryman Alexander VI was Pope. All five were decorated
"by Pinturicchio and his pupils, and all with reference to the Borgias."
"The Borgias have their history, not well known in all its details, and"
"their legend, which is more extensive and more picturesque. Really, it"
"shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not"
"all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,"
"and charity begins at home."""
"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and"
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
"the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than"
"the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey"
"home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and"
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
"himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
"And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe"
"that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."

THE MAGIC APPLES
Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
He showed me his thumbnail; there was no mark on it.
"The newspaper reporters wrote articles and sent telegrams, not only about"
"the Blue Peak and the dreadful death, but about the locality, and about"
"the Tore Peak resort, that haven for the weary, with its wonderful"
buildings set like jewels in the mountains. What a surprise to come here:
"gargoyles, living room, piano, all the latest books, timber outside ready"
"for new jewels in their setting, altogether a magnificent picture of"
Norway's modern farming.
"Yes, indeed, the newspapermen appreciated it. And they did their"
advertising.
The English arrived.
"""Where is Solem?"" they asked, and ""Where is the Blue Peak?"" they asked."
"""We ought to get the hay in,"" said Josephine and the wife at the farm."
"""There'll be rain, and fifty cartloads are still out!"""
"That was all very well, but ""Where is Solem?"" asked the English. So Solem"
"had to go with them. The two casual laborers began to cart away the hay,"
but then the women had no one to help them rake. Confusion was rife.
Everyone rushed wildly hither and thither because there was no one to lead
them.
"The weather stayed fine overnight; it was patient, slow-moving weather. As"
"soon as the dew dried up, more hay would be brought in, perhaps all the"
"hay. Oh, we should manage all right."
"More English appeared; and ""Solem--the Blue Peak?"" they said. Their"
"""I don't know, dearie. He used to take to spells like that when he was"
little. But lately he's got over them. I followed him once and I found
him out in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin' awful--out loud
and beatin' his arms. I let him be. I stole home and I never let on I
knew. When he came back all white lookin' I had a nice cake ready--roll
"jell, his favorite."""
"""Do--do you think he was out in the sand dunes--last night?"""
"""I don't know. He come in about nine o'clock, awful quiet and I didn't"
"ask him anything, but I just set his breakfast before him as though the"
morning wa'n't half over. And then he went off again and I ain't seen
"him sense. I thought mebbe it was these folks of Mr. Dugald's--"""
"""What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?"" But Sidney knew what she meant."
"""Like as not Lav's plain jealous. Mr. Dugald hasn't had any time for"
anything but toting this Pola round everywhere and Lav notices it. He
hasn't any right to be jealous as I can see for Miss Pola is Mr.
"Dugald's own cousin, but Lav thinks the sun rises and sets in Mr."
"Dugald. And like as not he misses you--"""
"""I've missed Lav dreadfully. I didn't know how much I missed him and"
Mart until today when it came over me suddenly that the things I was
doing with Pola weren't really much fun--just at first they were
"because they were different. I'm afraid, Aunt Achsa, that I love"
different things! But tomorrow I am going to play all day long with Lav
"and Mart, see if I don't. I can't wait for tomorrow to come!"""
"""So! We know now what happened to Journeyman and the others!"" burst"
"out Dex. ""I'll see 'em in hell before I'll talk!"""
"""And me,"" nodded Brand. ""But that doesn't cure the situation. As long"
"as ships disappear in this red inferno, so long will the Old Man keep"
sending others to find out what's wrong. The Rogans will capture them
as easily as they captured us. And eventually someone will happen
"along who'll weaken under torture. Then--"""
*       *       *       *       *
He stopped. A dread vision filled his mind of Earth depopulated by the
"feebly ferocious Rogans, of rank on rank of Earth's vast armies"
falling in stricken rows at the shock of the Rogans' tubes.
"Greca caught the vision. She nodded. ""Yes, that is what would happen"
"if they found ways of reaching your globe."""
"""But, God, Brand, we can't allow that!"" cried Dex. ""We've got to find"
"a way to spike the guns of these walking gas-pipes, somehow!"""
"Brand sighed heavily. ""We are two against hundreds of thousands. We"
"are bare-handed, and the Rogans have those damned tubes. Anyway, we"
are on the verge of death at this very moment. What under heaven can
"we do to spike their guns?"""
He was silent a moment: and in the silence the steady hum from the
domed building outside came to his ears.
"""What's in that big, round topped building, Greca?"" he asked quietly."
"""I do not know, exactly,"" replied the girl. ""There is some sort of"

"When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky"
"little brooch he’d given me—a silver bird it was, with a chain in its"
"beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the"
thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.
"“There you are,” I said. “Take them all back,” I said, “it’s all over."
"I’m not going to marry you,” I said, “I can’t leave my lady.” White! he"
"turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I stood,"
"all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the"
"door—believe me or not, madam—that man _was_ gone! I ran out into the"
"road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed"
in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they
saw me....
... Goodness gracious!—What’s that? It’s the clock striking! And here
"I’ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped"
"me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady’s feet, every"
"night, just the same. And she says, “Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and"
"wake early!” I don’t know what I should do if she didn’t say that, now."
"... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were"
"to.... But, there, thinking’s no good to anyone—is it, madam? Thinking"
won’t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up
"sharp, “Now, then, Ellen. At it again—you silly girl! If you can’t find"
anything better to do than to start thinking!...”
“I am not!” sobbed Jessica.
“You are.” He glanced about. No one was in sight. He put his arm about
"her shoulders, forcing her own to her sides, then bent back her head and"
kissed her on the mouth.
“Checkmate!” he said.

GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in San Francisco and received her
"early education in California and Kentucky, but her best"
"training was in her grandfather’s library, a collection, it is"
"said, of English masterpieces only, containing no American"
fiction whatever. Yet Mrs. Atherton is as thorough an American
"as a niece, in the third generation, of Benjamin Franklin should"
be.
It seems to have been the English critics who first recognised
"her originality, power, intensity, vividness, and vitality, but"
"from her first book, “What Dreams May Come,” published in 1888,"
her writings have revealed the unusual combination of brains and
"feeling. This gives her work both keen, clever strength and"
"brilliancy of colour, developed through years of hard work, many"
"of which were spent abroad, and reaching their best"
"manifestation in her latest fiction, the one quality in “The"
Conqueror” and the other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.” Both of
"these books go to prove the foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic,"

"These statistics are taken from the report of the British Parliament,"
"which, for learning and intelligence, as a deliberative body, has not"
"its superior, if it has its equal, in the world, and it is surely a"
"sufficiently Christian body to be accepted as authority in this matter,"
since a large number of its members are clergymen. These statistics
"hardly sustain the allegation that ""Infidelity is coupled with"
"impurity."""
"We are willing to stand upon our record. But, lest it be claimed that"
"this is a British peculiarity, allow me to defer to the patriotic"
"sentiment of my readers by one other little set of tables which, while"
"not complete, is equally as suggestive."
"""In sixty-six different prisons, jails, reformatories, refuges,"

"""If someone 'round here's doing it Cap'n Davies wants to catch him"
himself. He says he doesn't want the reward but he wants to punish the
man who's hurting the honest name of this part of Cape Cod. I think
"that's a grand spirit."""
Lavender's shoulders lifted. Why couldn't someone else save the fair
name of Cape Cod--someone like a crippled boy whom most of the
towns-people looked upon as a loafer?
"""I'd like to catch 'em, myself,"" he said slowly in such a low voice"
that Sidney barely caught the words.
"""Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance as anyone, knowing as much"
"as we do. What'll we do first?"" For Sidney was ready for adventure."
Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping the knife in his hand.
He looked down at it.
"""What we ought to do first is to find out how this knife got here."
Let's put it where we found it and go back around the other side of
that schooner so's no one on the _Puritan_'ll see us. Then we can come
"out late this afternoon and if it's gone--well, we'll know someone came"
"to look for it!"""
"""And then we'd know for sure that someone had been on the _Arabella_."""
"""That's the idea. You get on quickly for a girl, Sid. Come on, now,"
"we'll pull the dory round to the starboard side."""
Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck of the_ Arabella_. In
"her excitement she scarcely breathed. Every move, every act, was"
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.
"""Why, that's from Laura Craig--a cousin of mine. I remember now she"
said she was going to study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the
"Jack Norton immensely, although he knew that chances of survival were"
"better with Norton's boorish, interfering presence than without. He was"
"bored, he was angry, he was above all resentful of the time wasted in"
this spacewreck business....
"An orderly tapped Commodore Wilson on the shoulder. ""Message from"
"Terra,"" he said."
"Wilson groaned and reached for the telephone beside his bunk. ""Wilson"
"here,"" he said. ""Go ahead!"""
"""Admiral Stone. Wilson, a new ship is on the way. I want you to get"
"into this thing fully, so I'm briefing you now."""
"""New type of ship?"""
"""Well, not a new ship, but some new equipment. The Infrawave Section of"
the Space Department Radiation Laboratory has some experimental gear
"they want to try in actual service."""
"""Experimental gear?"""
"""Sheer experiment, Wilson. It's supposed to be an infrawave detecting"
"and ranging device. It's shown low grade response so far, and it may"
be entirely useless to you. But Radiation feels that even something
"incomplete and erratic may be better than going it blind."""
"Wilson sat up, interested. ""How does it work?"""
"""Darned if I know. It took a whole cruiser class to carry the junk"
"that makes it tick. It's piled in with twine and baling wire, and when"
the crate took off the advanced techs were still connecting cables and
murmured.
"The Mater turned her gentle eyes to the fire, and Dad, clearing his"
throat in a blustering way--though he was not at all a blustering
man--replied:
"""Perhaps it's rather decent of us to have a son who--er, I mean,"
"who--well, er----"""
"""A cruise hits me right,"" I exclaimed, hurriedly coming to his rescue,"
"for neither of us wanted a scene. ""And I'll wire Tommy Davis, Mater--the"
chap you mentioned. He's a corking fellow! I didn't write you how the
battalion started calling him 'Rebel' till he closed up half a dozen
"eyes, did I? You see, in the beginning, when we were rookies, the"
"sergeant had us up in formation to get our names, and when he came to"
"Tommy that innocent drawled: 'Mr. Thomas Jefferson Davis, suh, of"
"Loui'ville, Jefferson county, Kentucky, suh.' You could have heard a pin"
"drop. The sergeant, as hard-boiled as they come, stood perfectly still"
"and let a cold eye bore into him for half a minute, then gasped: 'Gawd!"
"What a wicked little rebel!'"""
They laughed.
"""Why didn't you bring him home with you?"""
"""Same reason he couldn't take me home with him. There were people"
"waiting, and turkey, and--but he won't want to go,"" I added. ""He's crazy"
"about a girl down there!"""
"""Fiddlesticks,"" my father chuckled. ""Any normal fellow'll want to"
"cruise! I'll wire him myself--this very night!"""
“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"
corks float.”
"enough wisdom and courage to put this matter before the people?"""
"""Young man, I am not going to pass judgment on anyone in Washington or"
"elsewhere. Each of us, I'm sure, does his duty as he sees it."""
Again it seemed to Senator Crane that he heard a ripple of mirth--louder
this time. It had to be something to do with the acoustics. Except that

course not. He had only to await the verdict of the nation's top
newspapers before proceeding with the publicity program that might well
make him presidential timber.

"Frank Corson sat quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Rhoda crossed"

"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"

down on a boulder.
"Frank followed the boy’s example, except that he stretched himself at"
"full length, while Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering over a"
rim of rock which lay directly in their way.
"“Look here, boys!” Jack finally called. “You remember the place in"
"Mexico called the Devil’s Cauldron? Well, this is it!”"
“What have you found now?” demanded Frank sleepily.
"“Here’s a round hole in the mountain,” Jack answered back, “that you"
might hide a city block in. It’s deep and the sides are almost smooth.
"Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of his characters in, only there’s"
rock instead of sand.”
The boys rose to their feet and looked over the ledge.
"“And right there in the bottom,” Harry exclaimed, “is a pool of water so"
clear that it looks like a diamond!”

gorgeous silk and passed it to one of the men.
"""I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle Sam,"" he said gravely."
"""Our business is with one Jed Starrow."" He turned to Sidney who was"
"trembling violently. ""Now, matie, will you tell these men how you"
"happened to ship aboard the _Arabella_ last night?"""
"Sidney's story tumbled out in quick, eager words and in careful detail."
"The men listened closely. The one who had taken the diamonds ""in trust"
"for Uncle Sam"" made notes in a small black book. When she had finished"
"Cap'n Phin nodded, his face serious."
"""Reckon we'd better not question Lav Green just yet, he's pullin' out"
of the fog. We got enough as 'tis to hold Jed Starrow. If I ain't much
mistaken he'll turn yellow when we face him and squeal on the folks
higher up what's paid him to hurt the name of the Cape. That'll do for
"now, little gal."""

7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.
"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

"And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light ordering--it"
"was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel whips; for, as each"
"change obliterated a footprint of the past, the atmosphere in which the"
boy and man had wrought their career swiftly vanished--the very hint of
an early struggle had departed from the place.
Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face as he
leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed to its
old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from his beloved
things.
Noll’s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent shoulders
of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that the other had
digested the situation.
"He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:"
“Poor Julia!” he said--“ she must never know. She has done this during
"our absence--as a surprise. And,” he added grimly: “it was!”"
Noll smiled:
"“But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You are famous,"
man----”
“Oh yes--quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner--without my wife.”
Noll put out the light:
"“Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat many a day"
and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed at care here;
your watchfulness. I had full information of King Charles's design upon
"my life from no less a person than Monsieur le Grand himself, who showed"
me the letter asking that I be returned to England.
"""I explained to Monsieur le Grand that the English king sought my life,"
"not because he is in fear of me, but because he thought I stood between"
him and a lady who despises him. While Monsieur le Grand was much in
"sympathy with the English king's grievance, his contempt for Charles,"
"his regard for me, which seems to be sincere, and his longing to possess"
"Dunkirk all induced him to laugh at the request, the nature of which he"
had imparted to no one save me.
"""My account of the lady who despised King Charles's love gave Monsieur le"
"Grand a new idea, and suggested a method of purchasing Dunkirk which he"
hopes will save the heavy cost of bidding against the citizens of London.
I had no hint of what he intended till one day he took me to his closet
and began to question me.
"""'Do you possess the love of the lady who despises King Charles?' he"
asked.
"""'I do, your Majesty,' I answered."
"""'Do you know you possess it?' he asked."
"""'As well as a man who is not a king may know,' I returned."
"""'Tush, tush! Kings are no more certain than other men.'"
"""'I know I possess this woman's love,' I said."
"""'Would she be willing to make a great sacrifice to help you?'"
"Understand?"""
"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"
"planning."""
"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"
"to take 'em right now."""
"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
"Four--whom would that come from?"""
"The burly man frowned. ""That would be the physics boys, Opperly's"
"group. Is anything wrong?"""
Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust
"controls, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually"
"he came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting."
"From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the"
six officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to
get used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.

"strongly urged, as it not only simplifies the problem for the printer,"

There was a great wrath in his eyes.

"The dawn was streaking the east with faint gold, and transient"
"sunshafts touched the woods, when Francesco stood before the doorway"
of his lodge of pine boughs. The men of the Duke of Spoleto were
"gathering in on every side, some girding their swords, others"
"tightening their shield-straps, as they came."
The duke ordered a single horn to sound the rally.
"The glade was full of stir and action. Companies were forming up,"
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed; horses steamed in the
brisk morning air.
"At last the tents sank down, and, as the sun cleared the trees, the"
"armed array rolled out from the woods into a stretch of open land,"
that sloped towards the bold curves of a river.
"On that morning Francesco felt almost happy, as his fingers gripped"
his sword and he cantered along by the side of the duke. The great
heart of the world seemed to beat with his.
"""The day of reckoning has come at last!"" he said to the leader of the"
free lances.
domineeringly:
“Giovanni Battista!”
“What is it?”
"“That’s enough, that’s enough! I can hear you from here.”"
"“That’s my wife,” said Giovanni Battista, “she doesn’t like me to be"
lacking in respect for plaster saints.” “You are a pagan!” screamed the
"old woman. “You shall see, you shall see what will happen to you.”"
"“What do you expect to have happen to me, darling?”"
"“Leave her alone,” exclaimed the elder son, ill at ease; “you always"
have to be making mother fly into a rage.”
"“No, my boy, no; she is the one who makes me fly into a rage.”"
"“Giovanni Battista is used to living among gods,” said Kennedy, “and he"
despises saints.”
"“No, no,” replied the cast-maker; “some saints are all right. If all"
"the churches had figures by Donatello or Robbia, I would go to church"
"oftener; but to go and look at those statues in the Jesuit churches,"
"those figures with their arms spread and their eyes rolling.... Oh, no!"
I cannot look at such things.”
Cæsar could see that Giovanni Battista expressed himself very well;
but that he was not precisely a star when it came to working. After the
"mould for the bas-relief was cleaned and fixed, the cast-maker invited"
Cæsar and Kennedy to have a glass of wine in a wine-shop near by.

THE WHAT-SHALL-I-DO GIRL
"Or, The Career of Joy Kent"
_By Isabel Woodman Waitt_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated by Jessie Gillespie. Net $1.25;"
postpaid $1.40_
"When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown on her own"
"resources, after the death of her father, she looks about her, as do"
"so many young girls, fresh from the public schools, wondering how she"
can support herself and earn a place in the great business world about
"her. Still wondering, she sends a letter to a number of girls she had"
"known in school days, asking that each one tell her just how she had"
"equipped herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how"
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply come
"letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian, the"
"salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse, and from girls"
who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a means of livelihood. Real
"Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more like"
the hue of badly-made paste.
"He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour’s sleepy eyes never"
leaving him.
"He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:"
"“A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your cousin, Monsieur"
"Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo of opera-bouffe."
Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in England.”
He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.
Gaston Latour nudged the other youth--they bowed solemnly and withdrew.
“Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!” laughed Quogge Myre.
The following morning Mr. Quilliam O’Flaherty Macloughlin Myre’s name
"was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from the list of those to"
which he had belonged; so it came about that he had to live his day at
cafés.
"And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance with"
"loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about him, vowing that"
he had determined to shake the dust of Paris from off his splay feet
"and to start a great renaissance of the English drama, when a handsome"
"young woman, sister to Gaston Latour, entered the place, walked"
"straight up to Mr. Myre, and struck him a sounding buffet on the ear"
that sent his hat flying from his head.
"pointed, scriggly hand, ""To my little friend.--E. H.""  Fiorsen drew smoke"
"deep down into his lungs, expelled it slowly, and went to the piano.  He"
"opened it and began to play, staring vacantly before him, the cigarette"
"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"
"one against the other!  Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides--besides,"
were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"
music-lessons.  Music-lessons!  Nearly three o'clock.  If he went for
"once and saw what she really did--Went, and offered her his escort home!"
"An attention.  It might please her.  Better, anyway, than waiting here"
until she chose to come in with her face all closed up.  He drank a
little more brandy--ever so little--took his hat and went.  Not far to
"walk, but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy."
A maid-servant opened the door to him.
"""I am Mr. Fiorsen.  Mrs. Fiorsen here?"""
"""Yes, sir; will you wait?"""
Why did she look at him like that?  Ugly girl!  How hateful ugly people
"were!  When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and"
listened.
Chopin!  The polonaise in A flat.  Good!  Could that be Gyp?  Very good!
"He moved out, down the passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly"
turned the handle.  The music stopped.  He went in.
"""He isn't even thinking of coming, the wretch! ..."""
"""That means that he does not love me!"" sang Deacon Taras, leaning his"
chin on his hand and casting a humorous glance towards the mountain.
At last Petunikoff appeared.  He came in a respectable cart with his
"son playing the role of groom.  The latter was a red-checked,"
"nice-looking youngster, in a long square-cut overcoat.  He wore smoked"
"eyeglasses.  They tied the horse to an adjoining tree, the son took the"
"measuring instrument out of his pocket and gave it to his father, and"
they began to measure the ground.  Both were silent and worried.
"""Aha!"" shouted the Captain, gleefully."
All those who were in the dosshouse at the moment came out to look at
them and expressed themselves loudly and freely in reference to the
matter.
"""What does the habit of thieving mean?  A man may sometimes make a big"
"mistake when he steals, standing to lose more than he gets,"" said the"
"Captain, causing much laughter among his staff and eliciting various"
murmurs of assent.
"""Take care, you devil!"" shouted Petunikoff, ""lest I have you in the"
"police court for your words!"""
"""You can do nothing to me without witnesses ...  Your son cannot give"
"evidence on your side"" ... the Captain warned him."
"""Look out all the same, you old wretch, you may be found guilty too!"""
"And Petunikoff shook his fist at him. His son, deeply engrossed in his"
man at my time of life! Do you realize that I am twice her age?”
"And he went on, inveighing now against the pitifully human conventions"
"that restrained him from hurting the chit of a child, and now against"
the sorcery with which she contrived to invest the chamber wherein she
dwelt.
"“And at my age, too, when I 've run the whole gamut of human misery,"
the whole discordant thing--_toute la lyre_--when I've finished with the
"blighting illusion that men call life; when, confound it! I 'm thirty.”"
"Sir Oliver, unable to sleep, came into the room in dressing-gown and"
slippers. He looked very fragile and broken.
"“Here 's John,” laughed Herold, “saying that he 's thirty, and an old,"
"withered man, and he 's not thirty. He 's nine-and-twenty.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at John, as only age, with awful wistfulness, can"
"look at youth, and came and laid his hand upon the young man's broad"
shoulders.
"“My lad,” said he, “you've had a bad time; but you 're young. You've"
"the whole of your life before you. Time, my dear boy, is a marvellous"
"solvent of human perplexity. Once in a new world, once in that"
astonishing continent of Australia--”
John threw a half-finished cigar angrily into the fire.
"“I'm not going to the damned continent,” said he."
"As De Grammont was leaving my closet, he paused at the door, and, after a"
"moment's hesitancy, whispered:--"
"""You may expect a letter from France soon. It will come from M. l'Abbé du"
"Boise, who I hope will come soon to London on the business of my king."
"You know him not--M. l'Abbé?"" The eyebrows lifted questioningly. ""No? You"
"soon will know him, yet you will not know him. You and perhaps a lady may"
"help him in his mission. I, too, shall help him, but I, too, know him"
"not. Yet I know him. If he succeed in his mission, he will be rich, he"
"will be powerful. And I? Mon Dieu, my friend! If he succeed, my decree of"
banishment from Paris--it will be to revoke. I may return once more to
bask in the smile of my king. You must not speak; the lady must not
"speak; I must not speak when Monsieur l'Abbé comes, nor before. It is to"
"silence. Stone walls have one ear."""
"""Two, sometimes, count,"" I suggested, laughing."
"""Yes, I should have said one ears! Non, non! I forget this damnable"
"tongue of yours! When I arrive to great interest, it is to talk faster"
"than it is to think, and--"" A shrug of the shoulders finished the"
sentence.
"""Let us speak French hereafter, my dear count,"" I suggested."
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! It is to me more of pain to hear my sweet language"
"murdered than to murder yours,"" answered Grammont, seriously."
"""Ah, but I speak French quite as well as I speak English. Perhaps I shall"
"not murder it,"" I replied."
"""Perhaps? We shall try,"" he said, though with little show of faith."
Travers nodded.
"""I heard you talking, but I wanted to make sure. It has all been my"
fault--every bit of it. It's decent of you not to make me feel it
"more. You are not to blame--her. You know I tempted her, I made her"
"help me. She isn't responsible. At any rate, she made a clean breast"
of it--that's something to her credit. I didn't want to--I never meant
to. I am not the sort that repents. But this last week you have been
"so decent, and Lois such a plucky little soul--she ought to hate"
"me--and perhaps she does--but she has done her best. Nicholson, are"
you listening? Can you hear what I say? It's so damned hard for me to
"talk."""
"""I can hear,"" Nicholson said kindly. ""Don't worry about what can't be"
"helped."" In spite of everything, he pitied the man, and his tone"
showed it.
"Travers lifted himself higher, clinging to the other's shoulder. His"
"voice began to come in rough, uneven jerks."
"""But it can be helped--it must be helped! Don't you see--I came"
between you and Lois purposely. From the first moment you spoke of her
I knew that you loved her--and I wanted her. I never gave your
message. I didn't dare. You are the sort of man a woman cares for--a
"woman like Lois. I couldn't risk it. But now--well, I'm done, and"
"afterward she will be free--"""
Nicholson drew back stiffly.
"""You are talking nonsense,"" he said, in a colder tone. ""No one wants"
"you to die--and in any case, you know very well we have no chance of"
"getting through this alive."""
_LEGEND AND HISTORY_
"Cæsar went out of the cabinet, leaving the German and Cortés seated on"
"the sofa, absorbed in the picture; he looked at various paintings in the"
"gallery, went back, and sat down, beside the artists."
"“This portrait,” he said presently, “is like history by the side of"
"legend. All the other paintings in the gallery are legend, ‘folk-lore,’"
as I believe one calls it. This one is history.”
"“That’s what it is. It is truth,” agreed Cortés."
"“Yes, but there are people who do not like the truth, my friend. I tell"
"you: this is a man of flesh, somewhat enigmatic, like nature herself,"
and with arteries in which blood flows; this is a man who breathes and
"digests, and not merely a pleasant abstraction; you, who understand such"
"things, will tell me that the drawing is perfect, and the colour such"
as it was in reality; but how about the person who doesn’t ask for
reality?”
"“Stendhal, the writer, was affected that way by this picture,” said"
Cortés; “he was shocked at its being hung among masterpieces.”
"“He found it bad, no doubt.”"
“Very bad?”
“Was this Stendhal English?”
"""Ay! But enough to make a garden,"" I returned, as we climbed the narrow"
flight of steps leading to the private entrance to the Old Swan.
"When we paused at the door, Frances said, ""Your garden is at hand."" And"
"when she opened the door, there stood Betty, and I was in Eden. The moist"
"glow of her eyes, the faint blush of her cheeks, the nervous fluttering"
"of her voice, spoke more eloquently than all the tongues of Babel could"
"have spoken, and I could not help comparing her welcome with that which"
Maxy Hamilton had given me at the queen's ball.
"Bettina led us to the parlor, and while we were drinking a cup of tea,"
we had the great pleasure of asking and answering questions of which we
always had a large supply in reserve.
"When it was time to go, Bettina walked down to the Bridge with us. As it"
"was growing dark, Frances suggested that I walk back to the Old Swan with"
"Betty, which I did, she taking my arm of her own accord, and both of us"
"very happy, though we spoke not a word, for fear of saying too much, save"
"""good night"" at the door."
"""Good night at the door!"" God gave its sweetness to youth right out of"
the core of His infinite love.
CHAPTER XII
A PERILOUS EMBASSY
"Four or five days after our visit to Bettina, I met De Grammont at"
sweep of his oar sculling shoreward through the murky night. Over the
"castellated walls of La Cabaña raced low, angry clouds. Was it a storm"
"brewing, or had some supernal madness touched the night?"
"The watch forward called in a guarded voice: ""All right, sir?"" to which"
"I answered, ""All right,"" then went cautiously across deck and crept down"
"the companionway stairs. The cabin was dark so I felt for my stateroom,"
passed in and closed the door. Somehow my fingers could not locate the
"light jet, but what matter? In three minutes I had undressed and was"
fast asleep.
CHAPTER IV
NIRVANA
"A pleasant sense of motion came over me that suggested cradling waves,"
and I was sleepily wondering why we had gone out on a day that portended
"storms, when a tapping at my stateroom door was followed by someone"
whispering:
"""Aren't you ever going to get up, you lazy old dear?"""
It was a girl's voice.
"Gradually and cautiously I drew the sheet about my chin, feeling no"
little confused to have a girl five feet away whispering pet names at me
through a thin partition.
Inserts[42] are almost always printed upon coated paper.
"Laid[42] paper is used in more expensive books, as, from its nature,"
better and more costly stock is required in its making.
THE PRESSWORK
"Books are printed in forms[42] of 4 pages and multiples of 4 pages,"
"depending upon the size of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,"
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to make approximately even
forms. To print any number of pages over an even form is as expensive
as to print the complete 32 pages.[43]
THE BINDING
"In binding, the questions to be settled include the style of"
"back,--flat, half-round, or round; plain or gilt-top; headband[45]"
"or not; trimmed or uncut edges;[44] kind of cloth,--T pattern,[45]"
"silk,[45] vellum,[45] etc.; color and shade of cloth; location of dies;"
"stamping,--ink, foil, gold or Oriental tissue, etc.; jacket,--glassine,"
"manila, or printed."
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOK
"THE proper layout for an ordinary volume, arranged in accord with the"
"best usage, is as follows:"
and an uneasy eye.
"“That is the Hungarian violinist Kolozsvar,” said Susanna."
"“Kolozsvar, Kolozsvar!” they heard everybody saying."
“Is he a great virtuoso?” Cæsar asked Kennedy.
"“No, I think not,” answered Kennedy. “It seems that this Hungarian’s"
"speciality is playing the waltzes and folk-songs of his own country,"
which is certainly not anything great; but his successes are not
"obtained with the violin, but among the women. The ladies in London"
"fight for him. His game is to pass himself off as a fallen man,"
"depraved, worn-out. There you have his phraseology.... They see a man to"
"save, to raise up, and convert into a great artist, and almost all of"
them yield to this temptation.”
"“That is comical,” said Cæsar, looking curiously at the fiddler and his"
lady.
"“To a Spaniard,” replied Kennedy, “it is comical; and probably it would"
be to an Italian too; but in England there are many women that have a
"purely imaginative idealism, a romanticism fed on ridiculous novels, and"
"they fall into traps like these, which seem clumsy and grotesque to you"
"here in the South, where people are more clear-sighted and realistic.”"
"Cæsar watched the brave fiddler, who played the role of a man used up,"
to great perfection.
"After tea, Susanna invited them to go up to her rooms, and Laura and her"
brother and Kennedy and Mr. Russell went.
"half the listeners, had known the lady as Mrs. Medland."
"""No,"" said Mr. Medland; ""I lost sight of him."""
"""You did not hear from--from any one about him?"""
"""No."""
He gave the dates when he had last seen Benyon in old days. Asked
whether he had communicated with him between that date and the dead
"man's reappearance, he answered,"
"""Once, about four years ago. I wrote to tell him of that lady's death,"""
"and he pointed again to the picture, and went on to tell the details of"
Benyon's subsequent application to him for a post under Government.
"""You refused it?"" he was asked."
"""Yes, I refused it. I spoke to him once again, when we met on a social"
occasion. We had a sort of dispute then. I never saw him again to speak
"to."""
"""It was all done,"" said Mr. Duncombe, describing the scene, ""in a"
repressed way that was very effective--to a house that knew the
circumstances most effective. And the other fellow--Kilshaw--he gave
"some sport too. The coroner (they told me he was one of Medland's men,"
and I noticed he spared Medland all he could) was inclined to be a bit
"down on Kilshaw. Kilshaw was cool and handy in his answers, but, Lord"
love you! his game came out pretty plain. A monkey! You don't give a man
"a monkey unless there's value received! So people saw, and Mr. Kilshaw"
looked a bit uncomfortable when he caught Medland's eye. He looked at
"him like that,"" and Mr. Duncombe assumed the finest wronged-hero glance"
Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward
and faced Bob.
"“I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” he snapped viciously."

"He brought into Port Royal in 1684 a merchant ship, _La Trompeuse_."
"Pretending to be the owner, he sold both ship and cargo, which brought"

All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely stood watching

"at her. ""Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got to stand"

"For such speeches, delivered in a strictly business-like manner, and"

"""Let's hope,"" the Captain said. ""Like any father used to say, a man who"

"it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted"
"in space. You can lower your hands now, son."""
We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested.
He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to
use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the
way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about
"carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days,"
"captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns"
in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our
ancestors did.
"The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down."
"""Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please."""
"""What did you stick him for?"" he asked. ""What was the price?"""
"Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she"
"thought better of it and laughed. ""Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm"
"elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago."""
"""And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!"" the Captain"
muttered as we spun up to the brig.
The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came
up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found
Simonetta gave her mother what was indispensable for household expenses
and managed the rest herself.
Kennedy retailed this information the first day they went to Giovanni
"Battista Lanza’s house. Cæsar could see Simonetta keeping the books,"
"while the small brother, in a white blouse that came to his heels, was"
"chasing a dog, holding a pipe in his hand by the thick part, as if it"
"were a pistol, the dog barking and hanging on to the blouse, the small"
"boy shrieking and laughing, when Signora Vittoria came bawling out."
"Kennedy presented Simonetta to his friend Cæsar, and she smiled and"
gave her hand.
“Is Signore Giovanni Battista here?” Kennedy asked Signora Vittoria.
"“Yes, he is in the court.” she answered in her gloomy way."
“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
head.
"""One must learn by experience,"" Petunikoff reassured him, lighting a"
cigarette.
"""Learn ...  It is not that, my dear sir; but don't you see there is no"
freedom?  Don't you see what a life I lead?  I live in fear and
trembling ...  I am refused the freedom so desirable to me in my
"movements, and I fear this ghost of a teacher will write about me in"
the papers.  Sanitary inspectors will be called for ... fines will have
to be paid ... or else your lodgers will set fire to the place or rob
and kill me ... I am powerless against them.  They are not the least
"afraid of the police, and they like going to prison, because they get"
"their food for nothing there."""
"""But then we will have them turned out if we come to terms with you,"""
promised Petunikoff.
"""What shall we arrange, then?"" asked Vaviloff, sadly and seriously."
"""Tell me your terms."""
"""Well, give me the six hundred mentioned in the claim."""
"""Won't you take a hundred roubles?"" asked the merchant, calmly, looking"
"attentively at his companion, and smiling softly.  ""I will not give you"
"one rouble more,"" ... he added."
"After this, he took out his eye-glasses, and began cleaning them with"
his handkerchief.  Vaviloff looked at him sadly and respectfully.  The
"calm face of Petunikoff, his grey eyes and clear complexion, every line"
of his thickset body betokened self-confidence and a well-balanced
"""With gratitude,"
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"I sought Frances, and when I told her the substance of George's letter,"
she was almost wild with joy.
"""Am I willing to try?"" she exclaimed, laughing while tears were hanging"
"in her eyes. ""I am not only willing to try, but am determined to succeed."
"Ay, I'd sell England itself in the same cause. Of all the men I have ever"
"known, this king of ours is the greatest dupe. Since the return of the"
"court to Whitehall, he has been growing more importunate every day. He"
"seems to have lost what little wits he had, and does and says the"
"silliest things one can imagine."""
"""And you do not fear attempting to lead him on to sell Dunkirk? You do"
"not fear going too near the precipice?"" I asked, wishing to weigh her"
self-confidence more by the manner of her reply than by her words.
"She laughed and answered: ""There is no precipice, cousin Ned; nothing to"
"fear save kidnapping, and I am always guarded against that danger;"
"nothing to do of which I need feel ashamed, save the acting of a lie, and"
"surely one may lie to the father of lies without sin."""
"""But the lie may be recognized,"" I suggested, ""if one be too bold about"
"it."""
"""My lie will go little beyond a smile or two. The king's vanity will do"
"the rest. He will make himself believe that I mean more than I say."""
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox, the weapons of the ruler will prevail"
over the weapons of the enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox that has _ganni_[87], the ruler will"
weaken the land of his enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox with two tails, omen of Ishbi-Ura[88],"
who was without a rival.
"If an ewe gives birth to a cow, the king will die, another king will"
draw nigh and divide the country.
One might have supposed that such omens represent a purely imaginative
"theoretical factor, but the introduction of the historical reference"
proves conclusively that the Babylonians and Assyrians attached an

'How?' my lady muttered.
"'He swore at me,' Marie answered in the same tone. 'And he spoke of"
you--somehow differently.'
"The Countess laughed, but far from joyously. 'I suppose to-night--I"
must see him?' she said. She tried as she spoke to press herself more
"deeply into the pillows, as if she might escape that way. Her flesh"
"crept, and she shivered though she was as hot as fire."
Once or twice in the hours which followed she was almost beside
herself. Sometimes she prayed. More often she walked up and down the
"room like one in a fever. She did not know on what she was trusting,"
"and she could have struck Marie when the girl, appealed to again and"
"""To please me."""
Mr. Wagge's readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist. He
"answered, in a voice that he strove to make bland:"
"""If you put it in that way, I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; but it"
"must be quite between you and me--I can't withdraw my attitude."""
Gyp murmured:
"""No, of course.  Thank you so much; and you'll let me know about"
"everything later.  I mustn't take up your time now.""  And she held out"
her hand.
Mr. Wagge took it in a lingering manner.
"""Well, I HAVE an appointment,"" he said; ""a gentleman at Campden Hill.  He"
"starts at twelve.  I'm never late.  GOOD-morning."""
"When she had watched his square, black figure pass through the outer"
"gate, busily rebuttoning those shining black gloves, she went upstairs"
and washed her face and hands.
"For several days, Fiorsen wavered; but his collapse had come just in"
"time, and with every hour the danger lessened.  At the end of a fortnight"
"of a perfectly white life, there remained nothing to do in the words of"
"the doctor but ""to avoid all recurrence of the predisposing causes, and"
"shove in sea air!""  Gyp had locked up all brandy--and violins; she could"
control him so long as he was tamed by his own weakness.  But she passed
"some very bitter hours before she sent for her baby, Betty, and the dogs,"
and definitely took up life in her little house again.  His debts had
"it, though we know better. Do not disown us. You know how triumphantly"
"certain letters of yours are circulated, in which, to protect yourself"
"from suspicion, you rather meanly fasten it on others ... If you are now"
"afraid to incur a little hostility for _my_ sake, concede me at least"
"that you will not allow yourself, out of fear for another, to be tempted"
to renounce me; rather be silent about me.'
Those were bitter reproaches. In the man who had to swallow them there
"was a puny Erasmus who deserved those reproaches, who took offence at"
"them, but did not take them to heart, who continued to act with prudent"
reserve till Hutten's friendship was turned to hatred. In him was also a
"great Erasmus who knew how, under the passion and infatuation with which"
"the parties combated each other, the Truth he sought, and the Love he"
"hoped would subdue the world, were obscured; who knew the God whom he"
professed too high to take sides. Let us try ever to see of that great
Erasmus as much as the petty one permits.

"'Five only,' I answered. 'They are all Steve could get, and they are a"

and young Jacob and Ernst are watching outside. Are all ready?'
"My lady looked round; her eye fell on Fraulein Max, who with a little"
bundle in her arms had just re-entered and stood shivering by the
"door. The Dutch girl winced under her glance, and dropping her bundle,"
stooped hurriedly to pick it up.
'That woman does not go!' the Countess said suddenly.

"The Ship shall remain in the Custody of the Marshal, or of such Officer,"

Chapter IV
HOLLAND
NOTE ON LITERATURE
The special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led
in past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was
given to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low
"Countries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,"
"folio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;"
"in Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of"
the kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon
the United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers
further foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions
of the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century
many English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An
English translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously
"known as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,"
"""Or open the cottage, if you'd rather,"" she excitedly interrupted him."
"""I hadn't intended leaving New York this winter, but will chaperon a"
"house party if you like!"""
"""Fiddlesticks! Cruise, by all means,"" he spoke with good-natured"
"emphasis. ""Get another fellow, and go after adventures and romances and"
"that kind of thing! Go after 'em hammer and tongs! By George, that's"
"what I'd do if I were a boy, and had the chance!"""
"They waited, rather expectantly."
"""Cruising's all right,"" I said, without enthusiasm. ""But it's a waste of"
"time to go after romance and adventure. They died with the war."""
"""Ho!--they did, did they?"" he laughed in mock derision. ""What's become"
"of your imagination--your vaporings? You used to be full of it!"" And the"
Mater supported him by exclaiming:
"""Why, Jack Bronx! And I used to call you my Pantheist! Don't tell me"
your second sight for discovering the beautiful in things has failed
"you!"""
"""It got put out by mustard gas, maybe,"" I murmured, remembering with"
bitterness some of the fellows who had been with me.
"What was romance here to the colorful, high-tensioned thing I had seen"
in devastated areas where loves of all gradations were torn and
scattered and trampled into the earth like chaff! Fretfully I told them
this.
"They exchanged glances, yet she continued in coaxing vein:"

I put r in the conference room.
You did?
I did.
"No,I did."
- His fianc?
"- Yeah,his fianc?"
.
Tall?
Light brown hair?
Redhead.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in jackson,pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That james finn has been dead three months.
He left for iraq three nths ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay,but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engad to jimmy,too?"
"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
- Shut up!
"So, I'm killing all these girls..."
He's riding next to me wondering who's doing it.
We're investigating the crimes.
Me and my partner.
"You've been a very bad boy, fucking your new partner."
"Did you get fucked, honey?"
"Well, Tommy has made a career out of fucking his partners."
- Let the girl go.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.
"- Bye-bye, Tommy."
- Jimmy!
I like this game.
"Everybody dies, and they all die with Tommy's gun."
Now we've got us a game.
"- Say goodbye to her, Tommy."
"- Jimmy, don't do it!"
"- Jimmy, no!"
- Say goodbye to her.
Jimmy!
"Put the gun down, son."
Please.
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
"- What fun would that be, Dad?"
"It's all over, son."
Put the gun down.
- It's just starting.
- Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy?
Comments?
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.
"- Come on, open your eyes!"
- Snap out of it!
Get your morning paper!
Read all about it!
Paper!
Get your morning paper!
Read all about it!
Paper!
- Holy Toledo!
"- I took him, Gus!"
I'll say he took him!
That last right hurt me!
On the table!
"You missed a great bout, Gus!"
"Oh, you should've seen it, Gus!"
Stoker hit him with everything but the bucket!
- He was landing as often as the Marines!
- Boy!
- I'll take care of that!
- Stoker was sharper than eight razor blades!
- He got careless!
- After the third heat!
!
"I know the kid is a gone gosling, an amateur!"
"Somebody yelled, ""Yoo-hoo, Nelson, you dropped your glove!"""
"He sure did, and his duke was in it!"
- There!
- How's that eye?
It's a beaut!
I can't wait to see Nelson's hand!
- Where's Tiny and Red?
- They ain't been in here!
Huh ?
"Oh, yeah, whatever."
"I mean, sure, if you want to."
We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport.
First would be...
Luke at Holly's beach house.
"Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
Right.
At the diner.
"Yeah, and again at the mall."
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.
"Yeah, in T.J."
"Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic ?"
"Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away ?"
Hmm.
"Well, we have checked everywhere else."
Light.
Be careful.
Oh... gross.
It's okay.
What is that ?
That's Uncle Alistair.
That's your uncle ?
Yeah.
No.
"It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school."
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.
"God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
Okay.
- The driver probably ran out of coal.
- Probably forgot his ration book.
"Now remember, Billy, you've just to point him out to me."
"Don't you worry, sir."
I could recognise Faber in a stocking mask.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Thank you.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Blackout.
"Come on, give us a bit of room, pal."
Someone take him away.
Come on.
Blimey.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Be still or I'll kill you.
Why are you looking for me?
- I'm not.
- Don't lie.
"Has the army changed its uniforms, Billy?"
What's the plan?
Where's the trap?
Glasgow.
They're waiting for you at Glasgow.
"So they finally let you in the army, did they, Billy?"
Congratulations.
"Oh, my God!"
Thank you.
You've been terribly kind.
You won't change your mind and have a spot of lunch?
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!

"Besides, I told your mom I'm watching out for you."
I'll see you later.
"Okay, bye."
- Bye.
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!
You will never touch me again.
"Dino, thanks again for letting me pay over the phone."

And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
Yes.
"Sure, why not?"
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey.
"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Hi.

"You know Candace, in catering?"
- My first wife.

Yeah.
Candy Kanaskie.
No wonder she left me.
Omelettes.
"Sure, a bachelor's standby."
"Oh, I'm married."
"Oh yeah, you said first wife."
I assumed that meant there was a second.
And third.
I was talking about me.
Omelettes are my standby.
Sausage?

"So what, after the lawyer who went gay, you figure, what, one then done?"

Kanaskie classic.
"Yeah, my exes, they blamed the job too."
"No kids, though, unless you count the ones I supervise here."
"It's a lot, but they just didn't understand what it takes."
Bye.
Hello?

"Excuse me, I thought you were Cristina."
I got the wrong number.
Sorry.
Fermín?
I'm Max.
"Hey, don't you remember Cristina's number by any chance?"
What do you mean Cristina who?
"Well, some years went by but... you know Cristina."
"Yes, of course, that Cristina!"
All of a sudden I thought I could remember her number.
Yes that's right.
It's possible that she doesn't live there anymore.
"But, I don't know."
Nothing in particular.
I just... wanted to know how she was.
"Well, I'll find her anyways."
Thanks a lot Fermín.
Bye.
Can you put Father Urlieta on the phone please?
Thank you.
Father Urlieta?
I'm an old student from high school.
My name is Máximo Gascón.
They called me Max.
Yes...
I think you should remember.
You taught me religion for 4 years!
Of course it was a lot time ago... 30...
More than 30 years ago I think.
That was a long-ass leg.
Ain't know where the hell I was going with that.
"That's just a long-ass, Wendy Williams-sized leg."
Damn!
It was big--
You ain't been here the whole show?
"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""

"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"
Biggie Smalls and Tupac.
That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.
Just cool.

"- Red, can you move over?"
I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.
"You know, I used to be a purty good whistler."
"I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes"
"I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it."
He can fix about anything.
That's why we made him the judge.
"Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow."
"Now, I'm not one to brag but people come purty far to see me get low on the ""Mow-Mow""."
Oh!
"- Aw, man, that's just great!"
"- Hey, what's wrong?"
My lucky sticker's all dirty.
"Ah, that ain't nothin'."
I'll clean it for ya.
"No, no, no!"
That won't be necessary.
Hey!
"Hey, big fella!"
"Yeah, you in the red!"
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.
Where's he goin'?
Boss.
- What's her name?
The one in green.
- Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
- What is?
"He's good-looking, he could have any girl."
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
"Take the car, I don't mind."
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning 200 workers with pickets blocked the national highway at four different spots...
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'm coming!
I'm alone.
- Can I come in'?
"- Yeah, sure."
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
"- It's Carmen, she's dead."
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Send it to Madrid.
Uh!
- Ow!
"- Oh, sorry, babe."
What were you aiming for?
"Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling."
"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not...
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
Are we OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"I mean, we had the talk, right?"
"It's just that every time you look at me, it's like you want to run away."
"Nah, no, no way!"
"Or if I do, it's just 'cause I'm busy."
"You know, I got places to be, stuff to do, you know, just like you."
"OK, well, as long as we're cool."
Cool as a...
Cool thing.
Look at them all.
They think I killed her.
Nobody thinks that.
Do they Fiona?
'Course not.
Terrible news.
So you better leave at once!
Down there!
Surround them!
Don't move!
"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?
Sisters!
It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
(STOMACH GURGLING)
Just hold that thought and stay right there.
Oh-oh.

DEAN:
Little lower.
Little bit lower...
Hey.
I thought you were in trouble.
DEAN:
That sucks.
Let me just...
Up a little.
I had to ditch this weird guy who's staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.
Yeah?
"Well, smart guy, what would you have him do?"
(MAKES ENGINE SOUNDS) Main systems on.
Main engines.
"One, two and three."
All systems go.
"Five, four, three two, one!"
Blast off!
(SCREAMING)
We're landing.
We're landing!
"I feel your anger, yes!"
"Yes, I got your blood pumping, yes?"
No?
Now use it!
Harness it!
Hmm.
Boom!
Everybody into the children's pose!
Heads down.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
Yes?
"Yes, good."
Let's breathe.
"Excuse me, Salvadore?"
I feel like my sacrum is really tight.
Could you just help me stretch it out a little?
"Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband."
Great.
"Boom, boom."
-.
Boom.
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.
What if Joey had seen?
"Lucy, it was really inappropriate."
"Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt."
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's drop it.
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable.
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!
Where did the tomato go?
Show us a fucking triple lutz!
Get back or I'll jump!
-No you won't.
"Don't you know your old friends anymore, King?"
Garbage Jesse!
Dammit...
It's been a while.
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary... all's right with the world."
"$10,000."
"10,000."
Cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just... no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What?
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"""Morally outraged"", he said."
Threatened to call the police.
And Badger's gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?
"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
- No!
- For safety!
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
"Talk to me, guys!"
Come on.
Just tell me what you want!
Jesus!
"No, no, no."
No.
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio!
He's the one!
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
(lock rattles)
George?
"George, please let me in."
Are you from the printers?
We've been waiting...
Madame Sand.
Pardon.
please excuse... (murmuring)
Madame Sand is on her way up.
Don't do that!
(whistles) It is rather far.
"- I'II have to face her, that's all."
- alfred!
I'II be perfectly behaved.
Even a little scornful.
"No, you won't."
You'II be impossible.
I don't want a scene.
Now get in there.
And hurry up!
"hello, George!"
I wasn't expecting you till next month.
"- How are the children, the country?"
- Fine.
Listen.
"I need another 3,000 francs."
What happened to the advance you got?
You know my expenses.
"The children, the estate, my mother's nursing home..."
The divorce took half of everything.
AII right.
But let me have one more instalment first.
Then her shoes disappear in the light of the lamp.
"It blinds me, so I close my eyes"
and her face is gone.
Thanks for the flowers.
Did you bring me some licorice?
I forgot.
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
Get up and do your exercises.
Yes.
The mice have a picnic on a mountain.
"They lay down a tablecloth, a tray."
Can I have some?
- No.
"It's not for you, it's for the mice."
"Everyone gets some cake, except for the baby, because it's too hard for her."
She only drinks.
Gonki.
"My Gonki, my Gonki."
"It went by fast, huh?"
What am I talking about?
It's over.
I have to put it behind me.
"It's easy for us to say, but for you?"
It's over.
Where's Ora?
Having some tests done.
She couldn't cancel them.
She didn't tell me about any tests.
She said the swelling went down a few weeks ago.
Hello.
"Hello, Daddy."
- Hello.
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...
Four...
"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."
Three.
I'll give you a hint.
I'm left-handed.
"Left-handed, left-handed."

I'll file for a dna search warrant.
What's the name?

I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... yomiss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why,do you miss me?"
"Uh,sure."
Boss... agent lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At finn,us,t world."
"Go back with her to h apartment,get finn's stuff."
"And,no,I don'want to wait for a search warrant."
I'll grab my coat.
Wait at the elevator.
Okay.
"Hey,you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah,you."
Did you and jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
- He used you.
- You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!

Did you see my ear?
Out of my way!
Here I come!
Here I come!
"Hey, look, its lasers light up."
"Take that, Zurg!"
"Quick, make a space."
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
"Come on down, guys!"
It's time for games!
We've got prizes!
-What is it?
-Can you see it?
-What the heck is up there?
"-Woody, who's up there with ya?"
Woody?
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'.
Nothin'.
"I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all."
"Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose."
It's just a mistake!
"Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody."
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
"Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome."
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
"Come in, Star Command."
"Star Command, come in."
-Oh my God.
Mom says we should pull ourselves.
It can also ye are not.
It's crisis.
"Lars, you must talk to her."
"I've tried, but she is furious because we conducted the tour."
But you must have the agreement.
Lars.
"I have not seen him in 20 years, since the trial."
So he stands here.
Totally sick.
You just do not let her run over you.
Not this time.
-No.
She takes well to mind.
"Yeah, talk to her."
-Hey it's me.
-I do not know if I want to talk.
-How did it go with Tim?
-It goes well good with him.
He spoke to me twice without screaming.
"Angie, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry I went.
-Are you all right?
You were right.
It was a bad idea to come here.
-Has Something happened?
No.
I'm going home soon.
We can do as you said.
I might take me a little time off from work.
Maybe we can go somewhere.
(LAUGHING)
"Never mind him, he's mad."
Come along.

I suppose this makes us even now.
Um forced herself on me.
"I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me."
Off with her head!
"Stand back, Mallymkun."
How's this for muchness?
"No, no!"
It mustn't be used for anything...
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
-Take it to the White Queen.
-I'm not leaving without you.
Go!
"Run, Alice!"
Alice?
Run!
Seize her.
Alice.
Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then."
-Give me the sword.
-Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
No one is there.
Hey why are you peeking and scaring my girlfriend?
I'm not scaring her.
Look at my back.
Hey why me?
Brother for god sake look at my back.
Hey I'm not like that.
Neither am I.
I've been shot!
Look at my back.
Stop the car.
I'll count to 3.
You can't die.
Shall I shoot.
This diamond is gone.
And the other diamond...
Fake diamond.
Papa will be shocked once he sees it.
This is the 20 crores diamond.
Do you know?
Why do I've myself called Papa?
Why Papa?
Because Demelo only knows about having.
Pa Pa...
Papa.
And you came back and left the diamond.
You know that electricity only comes for 2 hours a day.
And you let it go to waste.
Tell me...
Where is the diamond?
Like every time electricity went this time too.
Now it'll be back Tommorow.
You're a performing bear!
Are the countess and Monsieur Liszt at home?
"I will see, madame."
Is that the new baby?
She's adorable.
Can I hold her?
Darling.
- Countess!
"- Hello, George."
I just saw the new baby.
She's adorable.
Was it a difficult labour?
Very.
What brings you to Paris?
- My mother's ill.
- Oh.
I've been so depressed.
Seeing friends again will do me good.
How's Franz?
He's very well.
Have you seen the charming Chopin?
No.
- Why do you ask?
- Marie...
I've tried so hard to put him out of my mind.
You want him very badly.
"For a few heavenly minutes I thought I had him, too."
"In Angers, remember, I wore that dress."
Our eyes met...
You won't get him with a dress.
"On the contrary, my dear."
I know the man.
I want revenge!
He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
"It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back!
"Although the charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
"No, no, no, no, no."
"I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I...
I woke up.
Yeah.
That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy?
Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.
Hello.

"You sure can pick 'em, Doyle."
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
"Someone told me the reason why you do that is... ..when you meet a chick and you rub up against her,... ..she can't tell you're a cop."
I said it's bullshit.
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.
"Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?"
He's gettin' too far ahead.
You're gonna lose him.
"For Christ's sake, move the car!"
What the hell is goin' on here?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?

Abrasion of the left testicle.
It took 3 stitches.
The bullet missed the artery...
He sure was lucky.
We're always lucky.
Incredibly lucky.
The golden touch.
Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.
"Don't worry, just hand over your dough."
I don't have any on me I have to go to the bank.
No kidding?
I just used my last check.
You're not putting me on?
Just a thought...
You can take a look.
"No, thanks."
Talked to your husband about going overseas?
"Yes, I've been talking to him."
"Yes, I know."
"You've been a perfect angel about it, but I've changed my mind."
You have?
I think that Robert should go.
Are you sure Bob wants to?
"All right, Gretchen,"
I'll tell my husband that Bob's changed his mind.
"Oh, thank you, Karen."
You're such a darling!
I'll tell him he should have his orders in the next 24 hours.
"Goodbye, Gretchen."

"Listen, if I leave my suitcase, will you send it to me?"
I guess so.
You're just gonna sneak out of here without saying goodbye to anyone?
"Well, I have to."
"You say goodbye to Nancy for me, huh?"
What do you want me to tell her?
"Tell her, uh..."
"Just tell her goodbye, huh?"

"You see, I don't feel anything, isn't that great?"

Yes.
Would you like some of ours?
Hello!
"Girl, there's no paper in my room."
Why don't you check these things?
"That's what you're being paid for, isn't it?"
- We don't put it in the rooms.
- What?
We keep it in the lounge.
In the lounge?
I'll watch myself.
Just give me a chance to prove myself.
I'm different now.
Really.

I can't!
I'm getting impatient!
You have been VERY naughty!

"You said the man was here, the cloud man."
"Well, he's not, is he?"
Where's the Doctor?
I don't know!
Doctor?
Doctor who?
That's the way to do it!
"Oi, Ow!"
Where did she go?
Will she come back?
"No, don't worry."
She's currently draining through your carpet.
"New setting, anti-freeze, and you're very welcome, by the way."
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.
"No, you didn't, because I don't."
Because this isn't the sort of thing
I do any more.
"Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to..."
Yours?
I won it.
You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."
Thank you.
Polly.
"Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?"
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?
"No, no, that came in third."
Uh...
Fishwife!
Is it still beauty?
Thank you for letting me know.
Your real look!
So I thought...
I also should tell you.
It's my real look!
My father was the same.
Bald head!

- Xiao Xue!
Bald head.
What can I do for hereditary?
It's okay.
Don't cry anymore!
I'm sorry!
"I wish one day,"
I can use my own design to build my own garden!
A place as nice as paradise!
"In that paradise,"
- will I be there?
- Of course!
"Because of you, it becomes my paradise!"
Oh!
Wait...
"When I'm graduate, let's get married, how is it?"
- Hello!
"- Xiamu,"
Xiaotian is leaving tomorrow...
Come to have dinner with us!
Xiamu?
Are you still there?
"Someone stands beside you, would it be me?"
Pretend?
What?
"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia?
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
No!

This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than hour ago.
Did you hear anything?

Huh.

I can't hang out with you.
Why?
"Because of what you did, Chip!"
You sold out the whole population.
"- Aw, Cooler, come on, man."
"Not you, too?"
- No!
- Of all people.
"- Dude, no."
"Your actions, Chip, they have causes, dude."
"And those causes, there's an effect."

I gave it to him a longtime ago.
Any kids?
You're still young.

Our father.
And who is that?
What did you want from me?
Are you Algerian?

This is your mother and this is you.

She's obviously very brave.

Oh God.
You're lying to me.
You have to be lying.

"I don't know anything about robbing, but I do know that two weeks is not enough time."
"No, two weeks is the perfect amount of time."
It's not enough time.
That's more than enough time.
"Yeah, so much time."
Oh my God.
We can do a lot in two weeks.
Plenty of time.

He's my brother...

What did you want to transmit anyway?
That we landed at the wrong place?

Get this out of here.
Clean it up now.
Did you get my husband on the phone?
The hotel said he checked out.
Can't you do anything right?
Call again!
- I tried three times.
- Did you ask for the right name?
It's.
"De la Paix, I'm sure you got it wrong."
De La Paix It's not that hard.
I'm certain that I said it right.
The hotel specifically said that Mr. And Mrs. De la Paix... checked out.
"Jocelyn, I'm so terribly sorry for the way I behaved."
I'm off to London for a week.
It's my father's birthday.
I'll see you at the Return Bash.
I see your giant elephant's cock.
I want it inside me.
I really do.
Now it's inside me.
-Right.
Are you there?
There's no one here.
"Hi, daddy."
Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!
I'll get them.
Two rolls of wide duck tape.
This is all we've got.
One price for all.
And here's some fuse.
Keep the change.
I'm getting chills.
-I'm getting nauseous.
-I'm getting rich.

There's nothing to it.

-Use your footwork.
He's not moving.
"[CROWD YELLING, BOOING OVER TV]"
"Come on, Bull."
Do something.
The Battling Bailiff has yet to come out of his corner.
-You're very calm about all this.
-It's all part of the act.
"No, this isn't in the script."
"Wait, wait, he's moving."
"I told you, it's a sure thing."
The only way I can lose is if he left the ring.
He's leaving the ring.
"Bull, what are you doing?"
I could have burned the money.
It would have been quicker.
It's that kind of performance that gives this game a bad name.

She was having so much fun with that little girl.
"And then i saw the father, and he was flying a kite with his son."
They were having fun.
And there was a couple...
A couple about my age...
And they were
"On a blanket in the middle of the park,"
"Just laughing, enjoying each other."
And i thought about the fact
That i have never been on a blanket...
- Oh.
- ...with marcus.
- Oh.
"- I think i just passed so many opportunities, ma."
I...
I haven't been a good mother.
- I haven't been a good wife.
- Oh.
Oh.
"I want those chances back,"
And i think it's too late.
I never sat on a blanket and had a picnic.
"Oh, regina."
I never had fun with my child.
I never...
I never pushed monica on a swing.
- Oh.
"- Mom, i wanna change my life."
- Oh.

It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Did you do that?
Do it again.

You speak Latin?

Good.
That's nice.
That's what I like to hear.

He got a nice slice from a steak knife.
Definitely not a funny way to die.

I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You know one day we had a hill bombed.
"When I walked out, we didn't find one of them."
Not one stinking dink body.
But that smell.
That gasoline smell.
The whole hill.
It smelled like... victory.

"Sorry, Ricky."
Let's start looking right now.
It's a very scary foyer.
I'm going to look around it.
"Here I go, Ricky."
I'm looking.
Please don't just run in circles.
"Marnie, what's that?"
It's a picture of their fat son.
"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.
"Marnie,"
I think we just figured out what the murder weapon was.
- He's awake.
I'll go get him.
- That's okay.
I have to talk to you.

Then we'll find someone who'll pay for you.
"No, not my mother!"
"Please, not my mother."
"- Guys, what should we do?"
- Let's knock him off!
"No, no."
Please!
I'll give you everything I have!
- Like what?
"- Everything, everything."
Candies?
"No, I don't like breath mints."
This linen handkerchief.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
- It's not worth anything.
- Come on.
Come on!
I have 16.600 liras to last me to the end of the month.
- I'll take that.
- What about me?
You get nothing!
"No, ma'am."
"My guys, they don't smoke on the job site."
They're good guys.
Are you sure your guys haven't been sneaking around here?
And smoking?
And lying to me?
And smoking?
I'm pretty sure.
"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.
Right?
You and me.
"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
We're good.
"- Oh, good."
"Okay, that's great."
"Yeah, he did great work."
Hey.
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"- Hey, Mark, thanks."
- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.
All clear.
"With you in a minute, Granville."
What is it?
Is me slip showing?
I bet there's a hole in me tights!
"No, no."
"Calm down, Julie."
Everything's fine.
"Well, almost f--f--fine."
Have you ever thought about m--modelling?
Have you ever thought of g--getting me out?
-
"- Modelling, Mr Arkwright?"
-
- Yes.
-
- I don't think I'd be any good.
-
- Under my supervision and guidance.
-
- I were never any good before.
-
- You've done it before?
Oh.
L--l--I think I should s--say s--straightaway that I could only offer you a f--fraction of the g--going rate.
I didn't realise you had m--m--m--modelled before.
I'm still here!
-
- It's been quite a while.
-
- My feelings exactly!
I think it were in Standard Four.
I made a gnome out of Plasticine.
I feel proud of you.
"I might be your father, but you were born for the people!"
Previously on Kyle XY...
Kyle?
"Be careful, even in our backyard."
We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
Show me how.
I will.
She's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
You have to earn forgiveness.
"""She Could Be You. "" What?"
The two of you used to play that song all the time.
D4.
It's not there.
It's a Latnok ring.
All the members received rings.
It was a way of identifying one another.
And you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
Two days?
I miss this.
I miss you.
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
How were you before?
Invisible.
I'll call...
I'm... very hungry.
- This is Storm Island?
- That's right.
- And what do you do here?
- Sheep farmer.
- Really?
- I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a fool.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm in the first place?
Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe.
Give me two.
I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
- Would you like some more soup?
"- No, thank you."
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
"Where do you live, Mr Baker?"
I used to live on that boat.
I suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
- Really?
I haven't been there for years.
- When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here four years?
There you go.
Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.
Can you hear that?
It's a festival.
A gypsy dance.
People with legs should dance.
Ballerinas...ballerinas dance.
Uh...
"Thanks, big man."
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
You want one?
No.
You know I promised Ryan.
What's that?
Paper?
It's cute.
# No I can't save you
# You're on your own
# You're on your own

Things get too busy on the couch to call?
I was doing something for my brother.
Oh yeah?
Am I gonna meet this brother of yours?
It's not likely.

My Mom would have loved you.
"Well, of course."
You said she had good taste.
"You know, you can't ever leave me."
No matter how bad a wife I am.
You're a perfect wife.
Liar.
- Let go of my wife's arm!
Let go of her.
This is a shoot.
Let her sit on the pillion
I'll miss out on my tv programme.
Don't you watch Mtv?
"Drop me, please"
Where have you brought me?
Why here... in a haunted house?
Haunted house!
Come in

It's all a sham!
I'm faking

Wrong

Who Cyrus... what Cyrus?
"What happened, Ma...?"
He knows me!
My brother's bride.
Bride...?
Do you like her?
- Bride!
But why have you eloped?
Did your parents object?
Only Om objected
Who are these guys?

You are the scapegoat
I want you to meet Agesha my sister-in-law to-be
BUT ME AND MY LADY FRIEND HAD A FALLING OUT.
"AND,WELL,LIKE,MIKE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD BE OKAY"
IF I CRASHED HERE FOR THE NIGHT.
"SAM,I'M NOT AN IDIOT."
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
"WELL,SEE, THERE WAS THIS LADY,"
AND SHE WAS MAKING SOME THREATS.
AGAINST ME?
NOT SPECIFICALLY -
"- I MEAN, YOUR NAME CAME UP,"
"BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A HYPOTHETICAL-TYPE THING,"
SO IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
BUT MIKE WANTED ME TO STAY HERE
AND GIVE YOU SOME SELF-DEFENSE POINTERS
IN CASE I HAD TO LEAVE.
YOU GONNA LEAVE THIS HERE WHEN YOU GO?
"OKAY,BE CAREFUL,OKAY, BECAUSE THAT'S LOADED."
YEAH.
MICHAEL'S FATHER HAD A WINCHESTER SINGLE-SHOT.
I THINK I MAY STILL HAVE IT.
"SO,YOU WANT A BEER?"
YOU KIDDING?
DOUG IS SLEEPING PEACEFULLY.
YOU GAVE HIM SOMETHING.
MAYBE.
"WELL,HALF OF SOMETHING."
SAM GOT IN TOUCH
WITH HIS BUDDY AT THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S.
WE'RE BRINGING DOUG IN TOMORROW MORNING.
GREAT.
"WE CAN TALK,FINALLY."
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
- What?
What is that?
"My God, I think... that's a telephone line."
"Look, you just stay here and I'll be back as soon as I can."
All right?
I'll go see.
Hey!
"Hey, mister, can I use your phone?"
"Hey, who are you?"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a pilot that crashed.
Airplanes ain't safe.
Airplanes ain't dependable.
Look what happened to you.
Put that down.
That's railroad property.
"- Mister, I gotta eat something."
- Put that down!
You roach.
"It's been a home for me, man and boy, for 50 years."
They still got a place for me on the railroad.
"Mister, I got a kid who's hurt bad."
I gotta take her something to eat.
- Leave it be!
- I'll pay for 'em.
You drop 'em.
Now you get outta here.
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
You know you ain't gonna make it.
Damn!
Edgar!
- I just got a daughter.
- Congratulations.
- Do you have a wife?
- No.
- You haven't married?
- No.
A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?
"- No, no."
- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.
"Ever since you met your real, holy father   you've been really irritating to be with."
- You be easy now.
"Yeah, man, take it easy."
"My God, Miller."
I don't know where to begin.
"Nah, don't sweat it, kid."
There is nothing to say.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
"Well, for starters, you can give me your left arm."
"In fact, that is why I came by here today."
"Isn't it, Tucker?"
Fair is fair.
"We are just razzing you, kid."
"You keep your left arm, I will keep my settlement."
Hell!
I've heard these guys who'd give his arm and a leg to get a deal like this.
"So, I guess you can call me lucky."
"Well, Miller, if there is anything I can do..."
"Nah, forget it."
No hard feelings.
"I'll see you around, pal."
Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Hey!
It's got my arm!
Somebody help me!
Someone help me!

They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!
They've killed your son Paolo!
Murderers!
Murderers!
My son...
"All my respect, Don Ciccio."
You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak.
He couldn't hurt anyone.
"But when he grows, he'll grow strong."
Don't worry.
This little boy can't do a thing to you.
"When he's a man, he'll come for revenge."
"I beg you, Don Ciccio, spare my only son."
He's all I have left.
I swear to God he'll never do you any harm.
Spare him!
"Vito, run!"

Your Majesty.

Nwhere have you been lurking?
I have found the Oraculum.
That?
Looks so ordinary for an oracle.
on the Frabjous Day.
I'd know that tangled messNof hair anywhere.
is it Alice?
I believe it is.
What's she doingNwith my darling Jabberwocky?
She appears to be slaying it.
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?
but it will happenNif we don't stop her.
Stayne.

And stretch through the toes.

"Hey, back off."
Ain't nobody watching' you but me.
"Yeah, right, nobody's watching."
Come on.
Gotta get ready for Juilliard.
Go Derek!

You're milk.
Ain't no point trying to mix.
"Hey, what's up ?"
"Look, we were just dancing."
"And what, her ass just happened to fall into your hands ?"
"No, it was-"
"- You were dancing with Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki."
The music was going and-- l thought we were having a good time.
Look.
There's nothing between me and Nikki anymore.
Can people be evil?
- Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...?
-All her religious crap...?
- No.
You know what?
"Owen, listen put your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her... she's not here..."
"All right. please have her call me when she gets back, alright...?"
Well.
Dad!
"Owen, I want you to get that crap out of your head, okay?"
You mother just... she has problems... and I'm gonna talk to her.
"So I don't want to hear any more about this, alright?"
alright?
...Yeah...
"You have a good night, pal."
I love you.
"And I'm sorry about the last couple months, but I'll see you real soon, okay?"
- I promise!
Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...
I love you!
Can I come in...?
...You have to say it You can... come in..
Are you a vampire...?
I... need blood.
To live.
- How old are you?
Really.
- twelve...
But...
I been twelve for a very long time...
-Come in.
"-Thank you, my dear."
-You're going to break your eardrums.
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.
"You're young, I'm old and sick."
What we'll do in the next few months will make history.
It's never been done before.

He's small potatoes.
What's up?
We got company?
What's going on?
Michael Corleone is here.
Where is he?
He's in your den.
You better hurry.
He's been waiting a half hour.
Is something wrong?
I wish you would have let me know you were coming.
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died.
We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Porter.
Have you heard of her?
Exactly.
Nouveau riche.
"Excuse me, Gunther."
Mmm-hmm?
What's down that way?

This way.

Oh... mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
If you need any...
"Anything at all, you..."
Oh.
Thank you.

Isabel.
Isabel.
I apologize for the unorthodox introduction.
I'm Dr. cairn.
Oh.
I wanted to make sure that all your needs are being seen to.
"Oh, yes."
The institute is lovely.
I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?
I feel better already.
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
"- Whatever, bitch."
"- Hey, watch your mouth."
"Are you almost done, man?"
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma.
She's probably in Recovery by now.
"- That means she's okay, then?"
- No.
She could wind up paralyzed.
"- Like, all over or just her legs?"
- They' re not sure yet.
"Well, better if they just killed her, you know?"
An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
"Yeah, that was personal."
"It was about my name, honor."
- But paralyzed?
That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
"Hey, Luka."
"- Piece of work, huh?"
- Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
- Who?
- The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No.
Do you?
Not really.
"You know, I can honestly say that you are the only grandfather"
I have ever wanted to be with.
- Oh!
Hello.
- Daddy's girl.
I'm going to bring Ritchie his pancakes.
Okay.
I'm going to get us some coffee.
I'll be right over there.
"- Hi, Christine."
- Hi.
You having a nice Grandparents' Day?
"Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am."
You seem to have a very close family.
"Yes, you certainly seem to be daddy's best girl."
W hat?
Oh.
Ew!
"Oh, no."
That's not my father.
"No, no, no."
That's New Christine's father.
Why were you kissing him?
"Um, because I'm, um..."
I'm sort of dating him.
You're dating your ex-husband's girlfriend's father?
Yeah.
That's right.
"Well, you know, Christine, if we don't tell you enough, we are so happy you're at this school."
That's nice.
Ugh!
"I got so distracted by those meanie moms,"
"Look, you got to trust me, okay?"
Everything's going to be just fine.
"Hi, there."
I'm Judy.
Who are you?
Becca.
You're the lady on TV.
"Stay here, Becca."
We'll be right back.
I brought your phone back.
You haven't played the message on TV yet.
I will.
I made a copy.
"Mrs. Jerome, I have to ask you one more time."
Where did your daughter go when she disappeared 12 years ago?
I already told you.
I don't know.
This may be important.
I'll tell you what's important.
Everyone believes Jeffrey's a victim in this.
I need them to hear my daughter.
"Look, I've called the hotline, like, five times."
Why the hell hasn't anyone called me back?
!
You know what?
Forget it.
Don't bother.
"Hey, you seen Nicky?"
She'll show up.
Don't worry.
"Come on, Peter, we gotta go."
Are you in or are you out?
Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.
[Both moaning]
"Oh, my gosh."
That was so good.
You are fucking insane.
Hello?
Yes I'm fine.
Normal.
Hear about what?
Of course I've read the newspapers.
"Yes, I'll wait."
Luisa.
I prefer to meet Laura by myself.
As you want.
Yes.
Yesterday.
Almost at eight.
Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.
"I don't know, professor."
This scratch looks pretty old.
The Ark's magnetic.
"Yeah, let's check it out later, come on."
There's no engine!
That'll keep 'em out for a while.
And us in.
"Shh, quiet!"
Sound the alarm.
"Come on, MacGyver, they know we've escaped."
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
"Yes, I'm fine."
"Well, I'll just visit the powder room."
Of course.
You sure Mrs McCarthy's in danger?
George may well have poisoned Henry to stop him revealing that he killed Vera Blanchett.
And if George did that to Henry...
Exactly.
"Oh, that looks lovely."
I've taken the liberty of pouring you some wine.
Oh!
Why not?
"Here's to you, Bridget, and to Henry."
Of course.
To poor Henry.
"Oh, It's quite sharp."
Maybe even a little bitter.
Try the fish.
Yes.
Mrs McCarthy.
What are you...
George.
What on earth is going on?
!
I'm afraid there has been a fire at St Mary's.
A fire!
"Now, the Fire Brigade have it under control, Mrs McCarthy, but I need you to go back with Sid and sort out a few things."
But I haven't even started my dinner.
I'm so sorry.
"But all things considered, I think we've had a lucky escape."
Right.
Shall we?
"The Rolls, Mrs M?"
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.
[spit] [flush]
"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
Please don't make a scene.
Where's the restroom?
"Yes, I called him."
When?
Why?
Because.
Want something to eat?
The cafeteria's closed.
He's sleeping.
"It went well, but took a long time."
"We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right."
"Good thing he came in, it was almost too late."
There's a problem with his papers.
- If you don't mind...
- I'll take care of it.
"We almost killed him, and for what?"
My battery's run out.
I need to make a call.
I need to talk to Raziya.
This whole costume is for her sake.
All because I love her.
What's the sense in hiding all this from her?
You know what she calls Him?
Daddy.
"She calls God ""Daddy"" and me she calls ""Honey""."
Do you need help?
No.
What's your name?
Dorona.
- And your brothers?
"- Natanel, and the little one is Shai."
- There's another one.
"But you'll be there, right?"
Tuesday night?
Of course.
"Take the 11:40 bus, okay?"

Uh-huh.
-Congratulations.
-Same as you.
As me?
Ha.
"You're the father, Buck."
"Hey, Buck and Lucy are having a baby."
LUCY:
And a wedding too.
-What?
"Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one."
And you know how mad he gets.
A wedding.
"Well, someone should buy a round of drinks."
"The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold."
"No, no, this is nonsense, all right?"
It's nonsense.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not about to get married.
"No, no."

What about Judge Travis?
He's days away from a telegraph office.
Marshal's right.
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.
I work in a clothing store in a shopping mall.
I'm Varun.
"Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things."
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!
It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Hi, I'm Varun."
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
"Somehow, I am becoming you."
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
- We're down one.
- Just for a minute.
- I risk getting hurt.
- Don't make us beg.
That was a penalty.
It was!
I'II kick it.
"Run, a bombing!"
Who else?
The MiIanese!
could you take my window for a minute?
This has to be sent back.
hello.
Do you know my grandson Peppe?
"I have to send him this, it's a sweaterI made."
"I want it to get there fast, how long will it take?"
- Two orthree days.
- Two orthree?
"And if it rains, what will the dearthing wear?"
.
should he freeze to death?
Two orthree days?
But it's just a small package.
Your grandson Peppe?
- You're talking about Peppe?
- Do you know him?
"Peppe said, I quote:"
"""If my grandma comes, tell her she can't make sweaters,"""
"""she's gotta do fried dough, 'cause she does 'em great."""
"But he doesn't like sweaters, make him a dessert."
"Making sweaters isn't foryou, Peppe said so."
- Make scarves.
Let's see what's down there.
(FOOTSTEPS CLANGlNG)
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"(MUTTERS) Oh, my God!"
EMERSON:
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
-Brown.
"-Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
"Before you dropped out, huh?"
MAN:
There you are.
(david YELLS)
EMERSON:
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
"I picked-up names,"
"Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill, Hill, Trill ..."
Okay.
I've got it.
And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.
We could get our own school.
We are males.
-We adopts.
"-Takes you, I fit."
I have much to do.
"Okay, then can go, go quench your thirst for blood."
The many other Krills at sea.
Many would appreciate Krills have me as a partner.
I'm a hell of a partner.
You're the only school I have.
"You know that, but no intimacy."
-Are you hurt?
"No, I'm fine."
-I'm fine.
"-What is Seymour, gimme a break."
"No, no, Thank you, brother."
My kids are out there.
"Then, no!"
"Erik and Atticus, to hide."
Let's hide here.
"Rolls, rolls, rolls, where I can fly!"
"Look, My favorite penguins trapped a wall of ice."
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.
Never seen so many seagulls in one place.
"Stay together, do not differ."
"Ith that's it, thank you."
-You're welcome.
And a coke.
-Yeah sure.
Here you go.
Your mom would be real proud of you.
Proud of a reject Juvie kid?
Close your mouth when you eat.
Very nice.
-Hyder.
So?
How is school boys?
-I hate school.
It's fine.
This whole thing's a joke.
Dad of the fuckin year over here.
Not here.
-Why not uh?
Everyone knows CPS took your kid.
Whole town knows.
Shut your mouth now.
-They don't know about Galveston.
That's enough.
-He fucking left us.
Stop.
-Don't tell me what to do.
It wasn't my responsibility to take care of everything.
Take care of Wes while you boozed up down there.
"Alright, come on."
"3 weeks dad, 3 whole weeks you were gone."
"Admit it, you wanna drink yourself to death."
"Cause when Duncan found you, you were gonna leave us for good, weren't you?"
"It's the Sunland Arms, apartment 12B."
You'd better hurry.
There's no time to lose.
Her scalp must be in very bad shape.
It is.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, uh, hello, I am Wilbert."
Your husband sent me here to make the scalp happy.
"Oh, come in."
It is not easy to come through this little hole.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you out there in that cold hall, honey."
"But, you know, a nice girl can't be too careful."
(COUGHS)
Why don't you take your coat off?
"Oh, no, this is fine, thank you."
"All right, here is the coat."
(COUGHS)
I must find the place to plug in the equipment.
Over there.
"Oh, merci."
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
(WHIRRING)
"Well, I am now ready to begin."
So am I.
You know something?
What?
You're cute.
Do you know something?
Whisper it in my ear.
The scalp is dry.
Come with me.
Where?
"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
Of course not.
"I just thought you were working, that's all."
I took off.
For this?
Yeah.
Didn't your father ever teach you how to tie a tie?
"No, he didn't."
You know...
I didn't mean to make you do anything
You didn't want to do.
I'm chillin' yo.
"Oh shit, my dude..."
That's a nigga right there.
"No gas, no gas!"
Oh!
You just gonna stand there?
You're not gonna say anything?
"Yo, what you want me to say, yo?"
It ain't like they lying.
"You know, you're fucked up."
Yo.
"Yo, you ain't my girl."
"You need to chill the fuck out, a'ight?"
"Oh, so I'm good enough for you to fuck"
"And for me to suck your dick,"
But I'm not your girl?
"Well, then fuck you..."
fuck you!
"Yo, you good?"
"I'm good, yo."
"Wait, Chris."
You know... .
- You look older.
More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.
I remember you liked to write.
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't publish those books with the plain wrappers, did he?"
- Remember?
- No.
"- Yes, you do."
Remember?
- Yes.
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really.
You look great.
Thanks.
"You know, you never said goodbye to me when you left Peyton Place."
You never even said goodbye.
"I'll never forget that Labor Day, Norman."
I won't either.
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.
What brings you home?
Vacation?
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
Come on Prewitt.
"Come on, cut that out."
You want to see this guy's imitation of Mussolini?
"Come on, show him your Mussolini impersonation."
Italian men... Italian women!
For twenty centuries...
"Sorry, I can't."
"Cut that out, Prewitt."
What are you doing here?
Don't you know it's forbidden?
It's a minefield.
Get lost.
Get that bitch out of here!
"Out, out!"
Can you get that Italian bitch out of here?
- Get out bitch!
- Enough!
Are you here to fight Germans or to insult Italians?
You're killing them!
"Out, out!"
Go!
"- Step aside boys, move!"
- The medic's here!
It's too late.
Nothing can be done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Pasqualino!
Pasqualino!
- No!
No!
Is everything alright?
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr. Vega.
Hey!
Benigno.
Hey!
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said goodbye to Lydia.
OCR failed!
but Dr. Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
I'll read them to Alicia at night.
They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
Are you going alone?
Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
About what?
Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
I got a car.
Them wheels are yours?
Come on.
"What do you mean, come on?"
What's your name?
"Miko's the name, pedalling's the game."
How can I help?
- You know the Greenbergs?
- Yeah.
"Just yesterday, they takin' tourists..."
"I mean, doin' business."
You know what I mean?
"And today, pau'ana."
- They say anything about taking a vacation?
- Saul take a vacation?
- You gotta be kidding.
- I know what you mean.
Tom?
This guy says that Saul and Lena closed the place early last night.
"This morning, the place was for sale."
There was no answer from them this morning.
- Does this kid know anything?
- He's as surprised as we are.
- Let's run by their house.
"- You find anything, let me know."
- I like them old haoles.
"- Mahalo, brah."
"Thanks, brah."
Saul said they were taking a vacation.
- We're meddling.
- We're not.
- We are so.
- I wrote it.
- What?
In these couple of days?
"Yeah, I think it's pretty good."
These two pages.
How'd you finish so quickly?
Amazing.
Do you like it?
"Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me."
But it all came within a few hours.
"Funny, huh?"
"It came out so easy, as if I were possessed."
"Yes, Director Kim."
How are you?
I'm home.
Are you still there?
How's your leg?
It still hurts.
I think I was afraid again.
I miss you.
"I'm sorry, too."
Honestly.
When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.
"Hey, man, I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, but..."
I bet every dime I got on you.
You what?
I guess I got carried away.
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.
Just take it easy.
Come on.
All right.
Has anyone given him a salt tablet?
No.
Okay.
"I've got your glucose, your dry socks, liniment, bandages."
Bandages?
Bandages?
"- Just relax, okay?"
Relax.
"- Come on, Magnum."
Warm up.
Warm up.
"Yeah, get them legs goin'."
- Get them legs in shape.
"- Two minutes, swimmers."
Two minutes.
"- Oh, no."
- Don't use them too much on the swim...
What?
What do you think you're doing.
I'm sorry.
No one informed me of the dress code.
I can't control it.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)
(PANTING)
I don't know when I've had such good sport.
"Thank you, fair lady."
You must feel honored to be chosen by a baron.
Bring her to me!
(ALL SNARLING)
(SCREAMS)
(WHINNIES)
(GROWLING)
What's this?
You're one of our kind.
You're wrong!
I'm nothing like you!
I'm a human being!
Unbelievable.
How interesting.
You're a seriously confused fellow.
One only has to look at your eyes to know what you are.
Unless you're...
Can it be?
A hybrid?
Is that it?
Hello!
"Sorry to interrupt the hunt, Baron Howard!"
And who are you?
A hunter as well.
Only my quarries happen to be vampires.
What?
I wanted your last meal to be special.
"So tonight, you dine on the finest silver."
"That's a shame, Frankie."
Lot of unanswered questions.
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
"You and me, right now."
"- Well, I..."
No.
- What?
"Daddy, you can beat him."
Come on.
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.
"You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me."
- That's right.
"- All right, you got a fight."
"Greg, get my gloves."
"- I'm sorry, bro."
"- Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back."
- He was so fast.
- You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
- We have nothing.
- I don't know what to say.
- I gave it my best.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.
"- Hey, you have the time?"
"- Aw, not you again."
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.
Just around the block.
Yeah.
Just around the block.
"And be careful, okay?"
I will.
Bye.
I-It-
- It's really--
"It's really great to have you home, Mom."
"Hey, seriously, be careful, okay?"
I will.
Okay.
I guess we should talk.
"Oh, I think you said plenty the other day."
No.
"Look, about that, it just--"
Did you get the car wash keys?
"Um, yes, yes."
"Skyler, I may have... overstated things earlier, and I'm sorry to be so forward."
But I-
- I just--
I want you to know something.
I want you to--
I need you to understand that you are safe.
"You, Junior, Holly--"
You are completely safe.
Everything that I do-- Everything--
I do it to protect this family.
"So buying that car, that was protecting your family?"
Okay.
"I, uh--"
"All right, maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car, and--"
"Well, I had the baby."
Really?
Yeah.
"You guys took so long,"
I'm already pregnant with another one.
Here's your ice water.
Thank you.
"Anything else I can get for you, dirty stranger?"
Dr. Roland!
"Oh, my God."
I'm so glad to see you.
Yeah.
I didn't need to see the Rolling Stones tonight.
Where's Zack?
Jail.
Boom!
Just won the office pool.
Okay.
"Let's take a gander at the old money maker, huh?"
"Oh, six centimeters."
Shouldn't be long now.
But Zack's not here.
"Olivia, help."
Don't worry about it.
I know people at every precinct in this town:
"If they don't let him go, they're going to read about it in tomorrow's front page."
"Yeah, she's gonna get arrested, too."
Hey.
I slept with her.
I don't care.
I can't believe that
Zack's not going to make it.
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
A convention of predators?
"-There, there!"
-Why was not I invited?
-Will.
"-Guys, guys?"
-Will not go ...
-Get out.
-You will not survive.
Me misses.
Will stop.
I think the best part.
"If I'm invading your space, How about this?"
"No, no, I'm talking about, separated from truth."
More ...
Why?
My life is like now.
"I can change, be less invisible."
"See, you'll be great."
"See you, kid."
"Will, please do not let me."
"I'll take you, you, you, and you."
"Please, someone, anyone, I lost my Will."
"I beg you, please Will my return."
-Mano.
-Sven.
"-I will give to his wife, okay."
"-Okay, thank you."
"Right Sven, here I come."
Form a single queue and smiled.
You must be glorious.
And you must be Sven.
"It is a pleasure for me to know, seriously because I'm thrilled."
And he's one of your best friends.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you pursue him?
I always liked him.
I'm just not good at pursuing a guy.
"HALLIE, I'm sorry if I made you feel..."
jealous.
"I mean, I never, never meant to."
I never even knew I did.
"I guess I just feel the way you felt with J.P., you know?"
Yeah.
I understand that.
The next morning as soon as she woke up
Jill took a cab straight home to face the music.
Not knowing if that music...
would be a wedding march.
Drew.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I really do love you.
"Me, too."
Smell my hair.
Does it still smell like cigarettes?
No.
It smells like Jill.
Ugh.
Wow.
Look at this.
"Party at our place, and it's only 9am."
"Last night, she was wearing the ugliest pair of cotton granny panties"
I've ever seen in my entire life.
Listen in on his conversation.
He said it was a friendly dinner.
No way.
Not a chance.
"Tell them, Bobbi."
"- Let""s not jump to any conclusions."
- What?
Do you have a picture of the receptionist?
"No, but she has blonde hair, like Clara."
"Like Mom""s."
"Yeah, well, she""s thinner than me... and she""s prettier."
Is this your daughter?
"She""s so pretty."
Yeah.
"That""s my oldest daughter, Cassie."
"She""s getting married."
A wedding.
You must be so excited.
Yeah.
We are.
We really are.
"Now, how long has this scumbag been sneaking around?"
"We""ve known about it for a couple of weeks."
"Clara can""t sleep, she can""t eat."
"L""m worried about you, Mom."
"We""ll get even for y""all."
"Won""t we, Bobbi?"
"We""ll nail that lying, cheating bastard to the wall."
"We""ll rake him over the coals."
"And when we""re done with David Harris... he""ll wish he never stepped foot outside your bedroom door."
"- Do you love him, Clara?"
"- What""s love got to do with anything?"
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it.
Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian.
"Okay, bag him."
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.
"All right, hook me up."
O-silk is next?
- O-silk.
Come on.
- Here you go.
And I want to auto-transfuse this guy.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.

- How many kilos?
- [Sal] Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"

"And by the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be at least 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
"Take what's left there with you, and good night."
Uh-uh.
Not that one.
The little one.

I left it at the court.
I hooked it on the chain-link fence.
I'm so stupid.
No problem.
We'll just walk back.
"No, I'll go back."
You stay here with Greta.
It'll be faster.

"If anyone should be there,"

You have to tell me where you got those boots.
Olivia?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to use my journalistic connections to get them out.
"Now, which one arrested Zack?"
Grumpypuss behind that desk.
And don't touch his hat.
He's very attached to it.
Marion?
Olivia?
Oh...
"Oh, my God."
Darling.
You're alive!
All right.
"Olivia and Abby can catch up, but we've got to get you to the hospital to meet your son, mister."
When did you get a Porsche?
"Oh, it's my brother's."
He gave it to me when he met Antonio and moved to Florence.
I didn't know your brother was...
An expatriate.
I know.
It's surprising.
Okay.
"Billie, I'm out and on the way."
How you doing?
They won't let me eat.
Tell them to let me eat!
"Dude, it's all going down, man."
Tell me.
What are you doing?
- She wants me to buy her flowers.
"- It's not true, Master!"
That's enough...
I'll buy you some then.
"You naughty pair, go!"
It's all your fault!
- Don't behave like that next time!
- It's all your fault!
He asked me to go to the brothel with him.
So you!
Surely you know what kind of man he is by now.
You!

"Mr. Chao, are you satisfied with three girls?"
Not bad... not bad!
"That's fine, enjoy yourself!"
Ah-chuen!

Yes!
"Thanks, sir!"
"Well, let me continue!"
Do you know what's happened to him?
What?
He can't stand it!
Look how happy you are.
"Jun-kit, you should enjoy yourself in this place."
Why are you sitting there like a fool?
"Come on, cheers!"
"Chung-Ian, go and toast to Mr. Hong."
FINN:
I think I know where he might be.
(KEYS JINGLING)
JASPER:
Christ.
What's he keeping in here?
FINN:
I don't know.
Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.
Akan!
"Akan, open this fucking door, do you hear me?"
I got her all dolled up in the back of my truck downstairs.
I'm gonna rip your fucking lungs out!
"You'll go far, Henry, unlike this piece of shit."
"Hey, Henry."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Peaceful, peaceful."
Chill out.
Calm down.
Now I've shared something with you.
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Now that is my ego talking to yours.
"What do you want... higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"
- Higher self!
- Higher self.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.
"Oh, shit."
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.
"I'm sorry you're upset, okay?"
- Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.
Is that her mother?
I say yes.
And who's that Ghena?
Why does it smell of wine here?
What wine?
We had a drink with Mashka.
Today is her birthday.
We went to a cafe with the girls.
One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us.
"You do remember Mashka, don't you?"
"We came with her last year, remember?"
A little blond one.
- What have you got on your head?
- Grandma's present.
Take it off.
Grandma's present is for winter.
Go to your room.
Get away from the jam with your spoon!
Go to your room!
Lay off me!
"Oh, what great caviar I cooked!"
"Taste it, daughter."
I don't want it now.
"- Taste it now, I said!"
"- Come on, mama..."
Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose?
Is it really big?
That's how they joke now.
I wish you heard what she says to me.
And who is that Ghena?
Ghena is my colleague.
We work together.
"- Got your own John Dillinger, huh?"
"- Yeah, and, like, Capone too."
Be it ever so humble.
"Yeah, where is Miss Sexy Feet?"
She's in that nest over there.
"Oh, well, you go on."
I'll wait here and observe.
Not like this.
This has to be done right.
Come on.
"Well, I see you've cleaned this up."
"Oh, yeah."
"Here, why don't you have a seat over here, Jon?"
"- No, thanks."
- You want a cold drink?
- Yeah.
What do you got?
- Let me see.
Got a little apple juice and a piece of watermelon left over from the Fourth.
July Fourth?
"- Well, this is almost..."
"- Yeah, I know."
It's a little dried out.
I'll pass.
"You know, I could do it like in the movies."
I could walk over and borrow a cup of sugar or flour.
"Yeah, if you could find a cup."
Are you kidding?
I know where everything is in here.
Lucky it was that pole and not my leg.
"Now, what do you think?"
Sugar or flour?
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."
This is important.

- Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
"Yeah, thanks a lot."

- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
- No.
- Aww.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
"- Maggie, why don't you go?"
"- No, I'm good..."
"- I don't have a partner, so."
- We'll all be your partner.
"- Come on, we're all doing it."
- I'm keeping score in my head.
"You said you were open to loving some games, right?"
- Come on.
"- Play the game, Mags."
"Get up there, let's game it up."

Nobody cares about you!
- All by yourself.
- You're lonely!
- It's just you!
- You're lonely!
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.
And everyone forgot about you.
"Don't say a word without a lawyer, even if they beat you."
- Stay strong.
- Not tonight.

"And because I was kind of black, you think you can dump me."
What the hell.
2-11 to 2-10.
2-11 to 2-10.
2-11 to 2-10.
"Dale, where you at?"
(HARMONICA PLAYING)
"Hey, June!"
Junie!
How you doing?
You got something for me?
"How you doing, Mr. Charlie?"
"Hello, is this Ronnie?"
"Ronnie, this is Ray."
"Listen, is Fantasia there?"
"Yeah, Lila."
Where is she?
"Well, have you got a number out there for her?"
"Yeah, listen, give it to me, all right?"
Yeah.
Ronnie?
"Ronnie, come here."
Ma'am?
Come here.
I got to go.
"Ronnie, now, if you know something about Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen."
"Your sister's in trouble, but I don't want you being in trouble."
"No, ma'am."
I don't know nothing about that.
"Ronnie, June Hawkins down the street just told me he was out most of the night digging frogs south of town."
"When he was driving back, he saw you driving along in front him, and Byron, he was with you."
"Now, where had you and Byron been at 4:00 in the morning?"
"Clara, please."
"L""ll do anything."
"Clara, look at me."
Do you hear that?
That rattle?
Will you take it in?
I can take it in this weekend.
Fine.
"L""ll have dinner ready in an hour."
Spaghetti.
- The casserole is in the oven.
"- Let""s brown it."
"Do you want a picture of him, Bobbi?"
"Let""s just sneak on up here and get a little peek at him."
Get your camera ready.
"That""s him?"
"Danny Caine, Mr. Hidden Agenda?"
"That""s Pam Caine""s husband?"
That guy hired us six months ago.
"We""re in it now, so we might as well go for it."
"L""m going to nail this deadbeat."
"Baby, thanks for letting me come home."
Clara told us everything.
"So when Clara called, your mother and I knew what we had to do."
You are our son.
Clara is our daughter.
"- We""ll get through this together."
"- It""s over with that woman."
"- Of course it""s over."
"- Isn""t it, David?"
"You married a beauty queen, David."
Miss Colombia Houston.
Excellent!
What's wrong now?
You've suffered internal injuries!
You're joking!
Touch your rib cage.
Does it hurt?
No.
No?
What about this spot?
"Yes, it hurts a bit."
"You've breathing problems, too."
"Yes, how do you know?"
I think you trained much too hard.
I must try to relieve your tension.
You'll be okay when that's done.
Does it hurt?
No!
It doesn't!
What's wrong?
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
It's burning...
Stop it!
It won't hurt.
Have you finished?
Feeling better?
You're great!
Of course.
You dare to hit me?
How many hands you want to use?
You're magnificent!
"Oh, look."
The Granola family left this.
- What is that?
- It's a native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Mm-hmm.
- Let's keep it.
- Yeah?
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think...
I think it's time.
Together?
- Don't you wanna?
"- Like where, Neverland?"
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
Where?
I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick... that's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
"Fi, we need to get the biggest armed response we can get at that place."
How big?
Very big.
Jabbar's guys are armed to the teeth
And aren't gonna go down without a fight.
I think I have an idea.
Remember that burner phone we gave your mom?
Hello?
"Mom, I don't have a lot of time."
"I need you to say, in a loud, clear voice,"
"""1212 Bayshore Avenue."
"Yes, Michael, I can be there."""
Are you sure?
I don't know if anybody's told you --
I know Riley bugged the house.
It's what I'm counting on.
I need to get the CIA to show up someplace fast.
Can you do that for me?
"Yes, Michael."
1212 Bayshore Avenue.
I can be there.
"Thanks, Mom."
I'll be in touch when I can.
M-Michael --
"We lost his pulse, Sam!"
What?
I can't find a pulse!
"There's nothing, man."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do it!
Do it!
"No, this was never closed like this."
"Oh, there's a lock here."
- Hello?
- Hello?
Is it open?
"Oh, hooray."
Thank you.
"- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup."
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No.
"Hi, Rob Frey."
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
"Oh, absolutely."
Gosh.
"- It's painted now, huh?"
- Terrible.
"I mean, it's just such a shame."
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""I must build one of the great buildings of the time."
"""You must help me build this particular building."
"""I doubt if I can do it without you."
"""Just think how low architecture has gotten down."
- She's beautiful.
Toss your oars up.
We should say goodbye.
"Once we sail, we won't have a chance to talk."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Goodbye, Harvey."
- Boat!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Mr. Crawford."
Boat ahoy!
"Captain's jolly boat coming alongside, sir."
- Full company aboard.
- Good.
This is Midshipman Crawford.
You must be proud to serve with your father.
Take the captain's son below and introduce him to his messmates.
Stand by to hoist.
Pass the word that Crawford is to be treated the same.
"Understood, sir."
Lots of women aboard.
"Wives, I reckon."
"Hello, my love."
Who are they?
Them?
They're the pressed men.
Follow me.
"Bye-bye, love."
Get those wretched women off!
- Hoist away!
- Dawlish!
Swing them over!
- Clear the deck!

What's the matter Mrs.James?
You better get some good rest tonight.
It's these the hard shifts.
"I had some bad news this morning, Miss."
My Jim's missing.
Oh!
Try not to worry.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Oh!
"I do hope so, Miss."
I expect I'll feel better when I have cuppa tea.
That's right.
It's finishing time now.
A million bullets for dispatch by the morning!
?
But I tell you the girls have done 10 hours today already.
Yes.
I hear myself urgently.
But you expect these girls to run 14 hours on stretch.
Alright!
I'll ask them.
She doesn't have to ask us.
A million bullets by the morning!
Alright!
"Come on girls, it's gotta be done!"
Stop!
Stop there.
Stop right there.
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
I don't think so.
[snaps] Go wait by the door.
So we have a deal?
"You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones."
- Whatever those are.
"- [man] One, two, three, four!"
[rock music plays]
- He bought it.
"- Yes, he did."
"More importantly, he had no idea it was you."
"Yeah, but was all that really necessary?"
I am not whipped.
"It's all part of the play, Richard."
- Not my play.
- No.
Uncle Eddie's play.
[upbeat music] [applause]
Welcome back.
"Today we are doing a very special show,"
"""Foxy at 50... and Beyond."""
"- Welcome, guys."

"So, Dr. Jane, you have a hot new book out there titled,"
"""When I Grow Up I Want to be a JILF."""
"It's GILF, Donny."
As in grandmother I'd like to f...
- Uh...
- A GILF.
- Right.
- [laughter]
"Today, 50 is an entirely new landscape."
Put a fun spin on it.
"You're a pervert, Sid."
You need to get help.
I know.
"Right, we have a big case to solve, something you're not going to have to worry about now, eh?"
No.
Big cases and police work.
"Sleet, don't say that."
I'm really bad at breaking bad news.
"Yeah, yeah, no fucking joke!"
That's why I thought I'd get you to do it.
"Yeah, really fucking funny!"
"OK, I, I'm sorry, Sid."
"Be careful, yeah?"
Are we going now?
"Yeah, we go."
Come on.
"We'll just leave him here, he'll be fine."
Good luck.
Thanks.
"Bye, Sid."
Sorry.
Don't steal anything while you're here.
"I got a call from Bomb Squad, they'd found Cowell."
The only way to deactivate the bomb was typing in the name of the kidnapper.
"Miley, Jessie or Sugar."

Dermot O'Leary's here!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
"O'Leary, this is it."
Yeah.
"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
My wife got the good car.
"So, how you doing?"
"Well, Stan, we need to talk."
I know.
I can't do this anymore.
What?
"You're nice and sweet, Christine, but..."
I just don't think this is working out for me.
What?
Why?
"Well, you know, I haven't been around much, and..."
I think you just might be a little too fast for me.
Fast?
It's been three years!
I got a kid that goes to this school.
I got to think of my reputation.
Your reputation?
If anything...
I helped your reputation.
Giving some of this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You did me.
You know it!
You made me a mix tape.
"Oh, my stomach hurts."
"Yeah, I would die."

It's a great neighborhood.
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
"Well, you've been very nice, Mr. Thornton."
I
"- I suppose I was a little difficult, but..."
"- well, losing someone you've grown to love isn't-"
"- Yes, I know."
I'm sorry I was so rough.
"Well, I"
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm.
I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No.
My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up here.
We've known all along.
"I mean, old man Blake's claim."
But how?
How could you possibly know?
"Give me that map, Shorty."
Yeah.
Did you ever see this?
"Or, uh, something like it?"
Yes.
"Yes, I've seen the original."
This won't do you any good.
It isn't correct.
I know it.
That's why I was going to suggest that-
"Good morning, Miss Simpson."
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
"In English, please, Nadine."
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes.
Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
"He signed off, "" Love, Gary."""
"Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that."
"Americans use the word ""love"" very casually."
"We say ""I love you"" like you say ""Good-bye."""
""" Hi."
You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
"I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."""
Just to see you.
- Okay.
Just to see you.
- Right.
"""I know that I don't know you very much."""
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No.
I don't know you very well.
"- "" But you don't know me either."""
- Ei-ther.
""" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."""
"You know, you don't say ""person of my life."""

Why don't you women go on up to Eunice's?

You should call it quits after one more hand.
-Go up to Eunice's.
"-Hey, that's my coat."
"That's not fun, stanley."
It makes me so mad when he does that in front of people.
-I think I'II go bathe.
-Again?
My nerves are in knots.
Is the bathroom occupied?
I don't know.
"-Oh, good evening."
"-Oh, hello."
"BIanche, this is harold mitchell."

"-How's your mother now, Mitch?"
Blow!
You too!
"Oh, turn the lights out before you go, Stoker!"
"You made a mistake, Stoker!"
A bad mistake!
I don't mean about Nelson!
"Three, four wins and nobody will remember what happened!"
"But I paid for something tonight, and I didn't get it!"
"I don't like that, Stoker!"
I didn't know anything!
Tiny didn't say anything!
He know he was to go in the third!
I give Tiny the dough an hour ago!

You get dressed!
We'll talk about this later!
- Anything else?
- A couple of cans of soup!

- Vegetable!
"Oh, and two bottles of beer!"
That'll be $ 1 !

That's $ 1 !
16!
One-sixteen!
You ought to throw in a floorshow!
There he is!
"All right, Stoker, we'll talk!"
But I thought maybe we could make an exception.
Or not.
"You are not helping your cause here, son."
"Stand down, or--"
Or what?
You'll send me to my room?
And I'm not your son.
I'm not even his.
I thought I was his partner.
But not anymore.
Guess they're right about you three.
You're not ready.
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Superman to Justice League.
There's been an explosion at Project Cadmus.
It's on fire.
I've had my suspicions about Cadmus.
This may present the perfect opportunity to--
ZATARA:
Zatara to Justice League.
The sorcerer Wotan is using the Amulet of Aten to blot out the sun.
Requesting full League response.
-Superman?
-It's a small fire.
-Local authorities have it under control
-Then Cadmus can wait.
All Leaguers rendezvous at Zatara's coordinates.
Batman out.
-Stay put.
-What?
Why?
This is a League mission.
All right.
- I can't see Carrasco or his men.
- They must have separated.
There they are.
They'll hit the mines any second now.
The road is mined!
Hurry up!
Get on this bus!
Come on!
- They're going back.
- Hurry up!
We must get away from here!
Hurry up!
We must get away!
Come on!
Fire!
- There they are.
- They're coming.
Attention!
This is a message for Enrique Carrasco and his men.
Don't shoot!
I repeat:
Don't shoot!
General Benítez wants to talk to you.
Attention!
This is a message for Enrique Carrasco and his men.
Don't shoot!

- Hello?
"- Hi, this is Gigi."
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.
- Huh?
"- I, um had the dentist pen."
Right.
Hey.
How you doing?
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
"No, I know."
This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
"Hey, give me two seconds, okay?"
"Two seconds, hold on."
Let me guess.
He said:
"""The only thing happy about this hour is you."""
He might have used some derivative of that.
[CHUCKLES]
"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says..."
"Oh, he's not interested."
- You don't even know if he's called.
"- Oh, did he?"
No.
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.
What about us?
"It's always Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, all the time."
"You can't change things now, Anna."
Hello?
Why are you sitting here?
Sweetheart!
It's lovely to see you.
- I can't stand it when we fight.
- Me neither.
But we need to talk about this properly.
- Yes.
- Like grown ups.
"- Of course, sweetie."
- So stop calling me sweetie.
- What can I call you then?
- You could call me Anna.
Okay.
Did you marry Jorgen for my sake?
So that I had a father?
No.
I love Jorgen.
Do you?
A lot.
So everything with Jacob was a mistake?
- No.
- What was it then?
"I was very in love with Jacob, but I was also very unhappy."
About what?
About being in love with him.
We just hurt each other all the time.
When you told me Jorgen wasn't my father   why didn't you say Jacob was?
Maybe because...
1000)}TODAY
Where am I?
At the hospital.
You were in a coma.
I can't feel my legs.
Don't worry.
It will gradually come back.
Do you know your name?
I think.
So?
Lucy Clarsen.
Do you remember what happened to you?
What is it?
Why are you staring at me?
You're a miracle.
268)}What's going on?
268)}There's nothing more we can do.
The plant is flooded.
268)}You can't just leave.
You said... 268)}You should do the same.
There's no point in staying.
There must be something we can do.
Nope.
We tried everything.
The power won't come back.
Crowbar.
What the hell are you doing?
Please have a seat.
I have nothing to offer.
Will the power be back soon?
You can come to the Helping Hand.
We have a generator. and dorm rooms if you need to stay.
- Good?
It's nociIIo.
- delicious.
- Next?
- The Scapece house.
We'II slide it underthe door.
"No, we have to hand-deIiverit."
"If they offer coffee, we'II give a MiIanese no: categorical."
- How much sugar?
.
"- Two, please."
"You say ""no, thank you."""
Got any fruitjuice?
It's lemon juice he made himself.
"Here's yourregistered letter, yourreceipt, the juice was very good, maybe a bit strong."
It's his Postamat.
"That's wonderful, but we have to run."
Even I didn't understand that.
Goodbye.
Good thing it was a MiIanese no!
"If it was NeapoIitan, we'd have stayed for dinner?"
.
SorrowfuI Mother...
immaculate Virgin...
DeIiverus from evil...
Where are you goin'?
Where are we goin'?
"Cyprus, a Ietterfrom Ciro."
"Ciro, a Ietterfrom Cyprus."
- Want some coffee?
"- No, thank you."
"When they say ""Want some coffee?"", ""No, thank you."""
Say it.
Let's go.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Even though-
Even though- We're scared.
We're scared.
'Cause it's life- It's life.
And it's happening.
"It's really, really happening... right now."
All right.
"Now let's kiss to make it real, okay?"
Okay.
"So, how is your art project?"
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No.
That's not how it works.
"You know, they have to know about your work-"
"I would just march in there and show it to them, you know?"
No one is going to live your life for you.
Okay.
"That's not how itworks, but okay."
"So, how's Ellen?"
"Oh, she's wonderful."
I can't sleep at night thinking about her.
I just wish I had met her 50 years sooner.
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed... 70 years of life... to be ready for a woman like Ellen.
This rug is dirty.
Everyone get a box on the way out.
Ow.
Ow.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
Ow.
"Hey, kiddies."
Got your juice.
"Oh, thanks, Ethan."
"Thanks so much, buddy."
We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and... really just juice.
But we love juice.
Are you kids okay?
"Oh, we're just great, thanks."
Last juice of the day.
Great.
"Uh, cran-apple?"
Wait a minute.
Something's up.
Why are you out of breath?
"Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces..."
"Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking."
Why are your shoes muddy?
Because I'm-I'm poor.
"Oh, I'm so poor."
And why are you in your underwear?
Because I am rich.
There's been a burglary.
Somebody stole my chocolate!
I am very shocked by that.
"Okay, what was rule number two?"
Always believe in yourself?
No!
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
- What?
"Cousin, cousin, where did you find Mickey?"
In a train.
- What transport?
- Me
Are you an innocent?
I could say I'm a virgin man.
Not for long.
It hurts.
I bleed.
"No, you're enjoying it."
That's me bleeding.
You come when I will.
Ready?
"Leon, do not expect."
"Forget the address, forget everything."
Mickey is doing well.
Begone!
I'd like to ...
I can not ...
Yes?
Do not give money here.
Autographs and postcards Post exclusively.
Hungry?
The ladies are asleep.
Do not make any noise.
Come into the kitchen.
"Coffee, chocolate, tea?"
"Below, we, you know All of your disasters."
"Floods, terrorism, wars, famine, innocent martyrs."
"Propaganda, we would laugh."
We want to see.
"Okay, I will search for her."
I will also go to look around again.
I'm leaving first.
It's still my official duties.
Go there and look around.
Miss Kim Mi Jin!
"Oh, you are..."
You okay?
Wait a minute.
I'm with the Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces.
Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju.
I'm not a pervert.
Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces?
Is it true?
There has been too many impostors recently.
It's true.
But this time what are you working as?
This dress...
Not working anymore.
"I'm currently working as a country official, I'm afraid I can't say more."
A country official?
Can it be you're a police woman?
That is also a secret.
I'm in a hurry to find someone.
I'm sorry.
That...
"The woman who was with you the last time you interfered,"
Where did you take her?
Da Hye!
Do you know how to contact her?
Da Hye!
Da Hye!
Like where?
Neverland?
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
- Where?
I'll tell you where.
- Pfft.
Close your eyes and point.
"Whatever spot you pick, that's our home."
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
Everything's near a beach.
"Okay, then."
Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is!
Are you sure?
Is this what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
It keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
- I'll take first shift.
- I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We would never get it far enough away.
Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
Rip?
Rip!
What are you doing?
"I'm flying the Waverider into the sun,"
- with the meteor on board.
- And you on it.
I guess this is good-bye.
"It's been a pleasure, Captain."
"Likewise, Dr. Palmer."
"But you brought us all into this, man."
"Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson."
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
"I appreciate that, Mr. Rory."
"I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap..."
Rip.
Daddy?
Miranda.
I...
Where...
"I'm still here, Captain."
"I know you are, Gideon."
May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Me neither.
Which reminds me...
Don't worry.
"What are you doing, you stupid girl!"
She's very beautiful.
- Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.
Had too much to drink last night?
"She is an alcoholic, mom."
"She and Gurmeet Singh will get along so well, I can't tell you."
Good morning.
Good morning.
"Gurmeet, Saira."
"Saira, Gurmeet."
My mom.
"I seek your blessings, mom."
She also pays respect!
"That's enough, drama queen."
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Are you alright?
I'm done for.
What happened?
Look at your hand.
What's happening?
"Quick to jump into bed, quick to propose."
- Awesome.
- Then what!
Yesterday we met your parents.
Today we met mine.
"So now we are kind of engaged, huh?"
Are you asking or telling me?
Do you have full on attraction?
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
Where is she?
Where's Hyo-jin?
!
Hyo-jin!
What is it?
Where are you headed in the dark of night?
I'm asking you.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Girl about this tall?
Yeah.
Hyo-jin?
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
Drink.
Passports.
"Yes, I know,  but..."
If we had the passports
She would understand who we are.
"I repeat that he is our king, Nicolas III, king of Belgium."
What will we do about our king?
What did the Queen want us to grasp?
Its vitality...
And his spontaneity.
And smiles.
And smiles.
We need an official version of this story.
Why not the truth?
Ready?
His Majesty?
What a relief to hear his voice.
"Yes, he is here, right next to me."
"No, I mean, that's right..."
"There is Mr. Moreau over here, I take it."
Ready.
His Majesty?
"Yes...  yes, we're fine."
And you?
"I mean, kingdom?"
And the political situation?
"Yes, I understand..."
The king is fine.
We have a small problem.
"Yes, you too, I imagine..."
Excuse me if I stop...
"No, we are not in Istanbul."
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
- and a marquee.
"- Oh, Jesus."
You're the only one offering the moon and the stars.

"- Tony, are you OK?"
"- I'm top-notch, buddy."
Enjoying your night out?
Me too.
"Hey, Nips."
"- Don't call her Nips, Tony."
"- Why, what you gonna do?"
"I'm, uh, objecting."
Strongly.
- Come on...
"- Tony, what are you doing?"
"Isn't she pretty, hey man?"
Tony.
You two make such a sweet couple!
Out of all the world's famous lovers
- Anthony and Cleopatra...
"Taylor and Burton, Jordan and Peter..."
Stop it.
Bert and Ernie...
I would say that you two are quite possibly the greatest snog history has so far encountered.
"What is wrong with you, Tony?"
Are you OK?
What is it with you people and the concept of OK?
"I mean, we're a fucking threesome, aren't we?"
You know... peas in a pod.
"A fucking family, that's what we are."
D'you need to sit down?
Just calm down.
No...
This was not the job.
I got business to finish.
You stay here.
How do I get to the Oval Office?
Take the stairs to the ground floor..
you go to the end of the West Colonnade.
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!
You heard the man!
Tour's over.
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get the money myself.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
You think I put my country through this for money?
I hate mercenaries.
It's about time.
I choose the pen!
Come here.
Get up.
Up!
Put your hand..
Weapon system unlocked.
Enter presidential launch code.
"Mr. President, please wake up, wake up."
Please!
"Sir, we're at DEFCON 1."
The nuclear football in the White House went live.
That's impossible.
It's happening.
I can not hear you!
Does your heart hurt?
Let me have a look.
"The old warriors believed, that the heart was sacred."
"That if a hunter tasted his flesh,"
I could look at the spiritual world.
But I do not see any spiritual world.
"Maybe she was the only one, who had no soul."
Food for the creatures of God.
"You disappoint me, Bishop."
I expected much more from Mara's husband.
You are more trash than the man.
Barbarous and cruel.
A daughter.
"Our daughter, Mara."
"Come on, Bishop."
Follow me.
How can you leave us alone ?
!
Are you my daughter?
My name is Aluxia.
I have been waiting for you.
- I'm dead?
- Do you feel dead?
Not quite.
Just tired.
You've been dreaming.
Yes.
And you were there.
I do not want to get lost.
"- Leave it alone, Aluxia."
- Ok dad.
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
That was seven years ago.
I know.
"I'm trying, darling."
Did you see this?
Why are the drapes open?
"Kay, are you all right?"
-Are you hit?
-No.
It's all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Halt!
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.
Alive!
Stay by the door.
"Yeah, come in."
"-Mike, are you all right?"
-Yeah.
"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom."
And I know that's upset you in the past.
You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.
But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you.
Now you're the only one I can trust.
Fredo?
"Well, he's got a good heart."
"But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death."
"Tom, you're my brother."
"I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey."
A real brother.
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby... died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
How's your leg?
How about you?
"Fine, mama."
I'm fine.
[Speaking Greek]
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.
"Oh, really?"
When?
Last month.
Too tight?
No.
"Mama, you have to stay off it."
You can't go up and down the stairs.
You have to give it a rest.
Ok.
"Mama, I could take you somewhere where you would be safe and wouldn't be alone."
There would be people around.
You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.
[Speaking Greek]
You understand me?
"This is my house, and I'm not going no place."
"Dimmie, you worry for something."
"No, mama."
You are not happy.
"Tell me, what is the matter?"
"Mama, I'm all right."
"I'm fine, really I am."
[Tunes radio to Greek music]
Here it comes.
There.
Look at that.

PETE:
What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that cat-lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
Why?
- This is 7 Mary 3.
U.C. Medical says the baby should have its stomach pumped immediately.
Imperative.
Antitoxin must be administered.
- We have to get him to a hospital.
- Don't worry.
We will.
Send an ambulance to Malibu end of the canyon.
We'll meet them there.
- 10-4.
- Carry or lead?
I'll carry.
"Come on, Henry."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
You'll go with big Jon.
"Hang on, Henry."
"Hey, screw you, cop."
Get over there.
Easy.
"Easy, Henry."
Come on.
Here.
Take it easy.
Attaboy.
"Hey, his name is Henry."
"He's still in recovery, but the doctor says he's gonna be okay."
What about the baby food?
It's all accounted for. 15-8's got it.
"You put in a good day, fellows."
There is one other thing.
I hate to bring it up but you'll have to cut down on the personal calls at the office.
But we weren't even there to make any calls.
- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Richard!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought your car was over here.
It is.
It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.
Doesn't that break the rules of the thing?
This can be like the afterlife.
"You know, like we're angels or something?"
Cute.
What are you doing in my car?
"No, I don't know you, and you certainly don't know anything about me."
"I mean, what if I'm a killer of children?"
Yeah.
"Well, that would put a damper on things, wouldn't it?"
"See, you're acting like I'm just this regular man."
Like a man in a book who thewoman in the book meets.
I'm not doing that.
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?
"-Well, I'm sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.
-You should be.
Good.
Terrific.
Canyou get out of my car now?
Okay.
Okay.
"Both of you, out!"
"- But we're waiting for a call, sarge..."
- Look.
Stand by at home.
I will phone you when the call comes in.
Good.
We'll both be at my place.
"I don't care where you are, as long as you're not here."
Got it?
- Right.
- Good.
Good.
"Hey, why your place?"
I want you to see Melinda.
- Melinda?
- Yup.
"Oh, yeah, the one with the sexy feet."
Right.
And you'll get a free introductory lesson to the Poncherello School of Cool.
"Hello, Henry."
"That's a boy, that's a boy."
Feel better?
What do you think I should use?
Do I give her my Redford approach?
"Or maybe I'll be more continental, like Rex Harrison."
I just want to see her feet.
"Well, maybe I'll try my Stallone."
"Hey, hey, come here."
Hey!
"Hey, Ponch."
"Oh, mister, don't open that hood."
"Don't open that hood, whatever you do."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.
-l'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
-lt's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
He's required to call on the widow.
is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
You heard Rhodes.
He's got his hands full.
"Besides, we're running out of time as it is."
"Now, now."
Where's--?
Where's my journal?
D-d-don't...
"Don't, uh-- Don't touch... anything."
"What do you mean, we're running out of time?"
That's right.
"In fact, we've only got two days to find the treasure."
I can't even find my journal.
Why only two days?
Ah!
Ha.
Success.
"Professor, why only two days?"
Because that is when the first line of Solon's riddle comes true.
"I copied it, uh--"
"Uh, from an altar I found in--"
In the caves at Exeter.
Where is it?
Hm.
There we are.
There you are.
"""When the gods march in rank."""
What does it mean?
"Well, you saw the carvings on the Ark."
"Now, as you know--"
"I mean, when the Romans adopted the Greek gods, they gave them new names."
"Now, let's see, uh,"
Hermes became Mercury.
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
In Albany.
We are in Albania.
"Yes, like Mother Teresa."
"In prison, His Majesty."
Yes...
Okay.
Yes.
"Seeing Him, His Majesty..."
Why did you tell her about the prison?
- I did not want to invent a story.
The Chief of Cabinet will call you to this number.
And then we'll call the guards.
"Now I'm off, if you do not mind her."
"Thank you, sorry."
She does not answer.
- Wait.
I do not mean to wait.
"First, you must contact..."
It's ringing.
"Yes, we are healthy and safe..."
Did anyone explain it to you?
Can you contact the embassy in Albania?
Go call the guards.
Lord?
Lord?
Ludovic and Louise were immersed in the protocol.
"Meanwhile, that little brother had returned to being a puppet."
"Sire, here's a clean shirt."
I see.
Agree.
Goodbye.
"Mr. Lloyd, the palace has canceled Our King."
-Otherwise you are very nice.
-To your health.

Everyone!
"And you, my dear"
-Call me Pepa.
"-Hi, Pepa."
-What should I call you?
"-Whatever you like, Pepa."
"-For example, can I call you monster?"
"-You can, Pepa."
-And I will also call you monster.
"-Call me monster 2,"
-so there's order in it.
"-Bye, monsters."
"Bye, Pepa."
"Boys, I like you."
Yirinka!
These are my friends from space.
"Nice to meet you, I'm the princess of Monaco."
They are just flying back.
Cheers.
"-Cheers, Pepa."
"-Cheers, monsters."
Well?
Do they congratulate us?
I'm looking forward to going home.
"We'll get bonuses, I'll buy new aquarium, feed the fish, and have peace and quiet."
Wait here.
Hello.
"Good evening, boys."
- Have you got the stuff?
- What stuff?
- The Mickey Finns.
- What do you want 'em for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"- I'm afraid it's our duty, madam."
- We're police officers.
Come along.
- (Sighs)
(Footsteps)
My dear Lord Mayley!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
"Laden with good news, I trust?"
- Yes... and no.
- Ah...
Hmm...
I'm willing to pay but the point is this - my wife's rich father is on his last legs.
- So?
- He won't last a year.
"She'll get the lot, I shall be able to extract."
A year?
"I gave you two weeks, remember?"
"- Yes but £10,000..."
- You're an insurance chief.
- You earn a lot.
- My wife spends a lot.
"- If there's any left, I spend it."
- Too bad.
"I don't know where I'm going to get £10,000."
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
The hell with it.
The hell with you.
"Uh, you know, about the other night."
I don't want there to be--
"Don't even worry about it, man."
Myjaw's not made out of glass.
"Yeah, well, you know, blood's thicker than blonds, right ?"
"So, you got my back on Saturday ?"
Derek...
"I ain't got nobody else, man."
- You got Lip.
- Lip ?
"Man, that fool will get a nigger killed quick, man."
"No, I need you there."
"47th Street, under the El."
"I'll call you, man."
Are you down ?
"- Yeah, I'm down."
"- All right, man."
"Let me get to class, get some education like you."
All right.
Uh... I don't wanna bug you. I just came in here to say good luck.
"So, tomorrow's the big day, huh ?"
Yeah.
- You scared ?
- Shitless.
You got a minute foryour old man ?
I wanna show you something.
Sure.
Be careful.
"That wall, it's, uh, still wet."
"That'syourmother when she was 19, when I fiirst met her."
"We come, you lie down anatomically, like tenth we."
-It already is.
-It already is.
"What thinks, colleague?"
"I would begin by one ""intramuslus rigidum""."
Previous or later?
That depends on the availability of the patient.
Exact.
Tell me?
It hurts here?
-No.
-All to regulate.
Passive insensibility.
here?
-No...
-No?
"What thinks, colleague?"
-Colleague?
What thinks?
"-""Cachondum inmediatum""."
It is the same sensation that I have.
I propose that we deepen.
"Yes. ""Profundicemus, apropincuamus semper""."
"""Aprovechemus""."
"Now, you pay attention."
"Tell me, What notices here?"
to please or pain?
-Good... for pleasing.
-It is what I imagined it to be.
"An injection makes lack of ""mine-dura""."
And of mine no?
"Yes, yes, carry out, carry out."
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
James:
That's me.
"Hi, I'm Agnes lenbert."
I work for social services.
Who's she?
Her name is kalaya nirapattanassai.
She's a thai national.
"Hello, kalaya."
My name is James.
She doesn't speak much English.
Can we speak in private?
Why is she here?
She was arrested at the airport yesterday with 2 adult thai nationals who were smuggling heroin.
She was posing as the drug smugglers' daughter.
Where there any drugs found on her?
"No, she was just there to make it look like a family vacation."
To Pittsburgh.
Heh!
Not exactly a thai dream.
No wonder they got caught.
Where's she staying?
At a locked shelter for juvenile offenders.
But I don't understand why you're here.
I think she wants asylum.
[Slowly] Do you speak any English?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
Do you want to stay with Uncle Joe?
Does Uncle Joe live here?
Does Uncle Joe know you're coming?
Uncle Joe.
Me and Uncle Joe.
"I have seen it, Shiv."
What happened?
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.
It's a classic 70mm 3D Jodha Akbar scenario!
Oh God!
I look so hot in that costume.
And Zak was getting beaten up back then as well.
Take a look.
He looked like a joker back then too.
And you were so sexy back then too!
Press it again.
Press it again.
Go to hell if you don't want to believe it.
Baby... slave...
Massage my feet before you leave.
- Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!
Wow!
Helicopter!
Who am I?
Osama?
Shiv...
- Yes.
- Don't move.
- What happened?
There's a spider on you.
What are you doing!
Where did it go?
- I feel ashamed.
- Why?
"Back in that life, you had killed a tiger."
Hold on.
Hold on.
"Sam, hang it up."
Hang it up.
[Typing]
[Beeping]
Why don't I just run a search on his credit card?
Mmm.
Smart.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- James W. Harpel?
- Mm-hmm.
Looks like he opened up a tab at Pure about an hour ago.
Thank you.
That reverse psychology stuff?
"That's cheating, Sam."
Uh-huh.
"If you ain't cheating', you ain't tryin', Mike."
Damn.
Hey.
You guys see this?
"""Mancuso menaces Montecito."
"Ghost of former owner haunts hotel."" What the hell is this?"
I don't know.
Maybe that guy Taylor went to the press.
"What, because we made him pay what he owed?"
"Well, if he thought the story was gonna hurt us, he was wrong."
Bookings are way up.
Haunted hotels...
quite popular apparently.
Quite popular apparently?
Hundred percent.
"Unfortunately, your ball won't make it over."
- Data tennis is starting to show its abilities.
- It's really a strong method.
Use that move.
Yosh.
"Do it, Kaidou."
Game set and match.
Won by Seigaku.
Seven games to five.
It's a pit between physical peserverence.
We can't lose.
Third match is beginning.
Hyotei's Kabaji against Seigaku's Kawamura.
One set match.
Hyotei to serve.
Play.
Hadoukyuu.
15
- Love
What!
Winner will be Hyotei.
"If this continues, we'll lose."
"Taka-san, that is..."
I will definitely win this match.
I want to be in the Nationals.
Single-handed Hadoukyuu technique.
I can't play anymore.
Kabaji's stamina is actually drained.
The last ball doesn't count.
Singles three no game.
Chiku'so!
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I...
That's haven't been honest with you about a couple things.
Okay.
I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night.
That guy at church was Tim Riggins.
Mmm-hmm.
We have kind of a history together.
"Okay, what kind of history?"
"Get the door, Brian."
Hey.
"Hey, I just came by to say that I'm sorry."
Come in.
"Hey, Noannie."
Didn't Mom ban her?
"Noannie, please."
"Just watch your show and be easy, all right?"
I just feel so bad about everything.
I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that.
I wish we could erase that whole day.
It's gonna be okay.
This whole thing gonna blow over.
I was really worried about you.
Smash always lands on his feet.
Hello?
Who is that?
No.
"No, I don't."
Who is this?
"Noannie, give me the phone."
You guys are jerks.
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
I made friends with a transvestite prostitute.
Another one?
Big deal.
Uh...
I slept with Olivia!
You what?
!
That's good.
Yeah.
More stuff like that.
Tell her where.
"Uh, okay."
In your living room.
"Kitchen floor, on your bed... where your head goes."
Olivia!
"Oh, I'm not ashamed of anything I did to him."
"I am, a little."
Can you at least wear the gloves?
You're getting palm sweat all over the steering wheel.
Don't worry.
I'm getting everything.
"Over the shoulder, over the shoulder!"
"Abby, over my shoulder!"
"Okay, all right."
"If it makes you feel any better, way more people than this have gathered around to see my vagina."
That does not make me feel better.
Nor I.
Billie!
Billie!
Zack!
Did I miss anything?
I love you.
Hi.
Who's Mrs. Frederic?
"I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you."
What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
Perhaps he's doing his nets or something.
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
Water...
"Good, we'll continue with his regular injections."
"Are you responsible for him, Ms. Cappia..."
Cappam?
"Cappi, Professor."
The needle...
"May we give you a hand, Doctor?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Come, come... this may hurt a bit!"
Now everything's ready.
- All set.
"- Just relax, relax..."
He requires an emergency operation.
I can't tomorrow.
I'm too tired.
Then there's the weekend.
I'll operate on Monday.
What is it?
Who died?
You!
- It must have been you!
- No.
We didn't do it!
- It must have been you!
I'll...
"- One, two and three... in my office!"
We always take her with us.
It's a bad habit.
"Courage, Doctor."
Courage...
It's always the three of them who organize these pranks.
Get the hell out of here Danny!
You drunk!
***
***
- What's wrong with him?
"- Oh, Danny was so mean to him this morning."
I can still totally picture it.
"So it all started when Justin, he woke up."
He was in a great mood.
"He was like, man, I love being in love, man."
I just love it.
Makes me wanna do the moonwalk.
I could do the moonwalk.
I could get jiggy with it.
I could...
I could spin.
I could jump.
I could dance for days and days but I'm not.
I'm just gonna stand completely still.
Completely still.
Still like a stone.
Like a stone.
"And then... and then Danny,"
We pan over to Danny and Danny was all like grrr.
I think love is stupid.
Getting married.
"Getting married, ""pfft""."
That's all like a dumb mistake.
I would never do that.
And I get to be mean to you for just no reason because I'm a big baby.
I'm a big baby.
My hair's too long to be a baby but I act like a baby anyways.
Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so..."
This page gets a lot of action.
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon."
Thank you.
Bye.
PAIGE:
What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
There is a difference.
BETH:
"Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
PAIGE:
She wanted to do it.
LAURA:
Really?
She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
- Is that not right?
PAIGE:
"No, she didn't."
LAURA:
No?
BETH:
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?
PAIGE:
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter and I am not waiting till spring.
You are so pregnant.
PAIGE:
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.
Order.
"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.
"S-h-u- you know what, comrade?"
"I'm getting a little tired of spelling ""Shuckton."""
It's a little town with a big heart and it is really easy to spell.
"Well, I am trying to speak to the Mayor of Russia."
"What do you mean, you don't have a m..."
"Look, do you people want to rape our land or not?"
Rape.
Rape!
R-a- never...
You know what?
Never mind!
Travis!
That's my name.
I'm gonna need a power shake.
And by power shake you mean Martini.
Yes.
But I'm gonna call it a power shake.
"But it is still a quadruple Martini, right?"
Yes.
"Ah, I'm on it."
Prosecution calls it's witness.
"Thank you, your honour."

Normally they shout only when they see him
Now they shout even after he has gone in
What are you doing outside?
One guy is on a chopping spree inside
What are you saying sir?
What is happening there?
Break open
What were you doing out?
Ramanathan where are you?
- My phone fell into the water
Can't you pick the phone?
Don't shout without knowing what happened.
- What happened?
Did someone die?
- Worse than that!
- What?
I'm using the phone that fell into a commode.
Alphonse...
- Look how he is responding...
He is screaming at me.
- Ignore him.
Did you trace their location?
- Shall we leave?
Okay.
AKG service apartment is Vikram's location.
Vasundhara's phone shows the same location.
They must be together.
Let's go.
Panju.
Panju.
407.
- Sir.
You seem to be very clear about what you need.
I'm the confused one running after you repeatedly.
Driver.
Start.
Go...
Hey!
She has swept his account clean.
Thank you.
"She did see us, right?"
I see.
No nausea?
No vertigo?
Here.
Now?
No.
Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky.
But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time.
You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes.
Well.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
"You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here."
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
I'm the friggin' host of the show.
"Oh, okay."
We're being interviewed by a 12 year old.
Hi.
"I'm 14, and my show gets the most hits on Viddimension."
- You dig?
- Yeah.
I dig.
"I guess ""dig's"" back in."
"Now, I hope you noobs are ready 'cause I've played your beta, and I got some serious questions for you guys."
So who's gonna walk me through the demo downloads?
- I hope it's you.
"- Uh, I will."
- Come on.
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"- Yeah, that's awesome."
Hi.
"Oh, hey, you must be Suzanne."
"I'm Deena, Dave's wife."
Of course.
Really nice to meet you.
Dave's told me so much about you.
"Oh, not too much, I hope."
Hi.
Hey... honey.
What are you doing here?
"- Hi, honey."
- What are you doing here?
"Well, you know, today's a big day for you, so I just, uh--"
I'm--I'm glad you came.
And I finally get to meet the famous Suzanne.
"- I just can't believe it's taken this long-- - oh, it's been really crazy."
Right there.
Darren vogel.
That's enright's attorney.
"Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links"
A week before the murder.
Think that's a coincidence?
"Not a chance, eric."
Oh...
Looks like we've got some babysitters.
"Have a nice day, gentlemen."
"well, what are you doing?"
What...
What are you wearing?
"Get off the phone, please."
bunny?
Yeah.
"No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it."
Excuse me.
"Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here."
"Yes, I-I've got to go."
All right.
"Yeah, all right."
I'll see you at 7:00.
"Yeah, love you."
"Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour."
But here's the good news:
I take euros.
We are not soliciting counsel.
We're here about the tony enright case.
Enright?
Come on.
"That's old history, isn't it?"
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."
Get off the street!
- Run!
- Hide!
Here come the goon goons!
Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.
Yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
I can see it now.
It's gonna be great.
Lex.
It's Gina.
Please call me back.
I found who you've been searching for.
I know who the traveler is.
"After the funeral, I plan on taking some time off."
Get the jet ready.
Zurich.
You can't run away.
"No matter where you go, I'll always be there."
You can't get rid of me.
You need my help.
There's still good inside you.
I know it.
I don't want your help.
Don't go to Zurich.
I'm going.
I have to.
Dad was right.
"If you open the box, it will destroy you."
It's all I have left.
It's not true.
You still have me.
I'm done listening to you.
You make me weak.
Long night.
It's good to see the sun again.
It's too bad Lionel's not here to see it.
Lex closed the funeral to any and all guests.
"In other words, Lex is the only one invited."
"""Where's Behzad?"""
"She said, ""He took a towel and went out."""
You weren't down near the spring.
I tried the other side but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.
How can you cross?
There's a bridge.
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!
I work in the fields.
You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.
Mind you don't fall.
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.
Your personal bridge?
All the children use it.
- How are you?
- Okay.
How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.
"- Oh, Mrs Malek?"
- Yes.
She didn't eat the soup from Mash Hajer and the others.
How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.
"- Ari, look at us becoming BFF's."
- I know.
- I love that it's capsulated on film.
- It's on film for...
- That's an attractive looking face.
- You're drunk.
- Good look.
- You're beautiful.
"Ari, when you..."
- Okay.
- I love this.
Have you been looking at me?
"""I've been looking at you guys."
"Have you been looking at me?"""
A lot of good practice.
Flirting in college.
It really helped a lot.
And look at Jonny's bone structure.
- Yeah.
- Jonny has the greatest face.
- Look at that.
"- Oh, mama."
He's creepy.
People keep asking me if Jonny's related to Josh Hartnett.
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Really?
"I don't even really know the answer to that, I assume not."
"I don't think he is, but I can see why they're asking."
- Just because they look...?
- What is that?
"Yeah, they have similar bone structure."
- came all this way to see me.

No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
"Hello, John Klein."
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
"Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin."
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
"Okay, you got my attention."
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
"You're reading my mind, aren't you?"
Did you read my mind?
"I have no need to, do I?"
What's the third line of page 51?
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!
call me Dean.
"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."
-Right after I finish talking with--
-Dean.
-Found your pet.
-Where?
"squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth."
I'm trying not to wig out here.
"Oh, it's Wayne."
How are you now?
"Oh, not so bad."
"Yeah, this one's too hard."
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)
We don't have time to discuss that business.
Devon.
Stewart.
I come in peace.
How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock?
You don't.
Speak.
Do not approach.
- Seen Katy around?
- No.
- That is all.
- (GROWLING) Stewart!
Trouble in paradise?
"If there was, she wouldn't know it."
I'm not talking to her.
Well played.
Wait it out.
That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why.
- Precisely.
- She should anyway.
- If she's smart.
- I know.
- Why are you mad at her?
- She acts like...
You should try an open relationship.
Could be productive.
You could also try a hall pass.
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."
-you quiet...
How long you take in uninformed?
Ever since I was born.
By where one begins?
"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?
Don't bother me.
Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.
"Get up, Rudy."
N-No.
Beans didn't do anything.
He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag.
No!
No!
Don't you touch Beanbag!
No!
All right!
Bonus round.
Winner takes all.
- Freddy!
"[ Ray ] You see, Officer, in Garrison... when the car you're gonna tag has got a P.D.A. sticker..."
"I'd advise you to think to yourself, """"Hey, that's one of the good guys."
"I think I'll go catch me a bad guy."""
"If we didn't pull over P.D., there wouldn't be any violations in this town."
The problem in this town ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
"Is this a new car, Ray?"
It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.
"Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home."
Tell this cupcake to heel.
"- Okay, that's not necessary."
- Cindy.
"- Well, listen, take care, guys."
See you later.
- [ Ray ] Hey.!

[ Phone Ringing ]
Dispatch.
"No, no."
Slug.
Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
Yeah.
You seemed bored.
-I tried to be seductive.
-Other guys can see it.
One guy under a bridge.
He wasn't interested.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-Nothing's wrong.
-Answer it.
-It's ok.
-I said answer it!
Answer it and turn it off.
It bothers me.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Yeah.
-Hey I'm at yoga place.
It's not at this time usually.
"Yeah, the trainer came home late last night."
Maybe she was drunk her ass off.
She loves drinking.
You don't have to hang up.
She isn't here yet.
Are you busy?
I guess I'll have to hang up then.
I got vaccine for German Measles.
They say I don't have the antibodies.
Doctor says that we have to use condoms for a month to 3 months at least.
It takes about that long for the antibodies to generate.
You have to do them.
I can't take pills.
-Hyang Gi.
"Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother."
I think David's mixed up in something.
That girl they found in the Kingsmead...
"Jack, it's me, Jane."
Just checking in on the latest on the Bentleys.
"Apparently, they're gonna rob a bank."
- There's something going out between those brothers.
We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
"You a superstitious man, Silas?"
He's losing his grip on this job.
"There's a matching necklace, part of a set."
My God.
"- Jane, there's something..."
- Yes?
I saw you both earlier.
You should speak to him.
If you're serious.
About what?
- Sarge?
- What the hell was that?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!

Someone tell me what the hell's going on!
I want two of you on doors!
Get outta here!
"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?
"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"
You're blocking' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
"- Now, back away."
- That's it!
"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.
"Jahan, take a look."

"naples: gunfire downtown,"

Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't yourfriend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
Where'd you spend it?
"Look, man, I just wanted to start over."

No loose ends.
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
Be a fucking 'nother Toxie.
TRENT HAAGA:
"All right, no problem."
"And In fact, I want that other guy."
I want you to get-- hey.
"Rhonda, Rhonda."
"We're gonna sign that other guy, and we're gonna pay him."
So we can't do the first 12 feet?
"No, Lloyd won't do it."
He's fucking pissed at me.
He's pissed at everybody.
He's totally psycho.
This is a super long shot over the tops
Of the heads of crowds.
We got fog and--

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"OK, let's do it?"

Unbelievable.
All right?
And it looks like shit.
It's gonna look like shit.
I can't get through that little flag there.
But this guy can.
"He's a half inch taller than Tito, for christ sake."
"Oh, Red, you missed a spot."
See it right there?

"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.
"- Yeah, the Cozy Cone."
- It's newly refurbished.

"Ah, if you want, I can talk directly to the mana-"
Wait!
"This is weekly shounen monday, special extra-large spring edition!"

[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
Then you should fight.
With everything you have.
- What do you want?
- I want you to stop being so afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- I'm want us to stop being so careful.
- I'm just-
- I wanna marry you!
What?
I wish the sun would rise already.
This graveyard shift's going forever.
You okay?
"I love you too, Carter, but it's over."
I'm gonna ask her tonight.
You're going to propose?
"Actually, I already did, but badly."
- She said no?
- She didn't say anything.
But this time I'm gonna do it right.
That is a nice rock.
That was my great-grandmother's.
Great-grandfather gave it to her the day he left for the Army.
I don't think she'll mind that it's secondhand.
Hey.

JANINE:
"I mean, everyone makes mistakes."
"I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?"
"Probably seems the wrong time to do that, but why not?"
"You know, why not?"
Better later than never.
I'm dating now.
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?
Have you been married?
MAN:
"Yes, I'm married."
- You are married?
MAN:

MARY:
"We're heading there, is that fair?"
CONOR:
It's moving fast.
Just on our way.
"I like him, I'll say that L word."
"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
"I like her a lot, so..."
"- Good, I'm glad."
[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"
Xiamu...
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
- Are you allright?

Did you get injured?
Don't come near Shu Yawang anymore!
"I come near to her,"

Don't you believe me?
You want me to show you?
What are you looking at?
Don't you know me?
I'm Mousy!
I'm a fighter!
You're filthy!
And you have a bad attitude!
"You see good people, and you bully them!"
"You see bad people, and you fear them!"
My big sister's no coward!
"If we don't get the money, we'll come after you!"
"Mousy, who are you shouting at?"
- Him.
- Who's he?
He's me and I'm him.
Useless bum!
Where's the money you collected today?
I collected more laundry.
- Here.
- More business as well.
Your shirt looks dirty.
Take it off for a wash.
It's OK to be dirty.
- Take it off!
- No need!
Where's the money?
Where's the money you collected today?
Ah Fook's house has a fierce dog.
Ah Sao says he's got no money.
Big Mouth shouted at me.
I didn't collect any money.
There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place.
Oh no.
What?
What is it?
There's no beer.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on."
Oh shit.
"Blair, Ollie."
Did you find it?
No.
The skylight is sealed shut.
How did you open it in the first place?
It was already wide open.
I just went through.
Us too.
He's back.
"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."
Where?
We already checked everywhere.
Look how happy the mom is now.
"-Oh, Rach."
-Screw you!
You don't have to do it!
-Hey.
-Hey!
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Why?
"Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
"In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner."
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
"What's going on, huh?"
Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe I can help.
"Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
"You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex."
"-So anyway, what is it?"
-Forget about it.
It's no big deal.
"-Come on, what is it?"
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, René?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, René."
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
"Nice going, Campbell."
"Hey, Ben."
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
"Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,"
"Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar."
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah.
Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
"You live in Washington, D.C."
"Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach."
Will anyone help me?
Hey Gocha...
"Don't put pressure, he may die."
"See and tell me, I must kill him."
I must kill him.
"Hey, Doctor?"
- He's on the bed.
- Wake him up!
"Doctor is there, but what you do there?"
What to do now?
Gocha...
Gone again!
My partner said he's in this quarry.
He can't speak properly.
Even a sorry would hear like quarry.
"Sir, is Singamuthu's son a fool like you to come here?"
- Valentine's day?
That's in two weeks.
"Give me the sandwich, Will."
Hold my beer.
I need to talk like an old Italian lady.
What are you talking about?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Are you pregnant?
Did Candace put a baby in you?
I know you're joking but I would happily carry that baby.
"Morning sickness, stretch marks."
I want it all.
There's a point.
I think it's a little weird Especially you.
"Look, I get it."
"You feel like I'm breaking up the best on-screen duo since ""Will  Grace."""
I just want to make sure you're not bummed out.
I'm not bummed.
I'm totally cool.
"Hey, whose Twitter handle is cool Danny?"
Hm?
Not mine.
Not mine.
You know why?
I'm too cool for that.
Ah.
That sucks.
Danny.
"Yes, my sweet little Will?"
Don't be a bitch.
Oh.
I can't wait to dance at your wedding.
Now you know what?
"-Dad,listentome!"
"Father,giveme asec ,okay?"

- Stupid fucking cop.
Do you know who my father?
- Where the little girl?
- I do not know from what you're talking about.
"- For your own good, I hope this is a lie."
- Look at yourself.
Stupid fucking nigger police.
- I'm going to ask one more time.
Have something sweet.
"Thank you so much, aunt Anka."
"I'll be off, then."
"Wait, I've got something else."
- What is it?
- Take a look.
Thank you so much.
You really piled up a heap.
"I didn't peel this off, I was afraid to tear the stamp."
- You'll do a better job.
- Thank you so much.
"I asked the neighbours, too."
I know that you collect these things.
- Now you've got a bunch.
"- Thank you, I've got to go."
"Bye, thanks for dropping by."
The series will start now.
"Tito, Nasser, Nehru."
Tito lives.
"Mail for you, Countess Lily, you have to sign here."

"You know what, Lily?"
"Of all the people in this town, you're the most honest person."
My Sime... what is honesty?
"Father Ive, praise the Lord."
This was one of the best days ever!
"- Sime, my man!"
- I'll be only a minute.
It was just like you said!
Lebicada wind on St. Nicholas' Day!
It was a good day for scorpionfish!
Here's one for you.
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."
A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Good morning.
Okay.
So?
"Oh, hi."
- He asked me out.
NATHAN:
Come to my cabin immediately
Okay sir..
Sir..
- Is your son a Police officer?
I am asking you.
Why do you laugh?
Is your son a Police officer?
He is not even passed Inter.
How can he become a Police officer sir?
"No, he is lying."
"He is a Police Officer, I have seen."
I now understood whom you have seen.
"I, myself was confused being his own father."
No surprise in you being confused.
What are you saying?
There is a Police Officer who looks same as my son.
He even has a girlfriend.
He speaks non-stop in Hindi.
My son doesn't know any Hindi.
Are you sure?
How can person failing Inter and working as stuntman become a Police Officer sir?
You can go now..
- OK sir.
Sudhakar..
- Sir.
I am sending the details.
You do an inquiry.
You're so fat!

I don't know.
Better find out.
"All right, we better tell the captain."
I'll call him.
Might be a good idea to put some uniforms at our houses.
Got it.
I'll send one to the captain's.

"Yeah, I'm just not sure if I do."

But I don't have anything for you.
And yet you do.

Of course most things do.
I didn't know you were into Travis.
"Are you kidding, I love Travis."
He's the best.
Who?
Travis guy.
Are we not in the same conversation?
Check out tracks 8 and 13.
You'll love them.
Bye.
Thought you might want that back.
I already have it.
So do I.

Totally you.
So what are you doing?
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.

What is it?

What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.

You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
"Gosh bro, this isn't hard to understand!"
Love is like a disease.
You can treat it.
I will prescribe you some medicine.
"Here, shrimp dumplings."
Just eat this yummy stuff you like.
It will help.
"One more thing, you have to find something to do."
So you won't be free to think too much.
Working is good.
Way back when I was like you broken-hearted.
I almost flunked out of college.
I kept working.
"Then forgot everything, even being broken-hearted."
"Stop being sad, no time for that."
Just worked.
It works!

He wanted to have a drink so we did.
What do you want to have?
"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.
It's cute.
"No, it's a piece of crap."
Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike.

"Of course it's ok, if you're here to stay."
"Sarah's here for dinner, which, uh... is actually going to be ready momentarily, so..."
"So, what was it this time?"
"Did you run out of money, or did you have another fight with Martin?"
"Yeah, it was a big mistake."
I really shouldn't have come here.
"Sarah, wait."
Check your bank account.
Your money's back.
[WHISPERS] It's Georgina.
"[IN NORMAL VOICE] Georgina, where are you?"

- You'll pipe in every time I talk?
- Can it.
- Stuff it.
- They're in love.
- Clearly.
"Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too."
It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.
"That's Emily, right?"
- Rich people feel so entitled.
"- Yes, damn them."
I saw her wipe her face with a $100 bill.
We should line them up against a wall.
You know what I'm saying?
- Is Lorelei Gilmore here?
- Yes.
Good.
"Have a look at these, will you?"
- Wow.
Pretty.

You've been together since college.
Yup.
And do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
- I don't think that's true.
"- Well, I've just kept it from you."
"Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions."
Really?
I'm sorry.
You make this difficult because you want it that way.
Men are easy.
"And you've been with Michael, what,"

- Wow.
"Oh, you're lucky."
Jeez.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?

"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
"Next day, I woke up and...both my... my eyes were swelled up."
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.

"Sorry, let's do this."
What's the guy name?
Her who was it?
- Her ex-boyfriend?
- No!
"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi and he checked..."
God.
"That's right, you weren't at the meeting this morning."
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.
I had to wear the same blouse three times last week.
Three!
Three.
"Three, tres, three."
- Hello.
- Sorry.
Just remind me.
"All right, his name is Malcolm O'dwyer."
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.
Wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
- Thank you very much.
- Not you.
The Lotto girl.
You'll thank me later!
"I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous."
Like sandwiches with toothpicks in them dangerous?
Even more dangerous than that.
Like eating a bomb?
In between.
Like eating a firecracker.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Well... aren't you kids playing nice.
"Hey, Ethan, over here."
Look at my face and hands while I'm talking.
I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today.
"Um, it isn't June 3, it's today."
Okay.
"Wait, I have some questions for you."
Uh-huh.
"Um, what does ""Ethan"" mean?"
Um...
Sounds like how Shakespeare Huh?
"So, maybe that's where it comes from?"
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
"Next question, uh... if a train leaves New York at 4:00, and another train leaves Dallas at 5:00, what time will they meet?"
Uh...
Great.
"Well, I'm kind of busy right now, so I'm gonna have to let you go."
Have fun at my mom's birthday.
Bye.
Uh... do you want juice?
!
See?
We haven't got a proper officer so we get pushed about like potboys.
He's not a proper officer.
Never seems to tire.
Hard to catch him off guard.
"He let you off light, Sharpe, back in the village."
So why so hard?
"He's just not right, Cooper."
He's not happy being an officer.
And mark my words he'll bring us bad luck
We'll do it tomorrow.
In the mountains.
Vale.
The fire's started.
Prepare to fight
Down
Get down!
Or I'll kill him
Rifles!
To me!
"Oh, my God."
"Young Perkins, sir."
Not a sound.

No!
"Perkins, I want you to protect this pennant with your life."
"Yes, sir."
"Never say die, Perkins."
"Never again, sir."
They'll be back for them two.
Up!

How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?

"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
- It's gonna happen.
I can feel it.
- Shut up.
You're gonna jinx it.
"Please, God, if you give us a snow day,"
I promise I'll be a good boy for the rest of my life.
"...Abington High closed, Germantown West closed,"
William Penn Academy... open.
- Balls!
- Why?
!
I'm back to being a bad boy.
"This is on you, Mother Nature."
"Sadly, we were that one school that never closed for snow."
"Abington High closed,"
- Germantown West closed...
"- Please, please, please."

- Balls!
Balls!
- I hate everything!
I'm a man of my word!
Ow!
"Every time, it was the same heartbreak... until the snow gods finally showed mercy."
William Penn Academy... closed.
"Am I still asleep, or did he just say William Penn is closed?"
"He said ""closed."" School is closed."
This is the best day of my life!
I feel so alive!
You're gonna have a baby.
"I hope they haul you in, turn a fire hose on you Iike the Iast time!"
-I want my girl down here!

"Hey, stella!"
"Hey, stella!"
I wouldn't mix in this.
"Don't ever leave me, baby."
"BIanche, come back!"
Miss DuBois?
Miss DuBois?
AII quiet along the Potomac now?
She ran down here and went back in there with him.
-Sure she did.
-I'm terrified.
Nothing to be scared of.
They're crazy about each other.
It's a shame this had to happen when you got here.
-violence is so--
-Sit down on the steps...
-...and have a cigarette with me.
-Why I'm not properly dressed.
"well, that don't make no difference in the Quarter."
Such a pretty silver case.
"I showed you the inscription, didn't I?"
Yes.
So much--
So much confusion in the world.
Thank you for being so kind.
I need kindness now.

I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
like some company?
"Yes, I would."
Hi.
"Hi, Andy."
"Hi, boss."
Hi.
Did you hear that?
That was bad.
"That was very, very bad."
Want a date?
I don't think that's going to work.
That's Reverend Whitehead.
God doesn't let him do that.
Got you an ice cream.
Being on the job probably makes you hungry.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Where are you going to sleep tonight?
"In a hotel, if you'll get lost and let me make some money."
I-I don't think you should be doing this.
"What are you, some kind of child missionary?"
Sort of.
I did have an idea about the sleeping thing.
"Hi, Frank."
She spoke to me.
"I speak to her, but she never speaks to me."
"Hey, Frank, going to the dance?"
I-I can't dance.
"Me, neither."
"Aren't you going to introduce us to your friend, Frank?"
"I'm Frank's father's sister, Aunt V, and Frank and I are very, very close, aren't we, Frank?"
- What?
- Yeah.
Positive now?
You're only nineteen.
- I'm twenty.
- You're only twenty.
I know what age I am.
Don't start getting snotty with me.
I should be getting snotty with you.
Sorry.
"It's shocking, that is."
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- That the best you can do?
"Well, what do you think?"
I don't know.
"I should give out, I suppose... or throw a wobbler or something... but what's the point?"
"I mean, if she was..."
You should have come to us earlier.
"Before, you know, when... said you were gonna get pregnant... then we could've done something about it."
My God.
"You're positive, now?"
Absolutely certain?
Shh.
"Molly, my Irish Molly"
Good girl.
What's that on your face?
Shaving foam.
Oh.
"Well, fair enough."
"My Irish Molly, when you are near"
Who was it?
- Was it?
"Fucking hilarious, he totally did you."
- Have they chucked him out?
- Doubt it.
"Not gonna chuck him out for that, just a scuffle."
- He kicked me in the cock.
- Good shot!
- What happened to Hannah?
"- Erm, I think you blew it when a twelve year did beat you."
I fucking slipped!
He's talking to a load of Northwood lads.
- What?
"- They don't look twelve, to be fair."
"Fucking hell Si, you muppet."
We are so dead.
What?
Dead?
That should be the end of it!
"Simon's taken a beating, a child's honour's been restored."
- I didn't take a beating!
- Yeah.
This is Northwood.
"It's not the end, it's the start!"
- We do what now?
- I get Charlotte?
- Is she hard?
"- No, she'll get them thrown out!"
"I'll go find her, you go and hide somewhere."
- Hide?
"- Yes, hide."
- Toilets?
- Charlotte!
[ The phone rings. ] Charles?
Then what good are you?
Little Mosque on the Prairie S06E07 Mosque of Dreams
- RAYYAN:
Hello!
- SARAH:
Hi!
"Mom, is that bacon?"
That's bacon.
What are you doing?
I'm not eating it.
"Well, not yet anyway."
Do you know I haven't had bacon for over 30 years?
Because it goes against our beliefs?
"Well, I'm just not sure what our beliefs are anymore."
"Mom, what do you mean?"
You're a Muslim!
What if I'm a Muslim because I was married to a Muslim?
"Well, um, how long have you been feeling this way?"
"I've been on a date, I've had wine, and something else Ann put in my drink, and now I'm thinking about trying bacon."
"- No, don't do it!"
- Hey!
- That's turkey bacon!
- Oh!
I'm not going to jump in headfirst.
I've got to dip my toes in a little.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Ow!
"Fine, I guess, I had that coming."
AMAAR:
It'll be our own mosque.
Or just hitting Mike.
- It's like hitting a puppy.
You cannot...
- But we were in character.
"I know, but..."
It would have been so Of Mice and Men.
I didn't do it.
But back to the Denzel story somebody thought Michael was Denzel.
Did you ever think that maybe Denzel was just standing behind you?
- We looked to make sure.
- They were looking at me.
"I looked around for Denzel, because I love Denzel."
- But there is no Denzel.
"- No, it was me."
Did we have any celebrity sightings on the shoot?
- I don't...
"- Wait, wait."
"Yeah, we..."
"Oh, God."
"Well, now I forget."
"Remember there was a guy near Don Hill's who was crossing the street and I was like, ""That's the guy from..."""
Really?
"He's in a band, remember?"
He's handsome.
- Was it Mayim Bialik?
- I forget.
- Maybe.
- Mayim Bialik.
- Could be.
- I love Mayim Bialik in Blossom.
I don't remember.
"Mayim Bialik was, like, head of a Yiddish singing group."
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
That the phones are lighting up like crazy?
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did?
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
"So, what do you say?"
About what?
About doing it full time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you.
You're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Well, I..."
Why don't we think about it?
Okay.
I will.
I just did.
I want to do it.
"Oh, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry."
But I could really use the money and I think it could be fun.
There you go.
A star is born.
No.
Don't worry.
It's not going to change a thing.
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
"He'll understand, believe me."
Connie.
"If you don't listen to me and marry this man,"
you'll disappoint me.
-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!
"What's ""Chen dannay""?"
"""Cent' anni""."
It means 100 years.
It means we should all live happily for 100 years.
The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
"Merle, you've met my sister-in-law, Deanna."
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.
"With all respect, I didn't come here to eat dinner!"
"I know, I know."
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.
You're justjealous because he's a real man!
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!
These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives.
"Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to."
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop.
Don't!
"What are you doing to me, you big slob?"
"- Let's get him out, okay?"
"- Please, please, get me out of here!"
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build....
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?
Yeah.
"You gotta watch, because when it rains, the water comes up really quick."
"Joey, listen to me."
You go find a phone.
You call 911.
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
"All right, Joey?"
Go!
Go!
"- Well, where's he going?"
"- Well, this grate is locked."
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.
Just don't!
"Ben, listen to me."
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise you that.
"But you gotta do me a favor, okay?"
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
"Uh, is everything okay today?"
Why wouldn't it be?
No reason.
"So, what do you want to lay down today?"
"Uh, no."
No bets.
I'm just going to cool it today.
Thanks.
So why did you call me?
"Uh, shit."
"I got to go, Ivan."
I'll talk to you later.
So what does that mean?
"It means we wait 10 hours, figure out what the hell's happening."
"Babe, can we talk?"

"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
"I was wondering why you showed up tonight, and then it occurred to me."
It's probably 'cause I called you like a paranoid fucking idiot.
(HITS WALL)
"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
What are you doing?
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.
"Well, I'm not in the picture, so, send me a text message when it's done?"
"Well, I-"
"I'm not in the photo either, so... maybe I should leave too?"
- Don't you have any friends?
- None in particular.
- Who drove you to work?
- Where did you see him?
Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.
I don't miss much.
"That's Stiller, a guy I work with."
- How about that woman?
- What woman?
The one that gave you the lunch.
"That's Rose, Stiller's sister."
- Is she your pash?
- My what?
Your passion.
I don't know.
When you're...
"when you're flying all the time, you don't really have much of a chance with women."
I think you hide behind that scar too much.
- You ever do anything with her?
"- What do you mean, ""do anything""?"
"You know what ""do anything"" means."
You're blushing.
Your veins'll be too close to the skin.
I've known people like that.
I'm hungry.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- It's Stiller!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
I always get these things right!
No thanks.
"Yeah, no thanks."
"But, I really can tell the future!"
"Right, Saho?"
!
"You smell nice, Saho-san."
Ah!
That smell is incense.
I love it.
"The smell is great, and it is interesting to watch the smoke rise."
It makes me feel really relaxed.
Yeah!
I have been getting into incense lately myself!
Incense is great!
Okay!
Okay!
"Oh man, Fumi!"
You really are doing whatever your teacher does!
Of course I am!
"By the way, Hibara-san."
Hm?
"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."
Smoke?
I heard about your grandfather.
I heard that he deals with things from the other side.
Fumi-chan!
Sorry!
Saho-san was looking up things like that!
There are... a lot of things that I want to know.
Is it possible for me to talk to him?
Sorry for visiting you at such a busy time.
She works here.
I'm positive.
"She a waitress, bartender, like, what..."
She's a waitress.
I know the manager.
"I'll go talk to him, see if she's on tonight."
"Give me some money, I'll get drinks."

Donna was the chef.
Antoine was her number two.
"Back there was Ray and César, they were the kitchen staff."
"Gunther was the catering manager,"
Candace was his assistant.
Lots of other people.
Good people.
"They were here, then they were gone, and nobody came down to say,"
"""Can we please keep them on?"""
It wasn't fair.
You think?
- But Griff is different.
"- Oh, yes, he is."
Because they didn't do anything to deserve to be turfed.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
I cast that cat myself.
"And sir, while they are my-- Ow!"
Aaugh!
"No, no, no, no, no."
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
"Why, just this morning--"
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
Uh-oh.

Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yeah, yeah."
"It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Could we talk about this on Monday?
No.
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.

Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.

You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."

Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."

"Okay, mister."
Okay.
"I'll handle this, Willie."
"Thanks, Willie."

"- No, he's too old."
- What'd he look like?
- Medium.
- Medium what?
"- Medium young, medium height."
- Medium weight.
- Very illuminating.
"You can call him medium, what's left of him."
Barracuda got the rest.
That's the lot.
- All the rest empty?
- Yeah.
Not much business f or the one cool spot in town.
"- One just came in, but he don't fit."
- How do you know?
- You said suicide.
- l was guessing.
This one came f rom a car smash.
You don't want to see him.
- l might as well blanket the field.
- He's as crisp as bacon.
- l can stand it if you can.
- Okay.
He was like a lump of charcoal.
"Now, wait a minute."
Josephine was abducted from her husband.
Tony was abducted from his wife.

So...
"What do you say, girls?"
Who wants to be bootylicious?
I think I'm bootylicious enough.
Whoo.
Uh...
Hi.
Excuse me.
Um...
I'm meeting someone here.
The reservation is under Elise Lacey.
Oh.
Hi.
Your date's waiting for you.
Follow me.
"Oh, really?"
Is he normal?
- I wouldn't exactly say normal.
- Really?
You must be Kitty.
That's very good.
Thanks.
"I'll be back to tell you about specials in a minute, senator."
Thank you.
I never would've figured you for a silent treatment type.
I'm not giving you silent treatment.
I'm considering how I can tell you off without losing my job.
- You're angry.
- Yes!
Yes.
(Mrs Drayton) I'm always saying the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
(Jo) Not in the least.
"Dr McKenna, do you -"
"Why don't all of you sort of turn around here, or something."
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.
(Mr Drayton) It's in one of our English counties.
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a small holding.
Here we are.
- 0h.
- lsn't that fascinating?
Yes.
- There we are.
- Uhh.
"- Hey, they look good."
- Surprise.
"0h, they look wonderful."
"Ah, looks like bread."
"- We're not going to eat all that, are we?"
- No.
- (All Laughing) - ls that the way you do it?
"Yes, just break it, just like this."
"It won't break. 0h, no."
"Well, I'm gonna"
- There.
- ls that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.
That was a tough one.
Does it chew any better than it tears?
- ls it fattening?
- l imagine it must be.
"It's OK, polo."
There.
"feels good, huh?"
Yes... yes...
What's going on?
"Nothing, I got caught in his headphones."
He often screams like that.
"I was washing him, the headphones fell, he couldn't hear the music."
Seeing lots of strangers makes him yell... or losing his play farm figures.
What happened?
- He fell in the bailer.
- baller?
- The thing that makes balls of hay.
- I know.
He fell in one when he was small.
You've known him long?
always been neighbors.
We played together as kids.
"Right, polo?"
What's the music?
"""Give me roses""."
Fernand Gignac?
Yeah.
What else?
"Nothing else, for 37 years."
- How old is he?
- 45 years old.
"'Give him some roses, mademoiselle"
"'He has a "" rendez-vous"""
'It's very important
'Choose them for him
'Among the more beautiful ones
I'd be afraid.
What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.
That's true.
Of course it is.
You're always analyzing everything.
And saying what's good and bad.
And souls don't die.
Soul?
"Mom says it's something inside of all good things, and that it goes on forever and ever."
Souls don't die.
(CLAPPING)
You're very kind.
Thank you so much.
You ever seen a better picture than that?

County of Cheshire.
Poacher.
"So, you're a good shot, then, are you, Hagman?"

Belgium?
"Maybe he does not know, but his country is a coat."
"Yes, we know it."
- What a pity.
You are at the center of Europe and you do not know how to keep your mini-country together.
Nor is his country a good example.
"Ignore, Dragan."
"- He is right, I like it."
"We are mythical matter, Lady Louise."
The Balkans are the Balkans.
There is love.
I hate it.
It's love.

If we have gotten an order..
Someone has done the caluclation
We save more people by sinking the boat
-Is it that simple for you?
"-Yes, its that simple."
What if i warn him?
I didnt hear that.
Get up in the mountains (raveen?
) and make contact with England.
There you await new orders.
I'll see you there in two days.
Did you hear me?
-Einar.
-Yes.
-Second row.

Your welcome.
"And please, come in."
Thanks for last night.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it really is."
No.
Mom...
"Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
Do you mind being my friend instead?
"So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
We can still play ping-pong together.
Come on.
"You know, I let you win."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
In your dreams.
You ever see that movie Casablanca?
No.
It goes like this:
"Peanut, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady."
Oh!
"I can't believe this, I didn't win."
Shocking.
"Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding."
Would anyone like seconds?
"Yeah, I would."
"Yeah, me, too."
Thank you.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie.
Hey...
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid.
It's been a long time since I've done that.
Tell me that's her.
"BECAUSE I SPENT MY YOUTH AND $30,000"
"ON WHISKEY AND DEVOTION TO THE JOB,"

MR. LOVING WANTS ED ON HIS TEAM.
YEAH?
"WELL, HE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE HIM,"
BECAUSE ED'S GOING TO HELP ME!
AND LET ME GET ONE THING CLEAR-
I DON'T PROMISE YOU A THING FOR YOURSELF.
NOT A THING!
"WELL, LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR, JON."
I DON'T CARE WHO GETS THE JOB.
"FOR ONE THING, I'VE BEEN OFF A CRIME BEAT FOR 5 YEARS,"
"AND FOR ANOTHER, I'M NOT GOING TO GET"
MY THROAT TORN OPEN IN ANY DOGFIGHT.
"NOW, ED, I'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO YOU."
"NANCY, TELL ED I'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO HIM."
Mildred:
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG...
JUST KNEW I WAS GOING TO FIND A FRIENDLY FACE DOWN HERE.
"WELL, MY FACE IS FRIENDLY."
HI.
"HELLO, YOU LOVELY PEOPLE."
"I ALWAYS SEE YOU TWO TOGETHER, DON'T I?"
YOU COULD DO A COLUMN ABOUT IT.
"OH, I'D LOVE TO, DARLING."
I'M ALL FOR ROMANCE.
HAVE A RUM ON THE ROCKS OR SOMETHING.
"WELL, NOW, THANK YOU, JON."
THAT'S RIGHT FRIENDLY OF YOU.
AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY FRIENDLY
Where are they?
- You can't just barge in here!
- Where are they?
I ain't seen them.
They're not here.
Bollocks.
- Don't lie to us.
"- 'Ere, I know you."
Have a heart and tell me.
What happened to my son John?
She doesn't know.
Right.
"Well, John's dead."
Where are the other two?
A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.
Now she knows.
"- Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield."
We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.
I'm sick of this.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Who told you about John?
- What?
It was on the wireless.
"We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?"
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end?
Deal with her.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
"Lungs clear, chest tones normal."
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
Get me another commander.
"I'm here, sire."
I can't wait to get my tentacles on 'em.
"Damaras already called up tentacuss, boss."
And more xborgs stand ready.
Good.
Crush this resistance.
Hard. [remote screaming] [laughs]
I'll show the prince how easy it is to handle these humans.
[laughs]
I hope he likes the way I'm redecorating the place.
"[screaming] [super red] Hey, squidface."
Huh?
[grunting]
Ah.
The Power Rangers.
"I've been warned about you, but you look different."
Huh.
You should have heeded that warning.
Ugh.
So much for introductions.
Get them.
[battle cries] Let's switch.
It will double your blasting power.
Thanks.
My super mega saber's all yours.
Thanks.
You gotta have the right tools for the job.
Ugh.
Yeah.
Let's get that job done.
I'm on it.
It's possible.
"Oh, my God."
What are we going to do ?
Everything we can.
Another great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.
Where is everyone?
There's smoke from the chimneys.
They're inside.
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
"Howdy, folks."
- Who are you?
- Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Ratira?
No.
"From over the mountains, then?"
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
I take it you don't get many strangers around here.
No.
Especially not those that travel near dark.
Why is that?
You really don't know?
Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business, really."
We're just travelers.
Men without bikes.
"Oh, boy."
"Waltzer, Waltzer, look, don't worry."
"Your cut's waiting for you, that's right."
Relax.
Relax.
"Look, I tell you what..."
-Ow!
-Right.
"Look, if you don't get all of your dough, feel free to kill me."
"What do I look like, huh?"
A Laundromat?
A slot machine?
'Cause I am not a slot machine.
You are a slot machine.
"Step right up here, folks, there's a winner every minute."
Sorry.
"Oh, what, l-I hurt your feelings?"
No.
"No, and you want to know why?"
'Cause you don't got no feelings.
"Yes, I do."
"I'm a person, and I have feelings."
"Oh, ho, you're a person now."
"Hey, she's not a person, is she, Betty?"
"Yeah, she sort of is."
Nobody's talking to you.
"You know what the test is, baby?"
"If you were a person, you could do whatever you want..."
Ow.
"and you can't, 'cause you do whatever I tell you to do, isn't that right, Betty?"
Y eah.
"ROBERT, DON'T SAY THAT."
WHY NOT?
"IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?"
"WHEN YOU ADOPTED ME, YOU WANTED A GIRL, DIDN'T YOU?"
AND HE WANTED A BOY!
"NEITHER ONE OF YOU WAS SATISFIED, WERE YOU?"
I REMEMBER ONCE WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD-
8 YEARS OLD!
"I WAS HELPING YOU DUST THE HOUSE,"
"AND THAT WOMAN FROM ACROSS THE STREET CAME OVER AND SAID,"
"""MY, MY."""
"AND YOU SAID, ""YES, I KNOW."
"""HE'S EXACTLY LIKE A LITTLE GIRL, ISN'T HE?"""
"BUT, ROBERT, YOU ARE MY SON"
AND MY DAUGHTER
AND ALL THE CHILDREN I EVER WISHED I COULD HAVE HAD.
DON'T YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER?
SHALL I SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE MY MOTHER?
"OH, I HAVE SUCH A GOOD BOY!"
NOW I'LL BRING YOUR BREAKFAST.
YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY.

Aunt Letha?
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.
Come on.
"Tony, the bus won't run without me in it."
It's all my fault.
It's such a mess.
"Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it."
I'm sure Uncle Bene won't mind.
I'll do the engine.
You do the body work.
- OK.
"- So long, Alfie."
"Goodbye, Alfred."
"What job will you do now, Mr. Yo-Yo, uh, Yokomoto?"
"Oh, I've saved my money."
I'll probably open a Japanese delicatessen.
"Hey, kids, look."
I don't understand this.
- Man!
"- Wow, what a family."
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...
- ...somehow.
"- Uh, that's a possibility."
You know what this means?
They never saw the wreck.
I'll tell them that the reports were exaggerated.
"And, if you kids will go back to school,"
I'm sure they won't fire me.
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.
Hi.
"I'll be there in a sec, yeah."
"Okay, my deposition got moved up."
That's great.
So I'll just have to move everything... you know what?
- l'm sorry!
I have to get out of this house.
They say it'll be here in twenty minutes.
Great.
Hello?
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
It's for you.
Hello?
Kyle!
Thank God it's you!
I'm sort of not really that hungry now that I think about it.
"Okay, great!"
"Yes, I'll be ready."
"Okay, bye!"
- N ice.
- What?
You just made a date with Kyle?
"Yes, not that it's any of your business."
I don't believe you!
What about Brian?
Angela!
"Kyle is my boyfriend, I hate to tell you."
Brian Krakow happens to be waiting in my living room... and I don't know what you're doing with him!
Nothing!
Nothing!
We're just friends.
"Yes, when Kyle's not around, you've been using him."
You are lecturing me about using Brian Krakow... when he is so obviously in love with you and you totally use him!
- Brian Krakow is not in love with me!
- That's not what Rayanne Graff says.
You know what?
And she got her head chopped off
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.

"It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
Your brother and me -- we needed you.
"You walked away, Sam."
- You walked away!
"- Stop it, both of you."
"You're the one who said, ""don't come back,"" dad."
"You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
"Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could."
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"What happened, anyway?"
"She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."

"Fine, I guess."
You didn't... go to the rodeo?
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.

The Dyane 6.

- Pickers.
Here for the harvest.
He's from the town.
They know him.
Could be a picker who comes every year.
Or someone who works at the fair.
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.
- And gray.
It's a common car.
- Excuse me.
Someone wants to talk to you.
"Angelita is psychic, she sees stuff."
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother the last two nights.
And she said... she saw the girls at the abandoned farmhouse.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.

What was the question again?
The question was about...

"I tell you who misheard, David O'Doherty."
LAUGHTER
"And he was like, ""Oh, that's a sweet job"

It's that sort of area.
"Flirting, flirting."
Flirting with...

No knives and forks either.
I understand you're supposed to dig in.
"0h, allow me to show you, will you?"
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
"You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap."

- May I show you?
"- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?"

"Yes, good luck!"
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
"Morning, Major."
"Good morning, Fawlty."
"Yes, dear?"
"What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?"
"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."

"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"

"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."

"What about that guy, Taka?"
We need to ask you something.
How d'ya get on the 'net with PlayStation2?
We can't?

But I heard you could.
Says we need an adapter...
But we don't have one!
Who does he think we are?
We ain't got one.
Have you?
Why the hell not?
That was no use.
We're back to square one.
Doesn't Taka have a computer?
"No, he just knows a lot."
Buys magazines then can't afford a computer.
What's up?
"That guy, Kanzaki!"
He'll have one.
That weirdo electrician?
He's not a weirdo!
"Who, who?"
My Dad told me.
So the weirdo's got a computer?
He's not weird.

Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not like you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.

All right.
Yes.
He deserved it.
You killed him!
Get back.
Get over here.
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!
And do as you're told.
"Go on, sit down!"
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!
"No jail for you, you little bitch!"
No!
No!
Get it off!

Brent?
We can't talk here.
What?
Why not?
Count to 15 before you follow me.
"Second thought, make that 20."
Brent!
I said 20.
What has gotten into you?
You've become a cub scout?
No.
These two fingers represent the pause button.
On our friendship.
What?
River Rock Publishing is in the middle of a cold war.
"I'm America, and you're the USSR."
That's ridiculous.
Crossing enemy lines is a mistake.
It complicates things.
"Oh, Brent, come on."
This is crazy.
How long can you two keep this up?
Don't blame me.
Blame Julianne.
"By the way, fierce heels."
I am the one that's paid the lion's share of the mortgage!
I am the one that's bought the groceries!
I paid the bills!
I--I arranged and funded all of our vacations!
"Don't yell, Quico."
You'll wake everyone up.
"Get back here, please."
Did you like the private tutor?
Math is a little hard.
"If you have any trouble here in school, Maria, you can see me."
Let's meet your classmates.
- Come on.
- Wait...
Get the ball.
You get it!
This is howwe walk.
Can I try?
"No, Quico!"
That's not how you do it.
"You look beautiful, beautiful..."
"Frontwards, backwards, and slide... and a smile for the audience, you look great, perfect!"
I am ready to walk up there with you?
"The tightrope walkers, Márcia and Marcelo!"
- I Love you.
- Me too.
"Barbuda, you look lovely."
Let's get going now.
We go in after the acrobats.
"Foguinho, relax or you'll throw me off."
"Go away, great."
You look wonderful.
"Maria, my love!"
- Can I help you?
- Hi.
Grandma's here to see you.
Give grandma a kiss.
I'm tired.
I've got to do something.
Come on!
Let's go and take care of this.
"Tom, I can't find Franz."
"Please give him my best regards, and give him this."
This is the video footage.
I've decided not to do the project.
He'll be upset then.
"I'm sorry, but I think it's for the best."
I'm upset too.
Didn't you like the mask?
The mask was great.
I'm not so certain.
It's not your fault.
Who's fault is it then?
Certainly it's not yours.
Take care Tom.
I've been waiting for you.
I had the late shift.
Now I've got no time.
What are you doing?
Shopping free of charge

-Eight dollars.
-And you promised him....
-Eight dollars.
"Room, board and you say you like my wife's cooking."
-Your wife?
"-Oh, sure."
"Tell you what, Nick."
I got to track my guy down in L.A.
"If it don't pan out, I take you up on it."
"Well, okay."
If we still got it.
And I'll send you some money in any case for the breakfast.
"-Oh, yeah."
Do that.
-Okay.
"Thanks a lot, Nick."
"Goodbye, now."
Missus.
Be right with you there.
"Here's a change, 20 cents."
Thank you very much.
"What you need, Mr. Papadakis, is more coverage."
I hadda lass year.
"Last year you had fire, theft, no liability."
So what I need it now for?
"Well, you should've had it then."
Suppose a customer comes in here and there's a spot of grease on the floor?
"No, I'm sorry."
There's no grease onna floor.
"-No, I'm just sayin' suppose."
-No.
Debra.
There you go.
My brother's tall.

Are we in trouble or something?
No way.

Gary's dead.
I'm Jack Donaghy.
New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.
"Oh, we own Kmart now."
No.
So why are you dressed like we do?
I'm surprised you're renovating.
This is such a nice office.
"It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to, uh, make them your own."
Please.
"Ah, I'll call her back."
Is she at the White House line?
Great.
Tell them I need a 4:00 a.m. tee off time.
"Uh, five inches, but it's thick."
Are you familiar with the GE Tri-vection Oven?
I don't cook very much.
"Sure, I got you."
"New York, third wave feminist, college educated."
Single and pretending to be happy about it.
"This is AIberto CoIombo, yournew manager."

- Good.
- I should be there by dinner.
- Are you walkin'?
"At EboIi take the coast road, oryou'II go ""uppa"" the SaIerno-Reggio CaIabria."
UpperCaIabria?
There must be some static.
"I have a GPS navigator, I'II see you this evening."
I'II be 'ere.

Beer?
.
"Look, I'II call you when I arrive."
"- hello, license and registration."

"Too slow, you're blocking traffic."
"My mind was wandering, I'm going to naples."
I've been transferred there.

What kind of talk's that?
Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
-You're going to die?
-Transform.
Don't go.
I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
"I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl."
I'm not stupid.
My name is Alice.
I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.
"He had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him."
I'm his daughter.
I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
"Alice, at last."
You were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
"You called it ""Wonderland,"" as I recall."
Wonderland.
(WATCH TICKING)
-What do you call yourself?
-Alice.
The Alice?
"Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it."
McTWISP:
She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
"Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please."
Have some tea.
"You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem, stupid girl."
This movie's awesome.
You must be the last person on earth who has never seen Psycho.
Spoiler alert:
It's gonna scare the crap out of you.
"Holly, if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm a pretty tough..."
Aah!
That wasn't even scary.
"Yeah, but look where it got me."
"Hey, guys."
Hope I'm not interrupting.
"- Actually, uh..."
- 'Cause I gotta talk to Holly
- about something important.
"- What's going on, Phil?"
Is this shirt too tight?
"No, it leaves just the right amount to the imagination."
Is that kung pao chicken?
"Oh, stop drooling."
Sit down.
"I couldn't, I couldn't."
Not without a glass of wine.
So what are we watching?
"Wow, Psycho?"
- Uh-huh.
"- Oh, I love it."
"Get out the shower, girl!"
Get out the shower!
"F.Y.I., he'll be doing that the entire movie."
Yippee.
"Hey, Holly."
"Sorry, do you have any himalayan sea salt?"
'Cau...
At least the dimensions are stabilised.
"""8-9."
"""9-A."
"-""E-7..."""
-E-9.
"Sorry, E-9."
"""2-3..."" Wait!"
Wait!
Did you say E-9?
"Look, it says E-7 there."
You're right.
And the next three numbers are wrong.
This way.
"The Tardis isn't much use to anybody that size, stable or not."
-It gives us time.
-Time to do what?
We don't even know if he's alive in there.
They've arrested the dimension spiral.
Things are looking up.
This is the street.
The error should be somewhere here.
-Sabotage.
-Murder.
Interfering with the working of Logopolis.
The most dangerous crime in the universe.
An error in the dimension subroutine.
Somewhere here.
I will not be beaten.
I simply will not be beaten.
But I could certainly do with a little more help from outside.
"We must return to the Central Register, quickly."
The Monitor's done it.
"Keep it... here, give me that."
Hey!
Shh!
Now... stop it.
Are yous all listening?
I'm in hurry.
Will you get on with it?
Shut up!
He has to sit on the wall all day and do nothin'.
"You go and shite you, you stupid bitch... what?"
"Don't you ""what"" me, Sonny Curley."
No language like that in this house.
- Exactly!
"- Don't start, you."
- You never hit her!
- I do so!
I'm not taking this!
Have a nice day!
You better watch yourself... or you'll find yourself... packing your shampoo and spot creams.
"I'm sorry, you'll have to discuss it with my solicitor."
Don't you start.
Now...
Sharon has a bit of news for yous.
I can't help it.
"I'm sorry, Sharon."
"Go on, love."
I'm going to have a baby.
"- That's massive, Sharon."
- Is that all?
"Women, what?"
Right.
Where's your bump?
- Stop that!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Don't worry Miss Morgan, I'll call the police."
"Don't call the police, this is my husband!"
- He doesn't have a key?
- Don't ask.
"See, I told you I know her better than you."
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
What... what... what is going on?
What are you doing here?
"Well, I..."
I came to see YOU.
Why?
- Why did you come to see me?
- Well...
I...
"In... in... in light of our last conversation, and after speaking with Henry, I..."
I...
I've come to realize... that... alth... alth... alth...
although you might... might have significant reservations about e... e... even considering...
Gregory!
What!
I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?
"God, you're beautiful."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Gregory."
What?
"I'm so sorry... for the way I acted and for the things I said, I..."
"- I know that I hurt you, and..."
- That's okay.
Kuya!
Wait!
That's just the remains of a previous experiment.
It's not someone you should be fighting.
"Hey, lemme know, if you're gonna be reckless like that!"
No way!
I see...
But remember the Von Dinosaur incident...
Proceed with extreme caution.
"Yes, of course."
"If you'll excuse me, sir."
"Now, we're fully prepared..."
"The world will now see the almighty power of the States, and realize who will lead the world!"
Is it going to take her away?
Cover her!
I won't allow you to take Manami!
Damn...
"Take me, too!"
More to come...
More to come...
More to come...
More to come...
No...!
Wh...
What?
Kuya!
You okay?
Yes...
Let's get the hell out of here!
Keep going!
Keep going!
Keep going!
- Also why would we die?
- Can I interrupt for a second?
I just want to say that I love both of you guys.
Trent more than I did before.
OK.
"Well, just so you know, I hate both of you."
Do you want any oil before we start?
No.
"Please, I... that wasn't in the script."
Sounds like we're ready to go.
Let's get started.
Ah.
"Three, two, one."
Hit it!
None of my moves are sexual.
I apologize.
- Wow!
"- Yeah, wow."
That was an amazing story.
"Hey, Danny."
You have to tell us if you got the ring back when you get back from the bathroom.
"Hey, yeah."
OK.
Just give me a few seconds.
- Flashbacks are exhausting.
"- Hell, yeah."
So look.
The stripper scouts turned out that they loved us.
And so did the audience.
So...
Anyway.
"OK, well."
"- Well, well, well!"
You ready for one more ass-whupping?
!
You're going down!
"I will not fight you, Stinkmeaner."
"Say what, nigga?"
!
You not gonna fight?
!
Then why'd you come?
!
"Nigga, you could've told me you's a bitch over the phone!"
I came because I'm not afraid of you!
But I'm tired of acting like a nigga!
I'm an old man.
I'm dignified.
I watch PBS.
All y'all should be ashamed!
This has gone too far!
"Now, I've already called the police, so everyone should just go home!"
"Come on, fight, old man!"
Fight!
"Aw, hey!"
Ruined everything!
"This ain't over, Robert!"
"We got your back, Stinkmeaner!"
- It worked.
- It worked.
Hey!
"Ed Wuncler, my favorite billionaire!"
What can I do for you?
"Well, I heard about your little incident, and I wanted to see if you were okay."
Not at all.
"The only drawback of cupping is, it leaves a suction mark."
It can bruise a little.
Cupping?
"Yes, ancient Chinese secret."
All the celebrities do it.
"It draws out toxins, boosts metabolism."
You'll feel good.
[ Exhales deeply ] Who knew?
[ Yawns ]
"Oh, excuse me."
It's just so relaxing in here.
It's the aromatherapy.
The lavender really packs a punch.
Huh.

[ Snores ]
[ Snoring ]
[ Slurping ]
Flojo.
"You got time to lean, you got time to clean, huh?"
I'm starving.
What do we get to eat?
Same as the clients.
They expect us to eat this rabbit food?
It's not rabbit food.
It's super food.
I'm not eating it.

Okay.
What are those men doing here?
"They're not here to take him away, are they?"
It's okay.
She locked me out.
I understand.
"I understand, I understand."
"Now look, you laid out all night drinking and you knew she was going to do this, didn't you?"
Yeah.
"You say you're sorry, I'll bet she'll let you in."

That's all we need for now.
"You know, I don't think they're going to Jeremiah's at all."
Me either.

"Why, look at you."
You've gone to Hollywood.
Look at you.
You're all grown up.
"Stand back, let me have a look at you, girl."
"Yeah, you're still ugly."
I'm just playing.
You look fine.
"You know what, I'm feeling fine."
I'm going to go see my baby.
I'm going home.
"You can't go home, Lila."
The cops are after you.
What did they say?
Get in the car.
"You know, I didn't do the things they say I did."
"Yeah, I know that."
Being on the run makes you look guilty.
I already look guilty.
And looking guilty's being guilty for black people.
All of them look hard!
There isn't even one manga in there!
"They are books that Saho-san said I should try to read, but I don't know if I can read them all."
"Saho-san is that girl who always goes to talk to Grampy, right?"
Yeah.
Saho-san knows a lot of things.
She has been thinking about God and what happens after death since jr. high school.
Since jr. high school!
She read all of these books here.
She is a great person.
She is not just good at studying...
What are you laughing at?
"You are acting funny, Sis!"
Funny?
You're really getting serious!
It's like you're Saho-san!
What are you talking about?
!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Oh!
Shut up!
I'm really sorry!
Where is Shizuru?
No idea...
What's wrong?
Sis won't even talk to me!
All she does is read hard books.
Books?
Yeah.
Books that Saho-san suggested for her to read.
"Lately, she has even been coming home late."
"Hey, buddy."
This place has gone totally downhill.
"Hey, buddy, where'd you come from?"
"I saw you inside, raising hell."
"Yeah, that chump took my backpack!"
"So, Natasha..."
Yeah.
"Man, what about her?"
Have you seen her?
"Long gone, bro."
She hasn't danced here in months.
You know where she is?
"Last time I saw you, you wanted to punch my face in."
You remember that?
- Vaguely.
- It was that chick.
Zoe.
- Out of the picture?
- Out of the picture.
- You got blow?
"- No, man."
Why would I have blow?
Natasha...
Got a couple ideas where she might be.
There he is!
"Welcome back, Conner!"
- Ah!
"That really does hurt, man!"
- Chemical burns will do that.
Not too serious.
Looks like the EMTs did a good job irrigating.
That ambulance guy brought my camera?
"Oh, wow, complaining."
"That's very interesting, considering nobody invited you."
"Before I came along, you were on a skateboard."
Oh!
Oh!
You like them?
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well, what do you like?"
Everything.
"Well, I don't know."
I don't really listen to music.
"Dude, that's kind of weird."
Why?
What do you like?
"Uh, right now... punk."
"I'm sorry, Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk."
Oh yeah?
"Well, what about the Cramps?"
Stiff Little Fingers?
The Clash?
Sex Pistols?
I listen to the same music as Marissa Cooper?
I think I have to kill myself.
"Listen to punk, huh?"
I'm angry.
That's it right there.
Looks scary.
"Well, then, you can stay in the car."
"You recognize this place, Ryan?"
This isn't...
Where are we?
"Well, it's one of my mom's housing developments."
Look at this.
4 more break-ins on casino boulevard.
It's getting so you can't walk out the door anymore.
"Well, you can walk out the door."
You just can't go left.
That's not the point.
"A man should be able to walk out his front door, turn right, turn left, or walk right out into the street if he wants to."
"Don't make me lock you in the house, dad, ok?"
"Well, hello."
Ooh.
That shirt looks sexy on you.
Does it?
"I, uh, hadn't noticed."
"Hi, I'm Doug."
I'm a pisces.
I like walks in the rain and bags of pork rinds.
"Work it, baby."
Work it.
"I got the trash, babe."
That'll be our deal.
"Every time you buy me a shirt, I take out the trash."
"Oh, that's ok, honey."
I got it.
I got it.
"No, really."
It's fine.
What--what is this?
Barry's big and tall shop?
What?
"Oh, that's trash, baby."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop?
Did I?
"What if we were to do it in the dark, dark recesses"
- of the closet over there?
"- Oh, yeah, that sounds great."
- Okay.
- All right.
[clattering]
"Oh, God, there's some stuff in there, sorry."
"Oh, wow, there's a lot of stuff in here."
That's gonna make for a tight fit.
"Yeah, you know, that'll only be sexier."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay."
"- Ouch, ouch."
- I can't... ow.
- Ow.
- Emma?
"- Oh, God."
- What's going on?
- Emma?
"It's Maggie, shh, shh."
[knocking]
- What is going on?
- Hey!
I'm dying down there.
"I thought Cookie would wanna see my old hockey stick, you know?"
Remember how good I was at that?
- [toy squeaks]
"- Stop it, stop it, shut up."
"Shut up, there's someone in here."
We're not alone.
I don't hear anybody.
You shut your mouth for once in your damn life if you wanna survive this night.
"- I think we're okay, I mean."
Back to work.
"Hey, Kelli Ann."
Did I get any calls?
"Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no."
Not a lot of phone traffic.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
What's her name?
Who?
"The girl, Alex."
There's no girl.
"You can't hide it, man."
I know strung out and you are strung out.
"Okay, please."
KELLI ANN:
This is amazing.
"You can't focus, right?"
"Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your e-mail 100 times a day wishing you could write songs."
"No, feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations."
"It's always the same and it has happened to you, my friend."
Shit.
"Welcome to my world, asshole."
Let me get the door.
Sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
I gotta finish this stuff.
Okay.
- Yeah.
So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Okay.
Pen perfect?
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's very...
Buckley.
It's not your fault in there.
Really isn't.
I better go home.
So...
Exterior train station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
I didn't mean what I just said.
And anyway...you said worse.
Hm.
Declaration...
Stupid bloody fool's good.
Did you think of that beforehand?
Are you trying to put a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
"No...what I'm trying to say is that, if all of this stopped."
"The sparring and the jibing, and the insults and the arguments."
I'd miss it.
Even if I were dead.
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole school of dialog.
On and on and on and on and on.
Lose half.
Which half?
I forgot mine...
Please...?
Give me the fucking keys!
Thanks!
"- See you at home, little girl..."
- Hey!
- Shut up!
- But I didn't say anything!
Shut up!
"Abby, I did it!"
You did what...?
They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.
So I got a big stick and I hit him in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital I almost got suspended.
But I did it.
What you said.
I stood up to them.
Owen Yeah?
- Hey...
You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?
"""ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH"""
- It's pretty cool huh?
- Yes.
This this kid who used to live in the building.
Tommy.
"He would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends, and.."
"And when they weren't here, He would play ping-pong with me."
He was really cool
Then he had to move away.
I kinda like it here...
While the two of you were down on Vor-Deeth:
How do you know that the real Hawk wasn't replaced by one of those... those fakes: : :
During the time that he seemed to disappear?
[Whirring]
You cannot possibly believe what you are saying:
You are frightened!
You bet I'm frightened!
You're trying to kill both of us!
"Wilma, whatever is in your mind..."
[Man] Right here:!
Turn it on:!
Move!
Move!
It's a photon cannon!
[Wilma Screams]
Wilma!
Hawk!
"Over here, Buck:!"
Help me:!
I'm pinned!
[Screams]
"Buck, the cable!"
High voltage:
I can't move:
Help me!
- Hawk!
- Never mind me:
Get to Wilma:
[Screams] Help her out of there:
"That cable touches her, she dies:"
"Buck, please:!"
Hurry:!
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"I wear this crown of shit, upon my liar's chair."
"Full of broken thoughts, i cannot repair."
"Beneath the stain of time, the feeling disappears."
"And you are someone else,"
And I am still right here.
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"If i could start again, a million miles away."
I would keep myself.
I would find a way.
-One more try!
-One more try!
"-No, that didnt count!"
Thats...
"-Yeah, really..."
"Oh, we get a light, we got a ...."
Woo!
All right!
Awesome.
This way?
We can go this way...
Polaroid!
.
-Ready?
-OK!
"Everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum!"
"Mate, I'm not joking."
"I was on the dancefloor, this tune was playing."
I had my hand up both of their skirts at the same time.
It was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep!
"Very suave, man, very suave."
"Oh, mate, that will be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening."
But without wanting to give the game completely away...
"They're twins, they're from Macedonia and"
They don't have keys.
Shit.
You.
Out.
"Laters, bro."
"Rawley Park Estate,South London"
Mr Douglas.
Calum.
"No, no."
Ha ha ha.
John Mercer.
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you two shared a cell again?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
I'm not staying here.
He's an idiot.
That's a bit harsh.
Granted he's no Steven Hawking.
"John mate, don't be like that."
"Don't John mate me, please."
I'm not staying here.
You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
"- No, he says she's nearby."
Where do the Andersons live?
"Uh, Indian Village."
- That's 3 miles away.
- Let's go.
"[Woman] Here you go, hon."
I found a few more glasses for you.
Tom.
"Oh, my God, Tom!"
[Groaning]
[Kaman] Where is Tracy?
"Sir, I keep trying the Anderson house, but the line's busy."
[Busy signal]
[Garner] He must already be there.
"Garcia, have any fires been reported in the area?"
"Negative, but medics and fire suppression are on the way."
- Good.
Tell them to stand by.
- Roger that.
- There's one more thing I gotta tell you.
- What is it?
[Muttering]
[Kaman] Let's just get honest with each other.
Where is Tracy?
- She's not here.
- You're lying.
I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in Ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth!
We have no reason to lie.
"It's been five years, Kaman."
She's moved on with her life.
Looking for a room.
"My mother ain't here, but the lady in number two will show you the rooms."
Yes?
Yes?
I'm looking for a room.
Mrs. Maggione's kid told me you'd take care of that.
Yes.
I'll get the key.
Third floor.
There's something about your face that looks awfully familiar.
- You've been looking at the funny papers.
"- No, really."
"Listen, sister, all I'm looking for is a room."
Here it is.
Mrs. Maggione will give it a good cleaning.
- It's all right.
I've seen worse.
- I guess you have.
- I'll take the room.
What's the tariff?
- Five dollars a week.
- Sold.
- In advance.
All right.
Write me a receipt.
You can trust me.
How did you happen to come to this house?
"Looking for references, huh?"
An old friend of mine sent me over here.
"Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish."
- You know him?
- Father Jerry?
- Whose money are you using?
"- Yours, thank you very much."
But our money belongs to us again.
What's the idea?
Remember our bet?
"You see, you didn't get married."
- I'll pay you later.
- No.
All aboard!
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.
"You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter."
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.
I don't want to go to New York.
He doesn't want to go to New York.
"Goodbye, Lucky, old boy."
So long.
"- Goodbye, Lucky."
- See you later.
"Give my regards to the folks, will you?"
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.
So long.
"Goodbye, Lucky."
"Lucky, here's your suitcase."
Here's your toothbrush.
"Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke."
"- Well, take the quarter."
"- No, sir, not the lucky one."
Wait a minute.
I'll get a smoke.
"I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?"
Thank you.
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
He saved Ben.
- We're his parents.
How is he?
- It's too soon.
- The news said his heart stopped.
- It's going now.
- How's he doing?
- Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
- Blood pH 7.37.
- Thank God for small miracles.
- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.
- He's not warming up enough.
- Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
- That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
- You're the Attending.
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist with a bypass pump and a heating unit.
"Lily, go get Benton."
- Mark needs you for bypass access.
- Got to stop the bleeding first.
Thoracotomy tray.
Now!
- We'll go to the waiting room.
"- No, I wanna stay."
"No, we have to go."
It's from Laverne.
"- Corporal, can I have my letter, please?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Here, Father."
- Oh.
[Moaning] Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
"- Good morning, Klinger."
"- Good morning, darling."
"- Come again, snookums?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"I'm sorry, sir."
It's a letter from Laverne.
Laverne... the ex-missus who left you high and dry for that butcher boy?
Morty's a sausage maker.
That's below butcher in the Toledo social register.
"But everything's changed now, sir."
Listen to what I read so far.
"""Dear Maxie, You are much in my mind these days."
"""Taking up with Morty was a terrible mistake."
"The man's soul is made of animal by-products."""
"Guess that makes you feel pretty happy, huh?"
- Seeing the sausage king put through the old grinder.
"- It's more than that, sir."
Can't you read between the lines?
She wants me back.
"Oh, that's music to my eyes!"
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"Mandy, I really like you."
That's for making me fall for you.
"Aw, they're in love."
"Ah, my face!"
We got our very own chocolate fountain!
Some of it just went down my underwear.
I like it.
This is the best weekend of my life.
It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate.
"Rudy, what?"
"Ugh, stop eating it, then."
"Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it?"
"Yeah, what happens when you eat it?"
"I don't know, I've never eaten it."
I don't know what...
Rudy!
Rudy!
Just kidding.
"Damn it, Rudy."
It's not that bad.
I just get a rash on my back.
There's my babies.
Why are you covered in chocolate?
Why are you covered in wine?
Don't ask questions.
"Yeah, ditto."
Oh.
I feel like I French-kissed the whole train.
Uh... yum.
"Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least?"
I did.
"Wait, who told you it was my birthday?"
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
- I don't know what's going on.
- I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- What is wrong with your mom?
- She's bipolar.
She's bip...
She's an official lunatic.
And you let us get in a car with her?
"I tried to talk you out of it, but you would never listen to me."
If you would've told us she was crazy.
"No, near the mall."
"No, I'm fine."
"No, Mom, I just need you to come pick me up."
"Mom, no, please, just come pick us up."
"Izzy, I'm so sorry to have to put you through this."
"Grace, it's me."
I always knew.
I always knew there was something different about your mom.
Go.
Go.
"I'll deal with Olivia, okay?"
- Mom?
"- I'm up here, honey."
How could you do this?
You lied to me again.
You stopped taking your medication again.
"- Oh, I have my medicine."
- I hate you.
I'm done.
I'm so over it.
I have my medicine.
It's right here.
Something to preserve.
"The blood is fresh, but not human."
"Let's find out, he's at the end of the blood trail."
It smells like something big died.
"Yes, Ash has returned in his suit."
"Just smell it in your pussy with your breath, Kix."
Listen to the talk.
Pay attention!
.
"Okay, we split up"
"Come here, little bird."
"Come here, come to Dad!"
Stop the nonsense!
I have goose bumps here!
"Who knows, what is circulating around here."
"All right, I'm going in."
I'll cover you.
Let's go for it!
"You are dead, Kix"
Suck me the dick!
"What do you think this is, Commander?"
Noid art?
Hey friend.
Fuck you
"Fortunately, he is dead."
Let's take a blood sample.
Shit!
Hatta!
Hatta!
"Shit, I can not aim!"
I'm going out!
Son of a bitch have to pay!
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
"- with $20,000..."
- Wait.
Wait.
"Seriously, wait."
Wait.
Wait.
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
We can... we can fence them and then we have the money.
We can do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
So you... you want to steal the watches to help me with get away with stealing the watches?
Yes.
That is exactly what I want to do.
I can't let you risk everything...
I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.

(Growling)

"Oh, damn it."
Oi!

A walk with me feels like a date to you?
"No, not really."
There should be a sunset for a proper date.
And flowers.
A light drizzle...
Soft music...
A long walk...
And endless conversations.
Conversations.
And what if it starts pouring down heavily?
Then?
What happened?

No.

You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.

Not me.
I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.

"I don't get it, Mary."
"I mean, why come back here?"
You already missed the funeral.
You think I feel good about not being there?
Truthfully?
"I don't know, I can't tell."
"I mean, we were invisible to that man."
"I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment."
Because at least it would have been something.
"Listen, Mary."
"You know this is really hard for you to accept, okay?"
But Dad loved us.
"He just didn't know how to show it, I guess."
"Hey, I got that address on Sofia Archuleta."
"Mary, right?"
"Sis, meet Danno."
Danny Williams.
- What's up?
- Not much.
- A tie.
Seriously?
"Ha, ha."
"- Ha, ha."
What is it with you people and ties?
We're in Hawaii.
You are gonna have so many guys calling you.
Can I have your leftovers?
"Molly, men aren't Chinese food."
You can't just heat them up the next day.
I'll take 'em cold.
"Hello, Alex."
"Oh, hi."
You came to see me...
Mr. Larson.
What brings you here?
"Uh, a peace offering for your dad."
"I know he's ticked off 'cause I screwed up his real estate deal, so I brought you all some of our tavern's famous corned beef sandwiches."
Mm.
Yummy.
That's very considerate of you.
"Can I see you in my office, please?"
Should I come in and take notes?
- No.
- Please?
Can I come in and...
"Right, get back to my own work, that's what I'll do."
You look great.
Nice flowers.
"Oh, those."
Yeah...
Funny story.
"Um,"
Manhattan Monthly has named me one of their Ten Most Eligible Singles.

Stop!
No one's to enter the city unless they have money.
"WELL, WHEN WILL YOU KNOW?"
"I don't know, but, um, I-I can make a note to call you."
"UH, OKAY."
Is there another girl you'd be interested in?
Did you look at Donna on our Website?
She's available.
"DONNA, YEAH."

The one whose house burned down...
I knew I'd seen her before.
It's that naked woman from last night.
What?
The woman who was standing here last night.
Crazy fools.
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.
All three of them?
Yeah.
"Freaked the hell out of me, too."
Prime suspect is the missus who hung herself.
What the heck happened?
Beats me.
Over here.
In here.
What?
Give us a hand.
A little more.
Found it.
Idiot!
Don't touch it with your bare hands!
What the...?
Are you a moron?
That's evidence.
"He should've wrapped it in cloth or something, right?"

That's what they said.
I'll be damned.
"So, that's what happened."
Why did you call me?
I have some friends.
"Now, look."
This is Mrs. Ryan's check for $20.000 made out to me.
Do me a favor and get me my check back.
You mean that cashier's check you gave me?
Yes.
I don't know if I can.
It may have gone down to the bank.
I've got to have it back.
Why?
It's just as good a check as Mrs. Ryan's.
"I know, It's just that I've got to use that check for a transaction after business hours."
Nobody'll honor a personal check.
"Oh, I see."
It's endorsed.
I know.
Miss Watkins.
"Yes, Mr. O'Hara?"
Do you still have Mr. Sabourin's check for $20.000?
What was the transaction?
Wentworth Drug.
"Sabourin, Sabourin, Sabourin."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
That went to the bank about an hour ago.
Is something wrong?
"Oh, no."
No.
I'm sorry.
It went to the bank.
How long ago?
About an hour ago with our last deposits.
We make several a day.
Good night.
"John, you knew that."
Quite some time has passed.
Therapy How's it going?
"- Now I'm a new man, Father."
- I can see that.
- House is sold?
- No.

You have to continue life.
"Which hayatmış this, Father?"
- God works in mysterious ways.
- Now it is doing?
I can not understand.
Why?
Why come here at You're bothered that the candles burning?
- Because he would have done.
"- Anna would have done, because he believed."
"- Flame, a symbol of his faith believed that."
- Yes.
Well ...
I also drink it.
"Sometimes I'm thinking, God, I have chosen, or Does God he chose me."
"Because if he opted me, the error could have done."
"Hey, Father."
It relaxes you a little bit.
- Then I will see you on Sunday?
- No ...
- My mom says I vereceklermiş a medal.
I'm very proud of.
"- I'll be safe, John."
"I love you, Daddy."
You must work faster than this.
Okay.
Day 3
"Isn't this going overboard, bro?"
Your body might fall apart.
It's okay.
I've been up for 5 days before.
Kai.
I'm really thankful that you told me to work.
It really works.
Shit.
My head is so heavy.
Day 4
Yoon.
You accepted the job from Peng?
Yeah.
You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work.
You've only got 2 weeks.
And you accepted it!
Yeah.
You know even though I...
"I didn't screen it, you should have known better."
Why did you take it?
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You're the only one who looks up to him.
You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of.
He lied!
You know that?
"At least someone thinks of me, Je."
"Thought of you, that's f*cked up."
He only cares about his job.
So he sweet talked you into taking this job.
Turn him away from me.
Keep up with me.
You can move faster than that.
"Yo, Tino!"
"- Hey, how you doing?"
- What's going on?
I got something for you.

"What was it, a boy?"
Six years old.

Boy postured like he's seasoned.
Feels light.
Which would mean a lot if you were a scale.
Do you want it or no ?
Now it is light.
I'm losing my patience.

Deal's off.
I'm out of here.
"See, there's a problem with your story, Julio."

"No, whoever shot Bob left evidence of their gun on him."
Okay.

I didn't do nothing wrong.
"Yeah, you wake up, and you're already wrong."
Let's get him up.

HOW did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
"Are you a robot, too?"
Yeah.
"I started to rust here, but Ohji fixed me."
"I'm usually prettier than this, but you caught me at a bad moment."
Because the Ruin's begun.
What is the Ruin?
"Is it going to happen to me, too?"
"Man, I don't know what's going on!"
"But, you really are beautiful, mister."
You aren't all beat up like me.
You're like a human!
"I have to get back, or else Ohji will be worried!"
Ohji will be worried!
Ohji will be worried!
Bye-bye!
I don't think you're beat up.
I don't.
You can have this.
It's the prettiest one I've ever found.
It'll keep you safe.

"Boy, she`s a beaut!"
I Iike those green walls.
We had some trouble in St. Louis.
You`re looking really fit.
This is the old homestead.
"Yeah, I don`t know for how long, though."
The bank`s been after me like flies on a rib roast.
I know the feeling.
Fuck it!

Now you`re talking.
I`m going steady.
And I French kiss.
So?

I have one - there's an omission off the cool wall.
And it's this.
Which is the Mercedes SL55 AMG.
Mmm.
What a car.
Jeremy's car!
What a car!
There is an issue with this.
It's just been bought by somebody quite famous.
Do you want to guess?
Brad Pitt.
Cameron Diaz.

"Let me help you, Jeremy."
It's Dale Winton.
Dale Winton's a nice chap.
"No, he's orange."
It's uncool.
Sorry.
I'm glad you brought my car up.
I've got one I'd like to share with you.
The least cool car I've seen in a while - 1982 Porsche 911 SC.
Particularly if someone has written on the back and fitted a turbo body kit.
That's my car!
That really is your car!
"And it's hideous, so it's going here."
"Oh, we can."
And we will.
He's in the junkyard.
"McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road."
The junkyard.
Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.
"I wouldn't worry about this, Hogarth."
It isn't really happening.
This is only a bad dream.

MANSLEY:
Where's the giant?
(ECHOING) This is only a bad dream.
MANSLEY:
"Yes, sir."
"This thing is real, sir."
"I not only have incontrovertible evidence, General,"
I know where it's hidden.
"I don't know who built it, but it's here."
It's massive and we're running out of time.
There's no doubt we should act.
"The only question, sir, is..."
Can you afford not to?
"Excellent, sir."
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, sir."
"The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth."
Don't get cute.
I gotta warn Dean.
I'll be watching you.
(AWAKES WITH A START)
She drove off.
She's not rational.
Tell me the truth.
She's upset.
"Um, are you still with her?"
"Look, I told you..."
I told you we were having problems.
Are you still with her?
"All this time, you were... ..you were just lying to me about being separated."
"Technically, she was in Melbourne, I was here."
"Oh, my God."
I...
I just wanted to be with you.
"Oh, my God."
"OK, I can explain everything."
Do you know what?
Don't even bother.
Because I can see that the next word out of your mouth is gonna be a lie.
"OK, Grace, let's just be grown-up about..."
Just get out.
Let's be grown-up...
Just get out!
You heard her.
Hm?
"Now, you have fun."
That is an order.
You're going to enjoy bossing everyone around in Singapore?
Too soon to be funny.
Be happy.
Mwah.
"Rio awaits, and I've got a meeting at the office to get to."
"Oh, I'll miss you."
You're late.
The other bidders were hoping you wouldn't show.
I'll be happy to disappoint them.
- Sweetie?
- Yes sir.
- Stay close.
- Thanks.
See you later. 9:00.
Red eleven.
I'm approaching the cabin.
It's 5250.
Angels?
The signal's jammed.
Somebody doesn't want us listening.
Angels?
You're cutting it a little close.
I'm not here for the company.
I'm here to place my bid.
Are you sure your employer's prepared
- ...to compete in the big leagues?
- You'll see.
Welcome.
Business is for tomorrow.
Tonight...
A toast.

It got passed down through the family.
Why don't you?
I mean...
The police are investigating bars near the Nam Mountain area.
What's that?
I'm going to eat it after I raise it.
You should've picked a tastier one.
What the hell is she?
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?
"Mister, big problem!"
Your daughter's face came out like this.
Catch him!
You bitch!
It's me.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
I got him!
Excuse me.
Please let me live.
"You know we're foxes now, so we can't let you live."
Foxes?
"Dad, why'd you go on and tell him?"
You've got such a big mouth.
Shut up.
"He's going to die anyway, so who cares if he knows."
Wait.
Can't we let him live until that day?
"I know you're a bit reluctant, but if we let him live it could spell trouble later."
"Sorry, I know it's a waste."
Where should we start chopping?
Mutant Girl
Dismembered Woman
Knife Man
Kumiho Circus Troupe
"Franz, let us wear our old clothes and..."
- What else happened?
- Nothing!
Where did you first meet him?
On the streets?
"And I drive around, risking my life!"
You're a whore!
Leave me alone!
You whore!
I risk my life and work so hard!
Get out of my apartment!
Leave me alone!
Open the door!
It's my apartment!
Out!
Get out of here!
But I saved your life!
Get out!
Scoundrel!
Get out!
Out!
"Yes, she's so soft and faithful!"
I was on the verge of killing you.
Just like Ida.
I wanna be a decent man but it's so hard.
We just remain in the gutter.
"I'm going to drive to the countryside, I can't stand it here anymore."
"We still have a lot to do out there, in Weißensee."
Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.
"- So, you're taking Franz with you?"
- Yes.
"No, come on."
Already?
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Now, do me a favor."
I want you to move around with her a little bit.
See if she's worth a shit.
Come on.
"Aye, aye, captain."
This is a fucking good burger.
Did you make this?
I'm on break.
How did you find me?
"Mm, girl's got to eat."
One of mine saw you here and told me.
Ahh.
"I'm not here for you, love."
Don't worry.
What do you want?
"A couple of my girls got picked up and started talking to the cops, saying my name, talking about my business."
I've never said anything.
"I know, Chris."
"That's why you're still here enjoying your new life, spending time with your sons."
The other girls aren't so lucky.
Anyway.
"Point is, if the cops do show up asking you questions,"
I hope you forget my name.
"Of course, Terry."
I'd never say anything.
Sure.
I know you wouldn't.
Ah.
Don't worry.
I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.
Holy crap.
Look at that!
Cool!
A diving board!
Oh... my...
God.
This is the greatest thing ever.
And someone just dumped it here for us to find.
We've got to take it home!
What are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
But...
look at it!
It's... it's got the... and it's... up and... and bounce and... and bounce!
He's right.
We need it.
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!"
"You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas?"
You love peas!
Come on.
This is name-brand stuff.
It's three times the price of the food I eat!
"If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth."
See?
There's no reason for...
"Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too."
Promise you'll do it.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
"Okay look, just get out of your apartment."
Turn off your cell phone.
I'll call you at the inn as soon as I can.
Go now.
Okay.
Tell Julia I love her.
Mama?
Right.
Who's Julia?
She's my daughter.
You were married.
Kyra's a friend of mine.
We both wanted a child.
I want you to tell me the truth.
About what?
"You, me, what happened in Berlin."
"I told you, we worked together."
Don't.
"The memories are fading, I can feel them disappearing."
I wanna know the truth while it still matters.
Please.
You were studying in Washington.
I was assigned to recruit you.
You seduced me.
It was part of the job.
Why me?
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.
Who am I?
What is my name?
Kozlenko.
Kusuma.
I am sheik bin-Khalid's living son.
Only god will decide when I die.
"Now, put your gun away."
We have work to do.
You shouldn't be here.
Yeah.
"Well, you hung up on me."
I was... worried.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Hey.
Look at me.
You have to finish mixing the explosives.
Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
What they said about you with those other students?
Have you?
No.
"They destroyed your marriage, and now they're trying to destroy your career."
"No, no."
"Amira, please, stop."
Amira?
I knew you were lying to me.
"Oh, my god!"
He was the one you were texting?
"God, Amira."
You are sick!
You are a sick bastard!
I'm gonna tell everyone...
The door!
Lock the door!
If I catch even a whiff of you dog whistling these guys...
- Do you
- Get over there.
Get your hands on your head.
[Cloudy] Hold 'em up.
We told you people we were comin' back.
We're gonna keep comin' back here until you clean this bar up.
Keep your eye on your neighbor.
"If he drops something, it belongs to you."
"What is this, a fuckin' hospital here?"
Huh?
"- Turn around there, fella."
"- What do we got here, huh?"
This belong to you?
Huh?
"Stand up there, ""noddy."""
Get your hands on your fuckin' head.
Get in there!
"- You wanna take a ride there, fat man?"
"- Oh, bullshit."
Huh?
Pay attention.
We're gonna ask questions later.
Turn around.
[Man Whispering] Fuckin' bullshit.
"All right, shut up there."
Shut up!
Anybody want a milk shake?
"All right, come over here."
You... and you.
"Hey, whiskers!"
Come over here.
- Move ass when I call you.
"Give me a year, J. D."
"Fuck the year, homes."
I'm gonna go make my collections.
Órale.
"What's up, peckerwood?"
SANTANA:
Power became our game.
Make sure the meeting's set for tonight with the Black Guerrilla Family.
Power to provide everything you find outside.
Make sure the Aryan Brotherhood's behind us.
Make sure they're part of the whole thing.
(speaking spanish) I'll be over with the carnales.
"You got your people, Big Jim?"
big jim:
"Be straight with me, man."
"Hey, Santana."
SANTANA:
Extortion.
They wanna do it.
What should we do?
Go ahead.
(speaking spanish)

You just give it a little bit of time.
Prostitution.
All right.
"It's done, man."
We give you three packas.
Make sure it's done right.
"We got it together because we had to, didn't have a choice."
The eme is here because before there was nothing.
"You all right, Santana?"
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
please.
Know anything about the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
he goes to Paulie.
he goes to Paulie.
Tommy hecallsPaulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie everyweekno matterwhat.
That's no question to ask a young girl!
What's Pepita the Elephant?
An elephant.
Right.
You're both nuts.
How old is she now?
Are you afraid she's yours?
-Is she?
She has no father.
Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.
Give me your hand.
I'll read your palm.
You have a weird pulse.
It's like two parallel rhythms.
A steady Finnish hump.
And a fiery beat.
You're like Iceland:
"ice on the surface, fire inside."
You should show this fire to a red-haired woman.
She's been waiting for you for quite a while.
"Damn you, Jesse!"
Wrong hole.
The balcony will be out there!
Move it!
I'll come back tonight.
-It's a deal.
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
Fight fire with fire.
Ouch...
I don't think you're up to this.
I must fire you.
"Nick at Nite, once in a while."
"All right, I'm going."
Will you wait here?
I want your opinion on something.
How does Mona feel about Rachel moving in?
I'm on my way to tell her.
"She's been away all week, but she'll be cool."
She's been so supportive.
"She even got the baby a T-shirt that says ""Fossils are my friends. """
"Come on, Mona."
Don't kiss ass.
So I'm gonna take off.
"Oh, shoot!"
"Oh, shoot!"
Rachel wanted to see this tape.
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.
Could you take it to your apartment?
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
"Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter."
The father's name is also Cookie.
Why am I friends with these people?
I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
"Monica, grow up."
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.
"Come on, I'm your older brother."
Ask me.
"Okay, big brother."
Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister?
- Good.
I'll excuse myself.
"I'm gonna go to the ladies room and I'm going to remove my new, improved butt."
I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad.
- And then we'll get to work.
- Will do.
Apology accepted.
- You must be Nora.
- Yes.
- Lawrence McGill.
- Very nice to meet you.
"Oh, my God, look at those earrings."
"Let me guess, a carat and a half?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, are you a jeweler?"
No.
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.
Yes.
Please forgive me.
I'm a little nervous about all this.
- You're a virgin.
- Hardly.
I have five children.
I mean a dating service virgin.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, yes."
I am.
Are you?
"Oh, no."
I'm an old whore at this point.
Lots of first dates.
"Seconds, not so much."
- Marco Zuloaga.
- I'll put you through.
- To get a referral slip stamped?
"- Along the corridor, Administration."
- Who is it?
- It's Marco Zuloaga.
I'm calling from Jordan.
I read that Lydia died.
"Yes, that's right."
"I'm so sorry, Marco."
I would like to have been told.
We've had so many problems here.
What's going on?
They said Benigno doesn't work there anymore.
Benigno's in jail.
In jail?
Why?
He's accused of raping Alicia.
What are you talking about?
Try to help him.
The poor guy's got nobody.
- Have you been to see him?
- Me?
"After what he's done, I can't."
But he needs help and you're his friend.
- All right.
What jail is he in?
- It's in Segovia.
"Wait here for me, please."
I'd like to see an inmate.
"That's in Visitations, through that door to the left."
Thank you.
But it's not just your legs.
I'm crazy about that little nose of yours.
That cute little button of a nose.
"Hey, Animal."
Animal.
I've been crazy about you for years.
"I've seen every picture you ever made, six times."
"I'd just sit there, watching you."
I wouldn't even open up the popcorn bag.
Animal.
"Animal, wake up."
Wake up.
Betty.
Betty.
"Animal, this is me, Harry Shapiro."
Harry Shapiro!
Harry.
Cut the music!
Cut the music!
Cut it!
At ease.
At ease.
Somebody cover the doors.
"Now, listen."
The men are here to pick up Dunbar.
They're taking him to Berlin.
"They got the proof, looks like he's finished."
Only he's not finished yet.
Hoffy and I figured out a long shot.
I've got all the barracks behind us.
- What are you gonna do?
-Get that smudge pot.
Do you wanna leave ?
I like this place.
It's been a long time since we came here.
Your mother is gonna wait.
It was at least a year and a half ago.
"I wanted to take a book with me, and I forgot."
It was quite sunny !
You had to insist to bring me here.
As usual I dithered.
Aferwards I was happy.
Things were never the same after that.
"Try to sleep now, sweet heart."
Was it Francois who's just called ?
"Yes, he is on the way."
You didn't tell him.
No.
I don't want him to worry.
It's bad enough with you being upset.
This should be him.
Mom ?
Yes sweet heart ?
How do I look ?
Great.
Hi François !
Everything's alright ?
Yes !
How is he ?
Did he sleep ?
No even if he's really quite exhausted.
"He can't sleep, can he ?"
And he keeps asking about you.
"I go see him, and then I will make us dinner."
I told him that it was an interesting idea.
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
(SNICKERING)
JOHN:
Can you imagine that motherfucker roaming around Parker center?
(LAUGHING)
DUD:
He'd put a stopper in the bottle.
(BOTH LAUGHING LOUDLY)
That yokel wouldn't last 10 minutes.
Put a stopper in the bottle.
(LAUGHING)
FERN:
"Hurricane, what are you doing back there?"
You know no one's supposed to be back there.
"Just getting a candy bar, Fern."
You going to pay for it this time?
"Hi, boys."
I saw your car parked out front.
Charlie come to relieve me about a half hour ago.
Dud?
I didn't mean to put you on the spot this morning.
"(RADIO SQUAWKS) Listen, Dale, we didn't mean..."
"Oh, that's me."
"Yeah, this is 2-10, go ahead."
LARRY:
"Hurricane, I just got back from Little Rock with that picture."
10-4.
That's us.
You leave it?
Yeah.
"Jimmy, you got it?"
~ Um...
~ What?
Do you not think she has the right to know her husband was murdered?
No.
No-one has a right to know anything till I know who killed Mr Newcastle.
"We work for the dead, not the living."
Off you go.
Are you sure she can manage it?
She's never done it before.
Only one way to learn.
Are you ready?
"Is this your husband, Mrs Parker?"
"I-I-I mean, yes."
"It's Scott all right, but... just the shell of what he was."
What he used to be.
"(I'm sorry, Scottie.)"
~ All right.
~ Where did you find him?
"I, er..."
I don't have any details.
How did... he do it?
Do what?
Kill himself.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about his death.
"Don't know much for a copper, do you?"
Are you the tea lady?
When did you last see Scott?
Night before last.
Me birthday party.
Happy birthday.
~ Thanks.
~ Was it?
"Oh, right, right, right."

"Look, son, in this business, you wait too long, you wait tables."
[Arnie continues set]
[Arnie] Brain cancer.

This is my favorite.
"Oh, I've never seen a ring like this before."
It's so twinkly.
"It's a rose-cut diamond, from India."
[lounge music playing]
I can't stop looking at it.
"Nicky, see this ring?"
"Hint, hint."
"No one does subtlety like you, babe."
[laughs]
"Olivia's dad was a jeweler in Romania, and now she makes her own stuff."
"Come on, come see my wine cellar."
I have some bottles here that Bob Hope gave me.
Whew.
♪♪
- Oh.
- [clears throat]
Uh...
[laughs]
"It's okay with you, I'd prefer you fuck me the old fashioned way, 10 percent at a time, huh?"
You come to my house with your junkie girlfriend.
I have two kids here.
What are you talking about?
"That, I..."
[chuckles]
And she never asked any questions anyway.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk.
This is from Siam.
Come see my bedroom.
"-Tommy, will you take him?"
-Of course. I'll eat this fucking dog.
Love that crystal ball or what?
This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.
French.
"Janice and I were having so much fun, she started screwing up at work."
I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.
Fuckin' Janice can do whatever she wants to do!
Got it?
Got it?
"I'm who ya gotta run through, you understand?"
.
Hang up once more and you're gonna deal with me!
Get off of her.
You're an animal.
"Spider, on your way over here, bring me a Cutty and water, huh?"
-Did you guys eat?
-l'm starving.
-l'll play these.
-You'll play those?
Do I fuckin' stutter?
I'll play those.
What am I?
A mirage?
What?
-Really?
I'm sorry.
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.
Fredo!
"Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch, you look great!"
Frank Pentangeli!
"I thought you was never coming out west, you big bum!"
I've got to check on my boys.
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?
"A kid gives me a Ritz cracker with chopped liver and says, ""canapés""."
"I said, ""Can of peas, my ass."
"That's a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"""
Bring out the peppers and sardines!
Seeing you reminds me of New York in the old days!
"You remember Willi Cicci, who was with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?"
We were all upset about that.
"Heart attack, huh?"
"No, that was no heart attack."
That's what I'm here to see your brother Mike about.
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?
Do I have to get a letter of introduction to get a sit-down?
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.
Rocco.
Yes.
Don't worry; the shorts won't fit him!
That's his problem!
So?
He's been following me!
Following you?
!
Don't worry!
I'll fix him!
Keep this...
Make a hole in this and have it.
Okay?
I'm secretary to Bhardwaj and Bhardwaj the name is Banwarilal Pandit.
Have you seen the woman?
Which woman?
The well-endowed one.
She was...
Are you talking about Laxmi?
You know her?
You are God-sent!
I am God-sent and I'll give you some of God's offerings now!
You tease women in our area!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Have you no womenfolk at home?
"How are you, Shantabai?"
Are they having a fight there?
Yes.
Which is why I've brought these coconuts for you.
Make a hole in this and have it.
I know that.
"But, aunt..."
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.
Excuse me.
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton.
I'll wager he will do so in less than a fortnight.
Dear Edward...
Hello there!
Sir John...
Dear ladies!
Upon my word!
Here you are!
"- Sir John, your kindness..."
- None of that!
"Hush, please!"
"Here is my dear mamma-in-law, Mrs. Jennings."
You must be Mrs. Dashwood.
Was yourjourney tolerable?
Poor souls!
Why did you not come up to the park first?
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John.
We cannot...
No refusals!
I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!
Let us settle in.
Then the sword might not even work.
"And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it."
We are in a race.
We're in a race.
You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast.
"Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword."
800.
Exactly.
So it should be easy.
You guys follow the tsuba.
I will follow--
Ah...the implosion grenade.
And one of us will find the thief.
W--wait.
"I mean, wh--wh--where are you going?"
Somebody is making new grenades.
Somebody who promised not to.
Again he doesn't answer.
And no good-bye.
This is impossible.
Keep at it though. you're the smart one.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're--you're doing great.
- Hello.
"- Leena, hey."
"Hey, is--is Claudia there?"
"Okay, she won't be able to find it either."
Claudia's out.
It's just me.
Good night.
I see...
So this is the lowest layer.
"You say the two of them are here, right?"
Yes.
What shall we do?
This wasn't mentioned in Fubuki's report.
"Have Jinpu, Usyuki and one more stay behind to guard, and the rest of you, go down to the lowest layer."
Damn you!
This is special agent Fubuki.
The two Dangaioh pilots are in my custody.
"Boy, I'm in trouble now."
Wake up.
Both of you wake up!
"Are you okay, Big Brother?"
Kaori...
Hurry and get out there!
Burst and Flail are ready to go.
What on earth happened?
I'll explain later.
Just hurry!
"Hitomi, hang in there!"
"Chidou, you okay?"
Where the hell were you?
You ready to transform?
Am I ready?

"No matter what the event is, how can she apply it so thickly?"
"You just want to play with me, right?"
You take me for fun!
"I said, you played me for fun, didn't you?"
"You don't keep your word, you bastard smelly man!"
Why are you late?
I've been waiting for you.
You actually dare to cheat in front of me.
Bastard!
Hey.
Is your head messed up?
So I have to spell it out now?
I don't like you.
Bastard!
Miss Kim Na Na.
Hey.
Miss Kim Na Na.
She completely lost her spirit.
Here.
"Thank you for the kiss, agent."
What is this?
Money.
There are several zeros on it right?
"Here, 1 million Won."
Good bye.
Does it hurt?
"You have thick skin like walls, so it shouldn't hurt."
"For medical costs, right?"
"Hey, Shin Eun Ah."
What?
President's daughter disappeared?
"No, she did not come here."
Honey...

"- Hey,darling."
- You're home early.
- Is that a problem?
- No
- No?
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
"Oh,my."
They're gorgeous.
But why?
Tonight is your night.
You're going to be hearing a lot of speeches from people and...
I'm not going to bore you with one of my own.
I'm just...very proud of you.
"Jeff,there's something I need to tell you."
- sara.
- Hi.
"Senator,we still have to meet with the governor's people."
And security's now requested we arrive an hour earlier.
Thank you.
You should get ready.
Was there something...?
No.
"Later,when it's,um... when it's just us."
All right.
Shall we?
Okay.
"Don't reference the early readers program, at least 15 people in this room voted against it."
Set your perimeter!
- It's still alive!

We've hit it with everything we've got!
"Not everything, General."
The bomb.
The Nautilus has first strike capability and is not far offshore.
"You scare me, Mansley."
You want us to bomb ourselves in order to kill it?
"General, the giant seems to follow whatever attacks it."
"We can lure it away from the town, then destroy it."

"Father, please wake up!"
Father!

Chun-su...
Are you all right?
You should've just let them take the dam salt!
Why did you fight?
"That's salt is our livelihood, and I won't be robbed of it."
"I have to get you married off, and..."
What's more important than your life?
I'm sorry...
"I'm your father, and I have nothing but poverty and hardship to leave behind..."
"Stop that, Father."
"Chun-su, look under the ashes in the furnace."
The Furnace...
Father!
Chun-su...
My dear boy Chun-su...
Father...!
Father...!
Why didn't just give it to them?
Why didn't he?
That old fool!
What's more important than his life?
Why didn't he get treatment when he had all this?
That fool!
That idiot!
That old fool!
I won't let them get away with this!

"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Right, private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
(MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)
Forward.
Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."
(GUNS FIRING)
Dodged a bullet on that one.
Hlcoveryou.
You go around them.
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)
JIMMY:
"Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!"

Jolly good.
Pull your weight!
Help me with the cripple.

(MERCENARIES LAUGHING)
"Spasibo, Yuri."
"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little, teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"Yeah, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah.
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
Sure I can.
I'll be right back.
"Gingy, Gingy..."
"Run, run, run as fast as you can, if you want to remain a gingerbread man!"
"Oh, Gingy."
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.
"- Oh, well, I..."
- It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
"No, no, no!"
Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty!
Really pretty.
The girl of your dreams.
- Remember?
- Leave me alone!
Gingy!
"Let go, Gingy!"
"Fall with me, so we can be together forever!"
Here's a thought.
You let go!
Together.
Together for...
"John, who is this?"
Where am I?
What part of London is this?
"Well, if I tell you that it wouldn't be a safe house, would it?"
And you wouldn't be in protective custody.
"And besides, it's only for an hour."
(GROANS)
"You do know what they'll do when they find me, don't you?"
(PHONE RINGS)
(BEEP)
WOMAN:
"Pick up, come on, come on."
"Bitch, pick up!"
"All right, now listen."
Have you done as you were asked?
Have you?
(HANGS UP)
RIPLEY:
No sign of Cameron.
Flat's completely empty.
LUTHER:
Why the empty flat?
LUTHER:
It's almost like he's never been here before.
(PHONE RINGS)
"Hello, your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone."
(BEEP)
MAN:
I know you're there.
"Benny, it's Ripley, mate."
"I need you to trace a call going to this number, yeah?"
"Hello, Cameron."
- (HORN BLARES)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"- You didn't, actually."
- (SIREN WHOOPS)
- Oh.
- Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""Eyes on the road!"""
Screwdriver. (GRUNTS)
License and registration.
Hi!
"Terribly sorry, officer, but it's actually my car."
I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
You know it'll be three months until we get a spare part.
Make sure it doesn't happen again.
It won't.
Back to work!
I've got them very cheap.
Take a look at the large one.
- How much?
- 350 FM.
That's for women!
Try it on.
Too small for my girlfriend.
Look at him!
She's looking good.
How much for the trousers?
I'll give you 50 FM.
"No, 150!"
I can't give you more than 50... for that used rag.
I've made some progress with a serious man.
A rich man from Sarakollé.
He just needs to swallow the bait.
This has no future.
"She'll end up getting married, like our sisters."
Watch out!
The Director's coming.
You old whore!
Who did you date yesterday?
"In the afternoon, Seydow."
The ugly one?
Is the Minister in?
I'm Makan's secretary.
Fatou!
The Director wants to see you... tomorrow at 4 pm.
What we need is someone who's attractive but not too expensive.
Someone who's not too bright but brave enough to be casual about frostbite!
"Mr Arkwright, could you come a minute?"
Julie!
Little Jelly Tot Julie!
"Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982!"
Ho--ho!
"Hey, sh--she might even do it for sweets!"
Can you...
Can you get me out?
"What are you doing inside that, Granville?"
It's got me by the dangler!
How very inconvenient for you!
"I was so busy trying to keep me fingers out of the way, I forgot about me dangler!"
-
"- You do, don't you?"
-
"- Anything I can do, Mr Arkwright?"
"Funny you should say that, Jelly...er, Julie."
-
- What are you doing?
-
"- I'll be with you in a minute, Granville."
-
- Would you mind walking to the door?
-
- To the door?
-
- And back.
Good lass.
-
- Get me out!
"Oh, my."
"You have got a present for mommy, don't ya?"
You need a diaper change?
- I'll do it.
- All right.
You have at it.
- Go see auntie Nic.
"- Okay, baby."
Who's the best baby?
Not in your mouth.
Not in your mouth.
"Ooh, that's yucky."
Wait.
"Oh, gotcha!"
"It's okay, baby."
"Auntie Nic's not really a baby person after all, is she?"
"Okay, I know-- oh, not a ""baby person""?"
Then what's this?
"Oh, well, I mean, honey, of course you're a baby person."
It just takes practice.
That's all.
Maybe she just doesn't like to have her diaper changed.
"Oh, no."
She doesn't.
"None of them do at this age, but you'll learn all that."
"Actually, you'll just get a nanny, and she can deal with all that stuff."
Okay.
There we go.
We're all better now.
- What?
"- Thank god for nannies, right?"
"I'll make sure to get one that's a ""baby person."""
"- Nefedov, where does all this bounty come from?"
-We are strengthening ties with the locals!
- lt is foryou to live wealthily.
- Thanks.
And let your life have happywings.
-What's that?
- Give it to me.
"Calm down, my little one..."
- My congratulations!
- Thanks.
- Foryour health!
- Good luck to you.
"- ls that you, the charmed one?"
-You recognized me...
- Good luck to you!
- Good luck!
"Comrade mayor, may I invite you?"
"No, thanks, ma'am, some othertime..."
- Listen to my command!
- Lesha!
Prepare forthe march.
- ls it all right that we are kissing in public?
-All right.
- ls it a farewell kiss.
- l'll be back soon.
What's wrong?
What's up?
Why are you crying?
Why are you all crying?
Why is everybody crying?
"The carrot is very bitter, it needs some sweeties!"
Bitter!
Might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
(PANTING)
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry, this is my downtime."
(yells) What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you?
I'm your new personal trainer.
- Please!
- Ah-ah!
The tall guy the other night in the casino.
The one that got chucked out.
What's his name?
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just the warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop.
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff.
He got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"It's OK, I've got my badges."
Why?
"Look, all's I know is that..."
is that there was a girl between them.
Some stripper who worked in Soho.
Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental.
"Blimey, the newsagent's is closer now we're in a smaller studio."
Shut up.
You're spoiling the magic for everyone.
Oh.
"Oh, look, the newsagent."
"Hello, me old darling."
"Yep, it's me, Richie Rich."
Don't faint.
Treasure the moment.
Here's a pic.
Put it in your box of precious things.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes, I'm sure."
"One of the cool type, are we?"
Gonna boast to your friends?
"""I met Richie Rich and pretended not to recognise him."
"Hee hee. """
What a sad little life you must lead.
Are you mad?
"- Perhaps a little zany, yes."
- Excuse me.
Do you have part one of Poncy Cooking with part two free?
- Certainly.
"One pound, please."
- Aha.
"I'm afraid I have no money so I'll just take part two for nothing, shall I?"
- You stupid slag!
"Come on, Richie."
"- One pound, please."
"Er, hurr..."
I'll give you a mensh on me next programme.
"Night, hon."
Sorry!
- Trauma.
"- No problem, I just have to hurry."
How come?
- Don't get upset.
- Why would I be upset?
I need to clean for...
Sandy?
There's a real estate agent coming by first thing in the morning.
I need more milk.
A...
A real estate...
"OK, I give."
Why?
I was going to tell you on the way home.
To value the townhouse.
Value?
I just want to see how much it's worth.
- I know what value means.
"- I'm not selling, it would just be good to know in case."
- You're going to be in Dallas...
- I told you I'd pay my share!
- It's too big for me and Maya.
- It's only a contract!
You don't know that!
And it might be nice to be close to Mom.
Mom?
"Yeah, in case I need help."
"Sandy, Mom dropped Maya on her head."
It was an accident.
"Mel, you can't just go and make changes like this..."
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight and go skinny-dipping.
Yeah!
You know?
"Like,I just want to be naked in the dark ocean with you."
Naked.
You know?
Johnny?
"No,no,no,no,no."
"Everything's fine,it's just..."
What?
I like you.
"I just need you to,like,taper it back a little."
Just a little.
Like this.
You don't need to do that.
It's all good.
We're cool.
"You're kinda,like,bam, instant on me,bam?"
Yeah.
"and I need to,like,ease into it."
Have a little flirty time.
I don't want flirty time.
Flirty time's awesome.
"Flirty time is not awesome,okay?"
This is awesome.
This.
"This is awesome,okay?"
Come on.
"Don't be afraid of it,Bella."
You have absolutel no patience.
You're going to drive yourself crazy for nothing.
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing withoutJeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care ofJenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
Hey!
Don't shoot!
It's me!
Somebody's aiming at my ass from below!
What happened?
Where'sJeffrey?
I know you both lied to me.
Tell me the truth!
Ow!
Stop!
Ow!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ow!
-
- What's going on?
-
"- I'm just having fun, that's all!"
"You get dressed up to do a bit of shopping, not to be knocked over by an errand boy!"
"Of course not, Mrs Featherstone."
"Come and sit here, my dear."
Take the weight off your purse.
Not even me husband used to get as close as that!
Whereabouts did you catch her?
I don't know.
Everything went black.
She's a widow woman.
Everything's black to start with!
"God, it could have been anywhere!"
"Hey, come on, you're supposed to be customer--finding."
Get out there.
Go on!
"Dear, dear!"
"You look sad, Granville."
You poor love!
What is it?
It's advanced training.
"Oh, if it's only to do with the shop!"
I thought you were really depressed -- heartache or something.
That's what I mean.
"- Yes, it was."
"Well, at least Jo seems well."
- I kissed him on the ear.
- Perhaps if you had another?
Why ever not?
Surely David's capable?
Yes.
But he can't bear to pass me in the hallway for fear of touching me.
"- Come on, Lucy."
- I do love you.
It's not necessary to tell Father about this.
- No.
- No.
"Come on, then."
"- Bye-bye, Grandma."
"- Come along, Jo."
Agent Muller.
- Someone's in with Muller.
- Good.
Give them 60 seconds and then go in.
You've left a trail a blind man could follow.
We're surrounded.
Speak in English.
The Führer wants you to... reassess the strength of Patton's army in East Anglia.
It's invasion strength.
They have the photographs.
General Patton is ready to invade Europe at any time at Pas-de-Calais.
- Hitler's astrologer...
- Astrologer?
My God.
He believes... attack will be at Normandy.
All right.
What happened to your head?
"Uh, the sky is falling."
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch?"
Do I have to hold a real cat?
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Mmm, yummers."
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What?
"No, ew, Jenna."
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
"Hi, uh, what are you doing down here?"
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
Afghanistan is a different situation...
I'll have an apple juice.
"Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a...
You're not the one who disappeared.
You would've had to have been there in the first place.
"No, not Artie."
"Oh, all your--all your secrets,"
"And your--and your treasure hunts,"
And that damned place.
"You know, James believed in life."
You need to get one.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Carol.
Carol.
Carol.
Could you please--please.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- What?
- Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
"Carol, if you're harboring him in any way,"
You're in danger.
What are you doing here?
Just about to ask you the same thing.
Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself?
It is called investigating a case.
This isn't the case.
This is self-pity.
The case is the implosion grenade
And the sword.
And someone out there is running around
Never a rumpus here.
Most orderly.
"It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid."
Pretty girls always cause trouble.
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What?
Lvy?
I can't do that to Ivy.
A great man can always change his mind for a reason.
"Yes, sir."
"Why, certainly, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"A troublemaker, that's what she is."
Out she goes.
"Yes, but now, while the evening is still young."
"- Yes, sir."
"Certainly, sir."
"- Yes, certainly."
What happened?
I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.
"- That's my decision, my girl."
- Stop pushing!
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on.
Don't argue the point.
"- Oh, good riddance."
What's happened in there?
"- Is there some trouble, lvy?"
- Trouble?
"I was sacked, that's what!"
"Well, sir, I guess I am a lucky guy at that."
"You know, I hardly ever lose a coin toss."
"Go to the horse races in Hot Springs, bet on a long shot."
Damn if the son of a bitch doesn't come in.
My mom used to always tell me I was born under a lucky star.
CASHIER:
What you got there?
WOMAN:
A couple rolls of film.
"Baby, there's an article in here about Julia from Dark Memories."
That ain't Julia.
That's that damn twin sister...
With her evil self.
"No, it's not."
Can you tell him who this is?
That's Julia on Dark Memories.
Mmm-hmm.
Told you.
Got any maps of Houston?
We don't need no damn map of Houston.
PLUTO:
"Be cool, Ray, be cool."
CASHIER:
"Good, Bill."
How are you?
BILL:
It's real quiet out there.
We got the two most exciting jobs in town.
(MICROWAVE BEEPING)
LILA:
"Your other burrito's ready, baby."
He's watching me.
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
It was Roth who tried to kill me in my home.
It was Roth all along.
"He acts like I'm his son, his successor."
But he thinks he'll live forever and wants me out.
-How can I help?
"-Just go along, as if you know nothing."
-I've already made my move.
-What move?
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.
"You're to take it easy, he'll be back tomorrow."
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.
I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English.
"-Gracias, señor."
-Buenas noches.
"-Honey, go to the casino."
-If you're feeling better.
Feel fine.
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay.
"Nice to see you, Mr. Paul."
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought a bag full of money.
Where is it?
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to...
Just want to wait.
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.
I'd give four million to be able to take a painless piss.
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.
"I know, but who gave the go-ahead?"
I know I didn't.
Anyone called me?
"Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it!"
- I asked you:
Did anyone call?
- I can't hear you for all that music!
"Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off!"
Stop it now!
Go to your room!
I'm sick and tired of all this!
All right!
What's the matter?
My little baby...
"Nina, why is she like that?"
Like what?
A normal city child.
They're all like that in kindergarten.
They got a load of things to do.
I asked you:
Did anyone call me?
"- Well, did they?"
- I had no time to tell.
Someone did.
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?
Have you?
- Someone called?
- Yes.
It was embarrassing.
"I took it up, they say nothing."
"I yelled, then someone says politely:"
This is Ghena.
"And then he asks, you know:"
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
[PHONE BEEPING]
NATE:
It's already been over an hour.
Bar's closing soon.
"She's gonna come, I know she is."
"Whoa, wait."
Dan is Gossip Girl?
Gossip Girl?
You crazy?
"- Dan, what are you doing here?"
- I Loopt you.
Are you waiting for Gossip Girl?
"Yeah, and I know you don't approve."
I'm gonna go close the tab.
"This grudge-match thing, it doesn't seem like you."
What's going on?
- I don't wanna be irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?
You're Serena van der Woodsen.
"Gossip Girl might be right about me, but she's wrong about you."
"Without Serena, who would I have dreamt about?"
I might have spent my whole life on the outside if you hadn't let me in.
Which I'm holding against you.
[LAUGHS]
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
"- Wait, they're a team."
- A team of what?
"- Wait, why are you all here?"
- I got a text saying to meet you.
Ka-pow!
"Oh, Lightning!"
If you figure that out you just gonna be OK.
"Oh, yeah, that..."
That is spectacular advice.
"Thank you, Mr. The King."
"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history..."
A rookie has won the Piston Cup.
Yes!
...we have a three-way tie.
"Hey, that must be really embarrassing."
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!
Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.
"Well, thank you!"
Thanks to all of you out there!
Thank you!
"Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."
"No, not me!"
"No, you rock, and you know that!"
"Oh, yeah!"
Whoo!
Yep!
All right!
Got it!
"""First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. """
"Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick."
Huh?
"- Hey, kid!"
Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.
"Let's go, Mack."
We'd better go back to the Doctor.
-Where did you get that?
-It's too small for me.
-What is it?
-It's a present.
-I've been trying to get it off.
-Who from?
-I hope you haven't broken it.
-Nyssa.
"Adric, Nyssa, come on."
Doctor!
I don't want you two chasing after the Master independently.
"You, Adric, should know how dangerous he is."
-That's the man who brought me from Traken.
-Yes.
He said he was a friend of yours.
-But he's the man on the bridge.
-Yes.
-You said to be prepared for the worst.
"-Indeed I did, and I am prepared for the worst."
"Why are you prepared for the worst, Doctor?"
Because he's here.
Please remain where you are.
I have it in my power to bring Logopolis to a complete halt.
There's much more to this block transfer computation than we thought.
"Yes, that's how they built a replica of the Pharos Project."
"Yes, yes, but why?"
Hmm?
Why build a replica of the Pharos Project?
Central Register.
Listen.
-I don't...
What's up with step one?
You've skipped step one and two.
What's step three again?
You ask me what's wrong!
Got it.
Good.
You bet.
Go ahead.
Where?
- Step three.
- What's step three again?
(EXHALES)
We'll skip step three.
I'm just going to tell you what's wrong.
That should have been step one.
Wrong.
Step one and two are fundamental steps.
"You missed steps, Stewart."
How?
"Step one, become angry with someone."
"Step two, tell that someone that you're angry."
"Step three, resolve anger with that someone."
- Step four...
- (SCOFFING) Step four.
"Step four, resume peaceful existence."
Your logic is frighteningly bewitching.
Phantasmagoric.
It's time for you to go.
What?
Where?
Leave here?
It was a rebound.
Come in please.
Paula calling Hedley.
"Come in, Hedley."
Come in.
Hedley here.
"Come in, Paula."
Where are you?
"Well, I'm at the north waterhole, but no astro-chimp."
Where's Dad?
He's out in the bush looking for tracks.
"You know, the trouble with chimps is they're very tricky, and it's almost impossible to track them."
"But if anyone can find a missing chimp,"
I'd place my money on Marsh.
I'm afraid Daktari hasn't had any luck either.
- How are you doing?
"- Well, not too well."
"And you know, I guess it takes a chimp to find a chimp."
Judy's out in the bush scouting around.
"Over and out, Hedley."
"Oh, Clarence, I hope Judy can find Sally."

"Mrs Greenberg, one last thing."
If you think of anything else...
- I will call you!
- Fine.
Thank you.
They make me so nervous.
"Now, why do I have to stay at this Robin's Nest?"

They don't want me.
They want Saul.
They don't want her.

This is the last dispatch from Havas news agency:
"""The findings made on the trunk of the Munich-Paris train led to the discovery of a fingerprint left by Jacques Dollon, the man wanted for the murder of the Baroness de Vibray and the theft from the Princess Danidoff."""
This is madness!
I'm going crazy!
Not now!
"I need sensational stuff, so sort it out yourself."
Go!
"Hello, Fandor."
Good morning.
She was in her room.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- How are you?
- Better.
I find it peaceful here.
I got your message.
What's wrong?
"Ah, yes."
I read your article on the princess Danidoff.
I 'm sure now:
Her name was on the list with the date of April 12.
"Sorry to bother you, but someone is asking for Miss Elizabeth on the phone."
Anyone know you are here?
"No, just you."
I can accompany you?
"Yeah, sure."
Hello?
Elizabeth Dollon?
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
Maybe we could find out who it is.
Check and see if somebody died around here.
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
-Guess which ones.
-No.
"Ahem, there was one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
[SIGHING] I knew him.
How'd he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
-That's where--
-Where the chick got swirlied to death.
"So, what, this ghost is possessing nerds?"
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.

"Well, if I was older, do you think that I would make a very good husband?"
"If you were older, I think you'd make a wonderful husband."
I'll be back when I'm 25.
Will you wait?
That's a long time to wait.
It won't be as long as you think.
Now don't move.
I'll be right back.
Nancy?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are we fightin' about?
I don't know.
I guess I do.
I'm jealous.
Of Wilbur?
He's only 14 years old.
He is?
"Well, how old did you think he was?"
"Oh, much older."
"I mean, he's very mature for 14."
I thought he was at least 15.
"Oh, Bob, you're so silly."

The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.

Three years ago he tries to hold up Tiffany's... on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight.
He coulda got two and a half to five... but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute.
"Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled off a contract on a guy named DeMarco."

Her name's Angie.
She's a fast filly.

They'll get hungry.
And what about looters ?
We just have to get organized.

I just feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.
No!
Let's have a glass of wine first.
(ROBIN SIGHING)
(ROBIN EX CLAIMS)
"Oh, man."
(ROBIN EX CLAIMING)
Look how filthy I am.
"I am just a filthy, filthy girl who would totally go to second base with a guy as a favor to a friend."
(ROBIN MOANING)
You like that?
(ROBIN MOANING)
"I'm going to call Maggie, see what she's doing."
"Oh, God!"
"Maggie, Maggie, Maggie."
"Give it a rest, jeez!"
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.
- Ted?
What about David?
- They broke up.
Maggie's single?

- Get me my secretary.
"- Ah, here you are, Molly."
- Hail maestro!
"- Hello, Jane."
How are you?
- Fine.
"- Your show was grand, Doug."
- Did you like it?
You've certainly produced the best musical done at college.
I had a great gang.
How about a dance later?
- Certainly.
- I'll be over.
- You beautiful thing...
- Uh-uh.
Okay.
* Aah I'm in love

* All over again

* I'm in love all over again *
* Got a trick
I'm not old enough to... remember that event.
but trust me:
the poor and the noble... lose every war since then... regardless of flag...
And women...
Women have no flag.
The real Italian flag does not show three colors... but the male organ.
"Moral, Homor, Family... the cult of religion, are there, in between the legs."
- My God!
- I disagree...
A little exaggerated.
There's only one flag... this one.
But that is from Savoia.
Listen.
American airplane.
I think it is German.
And why the US don't fight back?
The Americans are asleep.
They rise early.
I heard another noise before.
Listen.
There's people at the stairs.
- Let them in.
- Ok.
Easy.
Slow.
Come in.
She was taken by God.
Let's go out.
"Nunziatina, Carmela, stay here."
Bring what's needed.
Quick.
Let's go into the other room.
I'm not gonna answer it.
What?
What?
I don't have the money.
What do you want me to do?
"Ok, you tell your mom, she gives you the money, you're out of debt."
Then you enroll in a public school.
You make it-- you make it sound just so easy.
It's--it's not--
I will give you until tonight to tell your mom.
"Nick, please, man."
I will get the money.
Ok?
That's--that's not a problem.
"I'll get it from this guy who owes me anyway, and I can pay him back with that and she'll never know."
Ok?
[Cell phone rings]
Uh...
Please don't make me sorry that I told you this.
Your client will talk?
Not on your terms.
What do you want?
An s-visa.
No.
What do-- TRENT HAAGA:
All right.
"No, let's get smoking."
Let's have him go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Can we come back tomorrow?
TRENT HAAGA:
Here we go.
Look at this.
Look at this here.
[Whimpering]
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Grunting]
INTERVIEWER:
Damn.
[Chatter]
OK.
Here's what's happening right now.
We are locked with camera.
The stuntman is prepping.
"OK, we need some nice, respectful silence"
While we do this work.
And then we're gonna light him on fire.
[Whistle] Safety guy up here.
INTERVIEWER:
What do you think about this next stunt?
"Every time I've done these, they've been really horrible,"
So-- INTERVIEWER:
They have?
TRENT HAAGA:
"Yeah, I'm not really optimistic."
"But, you know, we'll see."
Want to make a dollar bet?
We'll make a dollar bet.
INTERVIEWER:
"OK, I'll make you a dollar."
All right.
I'll make a dollar bet saying that this sucks.

- I'm a very famous racecar!
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?
"Yes, I'm a real racecar."
What do you think?
Look at me.
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes!
Yes!
I must scream it to the world!
My excitement from the top of someplace very high!
- Do you know many Ferraris?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
Is that what I think it is?
Customers.
Customers!
"Customers, everyone!"
Customers!
- OK!
- Customers?
- I don't know.
It was kind of nice having a roommate.
Sushi?
I hope you have a better plan than that.
It's all about misdirection.
I don't wanna show my hand too early.
"Well, the two of you have had enough misdirection."
"Trust me, show your hand."
"Move your toes, Trina."
Good.
- O-neg's here.
- Put it right on the infuser.
"Trina, do you remember anything?"
They started shooting.
They just started shooting.
Threading the catheter.
Wire back.
- What'd she say?
- Hook me up.
- Ten blade.
"- Trina, how many of them were there?"
"Two, in an SUV."
I saw them drive up.
- Another 50 of fent.
- Knife back.
- Curved Kelly.
- I might have seen them getting away.
Anything more specific?
"It was a 4x4, gold or tan maybe."
It looked pretty new.
Anything about the men?
Height?
- Yeah.
"No, you don't."
'Cause I just made it up.
"Don't you want a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?"
No.
You live there?
Cool.
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
"Next year, maybe."
"- Yeah, right."
- I am.
"My sister's gonna get a loft apartment, and she said I could live with her."
She won't even letyou sit in her car.
- Can we come in?
"- Yeah, can we come in?"
We'll be good.
"Go eat it outside, Robby."
Okay!
I just need to put on my jacket.
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.
My dad sleeps there.
"He'll be home, like, any second."
"We're each going to do it, and you have to tell us what the difference is."
"Like, how it feels different when she does it from when I do it."
Exactly.
"Thank you, Rebecca."
"You're welcome, Heather."
- But first we need a towel and-
- And a washcloth.
Right.
A wet washcloth and a dry washcloth.

- No.
No.
It's...
It's not my blood.
It's...
It's David Bentley's.
He's dead.
Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"We'll get you in the car, all right?"
"Take her to the station, OK?"
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
"Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?"
No doubt the same as mine.
That you were mad.
She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
"Kath, you can't give up."
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
"It's not giving up, accepting your limitations."
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.
Funeral's tomorrow.
So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.
"You're gonna win this shit, man, the cat's in the bag."
"I heard about Robert Ramirez, you put some kid in the hospital yesterday, dude."
"He wasn't in the hospital but, I think he's messed up pretty bad."
They took Robbie in handcuffs.
-Shit.
'You seen it?
Have you seen Wes lately?
Nope.
"You got this, man."
You'll win the whole race.
I have to.
[Door shut].
(Hollis) You've seen my belt?
-No.
Dam.
[Searching drawers].
Found that nice tie mom got you?
"Yes, it's right here."
I don't know how to tie it.
She always did for me.
-	 Know .
Come here.
Lift up your chin.
Here you go.
Here.
It's good.

[Door].
Come on.
Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
Voilà!
How on earth did you manage that?
"Garden centre, piece of cake."
- Perfect!
- Thank you!
Look at Naj.
Never seen him so happy.
Maybe he'll move in with them!
"Come on, we're naming the chickens."
- Why?
- Cause no-one eats pets with names.
Got to be something that suits them.
- Nugget?
- Something nice.
Korma?
- What happened to you?
- Car crash.
Suits you.
Both.
Are you OK?
We're naming the chickens.
"You can have one, but you'll have to share."
- Otherwise Abby won't get one.
- She not back yet?
That one there.
Eagle Eye.
What do you reckon?
Look at him.
He knows exactly what's going on.
You couldn't get anything past him.
Pretty...
Pretty... every one said...
But...
The taste of people change in any moment...
What is out of fashion is thrown in the drawer and never used.
Hey...
Am I Pretty?
What a soft feeling!
Although it's a little worn out
It's ok!
I'll borrow them!
Beautiful.
I'm just a traveler passing by.
Lost my way under the rain.
It's seems I entered your house without permission.
I'm sorry.
Will you let me go out soon?
That's a very nasty smell.
Even here it's all battered.
Up to be thrown in the dump indeed.
"But, before that..."
I won't forget...
"Before becoming useless, were wonderfully useful to people..."
Good work.

Do you need one?
"- Yes, maybe."
- We have many.

Let's go.
I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?
Why?
It's too quiet here.
Don't think I'll be able to write in this lonely place.
Makes sense.

- Sure.
Over there.
- Hello.

"It's 2,400 Won, sir."
Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
Brought you something.
- Is it chocolate?
- No.
"Oh, wait... it is chocolate."
How's she doing?
"Couple more hours, and she should be out of the woods."
Mel...
I don't think you should come to Dallas.
I said I was scared.
I didn't say I didn't want to go.
"I know, but..."
You're getting cold feet.
- No my feet are fine...
- Liar.
I think you're going for the wrong reason.
Is this your thing?
Thrill of the chase and then lose interest?
I'm the bad boyfriend you want to make happy.
"- Peter, what the hell?"
- And you don't even know it.
- I'm going to Dallas.
- I don't think you should.
Tough!
"You made your bed, you're gonna sleep in it... with me."
I saw you kissing Jerry.
- That wasn't...
I wasn't kissing...
- Looked like you were.
He was kissing me.
- I actually came up here to see a patient.
- The jackass?
- Don't...
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.

Come on.
They've checked the entire floor.
There's no one in there.
"No body, nothing."

Got upset with him.
Locked her in her room.

- Good.
He was adopted by a Russian family.

Why?
I've got money I can lend you.
Why?
Things are fine here.
You sent all the guys off.
Now we're short tonight.
We've got a first-class replacement.

I see.
Mr. Peep Peep.
A most respectable man... who'll soon be chirping a different tune.
Let's move out to the suburbs.

I just look at tax forms and I'm lost.

He wants Franz to stop by.
Well?

Come on.
"Thanks, Sonny."
"Forget it, man."
That's what I'm here for.
"Hey, I don't want to see you guys in here again."
"Yeah, we love you, too."
"Forget it, Annie."
You don't wanna be in the music business.
It's a jungle.

I agree.

I'll have my agent call you.
Sometimes it helps them if you pat them on the fanny.
"Oh, yeah?"
Thanks.
You got a baby?
"Well, in a manner of speaking."
His name's Noogie and I'm married to him.
"Yeah, space, totally."
I know.
"- Hey, do you know where Ryan is?"
"- 'Cause we had fun last night, and I thought just maybe..."
- Ryan's actually at school doing

He's kind of a dork now.
Thanks.

I don't need to be supervised.
I'm supervising her.
I'm afraid she might kill you.

About yesterday.
- So that's it?
No second thoughts?
You're not going to change your mind?

Does Julie know that?

When can we expect to see you back at the screen Mr.Hilliard?
When indeed.
"Well, apparently Baker films have a done post-script in the works."
Hm?
"Apparently, you will be in here."
They want a title.
We haven't started bloody writing it yet.
And they are asking about locations.
Or start casting yet too?
Don't tempt me.
About a beach twins.
That's all you're getting.
Try Devon.
Or Dunkirk.
You can go scam-tit.
Personally.
Hm?
Her.
Seconded here to smile on us.
You tell her nothing.
Understand?
All the every government department and wives sticking their womb.
Desk.
We were playing!
I don't care.
Dad lets us play.
I don't care what your dad does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- So start already.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.
-Can I turn on the light?
-No.
I put it in here to keep it fresh.
Can we leave this open to get some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It was in September.
I missed it.
I left him with Mama before he was two years old.
That means I've missed four birthdays so we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about....
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?
You should have some of our baby's cake--
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
"Damn it, I told you I didn't want any."
-Do you want this?
-What are you doing?
-This is what you want.
-Cut it out.
"Cut it out, goddamn it!"
Why did you ever fuck with me?
"The drunkard has tattled, has he?"
Not him.
Producer Ranbir Kapoor told me his.
"Does he know about it, too?"
Of course.
It'll be out in the newspapers tomorrow.
"In the newspapers, too?"
Yes.
I've sent the news!
You're not an assistant director anymore.
You've been promoted.
Jaiprakash Paswan is now an independent choreographer!
What a cold reaction!
No!
It means the same!
Won't you reward me for the good news I've brought?
What do you want?
Don't you remember?
No!
This won't do!
What if someone sees us?
You mean aunty?
Yes.
That's how you hurt your own feet!
So let's go...
Okay...
"I mean, I've got to go to the loo!"
But aunty's using it now.
I'll go after she comes out.
I have a lot to do!
When must I come again?
When I'm not around
Ted Carter?
- No.
"- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!"
I'm not lying to you.
"Doc, help me."
I need your help.
"What do you mean by ""help""?"
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.
There's nothing I can give you.
Tell me who's responsible.
I can help you that way.
You can get married.
He's already married.
Then he'll have to take care of you and provide for the baby.
Who is it?
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!
"I've done a lot of things, but I've never broken a law."
What you're asking me to do is break the law of man and God.
"Now, tell me, who is the man?"
"Selena, tell me who he is."
Who is he?
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather!
It's Lucas!
"Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink."

But when did you arrive?
I said I'm going out.
Okay?
Why have you locked that aunt in?
Chachi's gone out.
Impossible!
I just saw her coming up the stairs!
"This thing about in and out is a long story, Haribhai."
When aunt went upstairs...
"you saw her, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see when I went upstairs.
How could I see myself?
If I told them everything they'd never let me go out.
Baby... come on.
"Simon, we've got to talk."
"Simon, look at me!"

"- Just go, OK?"
It was only porn.
It didn't mean anything.
I did it for us.

What... what is happening in here?
"We wanted to say ""thank you,"" so we cooked for you."
[Laughs]
And at what ungodly temperature did we cook these eggs?
"Um, the temperature you cook eggs at... high."
"Ah, yeah, really hot."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, that is not cooking, Nate."
That is an egg-secution. [Chuckles]
"- Hey, before we leave..."
"If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age..."
I'm not willing take that risk.
You've shitting me right?
I've known you too long.
Thank you.
There's a flight at 7.30 am.
"- You got a hotel here, right?"
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up first thing.
"We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me."
We're gonna gat all this squared away.
This ***.
Where I am?
"You are where you need to be, honey."
"You don't have to this, Chase."
This is the only way to ensure the project success.
What project?
What are you talking about?
What is he doing?
Chase?
It's ok.
Don't worry about what he's doing.
What is that?
What is he doing?
Marcus?
Marcus?
It's just an experiment.
But one I'm sure will work.
Ready.
"You're sure about this, Chase?"
I've nothing but faith in you.
Chase?
What is Cock or Balls?
"It's like Rock paper scissors, except you stand back-to-back, unzip your fly, pull out a little bit of skin, and the other guy has to guess whether he's looking at your cock or your balls."
Best two-out-of-three wins.
Somebody wins?
[Eddie] [groans] I'll go first.
[clears throat]
"If I win, you gotta face Cassie."
"Okay, and if I win, you shut the fuck up about that book."
Deal.
"Wait, y'all actually about to play this shit?"
No peeking.
No need.
I can draw a courtroom sketch of his dick.
"All right, ready?"
"Yeah, did you find it?"
"Three, two, one."
- Balls.
- Fuck!
Every time.
[Ron's zipper opens]
- You all right back there?
- Yep.
Whew!
Okay.
♪ funky rock music ♪
What do you think of that?
"Yeah, drink it in."
Why are you so fucking close?
Balls.
- Cock.
- [Adam] Wow.
Bullshit!
I love music.
I like all kinds of music.
"Maybe he'll talk to you now, I think."
Prop him up in the chair f acing the wall.
I can't bear the sight of your handiwork.
"And don't put that thing away, in case."
In case there's more music?
"There he is, all tuned up f or you."
That's better.
"You're a stubborn man, Mr. Murdock."
"Your whole attitude, I find thoroughly aggravating."
What time is it?
That seems a little beside the point.
"It happens to be 10:45, or thereabouts."
"You're licked, Martinelli."
"Quarter to 11, manager, Hotel Southern will phone me here."
- Don't f all f or that.
- Shut up.
"Yes, Mr. Murdock?"
Do go on.
I'm interested.
He's just making with the mouth.
"Wrong, as usual."
Yes?
"-That, mostly."
"It's been pretty bad, Doc."
Where's Jim;
-Waiting at the hotel.
-Waiting;
To take the children home after you've seen them.
Oh.
Did he mind about my seeing them;
I could use good some employees.
They don't challenge you at all in this hotel.
How much?
"Three Euros an hour, plus tips."
"Three Euros, fixed?"
Fixed.
Welcome!
"Nora, you've made the right decision."
I hope that in the next few years...
"Viktor, that's enough."
... we'll lay the groundwork for a great program.
Here's to a fruitful cooperation.
- Harmann.
That's you.
"Yes, but please don't interrupt!"
There's more.
Can I choose now?
Pop culture.
It crashed.
"So tell me, I heard you were politically active?"
Do you still want to see the rest?
Yes.
That'll be a bit difficult  without hands.
I'm listening.

"- It's me, Cloudy."
Open the door.
I can't.
"- What do you mean, you can't?"
You all right?
"- Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
What happened?
That crazy kid.
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
- Where's the keys?
- Over there.
Hi there.
Anybody hurt in this wreck?
I thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
Your scrapbook is like you.
- A mess.
"- Give me my pants, will you?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds.
Mulderig and Klein.
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys,... ..and they can get all they want from Uncle Sap."
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"

"Look, Terry..."
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
I know we're late.
"We're on our way,"
"I don't know what's going on, I can't get a cab."
"Okay, we're on our way, I'm sorry."
Bye.
"In my wallet there's a secret number for a taxi,"
I always get one through them.
Don't forget the text.
And take my binder from the desk.
"Too tight, too tight."
You're pulling it too hard.
Do it yourself.
Goni.
Gonki.
Help me.
"It's my fault, I'm sorry."
Is everyone here?
Of course.
Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.
"Not here, not Tel Aviv."
"Not coarse, not hot."
Graceful.
He says that it is your job to answer the tough questions.
"You owe it to me, to the marriage, to confess everything."
- Pastor Paul...
- This is where we did it.
Can you believe I brought her here?
The same place we were married?
Pastor Paul says we should confess our sins.
Let the confessing begin.
"Make a list, will you, honey?"
Cheated on Clara.
Cheated on Lisa.
Here.
Clara:
Controlling.
Go ahead.
Lisa:
She likes for me to make the decisions.
"Let""s see."
Clara spends too much money.
"Lisa""s broke, but she""s not afraid to ask for help."
She likes for a man to take care of her.
"Lisa is tiny, or petite."
Clara is a big...
- thick person.
- Fat.
You had a great body when we were married.
You just got to work out a little.
Clara has pretty eyes.
"Well, they are."
"They""re beautiful, honey."
They are.
"Lisa, her body""s fit."
Take all of it!
The monster took my shoe!
- Candy!
"- Yay, treats."
I love treats.
- Felicia.
"- Hi, Daddy."
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
"Farkle, excellent work with your teeth."
"- Fergus, my lad."
"- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy."
We're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair.
Did you see?
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"That's all right, sweetie."
Mama didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?
You don't think that someone's inside?
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
"Oh, wow."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"- Oh, man."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.
A British tar is a soaring soul
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist should be ready to a dictator...
Where did you go?
I'm cleaning up.
Where'd you get that?
From him.
Who him?
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
- Need to talk to you.
- Okay.
Why don't you take a few minutes and come to my office.
"Yeah, sure."
Mr. Milliken?
Mr. Milliken?
"Oh, my god."
Mrs. Milliken!
Come quickly!
Quickly!
Hey.
How's the hand?
It's fine.
How'd Chappelle find out?
"I don't know, it doesn't really matter."
What's going on out there?
"Almeida's going to be interrogating Nina, and I'll follow it from a feed."
"Okay, good."
Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors.
Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything.
"Agent Bauer, keep pressure here."
Sure.
Thank you.
"Jack, you're about to find something out about me that's not going to make you happy."
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
Do you mind?
I've got a daughter.
- A daughter?
- It was sprung on me a month ago.
"Her mother dropped her off, and she split."
It's a long story.
- Peachy keen.
I'm Alice.
- What can I get ya?
"- Oh, I don't know."
Let's say a  big bowl of nachos and a Jim Beam neat?
"You betcha, dark and stormy."
"Oh, and Alice, tell Mr. Malvado that Seth Gecko's here to see him."
[elevator bell dings]
"He's right over there, Mr. Malvado."
"Thank you, preciosa."
I'll have my usual.
On your feet.
Oh!
"Whoa, whoa."
"Easy there, compadre."
"Should I take my shoes off, too?"
Clean as a whistle.
Sit.
[grunts] I thought Geckos traveled in pairs.
"Oh, right."
I guess you didn't hear.
Reunion tour got cancelled.
Uh... creative differences.
You got huevos de piedra coming up in here.
[speaks Spanish]
Can I just say how much I dig this place?
"You know, the whole Merle Haggard vibe goes real nice with the Thulsa Doom accents you got goin' on."
Thank you.
It's been a way station for a thousand years.
A saloon when we were part of Mexico.
"Not like the Twister, though, huh?"
"No, more, uh, truckers than desperadoes in here."
Oh.
Hey Lola.
Yes!
Yes!
Finally!
Somebody knows Lola!
I always liked him.
All right bye.
This is awesome.
Now you can be back in the band and we can be together all the time.
Ooh.
Just one simple rule.
Just 'cause you're mushy on Miley.
Don't mean you can be huggy on Hannah.
What?
"Come on, I can't have the world thinking that Hannah steals."
A boyfriend even though she wouldn't be stealing.
Her boyfriend 'cause my boyfriend is her boyfriend.
Which brings me right back to... what?
"You're dating Miley, not Hannah."
Got it.
You just tell me which one to kiss.
This one.
Okay the two minute kissing window is now closed.
-Dad.
-Come on Mr. Stewart.
[Grunting] Look at this Jesse.
Your horoscope says.
You are dangerously close to a slow painful death.
Now come on get the TV on.
It's time for the monkey to drive.
When you ask do you wanna dance.
- How long has this statue here?
- Children.
Mike.
"When the statue distributed, gave to us."
- Causing panic?
- We have broken.
Someone attacked.
"The interesting thing about it, crying."
At least so he says come here.
Think of a miracle.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
!
"If you do heroin in the form of a pie, kururken sweat."
"I made heroin virgin, Father."
- You're not going anywhere!
- Let me go!

"First, your brother, you are now?"

Neela.
Also brought his son.
"Do you receive the goods arrived, so?"
The same conversation?
"- Oh, my protector came to visit again."
- Lazarus.
"I can see, our friend has grown even more."
With prehistoric animals.
And Nazis...
I think.
Still drawing?
Sure.
"I was published in ""Parapluie""."
I saw.
Like it?
A lot.
You know I like what you do.
They cropped it an added yellow print.
It doesn't matter.
It's good.
I have to go.
It's late.
Kremlin-Bicêtre is far.
"""Whenever painters try to cast off representation, they do so destroying painting and their survival as painters""."
Any good?
It's amazing.
Do you agree?
To some extent.
We follow our own path.
But it costs you sometimes a lot.
You can't know.
I understand.
I think I do.
I saw Christine.
And?
She didn't go her own way.
She wants a relationship.
Hence the older man.
You want a relationship?
What's that behind you?
Turn round...
"To the left, the one you touched."
Careful you don't break it.
Try to free it.
Pull it out.
Toss it up to me.
He was tall!
It's your size.
is it the left leg or the right?
It's a leg bone. lt's not a shoe.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Thank you, you're very kind... lt's very difficult reaching you."
"It was the same in Tehran, always engaged."
Yes...
We're ready.
"Yes, they're ready too..."
Everyone's ready.
"Yes, if you don't mind, when you call, you have to wait a few minutes until I drive up to higher ground."
"Yes, that very place."
"Yes, yes."
All right.
Don't mention it...
Thank you...
Good-bye.
Behzad...
Hello.
Are you well?

"When I brought the bread, I asked Mim Kharaman,"
Go!
Go!
Right behind you.
- Come on!
- Ah!
This way!
Hurry!
- Won't they search the Abbey?
- Probably.
Behind there.
Quiet.
Hurry.
- Bread.
- Thank you.
- Be safe.
- You too.
We'll move you when the search dies down.
You must go before the Abbess sees you.
Come.
This way.
- Never do that again.
- What?
You broke rank.
You took action with no plan in place.
You've never broken a rule to save someone?
- Your job is to follow my orders.
- Our job is to recruit fighters.
We got what we came for.
We got lucky.
"If you want to stay on this team, you can't be so impulsive."
- We almost lost you once.
- Is that what this is?
It's like renting' a video.
"Once you're finished with it, you just pop it back through the slot."
I've got a new baby lined up.
"Oh, aye?"
One of me own.

- Yeah.
- Aren't we?
- Mm.
Bloody hell.
Aren't you gonna congratulate us?
"Aye, yeah."
"I'll crack open a bottle of Ribena Toothkind, shall I?"
We're gonna envelope together.
How are you gonna support yourselves?
The money from two paper rounds don't go far.

- No.
I were gonna call it...
Crash Bang Wallop.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I need to be there.
"- Hiya, Moz."

Home run!
Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
Wait a minute.
Dad... what is it?
"That sweater, Zoe."
Whose sweater is that?
It's my friend's.
He lent it to me.
"""He""?"
"Oh, no."
No.
Are you hanging out with boys?
"Zoe, I've had this talk with you before."
All boys are bad.
All of them.
"Yes, Dad, yes."
Seriously?
"I gotta go, okay?"
I love you.
"- I love you, too."
- I love you.
"Bye, bye-bye."
My dad always says never judge a book by its cover.
"Take Pin, for example."
"The guy looks like he swallowed a bag of lemons... but underneath it all, he's surprisingly..."
"Surprisingly likely to be a horse thief, after all."
Sedatives.
Pin... what have you done?
Go away
Stay out of our village you slut streetwalker
Go away
We don't want to live with you anymore
Go away
"I promise you, when I get my licence you can quit and go back."
I already quit.
"Yeah, OK, but you can dance"
- and go to school can't you?
- Not really.
"Alright, but it's kind of expensive for both of us to go to school, so, you know..."
It's not gonna happen.
"Drugs, med school."
Duh.
"OK, but I can, I..."
I got this.
I can control the drugs.
Duh!
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, you'll dance, you'll put us through school,"
- and then I'll...
- Decide you're too good for me?
"It's not gonna be forever, babe."
Stop talking to me and hope I get the idea?
How 'bout I be the doctor and you be the stripper.
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.
Calm down.
"- Cool, yeah."
Right.
- OK.
"When you come back, we'll get a little more coke."
We'll get out of here.
- We'll figure all this out.
Promise.
- Yeah...
Yeah.
As you wish.
See you in three months.
Then.
Yes.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Kevin.
Hello.
Hello.
I apologize for this morning.
You weren't so formal this morning.
I shouldn't have said all that.
What?
- Everything I said.
No.
It was...
A learning experience.
Do you always judge people like that.
from the start?
In five minutes.
You understand it all?
It's more complicated than that.
Sometimes.
I talk to someone.
and feel as if I were inside them.
watching them from inside.
As if there was a bond between us.
You didn't expect me to call?
No.
You said you were suspicious of me.
that you were afraid to call.
I had good reasons to be suspicious.
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
"Go, go."
"- Keith, Keith."
Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.
"Go, go, move, move."
Rebecca.
"Rebecca, can you hear me?"
Can anyone hear me?
!
Previously on 24...
"Six months ago, U.S. Special Forces launched an assault on the compound of Ibrahim Bin-Khalid, killing him and eight members of his terrorist organization."
Bin-Khalid's people found us.
Where is it?
"A strongbox that belongs to Sheik Bin-Khalid, taken from his compound the night your squad came and killed him."
Carter?
I get 22 in hand after TDS.
"Sairu, can we talk later?"
"What happened, lady-killer?"
Got scared?
Yeah?
- Look carefully.
- At what?
"Nose, it's like mom."
"Smile, it's like dad's I think."
"I'm an awesome combination, yeah?"
Yeah?
Absolutely awesome.
"Wait, uncle is staring at me."
"Don't worry, uncle."
I'll handle your defective piece with utmost care.
Okay?
"I have the patent for the helicopter,"
I did the chief scout for five years
And I can stand under water for three minutes.

"Strength, enough with the suffering of Belgium."
Let's go.
"Mr. Lloyd, just wait."
Let's go.
"What do you think, Ludovic?"
Do you have any suggestions?
"No, that's fine, sire."
Link heaven to the present situation of our country...
It's a good comparison.
It's not too much...
How are you saying that?
Go on?
- Sure.
"Louise, who's the lucky one?"
- Sorry?
The ring.
"If you really want to know it, it's Pierre-Armand."
Let me guess.
"French and you've known studying law, right?"
Did you dig into my past?
"- It's all online, baby."
Tell me about Pierre-Antoine.
- Pierre-Armand.
"And I'm not his treasure, Mr. Loyd."
- Call me Duncan.
Me dia.
"Hey, stop."
We have to go to Sofia.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
"No, there wasn't."
There wasn't any hesitation at all.
PAIGE:
You just did it again.
That was a pause.
DEVON:
I did not pause.
You must be Beth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heard a lot about you from Paige.
Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
"Oh, yeah?"
So you must be:

"- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
- A what?
- A Wiccan.
Wiccan?
- Male witch.
- Right.
So I also have a magical name.
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
But I didn't know if that would fit on the card.
Love that.
I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
You have to see the view.
Join this road.
"Gentlemen, this is our research department."
We are proud of what we gained through research.

But it is the latest version.
"We have what we need, thanks."
Shall we proceed?
-Yes.
OK.
"Thus, it is so ..."
It's so disrespectful.
"Yes, it must have been a shock."
Where is Lars?
I need to call him.
"No, wait a minute."
"Eva, listen to me."
PWG is the only card we have.
"In a few days the deal is done, and so you'll never have to see him again."
-What do you mean?
-Drag Back.
Hear what they have to say
He will not getting buy a single share.
-So You'd rather go bankrupt?
'Cause there's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
Miss Elizabeth Dollon.
Ah!
Let her in.
She comes from Switzerland.
"Sir, where is my brother?"
"Miss, I beg you, rest easy."
He was arrested but it probably was a mistake.
"I know, but it is terrible."
"You know, Miss, what would be truly terrible is that he was really guilty."
Why did you not free him?
He has therefore not been able to defend himself?
"On the contrary, Miss."
H defended himself.
And where is he now?
Can I see him?
Listen...
I would rather...
I mean...
I fear that seeing him
You're hiding something.
"I want to see him, you hear me?"
"He's dead, isn't he?"
"Alas, Mss."
"No, it is not possible."
This is not true.
He was killed?
"Listen, lead me to him."
You can not refuse me.
It's too horrible.
"I beg you, calm down."
I'll take you to your brother.
Your brother was innocent.
Terminated.

Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.
You want to do?
Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.

Jimmy you don't understand anything.
What I don't understand anything is why anybody would want to take your picture.
That's what I don't understand.
You're just a freak.
A weirdo.
Behind your back everybody laughs.
They call you chicken woman.
That's why you look just like her.
Such a sweet point.
"Don't step on that shoe, we'll have to pay for it."
C'mon!
C'mon!
One day the chicken woman had chicks.
"And everybody stepped on, cause they were so ugly..."
Don't talk to her like that.
We still have two rolls of film.
Old Mac Donald had a farm E...

I heard that Hybra Tech is sponsoring one of the monster trucks for the big rally next week.
Really?
I didn't know that.
I was wondering if you can score some tickets for me and Zeke?
Or not.
Becky!
Hi Julian!
Look out!
"Beck, are you alright?"
"Grap my bag, I'll get your bike."
How many bikes is it this month?
"I don't know, four?"
Hi Becky.
How are you doing?
"Oh, I am doing fine."
How are you?
Hi Guys!
Hi Katie.
Hi Baby.
What's wrong?
No kiss for the former-boyfriend?
You smell like farm wather.
"I got it, calm down."
I take it as he's not handling the break-up to well?
No.
Hi Guys!
Are you going to check out my gymnastics today?
"Oh yeah, bet you look real good bent over the bar."
Up your!
"Name the time, You got 4 more years to get a piece of this solid man."
What did he mean?
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
"Hey, I wanna meet him."""
"And Kat's like, ""All right, I'll go introduce you."
"Come on."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- I never met him either.
Andy was talking to somebody and then Kat goes:
"- ""Andy, this is Ari."""
"- Oh, man, that is so funny."
- Great.
- I couldn't help it.
"This is at The Box, which is an amazing space."
This was amazing.
This was...
Yes.
Yes.
- This was a really fun day.
- They did that how many times?
Like 10?
"Upwards of 10 probably, right?"
- Yeah.
- This is one of my favorite days.
"We're all, like, hanging out in there."
- My parents were here this day.
"- Yeah, your parents were there."
I love everybody's different faces.
Look at this.
Bewildered.
"This was originally slow motion, right?"
Or I guess we shot it regular.
"It was, but we realized the song wasn't long enough for us to play it in slow motion."
- Right.
"Oh, man."
- It's nothing.
- It's not nothing.
"You know, this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting."
Matt and Tyler hate each other.
You and Elena are on the outs.
I just...
I don't like it.
[SIGHS]
And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
"I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry."
Damon.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry I'm late.
"The dog ate my, uh..."
Never mind.
- What's with all the furrowed brows?
- I saw Isobel last night.
Isobel's here?
In town?
- You're late.
JOHN:
Didn't realize I was on a schedule.
What's with the sideshow?
ISOBEL:
Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn.
And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
- He's gay?
- Not right now.
He's very good to me.
"Hey, Cherie?"
[ISOBEL SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
I'm teaching them French.
And you can count on him.
Have a wonderful trip.
"Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen."
"OK, I'll try."
Ace!
(doorbell rings)
It's open!
- I'm just about to leave for Paris.
- I know.
Camilla told me.
- I'm here for the keys.
- Keys?
Of course.
I'm really confused.
- I'd better show you around.
- Yeah.
Didn't get much of a tour the last time.
"That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours."
"You can make up a different system if you want, you and..."
Camilla.
"Jesus, Johan!"
What are you doing here?
You never called.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I lost your number.
"I tried to find it, but..."
I don't know what annoyed me most.
Him appearing from nowhere.
Again.
Or him sharing my flat with Camilla.
(traffic noises from outside)
(heavy breathing)
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.
Take care of yourself.

Think on the bright side.
At least during New Year this time you can relax at home like everyone else.
It will be a new experience for you.
"Anyway, I got to go."
I got a briefing.
Bye.
Happy holidays.
You ready to be happy for once?
From today lots of people start traveling home.
And plan to travel around here and abroad.

We both won tonight!
We both won tonight!

"Yes, this is my town."
It's not new to you.
"You've read books about it, you've seen movies."
People are always talking about New York.
"It's the most exciting city in the world, they say, the most glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest."
How old is he?
I'd say about your age.
My age?
Sit down.
But you don't understand...
Sit down!
I'm telling you all this in confidence.
He's the only hope we have of catching the killer.
The man we're after is after Hoolick.
He's after Hoolick.
"When he strikes, we'll catch him."
But we need someone to keep an eye on Wilbur every minute.
Do you mind if I tell my girl about this?
You're to tell no one.
Wilbur's life is at stake.
It's more at stake than you think.
I knew we could count on you.
We'll keep in touch with you.
Good day.
Good day.
My age?
"Hello, Mr. Miles."
Not now!
(WILBUR WHISTLING)
Wilbur?
"Oh, hello, Uncle Bob."
Did you see those men?
I saw them.
Wilbur.
What?
"When you were on the train, did you spend the whole night in Nancy's drawing room?"
Aunt Nancy's drawing room.
"Yet, you guys are going to ship him off to a group home?"
Am I the only one who gets how much that sucks?
It's okay.
Really.
Good luck with it.
It looks perfect.
Good night.
Good night.
Got a little...
Playstation.
Perhaps... are you running away?
"Go back in the house, Seth."
"Hey, hey, hey."
You can't just run away.
What are you thinking?
"What about, like, Child Services, or my dad?"
"Okay, then, wait."
"Hey, I want to come with you."
"You know what I've always wanted to do, besides sail to Tahiti."
I want to do that whole Kerouac thing...
"Hit the road, stop at diner to diner, the pancake tour of North America."
No.
Fair enough.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
"New town, get a job somewhere, save some money."
Great plan.
Sounds like you've given it a lot of thought.
You got a better idea?
"Actually, I do."
Seth...
Hey... can I talk to you?
-No worries.
You never know.
See you.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Looking for an apartment...
There is no housing.
I have no money.
You've got the documents?
No.
"Come on, get out!"
Line!
You do not have to look for here.
How long was it?
-10 Minutes.
-Just.
"In barely 10 minutes later I noticed the ad, intercepted, searched and forced him out of the neighborhood."
"I'm not ga over there look, it's over."
We can go.
-OK.
Here we go.
"Listen, it's not complicated."
"I want 4 grenades, 3 electrical detonators and 5 kg of explosives."
Explosives?
What kind?
-C4.
Got it or not?
I've got everything.
But it will give you 5 pounds?
You want to breathe the air of Paris?
You are right.
Better that nothing not talking.
"I guess that would've been structural letdown, huh?"
You know this place?
Yeah. it's a fleabag hotel.

Thanks.
- I'll wait here for you.
- Thank you for your help.
Walt.
We're not done yet.
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.
Sign.
"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.
It's a birthday party.
I'll wait.
It's okay.
"Just tell me anytime, I just wanted to give it to you now just in case..."
No.
No?
"I can't wait to tell you yes, I'll marry you."
Load it 300 okay?
.
Thank you!
-Just there in the other block.
-I'll ask permission first.
"-Hello, Grandma!"
"-That's why be good my dear, okay?"
"But of course Grandma, I'm being a good girl!"
-You can even ask sister...
-You're such a joker!
"Hello Grandma, of course I should still be your prettiest and your favorite granddaughter!"
"Oh my, my granddaughter is really clever."
So how are you my dear?
What made you call?
"Well, there's something I'd like to ask your permission for."
I'm getting married.
Really?
Is it to your boyfriend who's a doctor?
.
"Yes Grandma, to Migs!"
Our wedding will be on June 1 0.
-Oh my I'm excited!
-You know what Grandma?
I love Migs so much.
And I know he'll take care of me.
"Come on, my dear."
I might as well get a dog or something.
When it comes to sex.
the man has to be in charge.
In every way.
"He has to take me when he wants, where he wants."
I'm just Woman.
just a sex object for this man.
And I need that.
And I like it.
You're right.
I swear...
Seriously.
How are you getting home?
- Leave your horn here.
- I'll take it.
- Leave it here.
- I'll drop it off tomorrow.
- By bus.
I promise.
- With the graveyard shift.
I'm the Fuhrer of this party.
- I'll take it with me.
"- No, leave it here."
Leave it.
You'll bust it.
- We need it.
- You guys have no sense of reality.
Of what's real.
How will you get home?
I have to open the door first.
How will you get home?
With who?
Sometimes it's just a bit monotonous.
Just a tiny bit dull.
"Hi, Claire."
"Frank, come here."
Have a look.
- Frank!
- Marvelous.
- Look at this.
It's a Torben Din.
- Very nice.
"- 25,000 kroner."
It's a steal.
- It is?
"- Yes, it's worth at least 30-40,000."
- I have to go help out the Gimp.
- He's putting Bodil in a home.
"- Well, good for him."
You just can't eat a thing around a mentally handicapped person.
- He's skin and bone.
- Why can't he eat?
- You can't eat around those people.
- Why not?
It turns you off food when fellow human beings are barmy.
I've never heard that before.
- You haven't?
- No.
- Mia said I was speaking for myself.
- I've never heard anyone think that.
I shagged a handicapped girl once.
I shagged a retard.
- But you can't.
A real retard?
"Madam, nobody has arrested you."
Now please go home.
"If you want to know anything about crime, ask the police."
"Very well, then."
Where would I get a Mickey Finn?
I haven't the faintest idea.
"There you are, you see?"
"Come, Cedric."
What are you waiting for?
Come along.
"Ethel, come on!"

"I haven't the faintest idea, sir."
(Creaks)
- Good evening.
- (Gasps)
Must you keep jumping out?
You seem to have jumped in.
What on earth...?
- I...
I got caught in a storm.
- It hasn't been raining.
It was raining where I was.
Cats and dogs.
"- And mud, I see."
"- Yes, I must brush that off."
"By the way, one of your girls has been telephoning."
Really?
Which one?
I mean...
What do you mean?
She had a twangy voice and refused to give her name.
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise, you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"""Snow..."
"""Beard..."
"Grace."""
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
"In the woods."""
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."""
Pine Street.
It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah, and the kicker is, it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out, not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well, let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc, give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
Eveyone used to call her her as Meena with love
Did you call her that too?
- No.
In college I was a shyster.
I was scared to talk to girls.
But this girl was vey...
"An_ay, forget it."
What use digging up the past?
Exactly.
No use.
Was she beautiful?
"Yes, she was nice."
Roundish face.
Large eyes.
Long tresses.
"Now that you mention her, I think she was quite exotic."
And so you fell for her?
"- Who, me?"
Forget it.
At the beginning I never used to look at her.
"But one day something strange happened, and..."
Forget it.
Why dig up the past?
- Right.
No use.
So you were saying...
what happened that day?
"What day... yes, that day ...it so happened..."
"ARer college, I find only Meenakshi standing at the bus-stop."
I didn't mind her.
Like me she must've come to catch a bus.
There was a silence.
- Forget him.
Ain't nobody watching you but me.
All right ?
Now show me some attitude.
"MissJohnson, we don't have time for this."
Areyou readyto continue ?
- MissJohnson !
- l'm ready.
Whoo !
Yeah !
"That's what I'm talkin'about, baby."
"Look, all due respect, ifyou don't let this girl in, you're crazy."
[ Murmuring ]
"Thankyou, sir."
Thankyou very much.
"MissJohnson, I can't say this on the record yet, but welcome toJuilliard."
[ Laughs ]
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
[ Laughs ]
"Oh, yeah, hype it up."
"Hype it up, everybody."
"Hey, I heard you got intoJuilliard."
"That's like the hottest school on the planet, right ?"
"Yeah, it's pretty good."
"Well, I know they got all these famous dance teachers and shit, but ifyou need some new moves, you know, some real flavor, you know who to call."
All right ?
All right.
- Congratulations !
- Thankyou.
Hold it.
Hold it.

You and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
Sunsets are really pretty.
Maybe we will.
Dead man walking.
Hi.
Hello.
Can I come in?
There's a front door.
I wanted to see you.
This is quicker.
What happened?
"Oh, I"
- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
Jumping off another roof?
"Kyle, I've learned my lesson."
And I'm here to learn another one.
"You said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me."
I can't.
There's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
"Oh, Amanda."
She's home?
As a surprise.
You're anxious about it.
"Your heart's beating really fast, I can tell."
"She told me, ""We need to talk. """
So?
You don't think that means anything?
Uh... it means she wants to talk to you?
Isn't that a good thing?
That's what I thought.
"No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you."
"Monica, come on."
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork is gonna bring mine.
"Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone."
She's right.
Of course not.
"Honey, get the tape."
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
"Oh, sure."
But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Oh, my."
"Come on, come on."
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's beautiful.
-It's horrible!
"-I know, I know!"
I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do?
I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys!
"You guys, look!"
-What?
Did her ass explode?
"No, the baby's out."
Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
- So let's try the other.
- That's where it has to be.
- Are you getting tired?
- No.
- All right.
[Rachel] I'm gonna start to scream soon.
I'm gonna go out and throw myself under a car.
That's the only thing I can do.
He was waiting for the doctor's call when I left.
What kind of a mother am I?
What kind of a mother am I?
I don't know where he is.
He might even be in a hospital.
I don't know.
I'm gonna start to scream at the top of my voice.
I don't care if they put me in jail.
I have to find my Freddy!
I want my Freddy!
Fred Baker.
My only child.
I'm gonna break everything.
I
- If I can't find him...
I will break everything here.
Everything.
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
Where are you?
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
[Ida] It was hanging up from the ceiling.
"He must be one of those there, on the wall."
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!
Mr. Ponsonby!
It's his arm.
Get him below.
"Hudson, King!"
Get the captain below!
The captain's been hit!
Take your orders from me!
Ready!
Oh.
"So, who's first?"
Uh...
[Chuckles]
Um... tell you what.
"Uh, why don't you let me tie you up first?"
Then how am I gonna be able to do all the terrible things that I've got planned for you?
"[Laughs] Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out."
"[Chuckling] Isn't that right, Kendall?"
Kendall...
Kendall?
Damn it.
She's gonna miss all the fun.
[Grunts]
You've been had.
That dirty little...
[Chuckles]
I'm getting tired of chasing you.
"Well, there's no rule against taking a short break."
[Laughs]
[Alarm blaring]
What the hell?
"Hey, where's your friend?"
Huh?
Castle:
Thought we had a deal.
No more double-crosses.
"Sorry, Ricky, but I am going to be the one to take those trophies in."
Castle:
"Well, good luck with that, because I'm looking for a murder weapon."
"It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that."
- You're lying.
You'll call her first thing?
Thanks.
Bye.
- Walter can't represent me on this.
- Why not?
Because it's criminal.
I don't understand why they want to talk to you.
"I told you, I don't know why."
"- Rick, I'm not the enemy."
- l'm sorry.
It's just I don't know what's happening and I suspect that Karen does.
- Karen is behind this?
- She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Miles?
"It's Rick, again."
"Uh, call me as soon as you get this."
It doesn't matter what time.
"Rick, it's okay."
"Rick, come here."
Please?
I know this is going to be okay.
I know who you are.
I know how you conduct yourself.
"Whatever these people may have done, it doesn't concern you."
"Hello, Rick?"
Hi.
Stephanie Arlyn.
I'm sorry.
We were wrapping up a deposition.
That's okay.
"- This is my associate, James Davis."
Slut?
"""Kim""?"
You have her number programmed into your cell phone?
- Who is this dirty whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- Who is this fucking whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- No.
"But you wanted to, right?"
- No!
- Bullshit.
Is she prettier than me?
- No!
- Liar!
"- No, Jen!"
"What am I supposed to do now, huh?"
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
You've ruined everything!
Will you listen to me?
Nothing happened!
Nothing?
You kissed her.
You were out with another woman all night.
I'm pregnant.
- Is that fucking nothing to you?
- Yes!
No!
How many times did you kiss her?
Don't you dare lie to me.
Several times.
"Oh, God, you make me sick!"
"But it didn't mean anything, baby."
Here!
Maybe it's a black hole.
Stop it.
It keeps you in school.
Came out of nowhere.
Swallows everything in its path.
For something that does not exist is quite impressive!
It's beautiful!
"Uncle, Ramon?"
"Children, take me home."
So this is all we are.
Food.
And we think that a lifetime without knowing the truth.
Criel Goodbye world!
Erik.
Boadicea.
Aticcus.
Ramon.
You see!
It is the main event of the females.
I'm about being thrown to the ground and crushed for thousands of Ticas.
"Rejoice Ticas, the emperor has returned!"
Ignored by thousands.
The emperor returned!
I have so much love overflows.
"-Ramon, live!"
How long!
I thought I had not left.
Ramon has twins?
There are only three.
"Children, friends."
"Friends, children."
"You're here about Ben, of course."
What about Ben?
-Ben Haverman.
"This morning, the newspaper said he had died."
"Out of the blue, it said."
That must have been our Ben.
"Bronze Lion, ex assault group member, it has to be him."
"Yes, it's Ben."
Oh God.
Out of the blue.
Was it his heart?
Are you going to the cremation?
"-No, I have to do something else."
You?
"-Well, so many people are dying."
Fantastic garden.
"-Yes, it's my pride and joy."
It takes a lot of time.
They're beautiful I've never seen them before.
Which ones exactly?
-The pink ones.
I've got those from Israel.
The children brought them for me.
Nice holiday present.
-They live there.
Have a seat.
"Yes, they're three very tough rascals."
They participate in every war.
"Syria, Jordan, Egypt, you name it."
They've got that from you.
They're real American Jews.
Very fanatical.
"""And I meant what I said, and I said what I meant."
"""An elephant faithful, 100%."""
Give me five!
"Yes, sirree."
"Hi, baby."
- Your mom smells good enough to eat.
"- What does she smell like, Daddy?"
She smells like pepperoni pizza.
Sausage.
Lots of cheesy cheese.
And a frog.
"Clara, honey... did you tell Mr. Rodriguez that we would eat the cost of his kid""s procedure?"
- Dad?
- Boo Boo!
"Hey, baby, welcome home."
My girl.
"This afternoon, I hired a new receptionist."
"J.T., take the elbows off the table, honey."
"It""s rude."
Thank you.
"- What""s her name, Daddy?"
- Rebecca Singer.
But she goes by Lisa.
She just went through a rough divorce.
"She""s completely broke."
Can you imagine?
Take your fingers out of your mouth and eat more.
"L""ll bet she""s super nice."
She just needs somebody to give her a break.
"- That""s way generous of you, Dad."
- Just try one string bean.
"You know, it felt good."
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
Forbidden!
Officer!
This wheel didn't understand ifs forbidden area!
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
Now you come down and give it to me!
I can't come down!
It's forbidden!
Go.
So I am coming in by myself to pick it up then I will go!
Are you going to come in?
!
It is forbidden.
No way!
Go.
Go.
So I would bowstring to get it.
"It's not forbidden for this rope, is it?"
Where are you from?
Bushehr_
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
Tangak!
- Where are you going?
- I am just gonna get some water.
It's out of water then
That's it.
There is no water inside it.
Trying to get into shape.
Some other shape other than hot dog or igloo.
I can't think of nothing new.
"You know, there's more than just those two shapes?"
There is?
Let's try this one.
An octagon.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Like that Chuck Norris movie?
That ain't Chuck Norris.
And it's not an octagan either.
"Hey, do Octopussy."
Like this here?
That's what I'm talking about.
There you go.
You know what?
I gotta go take a dump.
I don't know.
All these shapes just freakin' hurtin' my kidneys.
Why can't people just like me for me?
"But sadly, no one does."
Not even the president.
"He's a great guy, though."
"If I don't come up with some new shapes,"
I'm gonna lose my damn job.
He says he don't need me.
I be the first to go.
I have an idea.
That will cost you $20 dollars.
What do you want?
Shake:
Get your car washed.
"McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing."
- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...
Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.
I hope Lightning's OK.
I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.
"I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!"
Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?
"Oh, boy."
Where am I?
"- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!"
- Ah!
"Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up."
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?
- What's going on here?
Please!
- You're funny.
I like you already.
My name's Mater.
Mater?
"Yeah, like ""tuh-mater,"" but without the ""tuh""."
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?
Uh...
"No, I know your name."
Is your name Mater too?
What?
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
It's OK.
I was too drunk to worry about it.
But really.
What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy?
I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan.
"- So, what's up?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
"Well, let me think."
Just screw the brain out of me.
"So, you really moved my stuff?"
(cell phone rings)
"Yeah, two hours or something."
I just need to move this piano.
"See you, honey."
Yeah?
Yes...
"Yeah, OK."
- What are you doing?
"- Hey, OK..."
- You're sick.
Sick!
"- Hey, sorry, OK?"
(slow jazz)
"I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I..."
I just thought...
Can I come in?
"No, this is a bad idea."
I really feel bad.
"You were so good to me, and I just didn't..."
"I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me..."
"Anna, please don't!"
I don't blame you for not daring.
What the-- this isn't the-- you've got to get over here.
"This isn't the-- the camera's looking at us, right?"
This isn't the fucking hospital.
"Aw, shite."
"This-- you know, this isn't the fucking hospital."
Do it like-
- I'm a fucking failure!
I suck!
I suck!
INTERVIEWER:
"Could you do that again for the camera, Lloyd?"
[Laughter]
"Well, I'd say that."
(SLURRING) I fucking suck!
"My movie was a fu-- no, no."
[Laughter]
HEIDI SJURSEN:
I told my mom this morning
That I was gonna be making out with a chick today.
What did she say?
[Laughs] My mom's so cool.
"Like, she didn't flip."
"She was like, really?"
"Like OK, honey, have a good time."
"Yeah, have a good time."
Did everything work out yesterday
With the Sapphic love scene?
No.
"Why, what happened?"
There was a revolution.
The actress did not wish to take her clothes off.
"And, you know, and she did the first scene"
.
-I'll introduce you to my childhood best friend.
-But why will I meet her just now?
"-Because she came from Canada, she just arrived."
-Make sure she's just your best friend okay?
-Yes!
Come on!
What?
"You know, Migs and I have been playing together since we're 2 years old."
"As a matter of fact, he's my first boyfriend!"
How old was I when I answered you?
"-Around 1 6, right?"
-What 1 6?
Around 1 5 and three fourths!
-Come on.
-So you've been a couple.
Yes!
"We're childhood sweethearts, right?"
"I'm sorry, I thought Migs told you."
"No, it's okay!"
I was just surprised because he never mentioned that to me.
Haven't I told you about it?
"You know, why don't you guys tell me how you met?"
Oh!
It's like this.
"We were together in the hospital, she's a nurse there."
There it is!
Hence the uniform!
Then it's okay that you're together!
"Are you okay, Joy?"
.
Are you okay?
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
A camel!
Uh-huh.
Course this isn't really Africa.
It's the French Morocco.
"Well, it's Northern Africa."
Still seems like Las Vegas.
We're just a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert.
I don't know. ln school they call this the Dark Continent.
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.
You just wait till we get to Marrakech.
- Marrakech?
Sounds like a drink.
- Mmm. it sure does.
(Chuckles)
"(Horn Honking, Tyres Screeching)"
(Yelling ln Arabic Language)
Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
What's the matter?
(Both Speaking Arabic Language)
"Well, I sure want to thank you."
"Without your help, anything might have happened here."
"My pleasure, monsieur."
There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
Yeah.
Just what was the trouble?
Uh... your little boy accidentally pulled off his wife's veil.
- 0h.
Yeah.
- Hank!
"I want to introduce my wife, Mrs McKenna."
- How do you do?
Don't you?
Or do you just beat them until they do it?
Agreed.
But only until Casa Antigua.
Good.
We march in an hour.
We must hurry.
The French colonel will send the scouts after us at dawn.
How do you know it's a colonel?
Why not a captain?
Or a major?
Unless you watched us yesterday.
Watched us die and did nothing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
"Now, listen."
I'm in charge here.
"Not them, not Harper."
I'm in command.
You follow me.
"Speak French, Harris?"
"Oui, certainement, je parle..."
That'll do.
I want two boards and some pitch.
"Hagman, I want a lantern, a pound of gunpowder and a pound of old iron."
"Cooper, go on sentry."
"- And, Perkins..."
- Sir?
Dig a proper grave for Captain Murray.
"Yes, sir."
- Out!
- That box on the horse.
No.
But I bet you do.
Mm-hmm.
"I bet you have a big, thick pair of bifocals."
"She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues."
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit."
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
"Wait, did you steal my dream journal?"
No!
"Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for."
Bastard!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
"Look, Carly, I got to tell you something."
"I just, I don't see a future here."
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Hey... is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
"Me, too!"

"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
So?
Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
"- Come in, have a drink."
"- No, thanks."
I'm in a hurry.
You're always in a hurry!
"- Mrs Keka, a letter for you."
- Thank you.
Put it away.
It'll rain in the afternoon.
Thank you.
Mr. American!
Here it is.
From America.
"Good, good."
Do you save those things for me?
Of course I do.
I'll get to you.
"Tesla, turn it off."
What can I tell you?
He gets scared shitless when he hears this.
Pensions are finally safe!
- It really scared me.
"- Go on, have a drink."
"Tesla, I can understand your inventions, your ideas..."
"I support that, but..."
Can you tell me how many pension robberies we had here?
I've got no idea.
Of course you don't.
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Go ahead.
Not one!
Not a single robbery!
Who on earth would attack me here and steal the pensions?
- Good job.
Good job.
"Okay, let's send her for a head CT."
I'll be in Exam 2.

What's your name?

Good.
Other eye.
Yeah.
Your optic discs are perfectly normal.
- Are you sure you have glaucoma?
- My medicine must be working.
- How long have you been lightheaded?
- I wouldn't call it lightheaded.
It's more like I float.
- How long have you been floating?
- About two weeks.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
About two weeks.
- Having trouble?
- I lost Radiology.
- That's bad.
- No kidding.

"Oh, I missed you."
- Have you been fine?
"- Yes, everything is very good."
What is this?
You're so tall.
Let me have a look at you.
Let me see.
"Oh no, Pramod."
You're taller than me.
What is this?
And you got new goals and everything.
- Are you happy with that?
- Yes.
- Did you miss me?
- Much.
I want to ask you about something.
"You don't have to answer right away, because I'm staying all week."
"How would you like to come and live with me, in Denmark?"
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?

We could...
We could move it across the street if you like.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
"So, how did it go upstairs?"
Fine.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Oh, no, this is my boss."
"This is Adrian Monk, who is a hugely famous detective."

Please?
- Okay.
Thanks.
Murder!

Or murder.
It's a tough call.
Yeah.
This is a tough one.

No.

He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.

I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
"You know, in the bathroom."
Poop?
"No, of course not."
I knew it.
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.

"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...

"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.

I guess I'd better head home.

We didn't hurt anyone.
We just went for a ride.
Just killing time like we were hitch-hiking and you picked us up.
You weren't around.

"I figured he'd see some hair,come on to me, and then,you know..."
I take advice from you?
Hey.
Good morning.
Did I wake you?
No.
"No,I..."
I thought you were gone.
I was gonna make you some breakfast.
Come back to bed.
Come here.
Are you okay?
I'm in bed with the girl of my dreams.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm so glad we talked yesterday.
"I was really overwhelmed and ready to bolt, and you were just so cool and understanding."
I don't want to make the same mistakes I made last time.
You know...
"I think that I am going to have to write,like, a couple million songs about you."
"Oh,yeah?"
Is that okay?
"Or do you need me to,like,taper back?"
The boxes aren't going anywhere.

Tell Casey I'm sorry.
It sounded like I woke the baby.
He's cutting his first tooth.
Nobody sleeps.
That's a lot of blood.
It's Miranda Clark's.
She's in the hospital.
"Multiple cuts and bruises, concussion, possible skull fracture."
She have profile?
Her boyfriend does.
"Colin Blakely, The New Shadow."
"A year ago, he's bussing tables, now he gets 3 mil a picture."
So it fits the pattern of the other eight.
"Victim's high profile, young Hollywood, no forced entry, no prints."
Hmm.
Where was Mr. Blakely?
Clubbing.
Got home at dawn and found her.
They must have known he was out and got surprised by the girlfriend.
That's a big escalation.
Where's The Shadow now?
Kaiser.
He insisted on riding in the ambulance.
It happened before I got here.

The masked killer?
He must be connected with the opera troupe.
You don't have to tell me.
Just let me know if I can be of service.
No thanks.

Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm?
Fo Shou?
Yeah?
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs."
Cool.

- Subutai!
Salt!
- Is dead!
Commander!
"Commander, are you hurt?"
Where is Subutai?
Subutai!
Subutai!
Here lessor company was here for 6 years.
Computer cleaned.
There is nothing here.
- John?
Did you hear what I say?
- Yes.
TS ...
"Good job, make the brother."
"- Hey, you."
Should not be in bed.
- I could not sleep.
- Do Yorulmadın?
"- No, just can not sleep."
"OK, so how can you explain a story?"
How is this?
- Up the stairs.
"- Up the stairs, okay."
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
"A long, long time ago ..."
Very distant land ...
But so far ...
There is a little angel sleeping there ...
"I have done for yourself, John."
"Not for me, not for our daughter."
Have you done for yourself.
"Do not lie to yourself, even for a moment."
"- Hi, John."
"- Hey, Rache."
Ah ...
I made lasagna last night.
"Many, many more remained in my hand."
"If you open up, can I bring some of that."
Nice color scheme.
"Here,s another cabinet."
"No, it,s a bidet!"
How practical!
It really is.
"I,II just sit down."
- Not too sturdy.
- Sure it is.
This is great!
Did you see the tub?
Look!
Straight out of hollywood.
"It,s comfortable, with handles and everything."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, please get cleaned up and meet us in the living room."
What kind of decor do you prefer?
I Iike antiques.
"I Iike natural, ecological materials."
"AII we,ve got is modern."
"Here,s one possible layout for the living room."
Do we have to follow it?
"No, do what you Iike."
- Can we keep it?
"It,II give us ideas."
- Sure.
"Ladies and gents, our table"
Now take a peek
And the chairs of plastic
Green is so chic
"Isn,t our hi-fi cool?"
And the TV?
Where does it go?
What could that be?
She wouldn't wear anything that wasn't perfect.
It doesn't matter anymore.
[ Sobs ]
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Can I-
"- Can I, uh, drive you home or somethin'?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Spooner."
I--
I have to get out of here.
[ Sighs ]
No wonder nobody wants to touch me.
"Al, you scared me."
Scared you?
Comin' out of the coffin.
What about me?
You know how I feel about dead people.
I'm a coroner.
Yeah.
"Well, no."
"Actually, you're a mortician."
[ Chuckles ] It's 1 957.
"Uh, you're in Riven Rock, Massachusetts."
And in little towns like this sometimes they appoint the local mortician as the coroner.
This is horrible.
"Hey, I wouldn't mind sitting out this leap either."
"Well, maybe you can."
"I don't think I need you on this one, Al."
What do you mean you don't need me?
I don't need you.
What?
"On my bus, in my bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
What the hell was that?
Everyone okay?
Dirk!
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
"All right, everybody stay where you are."
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
"I'm like ""21 Jump Street."""
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
Where is it?
No way you'll ever find it.
Where is it?
!
Sam Winchester.
Still a bully.
"You, you jocks."
You popular kids.
you always thought you were better than everybody else.
"And to you, I was just Dirk the jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.
"You're right, Flynn."
I can't fix you.

You don't even want me to live here.
Do you really think it's a good idea?
Sure.
Why?
"- Why, why?"
"- Yes, why?"
- Why not?
- Why should you?
It'd be good.
We'd be together.
- But we're always arguing.
- That's not true.
Do you really like being with me?
"No, a big shiver!"
"Besides, it's starting to melt."
"- So, it's that urgent?"

What if Lella is delayed?
It would be a disaster.
Then let me handle this before it's too late.

I'm going to devour you!
- Just a moment...
let me get undressed.
- Hold still...
How long have you gone without?
Since I was born!
Where should I start?
"- Okay, well, you don't know."
Obviously you're not fans.
You're heating on me 'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.
"Not happening, chicken banger."
"Okay, I'm just going for the book, so."
"Yeah, around here, after 7:30, it's Alice in Chains or nothin'."
"Oh, now, now."
"What's your name, bud?"
"Hey, I'm Blake."
"I'm a hard rocker too, so I get it."
"And I'm married, butt pirate."
Hey.
"Hang on, buddy."
"We're all friends, here."
No need for the name calling.
"- Fuck off, Eddie Bauer!"
- You know what?
- Whoa.
- I've got this.
You can't talk to my friends that way.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
I bet I can pour this beer on your head...
Like that.
Oh!
"Hey, come on, that's a..."
That's a perfectly good Molson.

Seth Cohen says happy birthday.
Who?
She says thanks.
"Uh, look, I got to go."
Bye.
I got to go meet my friends.
My... other... friends.
"I should get back, too, and protect my cover."
"But wait, listen."
"We have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay?"
"Now, Ryan's not going to obviously, and I could get grounded, so that leaves Marissa."
I can keep a secret.
See you tomorrow.
"Me, too."
We'll fix this place up.
Cool.
"I'm telling you, Ryan, this plan is foolproof."
"Hey, Ryan!"
"Hey, Ryan, you ready?"
"Okay, the key here is not to panic."
Do you have your supplies?
"Yeah, but there are cops at your house."
"I mean, do you think it's safe?"
I'll handle Johnny Law unless...are you losing your nerve?
Meet me in the driveway.
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.
Seth.
I was going to get you.
We got to talk about Ryan.
Horton died.
"Sorry, colonel."
"-Things fall that way sometimes, Bill."
-Yeah.
Sure he ain't here;
You can look.
I....
"l shouldn't have asked that, colonel."
Good night.
Night.
"Why is Brock frightened, Sarah Beth;"
Doesn't he know Mac can get him off;
"Yes, Papa, he knows that, but he knows he can't get you off."
"The man Brock shot, he called Brock names."
"Not pretty names, either."
They'd sound awful at a trial.
Especially when they're true.
Brock thought-- He wanted to spare you something.
He can't spare me anything.
It seems none of us can spare the others anything.
"You go to bed, Sarah Beth."
I've got to find him.
I've got to get to him before he does something.
I've got to get to him before some sheriff gets him.
"He's a good boy, Sarah Beth."
"Yes, I'm glad we know how good."
"You find him, Papa."
I'll find him.
"Get your Afternoon Star right over-- Here's your change, lady."
Late Afternoon Star.
"Thank you, sir."
Over here.
That's not actually my line.
Mr. Monk said it first!
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
- Yeah.
- Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my god."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
- Really do have to.
- Sure.
- We should... we should head up.
"- Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
- Captain's probably.
- Mr. Monk.
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.
I never know what to say.
I know what to say.
I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name's on them.
I'm not gonna Deny that.
- Did you bother reading them?
"- Yes, sir, I have."
Then you know I didn't threaten anybody.
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioner some constructive criticism.
I know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
[Sighs] I'll be right there!
Who is it?
[Danny] Miss Elliot?
Yes?
Miss Karla Elliot?
Yes.
We're having wiring problems in the building.
Do you mind if I come in and check your baseboard outlets?
Are you kidding?
"7:30 at night, and you're gonna take outlet inventory?"
"Oh, well, if you're eating, I..."
I could come back later.
It won't take but a few minutes...
"No, if you're gonna crawl around the floor and count little holes in the wall, come on in and get it over with."
Come on.
Okay.
Who was that?
[Chuckles] I don't know.
He'll be gone in a minute.
There you go.
Thank you.
Do it.
That's good.
Mmm.
Ahh!
[Whispering] I love you.
I have always loved you.
[Ticking]
[Ticking Continues]
Ya haven't got a warrant.
You just want to get me in some kind of trouble.
Really nice name.
Thank you.
- Ozone Overseas.
It's a small company.
Maybe you have heard the name.
Your style of calling a big company small..
..and thus calling yourself big is great.
"You are late, Mr. Bajaj."
Umbrella Creations' conference is over.
It doesn't make any difference.
He is a victim of overconfidence.
He thinks he is going to get Umbrella Creations' order.
"Continue dreaming, Mr. Bajaj."
This time we will get the order.
Okay.
"Anyway, see you."
- Sure.
All the best.
See you.
- Bye.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
'Because she loves sex as much as I do.
Okay?

"'Sex is just an activity to you, isn't it?"

Let's utilize our Sunday.
Let's rearrange the furniture.
Actually.
"Come on, Gul."
Let's do it.
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
Yeah.
I guess it is.
Yeah.
Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my God."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
We really do have to...
"Oh, sure."
We should head up.
"Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
The Captain probably...
Mr. Monk?
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.

"I'm sure you do, Mr. O'Dwyer."
What am I gonna do with you?
You need to warn His Holiness.
Casey!
Henry?
"Sweetie, what is it?"
"Angela, is there something you need to tell me?"
I'm sorry.
I've been very selfish lately.
"I haven't really let you in, have I?"
"Henry, if you won't talk to me, if you won't tell me what's troubling you, how am I supposed...?"
You need to confess.

Hello?
St. Anthony.
He was the patron saint of...
Uh...
lost things.
I thought that was St. Jude.
"No, St. Jude is lost causes."
So how can you tell when something stops being lost and starts being a lost cause?
We're going to find Casey.
People don't just disappear.
Well...
"That's the problem, isn't it?"
She was disappearing... before she was ever lost.
Henry's illness...
"I'm trying, Anna."
"Do something about it, Harry."
For all of us.
WOMAN:
Mr and Mrs Clayton?
OK?
WOMAN:
Mr Clayton?
There's someone to see you.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
Is she OK?
Yes.
How did you know?
How long have you been following me?
Awhile.
I haven't got much time to explain.
- It's not safe for me here.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else, and he knows you have it, Harry."
- You're talking about the bracelet?
"- I know you're a good man, which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you."
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
"You're already starting to feel it, though, aren't you?"
No.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"Hi, Christo."
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.
Let her rest.
She OK?
Just OK.
Still after that van gang?
Still am.
I hear they hit again.
"Near the beltway, right?"
My only advice is:
"when you bust 'em, shoot first!"
You know anything?
I'm not a snitch.
Ask your questions elsewhere.
Who worked over Manou?
What do you mean?
Leo...
"I'm 46, I spent 1 8 years in jail."
She's the best thing that happened to me.
"Someone hurt her, I gotta know."
"If I tell you, what'll you do?"
That's up to me.
You're in trouble any time you step out of here!
"You're a hood, Christo."
With a record for armed robbery.
"If you smack your neighbor over a trifle, you go back to jail!"
Manou needs you:
"if you go down, so does she."
Screw your cop morality.
"Anyway, it's settled."
I dealt with it.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all dangerous jokes."
Do me a favor and don't write them off just yet.
I said they were dangerous.
Wonder what Vinnie's doing in a place like this?
Wonder what we're doing in a place like this.
-This is it.
-Where's our boy?
-l don't know.
-Think Vinnie had a change of heart?
"If he's a Zapatti, he has no heart."
-Let's go.
-Don't turn around.
"Marybeth, right?"
Who's this?
The deputy mayor.
Deputy mayor?
What do I need you for then?
Don't get smart.
I'm the only chance you got.
All right.
Let's go.
This a Searider?
"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a Shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.
"I wanted a Searider, but my uncle wouldn't pop for it."
Your uncle like boats?
Who?
Paulie?
Paulie wouldn't know a cleaver from a fucking cleat.
Batting cage.
I'm just throwing those two
Words out.
"If we get a batting cage, we win"
The department softball
Tournament every goddamn summer.
I guarantee it.
"Yeah, we need music."
I need a bra.
"Hey, how about a couple new"
Halligans and maybe that new saw
We were all bitchin' about the
City not getting for us
Last week?
"I feel like a million bucks,"
Man.
Thanks for that ibuprofen.
"That stuff's like a wonder drug,"
You know?
They should make you take it
Every morning.
"Vitamin I. Half an hour ago,"
I couldn't
Walk now I feel fantastic.
"Hey, Jesus."
Look at all this money.
How much is that?
2 grand.
Know what we should get?
A batting cage.
Shoot me.
"Well, come on."
Cut it out!
"What are you, his mom?"
Have a good weekend.
I brought you a CD forthe trip.
- Where's Mattia?
- He's been firing for an hour.
See you Monday.
- They're very different from us.
- That's for sure.
You can't understand them.
Chicco's sleeping!
- It's like being in Africa.
- Were you threatened?
- I'd rathernot say.
- What happened?
You have to tell me everything.
"If you show them you've got balls, they run."
"Don't be yourusuaI dare-deviI self,"
I don't want to be the widow of a hero.
And they eat anything at any time.
They drink gallons of coffee and make you drink too.
"You can't, you'II have a stroke, you can refuse."
"No, you can't."
If you refuse...
Darling!
"Daddy, don't go."
And don't be a hero!
In 300 meters turn left and take the SaIerno-Reggio CaIabria.
Fuck tha-t!
Overhere!
Come join us?
"No, thank you, an old injury..."
Look at her.
"Positively, absolutely... (Boys and girls) Undeniably..."
What?
What's the problem?
"Frankie, she's got crazy eyes."
Crazy eyes?
It's like she's having a panic attack in her eyes.
This is a day of inde... pendence for all the Munchkins and their des... cendants.
I don't know what you're talking about.
She looks fine to me.
(Chuckles)
I'm sorry.
The theater-- She is a cruel mistress.
"You understand, right?"
No.
"No, I don't understand."
"My daughter is a person with hopes and feelings, and... (Lowered voice) I was told everybody gets in."
It's true.
All the kids get in.
"However, all the kids don't necessarily stay in."
"Well, you could have put that in the flyer."
(Sighs) Please.
You don't get it.
She never makes anything.
You can't tell her this.
She'll be crushed.
"Oh, wow."
You're right.
That's why you should be the one to tell her.
(Munchkins) ♪ ding-dong!
The merry-oh ♪
"♪ sing it high, sing it low ♪"
Go away!
Go away!
- Come on...
- Just go away!
Mr. Jacob!
- Why do you have to go?
- Because I have to.
I have to go home and get some money.
"So we can buy new books, medicine and food."
And help all the others.
Do you promise to come to my birthday?
I swear.
And I'll be calling you every other day.
Okay?
"And that's not going to be a lot of times, because I'll be home in 8 days."
Perhaps you can take me there one day.
Perhaps.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

"Ooh, let's make some spicy ones."
Amy doesn't like spicy.
"Actually, she prefers no meat."
You work at a butcher shop.
Yeah.
"Okay, what about we make some hot sauce to dip them in?"
Good idea.
Remember that time...
No.
Not unless you tell me the time.
You got the fusilli stuck up your nose?
"Okay, whose idea was that?"
And Mrs. Ramsey called the fire department to get it out.
I was turning blue in the face.
I stuck it up both...
"Oh, hi."
"Oh, hi, Amy."
I didn't hear you come in.
"Hi, I take it you're Clementine?"
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
And who's this?
That's the guy I wanted you to meet.
"That's our son, John."
"Hey, John, say hi to daddy's friend Clementine."
No.
(SIGHS)
It's a great apartment.
"Thanks, yeah, we're good."
"So, how long have you been married?"
"Um, just a couple of weeks now."

"Then whatare you scared of, honey?"
"I'm notscared, Buddy."

"You know, the press, the kids, the Liberals out there."
They're outthere trying to figure out howto tearme down.

- Yes.
"You, personally?"
Yes!
"Listen, this is aboutme."
Why can'tyou understand that?
"I mean, you of all people."
It's notthe war.

"It's not Vietnam, it's Nixon."
Theywantto destroy Nixon.
"If I expose myselfjust the slightest bit, they'll tear my insides out."
You want that?
You know?
"You wantto see that, Buddy?"
It's not pretty!
"Sometimes I think that's whatyou want, Dick."
Whatthe hell are you saying?
Are you drunk?
"Jesus, you sound just like them now."
"I gotta keep fighting, Buddy, forthe country."
"These people running things, the elite!"

That must have been cute as hell.
"But yeah, she lost the lisp."
"She grew into a beautiful, smart woman."
"Look, I know what Audrey did to you."
"And as far as I can see, right now, this is your chance to get back at her."
Ahem.
Didn't you say you were gonna buy me a drink?
- Is she in?
- Of course she's in.
You got to pay her tab.
Pay the tab.
Son of a bitch.
"All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,"
- and you can be the hero.
"- Yeah, absolutely not."
"You're not coming with me, and I'm not giving you the money."
Raven.
"Raven, it's okay."
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
"You sure you're okay, Mia?"
Of course.
A little fall never hurt anyone.
"Uh, what's her name?"
The girl with the wild horse.
Her name is Zoe.
And she's our friend.
"Let's go, let's go."
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
...96 64 09.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
- Hello?
"- Marco, is that you?"
"- Yes, Benigno."
- It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.
Dr.Vega told me everything.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey, man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll try to find out.
You've got it.
Oh.
Goddamn right I have it!
Here!
"We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced ""Runaway Root Beers"" again."
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
We're a team.
What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.
It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
"Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside."
"Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!"
I'm not doing anything!
One new message.
"Frank, it's Bob Pogo."
We used to work together at Mohican...
Airways.
It's an airline... down at the airport.
"Aw, shit, you know who I am!"
Here's the thing...
- Is somebody there?
"- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!"
You don't have to bite my head off.
"I'm sorry, dear."
Don't cry.
"- So, Frank..."
Wash your hands first.
Where did that hair come from?
- Where?
- There?
That black thing.
Oh!
There's another one.
"Oh, wait."
It's the full moon!
I must be turning into the beast!
"Yeah, that moustache could do with a trim, too."
- I can see some...
- Ssh!
- Rhydian?
"- 'Listen, mate.'"
I've got a bit of a vomiting situation with my substitute parents.
They're throwing up everywhere.
Oh!
"Yeah, and I'm on bucket duty so I'm not going to be able to make it out."
"OK, well..."
"Oh, there she blows."
"Right, I've got to go."
No Rhydian?
What is it with everyone today?
Must be the full moon.
"You know, we don't have to do this."
- What?
- Stay here.
I don't care how your parents try and justify this.
It's still a cage.
It's still unnatural.
We agreed.
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
That means... we pretend that we've done nothing for two weeks.
"Put him on, I want to talk to him... I want to talk to him..."
At least give him my message.
I simply can't do that.
No.
Why do they want the material?
"No, answer me."
Why do they want the material?
We don't want to use it as a pillow.
"Yes... ln any case, that's impossible."
Yes... lt sounds as if we're guilty!
I'll contact him myself.
I'll call...
Good-bye.
"Hello, are you well?"
"- Yes, thank you."
- What do you want?
Can I have a word with Farzad?
Sohrabi?
Yes.
He's sitting an exam.
I know. lt won't take a minute.
Please call him for me.
Sohrabi!
You're wanted.
Are you well?
Yes.
Are you sitting an exam?
Yes.
is there a question that you can't answer?
"No, I know them all."
I want to apologise about this morning.
"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Gentlemen, please go check that shit out."
Freeze!
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but higher-self doesn't.
"Jesus, baby."
She was talking to the man.
Shit.
Look at this.
Dude's got memory lock on.
"Well, that's all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
You might see a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrated, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
Alright.
Now.
Can you focus only over here?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Burying you is like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan's think because...
"Henry, stop kicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.

I didn't-
- I didn't know I had it in me.
"But when duty called, I found the strength to be a hero."
"I only hope one day, both of you get a chance to know how that feels."
"Actually, I was a lifeguard one summer in high school."
"And I saved, like, 15 people from drowning."
"Well, I'm a brain surgeon, so I've saved two or three..."

"Oh, those-- those-- those are good stories, too."
"Oh, yeah, but how did you stop that guy's pants from being pulled down?"
How did you pulled that off?
"I didn't know I had it in me, but when duty called,"
I found the strength to be a hero.
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"27 vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
"- Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No.
"Thank you, Miss Givens."
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Givens?"
"Of course, I am."
I'm fine.

What?
I'm trying to sleep.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
- I'm just making conversation.
No one else in this house likes me.
At least I can talk to you.
- Especially if you need someone to talk to.

"Oh, please, I'm eating."
"So seriously, how well do you know Anna?"
I know Anna extremely well.
Uh-huh.
"Well, know that you can talk to me about anything."
I'm here to answer any questions that you have to help you in any way I can.
Why?
Because your dad would want me to.
"I'm, uh..."
I'm good.
"Uh-oh, Cherie."
You won again.
Hope I'm wearing my good underwear.
Tonight's just one blast from the past after another.

Mm.

"It's good to see you, Isobel."
Just having fun with your naughty little minion.
ISOBEL:
Mm.
How'd you find me?
I searched all the bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
"Oh, I should have known."
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
Yes.
"Hey, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?"
Here you go.
Would you like to hear
"Excuse me, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?"
Like to hear about Jesus Christ?
- Okay.
"- Thank you very much, sir."
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?
Have a great day.
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?
But what made him come back?
Won't you answer?
Nathan?
... right turn.
It doesn't recover.
We're dropping the...

"Of the 45 passengers on board, nine belonged to the same family."
All from Haiti.
So?
So they're afraid of getting fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.
"I explained to them that doesn't exist here, but they're scared, even still."
They set up a committee.
This is leading by example?
"It's not for us, stupido."
It's for the clients.
They're allowed to have pudding on their spa day.

"Yeah, yeah."

"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."

"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"I put my name in for seven songs, so I'll be back up here again."
"- Uh, yes."
- Wow.
- Instant classic.
- Wow.
- That was really scary.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I was very scared there for a minute.
"Honestly, you're like a crazy person."
"Okay, I'm not crazy."
"It's just been a crazy week, Anders."
Okay?
Okay.
Brent Hoffman died.
Who's Brent Hoffman?
He was my favorite cat.
"You... you had to put him down, huh?"
"Uh, no, no."
He was eaten by two of my other cats.
Really hard to watch.
"Hey, I really appreciate you guys coming to one of my sing-alongs finally."
- Yeah.
- It's fun.
"And as a ""thank you,"""
I've got some extra tickets to the Rihanna concert this weekend.

The guy from downtown.

"The guy who disappeared up the block from Christie, the one they made the beef on."
You know the guy I mean?
His name was Batts.
His people are driving everybody crazy looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened to him.
He came into the joint that one night and then he just disappeared.
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
"It's dirty, there's something in the..."
- Jerry.
- What?
What are you doing?
Being forced to work quickly.
"- Normally, I'd be much more charming."
- Take it back!
"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, in my life,"
- not giving that to you.
- Don't... don't...
- Don't do this.
- The situation calls for a grand gesture.
That's all I got.
"I love you, Mel."
"And not being with you, it hurts."
Every day.
"- And it's my fault, I blew it."
- Stop.
"You're right, I should stop."
Jerry this...
- ... isn't going to work.
- It could.
It did.
And then it didn't.
Keep it.
I don't want to throw it away.
OK.
"So, like, hmm, I am..."
"I'm, well..."
"My boyfriend, Luke, hi Luke, he.. he said that he... he wants me to do this, and he told me he doesn't think that I will."
"I, Stacey Ragota, hereby accept the cinnamon challenge."
OK.
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I got.
"And I really, really need your help. I really do."
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
"$3,200 for a lifetime."
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
"I don't want to do that, Henry."
Is that what you want?
"Karen, lf we stay around here we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
-You know what kind of questions they been asking him?
-l don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
- Really?
Wow!
I didn't know that.
All right then.
"Okay, let's celebrate."
"Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil."
[Spits]
[ Clears Throat ]
"Come here, Russ."
- I rather not.
"- Russ, come sit down."
"- No, no."
"- Russ, sit the fuck down!"
Okay.
"Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation."
"Oh, really?"
What's the wrinkle?
Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull.
- That ups the invoice a little.
- Is he okay?
"- No, he's dead."
- Oh!
"Oh, God."
"You know, okay."
I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.
"You know, not to mention,"
I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- It was a gift from my mother.
"She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days."
- Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks.
"- Okay, just give me -"
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"- Open up the back for me, please."
- Sure.
All right.
"Heel, bud."

Jesus.
That smell is worse than the shit it covers up.
Yeah.
- Have a good night.
- You too.

- Keep your weapons facedown.
[Gunfire In Distance]
We're SEALs.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
If you had taught him how to load that thing... there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge.
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We were doing so well.
She never even got to see my penis.
Ta-da!
Who wants some more coffee?
"Thanks, yeah."
Sure.
Let me help you.
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
"""Gals""?"
"Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
This trip to India sounds fun.
"Yeah, I think it will be."
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
A little.
They're very old-fashioned.
"Well, I wouldn't worry about it."
"It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
"Oh, God, no."
We're not there yet.
Not engaged.
Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.
You've been in there a lot tonight.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you writing a book?
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.
What's up with you?
Bernadette?
I can't do this anymore!
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
- We talked for an hour.
- Oh.
Oh.
Ah!
You've no memory of this.
- He was really drunk.
- Oh God.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
- Meredith was right about you
- No.
"- About me, about the whole thing."
- No.
Meredith was not right.
"It doesn't matter that I don't remember the specifics of what I said, because I was drunk when I said them and, you know..."
- In Vino Veritas.
- In Vino Veritas
"I mean, we know Vino Veritas is Latin for a reason."
It's just that you said some really beautiful things.
- You did.
- That's when I cried.
"I meant those things that I said, every word."
"Yeah, ok."
"Alright, we should get going."
You need to get your stuff.
It's like an hour to Sudbury or something.
You're gonna drive us?
- You asked me to.
- You asked her to.
Right.
Right.
"Hey, can we stop at a mall or something?"
"Ah, shit."
"Yeah, that's ah, that's palladium."
"Riley, you're a fucking idiot."
"Man, just say what?"
Don't talk to my crew like that.
At least he's doin' something.
Have you tried playing dead?
I gotta show you somethin'.
"Blair, I don't get it."
"I mean, there's nothing in this house."
Why would anyone keep it on lock down?
It gets worse.
Great.
"What, we gonna pay Timmy Song back with with a 200 dollar TV?"
So he's into low-budget slasher flicks.
"Really, really big special effects budgets."
Same place.
Same place.
"Ollie, I'm really scared."
Blair.
Let's get out of here.
"I was gonna say I'm really scared too, but yeah, let's get the fuck outta here."
How can Conner's inside not know this?
Hey.
"He had an inside, right?"
That's what it said in the plans.
"No, he lied on the plans."
There's no inside.
Shit.
Connor!
Shit.
It's all your fuckin' fault.
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the new janitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousy job.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What if there's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
Wait.
Hold it.
"Hey, come on."
"We're all concerned with human rights, for God's sakes."
"But the kids who want to get education have a right, too!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
Don't you understand?
"It's against your own principle, for God's sake!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids out of their school.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hold it!
Hold it!
"If you want to effect any change, you have to do it within the system."
Director:
"Ok, cut."
That's a wrap.
"I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike."
Take that and drop it by my house.
"Good night, tom."
Good night.
There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud.
"Priests, doctors, lawyers-- I've talked to them all."
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.
[Airplane flies over]
Hello?
In here.
Hi.
How did your day go?
I swear I didn't do it.
Who did this?
Brother...
Brother...
Brother...
Konda Reddy somehow knew about our people trying to escape.
They are taking away small children.
I tried to save a few.
But they found them.
Let the attrocities end with me.
You must save our men.
Let me be the last man to die.
Leave no one.
- Father...
- Kill me.
You bastard!
You came looking for your father.
Kill me now.
How dare you kill my man Cuddappah Raja?
Now kill me.
"You said he'll come as your saviour, right?"
I will kill him infront of your eyes.
and put his dead body under Gocha's feet.
"Velu, don't worry about me."
We must save these people.
Kill him.
Kill him.
He is my son Velu.
Vetri Velu.
"Konda Reddy, you think you can kill me?"
My son will surely send you to hell.
"If you are a real man, fight with him."
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
I brought you the best seafood.
It was the Mano-there he is.
Hi.
He asked me.
-It is my language.
I'm sorry.
If direction is not the feeling satisfied.
Can I get more.
"No Sven, I bet you have others more hungry than me."
I understand.
See you at dinner?
I'm kinda busy.
Kinda busy.
Even more!
She is beautiful.
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he no relation to Ramon?
You Ingracia!
"Should not scoff at someone, just because it's different."
Even someone who is having more a lot of work to save us.
-You are right.
When Sven- teach them all to fly.
It will be a rising up.
"-Erik, not ..."
-Get out of here.
-You will see.
Who dropped the fish?
"Guys, what's happening with the fish?"
Fish friends what's the problem?
The birds eat.
"Sven, you must fly on the wings of hope and ask them to help brothers emperors."
I'd love to know but ...
Previously on Fringe:
- There is more than one of everything.
OLIVIA:
Who the hell is this guy?
BROYLES:
We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern.
- Why?
What is he doing?
BROYLES:
Watching.
Observing.
- We refer to him as the Observer.
WALTER:
"We were dead, Peter."
Until someone grabbed me.
"We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met."
- You talked to him?
WALTER:
He wouldn't be any use.
He just observes.
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.
MAN:
Nice specs.
I've never seen anything like them before.
They're from somewhere far away.
I don't have any money.
"Oh, that's okay."
I'm gonna give you one of these anyway.
There.
"Oh, that's great."
Thank you.
So far you haven't shown me a thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right into next week."
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off.
"Cut it out, will ya, for Christ's sakes!"
There's nothin' goin' down.

- It's worth the half million?
- How many kilos?
- 60.
- 60 kilos...
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuffll take a seven-to-one hit on the street.
"By the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
Take what's left there with you and good night.
Uh-uh.
- Sure!
"- Clean-up time, Jocelyn."
"Jocelyn, how are you doing?"
Where have you been?
"Hi, Nate, I need to pick up Sebastian's packages."
Really?
What are his packages:
Big or small?
It's his luggage from the trip to St. Bart.
It's that stuff back there.
"It's too big for you, Jocelyn."
We'll take it up.
- Thanks.
- While you're here...
- do you think you can help us out?
- Sure.
What is it?
We found this package outside our door this morning...
But it didn't have no telephone extention or return number.
"So we took it to the 4th, Time Square, but..."
- That's Conde Nest.
- Yeah.
"It was addressed to an Andre Leon Talley, but..."
Andre Leon Talley?
Let me see this.
"I don't even know where it came from, what can I do with it?"
I'll take it.
Thanks!
"Slow down, punter foot."
This isn't Sports Ilustrated.
Look what I just found in the messenger center.
- Where did you get this?
So she is in town to kill someone.
And this is the site of her hit.
Hey.
Hey.
"I'm--look, I'm sorry."
I...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm just...
"I got a lot of stuff to do, you know?"
Can I take a rain check?
Sure.
Catch up with you later?
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay.
Bye.
Are we way off base here?
Maybe we're chasing after something that doesn't even exist.
Has anyone ever told you to stick to your first instinct?
I've heard it once or twice.
I'm sure you have.
I want 'em at least another 15 feet back from the stage.
"Officer, hi."
What's going on here?
Setting up for tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Big human rights celebration.
Joseph Dellaman's giving a speech.
The ex-political prisoner?
The rally's here.
He's giving his speech in the square.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
"IT WAS AFTER SCHOOL, WE GO INTO THE STORE,"
"AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND, UH, WHAT LITTLE CANDIES WE GONNA BUY"
WITH THESE FEW PENNIES WE HAD IN OUR POCKET.
"AND IN WALKED OUR HERO, JACKIE ROBINSON."
WE WERE STARTLED.
"AND HE PAID FOR HIS NEWSPAPERS,"
"AND HE TURNED TO WALK OUT, AND HE TURNED BACK AND SAID,"
"""WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE SOME ICE CREAM?"""
"EVERYBODY SAID, ""YES, MR. ROBINSON."""
"HE SAID, ""NO, NO, NO."
CALL ME JACKIE.
"CALL ME JACKIE."""
I WAS SO EXCITED...
MY KNEES WERE KNOCKING...
TO SEE A REAL HERO WHO LOOKED LIKE US.
WE SHUFFLED OUR FEET.
WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY ANYTHING.
"BUT HE SPOKE, YOU KNOW, GAVE US KIND OF A PEP TALK."
NOW WE SAW HIM AS SOMEONE WE COULD ALMOST TOUCH.
AND HE BECAME EVEN MORE INTENSELY OUR HERO.
[VEHICLE HORN HONKS]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
NARRATOR:
"IN MARCH OF 1948,"
JACKIE ROBINSON REPORTED TO SPRING TRAINING 25 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT.
HE ADMITTED HE WAS TOO HEAVY BUT SHRUGGED IT OFF.
"""WAIT UNTIL OPENING DAY,"" HE PROMISED."
[CHEERING]
"BUT WHEN THE SEASON BEGAN,"
ROBINSON WAS SLUGGISH ON THE BASE PATHS
AND BY MID-JUNE STILL HADN'T STOLEN A BASE.
I remember something like that.
"I like to poke Michael, because..."
You're so cute when you flinch.
When you recoil with horror.
"Poke, poke, poke."
- Here's some hotness.
- These guys are good.
- Sexy.
- Great chemistry.
"I don't know why, but these guys..."
"They, like, auditioned together, right?"
Norah!
Norah!
Norah!
"Oh, my God, Pete."
This is that crazy shot where they had like...
"They put the wall back, remember?"
"When it goes all the way around, someone was putting the wall back."
- Really?
"- Yeah, it was like a 3-D shot."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- This one was...
This was cake icing on my hand.
- It was?
- Yup.
- It looked like paint.
- Have a sweet dessert.
"- After this, you licked your fingers?"
- I licked that wall.
Check out Mike's performance here.
"Oh, well, there's a..."
What?
"Most of all, friends."
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
A man's life is not the bricks.
It's the mortar.
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
-He's a good man.
-But this is tough stuff.
This is body-bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I gotta go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface...
... justasIknew when that bullet hit that boy...
... itwouldkeeptraveling.
And find its way... ?
You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
"You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity."
Farewell.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, good riddance, ya loony!"
"""Rendezvous with Star Command."""
"-Hey, gas dude!"
-You talkin' to me?
"-Yeah, man."
Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet?
Andy!
Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
"Oh, no!"
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
-Buzz!
"Buzz, come back!"
-Go away!
No!
"Buzz, you gotta come back!"
I...
I found a spaceship!
"It's a spaceship, Buzz!"
"Come on, man, hurry up!"
"Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!"
"-Cutting Boulevard, huh?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
Which way?
"Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?"
"And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home."
About what?
Maybe we should take him to see a shrink.
"Look, honey."
"If we can just be patient,"
I think we can handle this.
We both love Mikey; right?
We're the ones that are gonna help him out.
Mom.
Mom!
( Gasping ) Mikey.
I was looking for you.
- What are you doing?
- I have something for you.
"Mikey, you have to learn to knock."
They're for being such a great mom.
Why don't you take the flowers downstairs and put them in some water while I get out; okay?
Mom.
Hmm?
"Mom, what if I..."
I'm getting cold.
"If I threw this in the bathtub, it would work just like an electric chair."
You're right.
Be a good boy and unplug it.
( Gunfire on TV )
This is so cool when they blast their way out.
- How do you know?
- I've seen it three times.
"Hi, guys."
How many dead?
"I know how much you miss your cat, so I got you a new one."
"Oh, thank you, Mick."
( Doorbell Ringing )
"Oh, they're a bunch of fucking liars."
The president is a liar.
I think there may be a problem.
Only problem is you motherfucker think I can't hear you!
"Hi, Mr. Freeman."
Unh!
Hey!
"Damn it, watch where you're going, bitch!"
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
Shit I ought to whup your big ass!
Now get the fuck out of my way!
"- Slow down, granddad!"
"- Granddad, watch out for that curb!"
Ow!
I can't find my seat belt!
"Whoa, hey, granddad, I think we should talk about your eyesight and whether it's safe to drive."
I've been driving my whole life!
I don't need to know how to see to drive!
Shut up!
"Now, what the fuck is this?"
!
I hate when people do that.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I fucking Hate it!
That was supposed to be our space!
You know what?
You know what?
!
Fuck That!
"That's our space, God damn it!"
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
"- No, I want to help you."
"Mr MacGregor, if I mentioned the name Dennis, and that I know that you're being ""B""-ed..."
"- ""B""-ed?"
"- Well, blackmailed."
"- Look, may I come in?"
- Wee Sonny MacGregor blackmailed?
- I think you're mistaken.
- You're wondering why I'm here.
"I know why you're here, friend."
"You're being ""B""-ed, too."
"- No, I'm a complete outsider."
- I wouldn't say that.
"Please, let me explain."
A young lady came to see me...
You're a lucky fellow.
"Good luck to you, sir, and good day."
- Mr MacGregor?
- Go away.
You'll regret this.
- How did he find out?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you let him talk?
He obviously wanted an ally.
The more friends we have now...
Make an ally of that idiot?
"No, thank you."
I'll rely on my bomb.
And now... for the gunpowder.
(Doorbell)
Bill!
"Oh, Bill!"
Honey!
You must have dropped it.
Thank you.
Is everything there?
Yes.
I didn't touch anything.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"Yes, but I'm going home."
"Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
Do you like dancing?
I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
Silent cinema?
Yes.
What do you do when you go out?
I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
"Yes, my lord."
She is quite important to me.
Too important.
- Master...
- Silence.
I can sense her powers growing stronger.
I would hate to think you are training your own sith... apprentice to destroy me.
Never.
My allegiance is to you and you alone.
Then you must prove it.
Eliminate her.
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!
"As you wish, my lord."
Ventress.
Split up.
Looks like I'm her favorite.
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.
You want to race?
Come on.
I'm going to need some help.
Where are you?
I'm hit!
I'm heading toward the separatist flagship.
I see you.
I've got her.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I'm surrounded.
"You have already lost the battle, child."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
No.
"One call to Dale, we're back on track."
Absolutely!
Let's do it.
What is wrong with you?
He threatened us.
Just remember that.
- It is extortion.
- Does that mean he's gotta be dead?
- We're not giving him our money.
- What money?
That worthless scrap of shit?
"Yeah, okay."
"Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer."
"- Oh, Scatter."
- Scatter!
Yeah!
He could help.
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours this whole week.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
- I have dandruff with big flakes.
I've gained two pounds!
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.
Shouting isn't helping.
"- [Woman] Hey, Gig?"
- Yeah?
There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you.
- I'll be right in.
"- Oh, great!"
Cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give an inmate fame.
Did you say that to him?
Something like that.
Strong words.
Something like that.
Strong words.
Did you mean it?
Did you mean it?
'Course I didn't.
'Course I didn't.
I was het up.
I was het up.
"You threatened to kill a man who's now missing,"
"You threatened to kill a man who's now missing, possibly dead."
possibly dead.
OK.
Where were you Friday night from 6:00 onwards?
OK.
Where were you Friday night from 6:00 onwards?
I was having a business dinner with associates at La Scala -
I was having a business dinner with associates at La Scala - it's an Italian restaurant here in town.

OK.
Can you give me some names?
OK.
Can you give me some names?
Sure.
Sure.
Malcolm Paris was there.
Malcolm Paris was there.
"Country town, Warwick."
Everybody knows everybody.
"Country town, Warwick."
It's when I'm nervous.
I used to sing that song to my children.
When they are scared.
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
"Beautiful story, now shut the fuck up."
Shit.
"Hey, hey, no, no."
They are Massalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.
Why are they running?
- That's why.
- Janjaweed.
JACOUB:
What do we do?
Depends how many there are.
Let's take one alive and find out.
- You take the wheel.
- What?
Drive right up beside him.
You son of a bitch.
Jacoub!
Get off there and translate for me.
He's going to tell us where the camp is.

Hey.
Hey!
I can't believe you guys are both here again.
Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
boss?
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.
Get the hell out of here.
boss?
- Fuck off.
Go!
You've had training.
Some.
don't wake her yet.
Let her sleep another hour.
Logan... without a doubt the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
But I don't deserve it.
Do I?
I did something.
Something unspeakable.
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.
I didn't know.
You wouldn't tell me.
So we just kept on running away from it.
I think I finally understand you.
Logan...
He's fantastic.
You said you only needed the girl!
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Your friends had every chance.
And so did you.
Nate?
Put her down.
Honey.
Will!
I will kill you honourably at dawn tomorrow.
With any weapon you prefer.
You wish to fight me?
You have stolen my lady's affections.
- I wish the chance to avenge myself.
- GEORGE:
Mallefille!
No!
"Very well, monsieur."
I will give you the opportunity.
But not the prize.
Let's go back.
This is ridiculous.
"What, run for my hole like a rabbit?"
I could never respect myself afterwards.
"Nor could you, Aurora."
I'm going to fight at dawn for the right to see another dawn.
- Eugene.
- It's too late.
He's in love.
Monsieur.
Madame.
Welcome.
The doctor is here.
These are my seconds.
The sun is rising.
Shall we go?
Please.
I wonder...
Is there by any chance a cleaner one?
- Don't hurt him.
Aim at the clouds.

"Old man Marshall, as long as you're still married to Lily, you're doing just fine."

Sorry the wings were so hot.

It wasn't that they were too hot.
It's just that I had wings earlier.
Much earlier.

And it was on early.
How early?
Mike?
"wakey, wakey."
"But then, everything changed."
Hey.
Hey.
See my show?
"Oh, I meant to watch it."
"I just got so busy with the whole ""being sound asleep"" thing."
"It took all night, eight hours down the drain."
"Oh, it's fine."
But get this:
After the broadcast...
Hi.
Are you Robin?
Yeah.
"I'm Don, your new co-host."
"Don was Don Frank, seasoned veteran of no fewer than 39 local morning news teams from all over the country."
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."
"[Man singing on radio, indistinct]"
[Humming]
[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
Pardon?
Pate maison?
Yes.
Your lunch date.
"It was with a girl, wasn't it?"
"As a matter of fact, yes, it was."
Des ecrevisses?
Oui.
Now I'm going to spoil your fun.
How dreadful of me.
"Don't tease the animals, Mrs. Brown."
You might get bitten.
Du saumon?
Oui.
"My, we're in a bad mood."
Excellent.
"Et vous aussi, monsieur?"
"Nothing for me, thanks."
Tres bien.
Merci.
Why were you and John glaring at each other when I came in?
I told him our product was 20 years out of style.
A lot of people still buy it.
Three times as many would buy furniture like this.
What's that?
Sketches of a new line of modern furniture that we're not bringing out.
May I look?
You can have them.
Are these your own ideas?
"Well, some of them."
I had a designer working on it.
"Oh, I think they're awfully good."
She could be fucking him right now.
She could be fucking him in Ojai or in a fucking sailboat for all I know.
I appreciate your candor.
I'm both embarrassed and illuminated.
You did nice work today.
Are you gonna be with us tomorrow?
- Every day.
- Indeed.
"Yeah, have you seen Ryan today?"
"Um, he's with his dad dealing with some heavy shit."
"But it's not about you, so don't sweat it."
I don't.
Goddamn right you don't.
Alicia Mendez sweats no man.
- [Chuckles]
"- Yes, ma'am."
[Music playing]
Alvey:
Nate!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
Sparring with Juan.
"No, no, you're..."
"No, no, you're not."
Come here.
I said no sparring until your head's right.
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not fine.
You're not cleared.
"You're not fucking training until you are, okay?"
Done.
But that leaves us one short to Mick Jagger's.
Van Hoogstratten.
See me in my office.
What is it?
You ok?
I'm in!
Congratulations!
"Now, let's go out the homosex."
You know...
"The tall guy, Ralph?"
What?
He's gay!
Standing in the fog always gives me strange feelings.
Yeah.
This is something that only really happens in winter.
"But, I wonder if Saho can knows this place."
Ah.
Maybe the fog isn't a good thing if you are waiting to meet someone.
Nice to meet you all.
My name is Katsuragi Saho.
She's really pretty.
I met Saho-san at her high school's culture festival.
Fumi-chan came to see us about how my club uses tarot cards.
Yeah!
She is like my teacher!
Saho-san knows so much!
I even learned how to use tarot cards!
Look!
I have my cards!
Does anyone want me to tell the future?
!
There's only one way to find out.
- What the hell am I doing here?
- Look at it as a field trip!
(Travis):
"Look, I've cooperated with you clowns."
"If you think I know anything else,"
- you're wasting your time!
- Pa?
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
"- I've just had enough of you, you lowlife piece of..."
Ah!
(Fen grunting)
(screaming and grunting)
Get off!
Get off!
(Travis):
My property and lay off!
(man):
"You can't do that, she's a human!"
- (Fen grunting)
- Don't lay your hands on her!
(stabbing sound)
(man screaming)
Come on!
Get off!
Get off!
Shh!
Shh!
- Shhh!
It's alright.
Shh-shh!
"- Are you alright, sir?"
Xiaotian has back.
Aku want to be with him tonight.
Can we watch movie tomorrow night?
I don't have time for tomorrow!
"- Then, the day after tomorrow."
- No time either.
Xiamu.
"Xiamu, it's a gift for you!"
Please take it!
"Xiamu, she has been fall in love with you for a long time!"
Consider I have taken it.
Sorry!
Is this the place?
It can't be wrong.
Why did Zhang Jingyu tell us to go for this place?
This place is not bad!
I'm scared!
Let's just go home!
It's okay!
I'm here with you.
What is going on?
Yawang!
Let go of her!
What is happening?
Run faster!
"Uncle Tang, don't beat Xiaotian anymore!"
- Stop it already!
- Get up!
Go to sport field and run 10 kilometers!
You deserve it!
"Girl who not go home in the midnight, is a bad girl."
"Xiaotian, the time has passed."
I'm in a fox's den!
So what!
"Whether I'm killed by a fox, or get rich off of their pictures, you'll never kill me, so don't call me again!"
Honey.
"I'm hanging up, you bastard."
I'm risking my life for this.
Live or die.
Turn into a fox!
"Honey, please change!"
- What?
- Turn into a fox!
- You don't change when you do this?
- No.
You're still the best!
Welcome!
Tickets are sold here!
"Hey, they didn't buy any tickets."
"Dad, what's with all these people?"
It's a sign that everything will be alright.
The cop.
Welcome.
May I help you?
I came to see a circus performance.
You came to the right place.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
"No, I don't know her."
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Who is she anyway?
A dead woman.
She was found axed near Nam Mountain here.
No le dejen mover.
Take off your clothes.
She's clean.
"Viktor Karp, I'm Regan."
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.
ETU.
I'm out.
That's why I'm here.
What happened here?
I had a baby.
The humans took it.
Why you want to see Liana?
I'm her daughter.
Liana doesn't have a daughter.
You're at home.
So I see.
I had you brought here.
We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't.
"Flynn, you got a drug problem."
No.
- No.
I got an alien problem.
"- Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team."
Team?
Right.
"'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss?"
You're using me.
You're using Regan.
God knows what you got on Briggs.
You are privy to information that is beyond classified.
"And if I don't come back and play, you're gonna contain me?"
If I have to.
Better than you posing as a Japanese!
"Damn Robin, I quit."
Gosh...
Something terribly important is missing.
What did you lose?
I lost a toothbrush!
I'm not kidding. it's an heirloom.
Passed on through the generations.
For good fortune. lt's very important.
I'm afraid I'll have to search you all.
"Right, stealing right under the Commissioner."
And Inspector Robin's nose.
It's really too much!
"I agree to a search, I'll go first."
"Yes, I approve of a search!"
No need for you.
"Dumplings, you do it!"
"Oh yes please, come!"
Not him. I meant her.
- Inspector Robin!
- Sir!
You're responsible for security tonight.
"If you don't find the toothbrush, I'll have your head!"
Yes.
- Fools!
- Yes sir!
Get away.
Salute!
- Body search!
- Yes sir!
Hurry up!
"If we can't find it, I'm done."
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you watch somebody die, slow."
Waste away to nothing.
It does things to a person.
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He-
- He wouldn't talk about her not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"We'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. MacGregor."
"Um, do you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's-"
- That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
"On my bus, in my Bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you wanna ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
[TIRES BURST]
What the hell was that?
[TIRES SQUEAL]
- Right!
And I want to buy it.
But I dont want to sell it.
Think about it!
I will give you whatever you ask for!
But I still wont agree!
Not even for 50?
Not even for 55!
60?
You dont understand!
"Look, I have told you."
70?
Who are you?
80?
Whats so special about this mansion?
I mean to say that..
90!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
If you want it so badly then I wont disappoint you!
I want to ask you one thing.
"But I hope you are not kidding, right?"
I dont do that!
"Then come with the money, I will get ready the documents!"
I have already prepared the documents!
Very good.
-You wiIIjust have to sign them!
My man is waiting outside with 90 lakh.
Just go and open the door!
Okay.
Wait a minute!
Dont hang up!
Why would he fight back for that bit of money?
"Regardless it is a robbery or murder,"
I want to find the guy who did it.
Sawadee Club
"Mr. Lin, this way please."
Enjoy your dinner here.
All these for the two of us?
All your brother's favourites.
"David, simple meals will do next time."
Don't waste food.
Yes.
Hi!
Lincoln.
Remember me?
This is Roger and Mr. Law.
Hi!
We met before.
Your brother introduced us last time.
I must have been drunk and left early.
Pity your brother has passed away.
We missed him.
Our condolences.
Thank you!
We're having boating party next week.
You brother will never miss it.
You must join us.
"Let's have fun, okay?"
I'll check my schedule and see.
Alright.
See you.
"I'll see you out, Mr. Law."
Why bother?
"Yeah, maybe ten?"
Ten?
"Yeah, me too."
"But, did you get any flowers?"
I think you know I did.
"I thought it was really sweet, and I was gonna say, if you're not busy, we could hang out this Friday?"
I think I'm free.
"Yep, yes I am."
I'm working on the bar at a local Valentine's disco thing.
"It's under-18s, so it might be a bit lame, but if you fancied keeping me company?"
A date?
"No, Will, not a date."
Just two friends hanging out.
Great.
See you Friday.
It's a date.
"No, it's not a date."
Cool.
"She said it wasn't a date, but we both knew it was."
"Before that,"
"I had to make the most of my new, pointless, shitty manual job."
Hellooooo?
"Will MacKenzie, I'm here for work experience."
"Hello, you must be Will."
"Great to meet you, I'm Jim."
This here's Wolfie and Steve.
"Hi, Jim, hi, Steve, hello, Wolf."
Wolf-ie.
"Wolfie, right, gotcha."
You'll have a right laugh.
Long as you don't mind a bit of blue talk.
"- Not a poof, are ya?"
"Finally, a letter from Naples!"
"Vito, how do you like my little angel?"
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
"To you, she's beautiful."
"For me, there's only my wife and son."
Our dear mother - ...is dead!
We'll go backstage later and take her to eat.
"Sit down, you bum!"
"Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci."
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter!
Let her go!
"Here, take all my money!"
"Vito, come on."
I know what you're thinking.
But you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
"Even my father, in the grocery store."
If he's Italian why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody to protect them.
Forget that.
Did you like my angel?
I will see.
They're closed.
Man over bullhorn:
"In the group over here,"
"I need a priest, a nun, and two students."
That's exactly what we want.
...and the camera goes around here.
Burke?
"Oh, Burke."
"Is the scene really essential, Burke?"
Would you do without it?
This damn thing doesn't make sense.
It's perfectly plain.
You're a teacher.
You don't want the building torn down.
"Come on, I can read."
"Well, what's wrong?"
"Well, why are they tearing the building down?"
Shall we summon the writer?
"He's in Paris, I believe."
Hiding?
Fucking!
"Scene 39, hotel."
Take 4.
"All right, hustle, background, and action!"
[Roar of protesters]
Girl:
We're not backing down!
Director:
"And action, Chris!"
[Feedback]
Wait a minute!
"Romeo, believing that Juliet is dead, comes back in Verone to see a last time his love."
THE MUSKETEERS OF PIG ALLEY
New York's other side.
The poor musician goes away to improve his fortune.
Later.
"The little lady meets Snapper Kid, the chief of the Musketeers."
Alone.
"The musician returning with replenished purse, ...meets the Musketeers in Pig Alley."
The musician determined to recover his stolen money.
A friend tries to cheer the little lady.
The little lady at the gangster's ball.
Fear of the big boss forces them to settle the fight outside.
The gangsters feudal war.
One good turn deserves another.
Links in the system.
YES?
DRUGSTORE.
MISS JUDITH!
PACKAGE!
IT'S A CHARGE.
"TAKE IT, POP."
"AFTER YOU GO OUT FOR DINNER, I COME BACK"
AND PERMANENT-FIX THE PLUMBING.
Judith:
FINE.
I USE MY PASS KEY.
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT NOTHING.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
"GOOD NIGHT, POP."
GOOD NIGHT!
"You're busy selling your gear, so you don't need mine."
"You've got it all wrong, mate."
"- Shh, it's fine, fine."
"Let's call the boss, see what he thinks, shall we?"
"For-for fuck's sake, Jonesy."
"Just, this shit doesn't grow on trees."
You know what it's like.
I'm on hold on your tip-off...
"Just go away, just go!"
I was just explaining about the private party.
This isn't...
Not a problem...
Get a cab
Be careful.
Why don't you join us?
I wouldn't wanna intrude.
"Maybe, uh, maybe another time."
- Guide me.
- Swivel round and rock back.
"Yeah, that's it."
Okay.
"Come inside, I insist."
"Quick, come on."
"You can do it, come on."
Just go for it!
Gem!
Fuck!
Let's see how you like it.
No!
"Gem, listen to me."
Focus.
There's a saw.
- For a job.
- You don't have a job?
- Did you see the pretty fish over there?
- Did you lose your job?
My daddy lost his job.
- Did you get a new job?
"- Yes, giving big shots to little girls."
- Mommy!
- Big shots.
There you go.
- Mrs. Riblet.
Weak and dizzy all over.
- Be still my heart.
- Smell something?
- Yeah.
"Ma'am, smoking is not permitted in the hospital."
This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.
"Oh, no, thanks."
Put that there.
"Why don't we put these away, so that we don't get busted?"
- Smells like primo stuff.
- Yeah?
"God, I miss the '60s."
- New computer?
- Yeah.
CD-ROM.
I'm connecting us up by modem to Mount Sinai.
Pooling our resources.
A couple more things.
Dr. Benton goes nuts if you're late or don't answer a page on the first beep.
He has a bad temper.
"And tell Mrs. Manicotti that I'll stop up there later, okay?"
All right.
Should I take the rest of the dog food along?
No.
I won't have to feed him till tomorrow morning
-when I get him back.
"-Oh, I see."
Okay.
"- Don't drop him now, Trix."
"-No, I won't."
"- Oh, he's a good fella."
Bye.
-Thank you.
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-All right, bye-bye."
(clears throat)
"Hiya, sweetheart."
"Hiya, Ralph."
I'll have your supper ready for you in a minute.
"Oh, don't go to any trouble."
I'm not gonna eat here.
I'll eat over at the lodge.
I got just enough time to wash up and get over there.
We got another emergency meeting.
Again?
!
"Ralph, you had an emergency meeting last night."
-So?
-So?
Do you realize you Racoons have more emergency meetings than the U.N.?
Just so happens that the Racoons have more emergencies than the U.N.
(Alice sighs)
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
This is about Kitty's social life.
I don't really want to intrude.
"Oh, trust me."
She loves to intrude.
She lives to intrude.
Nonsense.
You know what?
I love mother-daughter teams.
- It's twice as much fun.
- OK.
"Well, she loves contractors."
- Kitty.
"- Nora, I feel so confident in this,"
I'm not gonna charge you for this consultation.
Sit down.
Sit!
Great.
"OK, here's what we're gonna do."
Hey.
So this is really good.
"I would just change ""watchdog"" to ""necessary vigilance."""
Protection over fear?
It's good.
I like it.
Sit down.
I'll go over the whole thing.
"You know, actually, I..."
I kind of have to go.
Is it OK if we run through it tomorrow?
It's a personal matter.
- Oh.

I'm going to get our money.
but--
Our money?
Your choice.
Take it.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
000 looks like?
This is fucking awesome.
boys.
Our next fight's a 10-grand buy-in.
Todd?
When do I get some?
I discovered him.
This fucking guy.
How would you like to discover this?
I'm serious.
yeah?
These fights today-- these private fights man.
You want to fight in real fights-- proper fights with proper prize money and betting money.
That's how you make money in fighting.
- So when do we get some?
- I've already put the word out.
Mmm.
It's almost as if Trina has become our very own Lady Di.
"Oh, and I corrected your spelling mistakes."
Thanks.
"Shall we dance, my dear?"
We shall.
Are they?
They live together.

No.

"Well, I have to say, as far as wakes go, this one was pretty good."
Mum's was better.
"Well, Mum's didn't have nearly as much dancing."
But it did have uncle Terry standing on the balcony shouting at the neighbours like there was no God.
"My brother, the life and soul of every wake."
Wait!
You forgot me!
We thought you were...
Going home... ..where you belong.
No way.
"I mean, Dad's OK today, but tomorrow he'll be bad again."
Which one?
"No, no, no, no."
You were in your best suit.
Was I?
"Oh, yes, of course!"
"I went to the theater, of course!"
"- No, no..."
"- Yes, yes, with Winnie Atwell, yes."
Winnie Atwell?
"Well, Marjorie Atwell then, Marjorie."
I always call her Winnie because...
"well, because she looks like Winnie."
She's not black.
Black?
Churchill wasn't black.
"Look, look, look,"
I gave you £75.
You put it in there.
What do you mean by telling me you called the police?
You've done no such thing.
Your wife's just told me you're still searching the rooms.
"Well, I thought she'd called them."
You lying hound!
- Mrs. Richards...
"- Go and call them now, immediately."
"Mrs. Richards, we will, the moment we've searched..."
Right.
I shall call them myself then.
Couldn't we just wait until...
I've never seen such a place!
"All right, Mrs. Richards."
Would you like to use the office phone?
"We'll go at eight bells, same as before."
"Now, Morrison, get up on deck and warn everyone you meet."
"Wagstaffe, go and tell Dawlish."
You?
Get up aloft.
This time let's hear you cheer.
- Who's on watch?
- Ponsonby.
Where's Scott-Padget?
Where is he?
"All officers confined to their quarters, under guard by Marines."
Listen to me.
I'm warning you.
"You use that knife, and you're a dead man."
"All right, lads."
No rushing on deck.
And wait for the cheer.
"Now, take some more, sir."
You'll stand better what I've got to do.
"Now, get ready."
"Now, grab him."
Look lively!
Put your backs into it!
"All right, you."
Start on number four gun.
Hip-hip-hooray!
What's happening there?
- Leave me alone.
- Shut your mouth.
"Don't move, sir!"
"- This means your death, Vizard."
- Take him below.
- Did he tell you he went to see Marosi ?
- No.
"He's bottling it up, he's dealing with all of this on his own."
I bet he didn't tell you his girlfriend dumped him.
Hold on one second.
"Alright you lot, leave him alone."
"What's going on, Stevie ?"
Talk to me.
I don't want to take it.
I think you should kick that ball as hard as you can.
Go for it.
"Listen to me, Pru."
"He's going through a lot right now, so... promise me you'll be there if he needs you."
I promise.
"Ok, great."
Bye.
I think I have one for you.
Please...
Please...
It's all right.
I'm here to help you.
"Mark, it's me."
Listen...
I need Pru's number.
She should be in a hospital.
"No, sorry,no can do."
Hospitals require all kind of information.
"- No, you're doing great."
- She needs an internal scan.
Did she have anything on her ?
A phone or ID ?
She is yet to speak.
It's empty.
Just one bullet.
Hey!
Stop.
Ram.
Gopal.
What's his name?
Verma.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you?
What if he had fired?
If he had fired Bittoo would be dead... and Verma's son would've been hanged.
The same thing... will imply on Boss and Shiv.
I didn't get it.
Boss will kill Shiv... and he'll be foreshadowing crime.
But the Boss workforces.
I don't trust my father.
It's an old rule.
First clear the garbage then clearly record.
Hi Ankita.
Hi.
Why did you come out?
From today your outgoing...
Yeah hello.
And your phone's incoming is barred.
Go lock yourself in the room.
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.
I'll call you when it's time for the engagement... and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.
Go.
J.E.
Pepper!
Pepper!
Here we are!
Come on!
"Come on, digger!"
"Come on, there you go!"
"There you go, digger!"
Go get it!
Go get it!
Fetch!
"Fetch, digger!"
"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
It's a case you worked on when you were a copper.
"Jesse, Alan's boy."
"He's back, Dad."
Jesse's come back.
Leave her!
Dad?
Look at him.
"- Take his face away from me, please."
"- Dad, he didn't do it."
He admitted to it.
And you believe that?
Dad I know he wrote you letters.
"- I destroyed them, they gave me the creeps."
- All of them?
- Yes.
What about mom?
Did she keep any of them?
You know what?
You're gonna have to ask her that.
"What is all this, Mark?"
It was 20 years ago.
Why are you bringing all this up again?
"Here we are, one chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir."
Enjoy it.
- Disgusted or not you must have read them.
"- Yes, of course I read them."
- And?
Well you know he wanted us to meet him.
Wanted us to a... to talk.
- But of course we wouldn't entertain the idea.
- Why not?
'Coz he killed your brother.
"Okay, I'm on my way."
Josh needs my help.
Esme's stoned.
- What?
- Yeah.
He wants me to go over and give her a talk.
- Really?
- Mm.
The first thing I got into trouble with as a teenager was smoking weed.
Mmm.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
It's delicious.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
I'm glad you called.
"Guess you want me to come down pretty hard, right?"
Yeah.
She'll listen to you...
I hope.
- She's pretty stoned.
- Is she?
It's not funny.
"No, I know."
"For three, and it's good."
"He is just 3 of 13 behind the arch, and he puts up a big three to give his team a four-point lead."
This is a high-resolution S.P.E.C.T. Image of a chronic marijuana user.
"Okay, so, here you can see the decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex."
This is bad.
Oh.
"The, uh..."
"Weed, it can, uh... can trigger psychosis."
Aunt Kate?
I'll say.
Ka-chow.
You're gonna fit right in in California.
My goodness.
It looks like you've helped everybody in town.
"Yeah, everybody except one."
"- Hey, is it getting dark out?"
- What?
What'd he say?
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?
"Now, what was I supposed to do after that?"
They fixed their neon!
- Low and slow?
"- Oh, yeah, baby!"
"Just like in its heyday, right?"
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.
Shall we cruise?
"Oh, thank you, dear."
I'd love to!
"- No, no, no."
- Lizzie!
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
"Hey, Miss Sally."
May I have this cruise?
"- Of course, Mater."
- Uh-uh-uh!
"...and again and I said, ""No. "" He asked me again, and I said, ""No. """
"But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder."
"Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive. """
Oh!
Sure.
Come out!
Come out in the end.
We got them all.
Is there one left?
We can meet together now.
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
What do you want?
"My name is Jurgen Hoffman, I'm a scientist."
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.
What do you know?
I've watched through this window.
I've witnessed the deaths from over there.
I know how and why they died.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
So you tell me why they died.
What difference does it make to you?
Now.
Come with me.
Wait a minute you come to my place and you want me to leave and you don't want to tell me why?
"Ok, you have a creature, an alien creature on your roof."
Where?
I study these creatures.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?
-No.
-Let me explain.
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Help!
Help!
Please help!
Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
"And it's left-hand drive, so you're a cheapskate."
It's true!
It's never overtaken anyone.
That's what passengers are for.
His dog ate it.
She did.
A couple more I have to stick up -
"Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at."
Where's it go?
AUDIENCE:
Sub-cool?
Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?
It's a proper car.
It's fast and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.
It's like having ginger hair.
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?
MAN:
Uncool.
Uncool.
"He says it's uncool, he's kind of right."
"The thing is, it's very gender-specific."
"If you're a man, it's really uncool."
"If you're a woman, it's fantastic."
We wanna meet you.
"So it kind of goes there, as does...the same story with the Subaru."
Yeah.
Put that there.
Right in the middle with the F60.
"It's funny, it's the way of the cool wall."
"I've got one last one here, the Peugeot 206 GTI 180bhp."
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
Let me see those hands!
Ladies and gentlemen we would lik e to begin boarding Japan Airlines Flight 3 20.
he amount of time we've been away from home just to mak e our band stronger and be successful  is a lot and there's no rest.
"It's just go, go, go."
"Like, you fly from one place to another to another."
-See you.
-Bye-bye.
think we're very lucky in the fact that when we were touring this time  we get to go to a lot of different parts of the world and you come across a place you haven't been to yet. t's just always so exciting.
-Harry!
"-please, Harry!"
please!
Harry!
This is a little strange.
"This many photographers aren't allowed in the building in, Iike, england."
"Hey, Harry!"
Harry!
I'm excited.
1 D!
1 D!
1 D!
1 D!

How are you?
You okay?
Let's go.
"Bro, how crazy was that?"
I've never seen that.
That's mad.
That was crazy.
"Like, you know, all I kept thinking was, ""And this is in Japan."""
Yeah.
- Better than tits you'll ever get mate!
"All right, I'd spunk over the big ones, and they're not better than I'd get."
Bollocks.
"Here, Steve..."
- Speccy here... reckons he has better!
- Stop that.
- I have.
"- Fuck off, you're a virgin!"
- Classic virgin.
- You're wrong.
I did it last year.
With a girl I'm seeing tonight.
"Yeah, sure."
Yep!
"She's fit, she's older than me, and she goes like a porn star."
"- Oh, right!"
"- Yeah, and she's got massive titties and I..."
"Well, I... fucked her hard and all night long."
What are you and this dirty horn bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.
"Going to an under-18 disco where she works, so you won't be able to."
I could go.
- What?
- I could go.
I'm 17.
You're 17!
?
- You're 17?
"- Yeah, yeah"
- I just look older.
There's looking older and then there's that.
You look about 30!
I miss the track team.
And I miss the basketball team.
We have no time for other sports.
Lacrosse is hard enough.
Forget it.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu all of a sudden?
Are you at all interested in lacrosse?
"Showing up late, and all."
Bringing your weird friends.
You're a bit strange yourself.
"""My name Minmin."""
Can you play lacrosse?
You use this?
It's for throwing the ball.
This is no good.
You must control the ball.
Shoot at the goal.
"Oh, OK."
It's quite difficult.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey!
help!
I need help!
Hey!
"please, help me!"
What am I to do?
Task Force 7 needs more students adept in martial arts.
select a few students.
Request payment by wire.
And the other request?
We've dispatched 3 students.
Payment is complete.
- Hanna?
- Her daughter.
Are you her son?
No.
I'm just the guy who opens the door.
"Mr. Leland, this is my daughter Hanna."
- Hello.
"- Hello, Hanna."
"Oh, I forgot to get your signature on this."
Um...
It's just part of authorizing you to look at the safe deposit box.
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um...
- I won't be late.
- Okay.
What are you doing coming to the front door?
It was a better way to meet than her tripping over me behind the furnace.
"Yeah, but just knocking on the door?"
Why couldn't you ask me?
- You would have said no?
- My mom thinks you're trouble.
- You don't like her boyfriend.
- He's not her boyfriend.
He's a customer at the bank.
Some architect from Syracuse.
Really.
"What do you mean ""really""?"
He had a crappy plastic pen.
So?
So architects draw for a living.
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down.
I'm not going to test you on this.
Come on.
Teach me something.
Anything.
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.
"If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T..."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
"If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed..."
You lost me.
What does that mean?
You have to put it in context.
"- Jazz it up, find some humor in it."
- Humor in calculus?
"- Well, try telling a story."
- A story?
"Once upon a time, there was a ball."
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
"No one understands those, either."
Just kidding.
- Don't give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
"- Hi, Professor Larkin."
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
"Hey, man."
"It's all good, right?"
"Look, you get a little money in your pocket."
Nothing wrong with that.
"Just for now, right?"
Plus it's always good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent.
"Hey, what do you say you and me head down to the rec center?"
Got a pick-up rugby game going on.
"Then afterwards, maybe go get me some ribs, some corn."
Some hot chicks.
Maybe she got a friend for you.
But one of them ugly ones.
"Buck-toothed and, you know, just got the fangs."
"Got the fangs happening, huh?"
Know what?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Just give me a couple minutes to change and then we'll head on out.
"Oh, dinner's on you tonight."
You still owe me...
"I think, what is it, $19.40?"
"Oh, you're serious about that?"
So...
Yeah.
Dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.
"No, the girls will be on me."

What are you doing in my office with your butt in the air?
I was hoping for an injection.
Go to the waiting room.
This isn't an outpatient surgery!
They told me to wait here.
See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."
I'll report you to the Academic Senate and have you expelled.
"Cicchirini, calm down!"
And you... get out of here.
Out!
What about my injection?
You expect me to give you an injection?
Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?
- Me?
No.
Was it you?
"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?
"""Who is it?"" That's for me to say!"
Who is it?
Am I disturbing you?
"No, no, my dear."
Come in.
You're never disturbing.
We'd been here all night.
"June's mixed up, he's getting old, he don't see very well."
Lying son of a bitch!
I'll make him talk.
He's not gonna talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
"How are you this morning, Byron?"
Just fine.
Pretty sleepy?
"Yeah, I guess so."
Did you go stay someplace with your uncle Ronnie last night?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
"You didn't see a lady, a pretty lady?"
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
Did your uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
Yeah.
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
Okay.
"And I think you really ought to spend a night or two in jail, so you don't tell your sister."
Dale...
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
"What's going to happen to our baby, with me in jail?"
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
"It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
I wanted...
"the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what...
"recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'Cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
Hi.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
Gin is good.
Gin is good.
So... what's wrong with ya?
"I mean, other than the whole ""psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran"" thing."
Other than that?
Is... is there something other than that?
You tell me.
I'm just a chick with a drink.
No judgments.
Oh.
I get it.
You don't want to open up to me.
I know.
I'm not the touchy-feely type.
I got fired for being heartless.
Cooper apparently agrees.
Maybe he's right.
It's the baby.
He have 11 toes or something?
He's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
"He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect."
And I...
"I look at him, and I feel... nothing."
I can't... feel anything... ever since the...
"I mean, there's this pressure to be all ""mommy,"""
and I'm just...
I'm not.
I'm not ready or something.
I just...
I don't...
I don't want to deal with him.
-See you later.
I'm going to have to rent a tuxedo.
Rent a tuxedo!
"Oh, there's got to be a peasant in every outfit."
"He's never changed, has he?"
"Good old... ""Rent a tuxedo."""
"That's laughable, isn't it?"
(chuckles)
Take care.
I'll see you later.
(chuckling):
"""Rent a tuxedo."""
Who do I call about renting a tuxedo?
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Sergeant...
"uh, Mr. Bilko's room."
Long distance where?
"Roseville, Kansas?"
Fort Baxter?
"Tell them I'm not, uh..."
"All right, put them on."
"Hey, Sarge, we just called to see how you're doing."
"Hey, did you see your old squad yet?"
"Hey, what did they say when they seen you with all them stripes?"
"A master sergeant, huh?"
"They really flipped, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
Henshaw wants to say hello.
"Hey, I was next!"
"By rank, Doberman."
By rank.
In a little less than 14 minutes.
"When I was your age, I used to love school."
I remember once we had to do this time capsule...
"You know, fill it with important things"
And bury it in the backyard
So we could dig it up when we were grown.
Really?
And... and did you?
Did you dig it up?
Oh.
Moved before I could.
What a shame.
"You know, I think of it every day of my life."
You have?
"Oh, my god."
That's so many days!
"So if you look at number five in your handout,"
"Using the chunking strategy, what is the answer?"
74.
112.
Excellent...
Mostly everybody.
Here.
Let me show you.
You're thinking addition.
You need to...
I don't need your help.
I can do it myself.
"Nice job, mr."
Heck.
You get it.
"Well, now that you explained it, it's comin' pretty easy."
- I'm...
Shh!
(Whispers) I came to apologise about yesterday.
Is that the only reason you came?
"No, it isn't."
Now I've really lost Bill.
- I am going to the police.
- Please...
That's no good.
No point crying over spilt milk.
You don't understand.
It's not his money I care about.
I really love him.
"So, now I'm getting my own back on that beastly Dennis."
Just a minute.
You said you saw a file on that authoress Flora Ransom?
- Yes.
- Right!
We're going to see her.
I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman.
Excuse me.
- Have a good time.
- I am not going to have a good time!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
She's out but we are expecting her back soon.
Come in.
Thank you.
My name's Bastable.
I'm the lucky fellow she's consented to marry.
"She's a widow, you know."
This way.
"Oh, was Flora expecting you?"
"[Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push lt"" playing]"
"[Indistinct shouting, laughter]"
TRAC Y:
Get down!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
Is Liz back yet?
No.
Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
I'm sorry?
Which cat?
Oh.
I want... that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the forum, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.
[Exhales sharply]
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
"I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit, and I want to do it in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me."
I want to see that.
"[Cheers and applause] ß It's time for ""The Girlie Show"" ß"
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothing.
First team to the studio.
I gotta go.
I appr eciate your talking.
I can have that time in the 20s?
Check back with me.
"2 minutes to VTR, 2 1/2 live."
"""VTR"" -- that means a videotape record."
"That's the taped intro, then they come live to the studio 30 seconds later."
-
- J.J. -
- Isaac.
"Uh, Judith, this is Isaac Jaff ee, the managing editor."
"Uh, Isaac, this is my fiancée, Judith."
How do you do?
So nice to finally meet you.
I hope I'm not imposing.
"Judith, you ar e charming, and you'r e welcome her e whenever you like."
Thank you.
Watch out f or Isaac and the ladies.
"This is J.J. 's fiancée, Judith."
-
- Nice to meet you.
-
- Hi.
Would you give Judith a quick introduction
-- to Dan and Casey bef or e we start?
-
- Sur e.
I was thinking about what I said earlier.
About what?
About cr eating division between the show and the network.
"I said it's not good f or CSC, it's not good f or the show, it's not good f or Continental Corp,"
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the newjanitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousyjob.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What ifthere's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!
"Jeffrey, you're back."
"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...
"I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse."
That's what you called each other?
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?
Joking.
I...
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
"Oh, yes."
- Mayhew.
Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.
My real name is McGill.

"They all want a pipe-hitting member of the tribe, so to speak."
I digress.
Good things are happening.
"Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time."
"That's wonderful, yeah."
"There's still a few details to be ironed out but now that the DEA is involved I think he's looking at time served, then probation."
Where are you going this late?
To the West.
"- What, on foot in the Zone?"
- Can I see your papers?
"Well, did you have a nice New Year's?"
Your name?
"Well, what's your name, Miss?"
Karka!
Pauline Karka.
But it is... bloody.
What do you have there?
My child.
May I see it?
"Now come inside and get warm, young lady."
The Rats
- Based on the play by:
Adapted for the screen by:
- What's it about?
- Go to the police!
"Room 12, the police inspector said."
"For that you drag my child out in the freezing cold, risking it dying?"
"- Well, whatever, Mrs John."
- Don't shout at my daughter like that!
"What has happened, Miss Pauline?"
"The inspector didn't say, Mr Hassenreuter,"
- only that they are to id..idi..
Pauline...
- Identify...
"- ...her, yes."
- Pauline?
I've never heard that name.
- What am I to do there?
Saira!
You have five minutes.
Leave before this cigarette gets over.
I cannot leave.
What story will I tell our kids?
That papa got scared so he ran away?
I forgot!
This story has an armour too!
No..
No..
No..
No..
No..!
"Come on, leave this world."
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"It's time, Jilaan."
Stop it!
No!
No!
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."
Shiv!
Shiv!
Okay.
If you wouldn't have come for me...
Then what stories would you tell our kids?
Prayer.
Listen carefully.
Your mom might sometimes say that you were Karan-Arjun in your past life.
You like doing that.
"Yours, Corporal Dawes."
"You, Evans."
Gordon.
"Come on, Stubbins."
Each man check his release box.
Easy now.
Nothing worse than blokes hitting their boxes at the same time.
It sounds like the Salvation Army on a Sunday afternoon.
"You've nothing to worry about, they're smashing parachutes."
They ought to be at £60 a piece.
"Morning, Bill."
Morning.
"All right, you gentleman aloft."
We're ready.
We are ready.
He's ready.
So are we.
"Gentleman, I don't like your colour."
You look a little green.
What colour would you like?
Suppose you surprise me.
"0K, Number 0ne, a good parachuting position."
Action station Number One.
Jump when I touch you on the shoulder.
Are you ready?
Go!
There goes my first one.
Reach up high on your front left webs.
Pull down steadily now.
"Your head well forward, feet together."
"OK, hold it."
- If she hurt you...
"- No, no."
She... she didn't lay a hand on me.
"I'm fine, really, I'm just..."
I'm just tired.
Whose body am I in?
You've seen Liana.
"That's what happened to your face, isn't it?"
"Dad, tell me the truth."
"Where did this, me, come from?"
I need to know.
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.
"Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent."
Did it have a name?
The baby?
Allison.
"From the day you became Allison,"
I vowed to protect you with my life.
But...
I failed you.
No.
Yes.
We should have left.
Gone on the run.
"I'm so, so sorry."
"Dad, don't."
You did everything you could to protect me.
I always will.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying that I love you.
"As long as I'm alive, you're in danger."
- They'll use us against each other.
"A teenager has his right to get his mac on, Riley Haskell."
It's the law.
- Where's Mr Webb?
- He's sick.
"Look, I gotta go."
I'm really sorry.
The pizza was really good.
Jerk.
"And Precious, make sure you do that thing I told you to do."
- I made a mess.
"- Henri, help me out."
You grab the other side.
"Yeah, we'll just lift this up."
"- Man, I got this."
Grab that.
- You got it?
- That's better.
- Where is he?
Ate the whole box.
- He OD'd on Ding Dongs.
"- Oh, God."
- You okay?
"- We didn't have a choice, man."
- It was for his own good.
- He'll be fine by game time.
Dickie Dunn Jr.
Here with Dickie Dunn III bringing you another exciting season of junior league hockey action.
And this year's first battle is a real David and Goliath matchup.
"Yeah, Dad."
"If David were a Chihuahua, that'd be more like it."
"Yes, that's true, D-III."
It's the defending champ Ice Hounds versus Newman's upstart orphan team calling themselves the Zenovators.
Wow.
I get it.
"You are a trip, Ms. Sciuto."
"That's a good thing, right?"
(sighs)
What now?
Where is Baylor and who shot Ridgeway?
Wickes might be able to tell us if we ask nicely.
I'll ask.
I've seen your nice.
I'm going with you.
You said man-to-man.
Oh.
"Right, I'm sorry, we haven't met."
"Hi, I'm Elizabeth Brighton,"
SECNAV's public affairs officer during this time of crisis.
Wickes and I are going to form a special bond of our own.
(snickers)
GIBBS:
We think she might have a connection to whoever shot the secretary.
You know her?
(sighs)
I don't recognize her.
Did you talk to Lawrence Ridgeway?
He's dead.
He was murdered?
Murder weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's rare.
You know anyone with something like that?
(phone rings)
WICKES:
No.
- Yeah.
I loved that old house.
"- Yeah, I loved that place, too."
- I had my first kiss there.
"- Me, too."
"So what's going on, Jimmy?"
"I've just had a really bad year with the market and, it's disastrous, and it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent for the next..."
How much do you need?
No.
It's... it's a lot of money.
It's too much.
Jimmy.
It's a hundred thousand dollars.
I'll call the bank.
No.
I can't.
I can.
I'll pay you back.
But it's going to take me a couple of months.
I know where you live.
This place is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
New contractors come tomorrow.
Better get the job finished.
New contractors.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.
Pretty much.
You okay?
So the contractors start tomorrow.
Guess that means I'm gone.
One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
The Boss is being over-enthusiastic... but I'm going to use my brains.
By playing the right card at the right moment.
Daddy.
By the time he plays his cards...
Shiv and Ankita will already have their honeymoon.
I'm moron.
Hold on.
Jabbar bhai.
Dad call Jabbar bhai right now.
On the spot finish his entire family right now.
- Father's here.
- So what?
- Father's here.
- Shiv?
I told you we'll be visiting the saint's tomb one day.
And return to Benaras after that.
We'll visit the shrine today.
It's a good day today.
I'm pleased that you've been released.
And even happier... that you didn't need that goon's help for it.
Brother...
Brother come in.
No actually I couldn't do the job.
So I'm here to return Mr. Satyakant's money.
Brother come... come in.
- I'll leave.
- Please.
Please.
Brother come...
I'm going to the shrine.
Are you coming?
Yes father.
- We have our own bikes.
Fucking hell.
"Sometimes it is easy just to say ""yes""."
"Henry, catch it!"
"Oh, God."
I thought I'd lost forever Henry.
I was so scared.
I was so scared and you fell.
I thought I'd never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea.
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, please."
We can go now.
"Every year, 100000 baseball bats are sold in Russia."
"And at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives an idea of a great Russians pastime?
"This is a rare, survived bat."
Estelle.
"Would you, please, be so kind and stand up?"
No.
Or you wanna take her place?
"Estelle, your boy is quite a knight."
Sacrificing himself to keeping you alive.
Only for my dick... to kill you later.
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
"- I didn't hear a ""no""."
- Brilliant!
"Come over here, Henry."
"No way, we have a show coming up tonight."
Do the box again.
"Kids, didn't you hear me?"
We have a show tonight.
"Bye, kids."
All the best.
"Everything will be okay, my sweetie."
Give me a hug.
Barbuda loves you.
"- Bye, kids."
- Bye.
Here.
For you.
Maybe you'll need it someday.
"It's yours now, Maria."
"We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay?"
"Look out for her, Quico."
"Maria, let me go."
"Be good, sweetie."
"Bye, kids."
My ring fell into the sea and it was lost to me the waters gave me a seashell as a present for you
Come on and eat Maria.
Do you still like chocolate milk?
Yes.
So...
Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you?
But it's so pretty.
I've picked your school.
I'll take you to meet the principal.
She wants you to take a test.
But I've always studied!
In the circus?
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up.
"I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too."
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din.
What's up?
"Tonight, when everyone sleep, Din go back again."
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it.
All gold.
"Here, now."
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
"Is this satisfactory, sahib?"
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
"Go on, get something big."
Jaldi!
"Up, Annie."
"Please, Annie."
"What are you doing, Din?"
"A large tool you asked for, sahib."
"Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me."
Work for me.
"Get me out of here, Annie."
"Come on, Annie."
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.
Chopper is on the way there now.
Tell him I'll pick him up at 7.
Tell Nathan to come see me.
I'll do what I can.
Peyton?
Peyton!
- Where's Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.
Who are you?
I'm the guy who's about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.
I'm her dad.
Who are you?
Oh.
Sorry.
The front door was open and I thought...
I'm Lucas.
Larry Sawyer.
"Hey dad, do you know where my..."
What are you doing here?
Oh he's trying to rake me to death.
What?
!
I thought you were... nothing crucial.
I'm gonna go put this back.
"- So, who's the guy?"
- What guy?
The one that's got you smiling.
That'd be my dad.
"Oh, I'd be smiling too but for entirely different reasons."
"Dude, that's my dad!"
Don't go all horndog on me.
There's a line!
"Speaking of which, I really don't wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask."
"No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me."
But if he can't control his power -- it's all right.
How is it all right?
"By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his emotions."
Just like I knew would happen.
"He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready to give us a hug."
[ Grunts ]
Close enough.
Guys!
Wait!
You have somewhere else to be!
What?
There's no time!
Run to the big donut!
Run!
"Uh, okay!"
I would've liked a hug.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ] No way!
"No way, no way, no way, no way!"
Ooh!
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Uh...
You're just opening?
I thought I was late!
Late?
We always open at 7:30 on Sundays.
"Ahh, duh!"
"Well, you're just in time."
Here you go!
My treat!
A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
We're gonna crown us a new champion!
"Checkered flag, here I come!"
No!
McQueen's blown a tire!
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?
You fool!
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!
"Go, go, go!"
He's lost another tire!
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!
Come on.
"I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!"
Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
The King and Chick rounding turn four.
Down the stretch they come!
"And it's, and it's..."
- It's too close to call!
Too close!
- I don't believe it!
Lightning!
"- The most spectacular, amazing..."
- I don't believe it!
"...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!"
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?
"Hey, no cameras!"
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.
"- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite."
"It has to be really good vanilla, though."
"You should, um, check out the place down the street, in the mini-mall on Olamar."
Best shakes in town.
"AND YOU NEED HELP, AND YOU KNOW IT."
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
IS THAT A TACTICAL JUDGMENT OR A PERSONAL ONE?
BOTH -
"- EVERYBODY I KNOW IS IN DANGER RIGHT NOW,"
EVERYONE I'M CLOSE TO.
WELL...
I'M WILLING TO RISK IT...
IF YOU ARE.
HOW'S MY MOM?
"LOCKED UP COZY WITH A CIGARETTE AND A SHOTGUN,"
READY TO KILL ANYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH THE DOOR.
"HERE YOU GO,DOUG -"
- MY LUCKY VEST.
IT WILL LOOK GREAT OVER MY SHIRT.
thanks
"IT'S A LITTLE WORN, BUT IT WILL DO THE TRICK."
ARE THESE BULLET HOLES?
"YEAH, I BROKE IT IN FOR YOU."
IT'S A SHORT RIDE TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
"JUST THINK OF IT AS A PRECAUTION,LIKE A SEAT BELT."
A SEAT BELT THAT SMELLS LIKE OLD SPICE AND BOURBON.
"EASY,NOW."
"ASSASSINATION IS 1% SHOOTING, 99% PREPARATION --"
"ANTICIPATING MOVES,"
"DEVISING APPROACHES, RECRUITING SOURCES,"
FINDING THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
SO THE BULLET'S ALMOST AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
"USUALLY,THAT'S WHEN A TARGET IS ON THE MOVE --"
WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY VARIABLES TO CONTROL THEM ALL.
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.
"MICHAEL,WHATEVER HAPPENS, THANK YOU."
"I mean, you call these problems?"
"""Oh, it's horrible."
"Someone wrote in the sky for me. """
I'd kill to find a little note in my diaphragm case.
Oh...
But that's just me.
Then maybe he should be with you.
"No, Joanne."
"Joanne, wait."
Wait.
This is the best party ever.
- Nice speech.
- It was horrible.
I thought it was great.
"Oh, happy people complaining."
"No, they deserve to be yelled at."
I'm Richie.
Lina.
"No, I know."
Um
"- You sat in front of me in Ms. Klinger's class, but then in fourth grade you were gone."
We transferred to private school.
After Kat was expelled for telling Mr. Dubin he looked like a penis.
"He did, he kinda looked like a penis."
"Yeah, and the turtlenecks didn't help."
I like your hat.
Are-are you making fun of me?
'Cause I don't think I could handle-
"No, I like it."
"It's, um... jaunty."
Hey.
"Couldn't have looked like crap just a little, huh?"
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
One of which is pain.
"The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him."
Chase!
How's cameron?
She's not giddy.
Fever's down.
White count's improving.
Has she said anything to you?
"You mean like,""I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"""
What I did... did save my life.
Get in here and help!
Forget the suit!
He's tachycardic!
Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
It's not cryptococcus!
What?
- House was wrong.
The samples were negative.
So what is it?
We don't know!
- Give him in the amio.
Do we have any more leads?
That was our lead!
Foreman!
So the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman!
He's in v-fib!
No good.
Hit him again.
"Come on, man."
"Come on, joe."
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.
The match can't continue.
It's fine.
Stop joking.
Captain Tezuka is worried too.
I want to play.
Ten minutes.
"If you don't win in ten minutes, I'll substitute you."
Tezuka.
Alright?
No problem.
Sorry for the wait.
Still playing on?
"Just a little cut, no reason to make a big fuss."
That guy's left-handed.
No way.
You'd better admit defeat.
Nitouryu.
Note:
This name refers to Ryoma's ambidexterity.
Seigaku Tennis Team.
Congratulations on your victory.
Thank you.
Players of the tennis club.
"Today, my idiot son lost his game sorry to bring you guys trouble."
It's okay we won in the end.
- It's my treat today.
- Thanks.
"Eat, eat."
"- Everyone, let's toast."
- Okay.

Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.

Thanks.

- No.
For my mom.
This was her favorite group when she was my age.
It's signed by Belinda.
This would be the perfect graduation present.
"I've been looking all week long, and I couldn't find anything."
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?
From college.
From business classes.
I'm surprised she has time for anything... except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
"It's not a lot of time, but..."
- Go on.
Get it.
She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.
- This was fate.
- I think it was.
"And in return, I just might show you my withering stare."
I'm a lucky man.
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep.
Thank you.
- Is everything there?
- Yes.
- I didn't touch anything.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"- Yes, but I'm going home."
"- Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
- Do you like dancing?
- I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
- Silent cinema?
- Yes.
- What do you do when you go out?
- I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
Thanks for the wallet.
"- Sorry, it looks like a pigsty."
- Do you spend wisely.
So it is now.
What an ugly bag.
"- There are more than 200,000."
"- There are actually 500,000."
Jaså.
We clean up after yourself.
- I've messed up!
- It is you who have fucked you!
I salute the way from Vijay.
He got 10 years!
Shit.
Moment
"No, let it sit."
- Your fucking snitch.
"- Yes, I'm a fucking snitch."
Come on.
Hold this.
Wait here.
- They have several informants.
"- Bye, Dad."
You can even see in the new documents.
I send them over a secure line.
"Well, and if I need to check other cases ..."
Can I call you back?
What are you doing here?
Do you know why we tolerate your kind?
Because I just fit your work.
But you have gone too far.
Now there shall be no rules anymore.
I have not done anything.
Wow!
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing...
"I think you're just gonna stand there, like the little girl you are..."
And I'm gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...
And then...?
You're goin' swimming.
hey hey quickly
Dude....
Zoric is over there checking us out let it go...
We'll beat his little ass later...
Give me the stick...
Give me the stick...
Holy shit!
Are you fucking crazy!
?
Hey!
Okay.
"Please, move back."
move back
"Give me one reason I shouldn't suspend you, Owen..."
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could've happened...?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path...
He's a good boy... he really is...
Hello...?
Is John there...?
Excuse me...?
This is his wife who's this...?
"hello, Cindy..."
- What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.
That's enough.
"If they are alive, they must be exhausted."
We'll easily catch them.
- We must try to capture them alive.
- Why?
I want to finish them off.
Over here.
I can see them.
Give me that.
Stupid bitches.
- They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.
We can't search all the wrecksl
"Did you see anything, Bosco?"
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.
- We must wait until daybreak.
- We'll find them eventually.
I know how to drive them out.
"Paul, bring your lamp."
"Come here, all of you."
Le Bosco has an idea.
You come down too!
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn them.
Give me your lantern.
Stay here and tell me if you see them.
Bosco!
A real pisser.
You wanna talk now?
"Okay, let's talk."
Let's get it over with.
"Swear to God, I've never met a ball buster like you my whole life."
"Who loves you more than I do, huh?"
-l'd do anything for you.
-Except stop busting my balls.
-Let's go have coffee.
"-Want to go to the diner, or what?"
We'll go to the diner over there on the boulevard.
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. lt's open 24 hours.
-They got danishes there?
"-Yeah, they got everything."
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.
You hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston?
It's terrific.
Nunzio up in--
I thought he'd never shut the fuck up.
I know.
Pain in the ass.
-Whatta you wanna do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you get through.
"-Frank, let's chop him up."
-All right.
"-Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?"
-I thought you said chop him up.
"Up at Charlie's, not here!"
"Come on, what are you doing?"
Get the fuck out of here.
Mom.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's fine.
`
The baby's okay.
She's okay.
She ?
It's a girl.
Sweet.
Cool.
"Well, looks like the old girl held up pretty good."
I can't wait to have a hot shower with the hot water we don't have.
I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
Or sleeping anywhere.
"Come on, I'll fire up the grill, we'll get the camp stove going..."
it'll be fun.
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.
"- Oh, my God, the yard guy?"
"- Yeah, I know."
"What was I supposed to do, wait for you?"
You weren't coming back.
I wanted you to tell me the truth.
- Who's your favorite writer?
- Bendis.
"Well, hot damn, welcome to the club."
- I love that guy.
- You're not the only one.
"- You had me three months ago, and you left."
- I want to make that up to you.
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Jesus, Harry, stop the machine!"
"- I'm dying here, come on!"
"- Come on, one last push, JC."
"He was wearing a barman's outfit when he came in, wasn't he?"
Try Kinzoku in Chinatown.
(GROANS)
(PANTS)
Cuff-Fit.
All the rage in LA.
Need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of here.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me and I will not keep my mouth shut!
Alright?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar?
SURI:
Who's that?
No one.
"Come on, let's go in."
(MUSIC PLAYS)
# It was a kind of so-so love
"# And I'm gonna make sure it never happens again it You and I, it had to be"
I?
Temperature suddenly dropping with no explanation.
Thought that you were a man of science.
I am.
But I also know that there are things in life that even science can't explain.
Okay.
Carter.
Any messages for me?
"Uh, no, Ms. Marquez, no messages."
There's nothing from Mr. Harpel?
Nothing.
Danny here?
Do you see him?
What about Ed?
It's kind of urgent.
[Sighs]
One of my whales disappeared.
I can help you.
I should probably talk to Danny.
I can do anything he can do.
Probably more.
- Really?
"- Oh, uh, really."
Can you find Mr. Harpel?
The guy you were supposed to meet earlier?
Mm-hmm.
You sure he didn't just stand you up?
Or maybe Paul Logan swooped in and yanked him from your clutches.
I knew this was too serious for you to understand.
"Hey, Danny."
It's Sam.
I need to talk to you right away.
Hey.
Looks like it's gonna be a late one here tonight.
Yeah.
"No, no, everything's fine."
"Just a lot going on, back-to-back meetings."
Yeah.
"I love you, too."
It's complicated.
"Family, Leon."
Always is.
"So, you think my chattiness is annoying?"
"I think you asking me about your chattiness non-stop for the past 20 minutes is annoying, yes."
Want to know who else thought my chattiness was annoying?
Wendy.
She said it made me sound nervous and insecure.
- Like that's even possible.
"- Stop it, Tony."
"It was one little comment Gibbs made, okay?"
Nothing more.
"And as for Wendy, I believe you were right to turn the book on that relationship."
"Turn the page, close the book, but... yeah, I guess I was."
Oh.
Meredith Bilson?
Who are you?
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
This is
Agent David.
NCIS.
"We need to talk to you about your boyfriend,"
Petty Officer Caleb Adams.
Is s-something wrong?
May we come in?
"Uh, uh, I'm..."
Oh my dick!
"Now, you are charged with murdering."
You can employ your own lawyer to defend for you.
Do you have any lawyer?
Yes!
Chan Mon-gut!
Shit!
"Mister, are you ready?"
I've found Master.
Good!
Let's go.
"After the shaving, no hair will be left."
"You can't regret, Mister,"
do you want a second thought?
Come on.
Stop!
"Fleas are living in my armpit, why do you stop me?"
May I have a little bit freedom?
"Mister, do you want to go on?"
"Yes, please."
Foon is being charged with hom4cide in Hong Kong.
What?
Yes.
Hey!
What?
Are you going to save him?
How?
"If you don't, he will die."
People will die sooner or later!
You are smart and wise!
I can't help...
He committed crime in HK which is governed by British law.
- No.
Mr Thomas.
Can you tell me what you remember last?
Well.
I came out of my apartment.
and I walked...
My head was spinning and I fell down.
After that.
I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it.
Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What?
You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes.
But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen.
Mr Thomas.
you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes.
I escaped because I played dead.
Played dead?
Yeah.
That wasn't my fault.
Get me?
Yeah.
Where'd you come from?
I've known this guy for six months.
What is that?
It's a good plan.
"I'm his crew, we go way back."
What about you?
I'm his sister.
"Okay, everyone stop."
"This is my lead, my research, my job."
You're out.
"No, wait."
Connor listen.
"Look, I'm begging you, okay."
I'm begging you to let me go.
"Look, the only reason Blair is here, the reason why we're in this mess, it's because of me."
"I didn't put her first, and now we've lost everything."
And I can't risk losing her too.
"I don't care about the plans, I don't care about the score."
I'm begging you.
Please let me come.
If I let you come...
I have ground rules.
"First, the cut remains the same."
You're not gettin' any extra money for coming along.
Totally fair.
Yeah.
Uh...
Lobster truck is here.
Hm.
"An hour ago, I found Mr. Myers down in the E.R. washing the feet of a homeless guy."
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Reminds me of my Uncle Ben...
"Goes to mass every day, twice on Sundays."
Nobody calls him crazy or that he has some syndrome.
You believe in God?
I was raised Catholic.
It never leaves you.
I pray sometimes... mostly for the mets.
God's record there is pretty spotty.
- What's going on?
- Anything?
Who brought Mr. Janson out here?
- I can see!
- You can see?
Jacob brought him for lobster.
Ha!
"Jacob, I can see!"
I can see!
All praise to Hashem!
I can see!
It's a miracle!
"I touched Larry, and Larry can see."
This is a fact.
"Look, as scientists, you have to accept hard evidence."
Larry has graves' disease.
That's why he was blind.
We treated him with a steroid that reduced the swelling...
like your girlfriend claimed.
He didn't?
He was murdered.
Skinned.
It was never solved.
The colleaguesthink that it was a kind of
"Personal vengeance, because the murderer or murderess took several days to skin him."
"Now guess who left New York a day after the murder, even days before the press found out."
She lied to you.
Probably from the beginning.
She played with you like a cat with a mouse.
She screwed you and whoever worked with her.
Where is she?
Where is she?
- Who?
No.
No...
Where is she?
Wait!
Where is she?
- No.
"Please, don't."
No.
This won't get you anywhere!
I'm meaningless.
You didn't accomplish anything.
[Sighs]
What?
[Ding]
Morning.
Did a package arrive from booth Allen in Chicago?
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
"Oh no, don't shoot!"
I hate violence!
I'm here to tell you a secret!
Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!
- You have to close your eyes!
- O.K.!
"Hey, wake up. lt's done!"
Japan cabled today.
Hiroshima only has a phoney Formula.
You have the real one!
We all know that!
That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
"In the Paratroopers, I mean."
I don't know.
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother... I suddenly realized how wonderful life really was!
And then I fought like a tiger to stay alive!
I was running away from problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah...
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
Better not to talk about it.
All right.
"-Hey, have you had dinner?"
-No.
-Would you like dinner with me?
-Okay!
All right.
Doc Swain?
"Evening, Selena."
I'll be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
"Ah, watch your feet."
Are you going to tell them about me?
"-I'll have to, Selena."
-Nobody in town must ever know.
"But, if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
-I know that.
"-Well, then, why?"
-Because of Ted.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.
- What?
- OK.
Fuck.
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?
All right.
"Hey, look, look!"
Excuse me.
You guys going to America?
"Sí, vamos."
"Yes, we're going."
Thank you.
- Es mío.
"- Vamos, vamos."
"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
- Shut up.
- He totally knows.
"- My point is it took Elliott a year to say he loved me, and another year to say it without using a cartoon voice."
"I think I should be ready for a guy who shows emotions,right?"
- Yeah.
Totally.
- Don't you think?
Just maybe not so many of them.
And on separate occasions.
"And,like,when you're not there."
"Hey,beautiful."
Hi.
This is a surprise.
I hope it's okay.
I just...
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Dad.
Um...
"You know,I found a strand of your hair on my jacket."
"What,is he shipping out tomorrow?"
It smelled like you.
I'm kind of working.
I love that you're working.
"I love that you work here,and that your hair smells."
Thank you.
"Oh,can we go for a walk or something?"
Yeah.
Is that...?
Get a cramp?
You okay?
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight.
- Adam.
"No, dude, that is Adam."
"Dude, that is Pete."
Can you give us a sec?
"Live it up, football jocks!"
- It's all downhill from here.
- Oh!
It's going down!
I just heard!
"Here, tonight!"
It's going down!
Nice dress.
Did your mom make it?
"Listen to me, damn it!"
"I didn't see them, but I heard their plan."
"""At 11:00 sharp, we shank the dork."""
"Ellie, some poor kid's getting pantsed!"
"No, this can't be happening."
Not now!
Not again!
"Boo, you got your crazy face on."
A-are you all right?
[ Sighs deeply ] 1987.
Senior prom.
I was so excited.
"I had a cool tux, a hot date, and a plan to help my best pal Bucky Martin score a dance with the girl of his dreams."
Bucky Martin?
Sounds like a stud.
- He actually wasn't.
- Stop it.
"But I knew he could be, if he-- if he just believed."
"And then when I saw Cindy Lee standing alone at the punch bowl,"
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.
Short circuit the control system.
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
Look out.
Get out of my way.
Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
- Just a minute.
alberto?
"Now I can leave, my best to yourIover."
- What lover?
.
- AII yourIies!
"It's my fault, but I didn't do it on purpose!"
"Scapece was yelling, but I couldn't understand!"
Stay back.
Be careful.
If I asked you to marry me?
No rush.
Rememberwhen we got married?
"We lived everywhere, we didn't give a damn."
We were happy because we were together.
How could we have forgotten that?
Jackass.
Come in.

From the central Office.
"Two years have gone by, it was bound to come."

"You're happy, aren't you?"
See you tonight.
Have a good trip.
"It's always the same with you directors, you come, we get used to you, when everything's workin' smooth, you run off like thieves."
Goodbye.
Mamma's boy!
This is foryou.
There you go.
Could you please tell John that I called?
Hi there...
Your mom or dad home?
Yes.
Mom!

"- Sorry to bother you, Ma'am."
What's this about...?
I'm afraid there's been an incident with one of your neighbors here in the complex...
"So we're just going around, talking to people..."

What kind of incident?
"Owen, why don't you go to your room...?"
"- Sorry, guys!"

I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

That's very annoying.

Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.
What're you doing here in the middle of night

Get in.
What's happening?
What's this?
The Vesuvius.
We're having a dress rehearsal Monday afternoon.

- I doubt if we can finish it.
That gives us only three days.
You've got to finish it!
The show opens Monday night.
"- Oh, alright."
- Fine.
Here you are.
"Now remember, we must have the costumes Monday morning."
[snaps]
- What about those amber spots?
- 'Right away.'
They should be on when the curtains come through.
Do you realize we open tonight?

Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it.
I don't know who I am.
So I...
So I need to go home.
The interface has data tendrils like roots.
They've dug in deeper than they're meant to.
"Threaded through your brain, taken over whole areas, I can't stop it."
"I can't remove it, and I can't stop it."
But I...
But I don't know who I am.
I don't know...
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.

"- What happened, Pablito?"
- I saw men with guns.
- Were they soldiers?
"No, revolutionaries."
They're coming to our village.
- What do they want?
- Let's wait and see.
We are your friends.
I hope you know that.
We'll march on soon.
All we're asking for is provisions and water.
"We'll rest a bit, and then we'll march on."
"My village is poor, but we'll share."
I love these gushing receptions.
Really charming.
"Captain howdy, do you think my mom's pretty?"
Captain howdy?
"Captain howdy, that isn't very nice."
"Well, maybe he's sleeping."
You think?
What--Regan...
Why are you reading that stuff?
Because I like it.
It's not even a good picture of you.
You look so mature.
I wouldn't talk.
You wouldn't talk?
"Well, I didn't have my makeup man there."
Let me take an eyelash off your face.
"No, I didn't get it."
What are we going to do on your birthday?
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?
What can we do?
I don't know.
What would you like to do?
Got any ideas?
Mm-mmm.
No?
Let me think.
Let me think.
What can we do?
We never finished seeing all the sights in Washington.
"We didn't get to the Lee mansion, lots of stuff."
Shall we go sightseeing...
If it's a nice day?
"Yeah, let's do that."
"And tomorrow night,"
You won't?
You really won't do as I say?
Director Kim.
Director Kim!
Director Kim!
"Director Kim, get back here, right now!"
"Director Kim, come here now!"
I'm not going to let this one go.
I'm serious.
I can't stand it when a person mistreats another.
Can't stand it?
So what?
"I still like you, even if you've done wrong."
I respect you as a director.
"Now, go and apologize."
I'm serious.
Go say you're sorry.
That's the right thing to do.
You apologize if you like.
Why should I?
Because you treated him like dirt!
You really won't apologize?
"If you don't, I'm going back to Seoul."
You won't?
"Okay, I'm leaving."
Let's go!
Seriously?
Back to Seoul?
What's gotten into you?
"Alright, I did wrong."
Let's stop this!
"No, you have to go and apologize."
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
"- Hey, John, check the words to this."
Yo!
"And I ain't chatting no black talk, mate."
Yo means I in Spanish.
- Very impressive.
- There's more.
Yo no soy marinero.
I ain't no sailor.
Soy capitan.
I'm captain.
I've found Risdale.
"To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
Una poca de gracia
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
"Seriously, John, that ain't a trick question."
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
We're going to the seaside.
Pack a bag.
"Mi amor, Calum."
Mi gusto los churros a los chico.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
It reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, my dad used to take us to the seaside."
Me and my sister would sit in the back eating digestive biscuits.
Takehara sees Mother a lot?
I don't know.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
What do you think?
Will you let us use it?
It's a little embarrassing.
It'll get you a lot in return if you do let me use it.
My mother says that she can't make it today.
I think you were supposed to go the Kabuki with her.
Has something come up?
My father came back.
I see.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Same as ever.
"Takao, I haven't seen you in ages."
Is your mother well?
Yes.
You should come to Kamakura.
The beach is really popular.
I'd like to get there this summer.
Excuse me.
Someone from the Kokuminsha is here.
"Send him in, please."
Will you be going in the bath later?
"I will, but after we're done talking."
Make yourself at home.
Mother was a friend of hers wasn't she?
"Yes, I think they were very close."
What do you mean?
Let me free.
No way.
The law is right.
Come on.
Why are you being so stubborn?
Law is dead.
But we are alive.
Why don't you be a little more sensible.
"Come on, look."
"I'll give you $10,000, you can do as you want."
"Eh, well then?"
Officer Jeng?
I refuse!
You keep quiet.
You want me to charge you with bribery?
What?
"Well, bribery would just make one more charge."
It won't make much difference.
Huh.
"I wanna ask you, did you come from Wayne County?"
Huh?
(Laughing)
"I've been around, in all parts of this area."
But not as far as a county of Wayne.
"You were an accountant, that right?"
"Me, accountant?"
"Can't make a good living these days, don't you agree?"
One thing.
"Was your name Lun Taichen, and did you know Cheng Tachwan?"
Cheng Tachwan?
Cheng Tachwan?
Yes.
- Stand up.
Do you prefer?

I'm serious.
I love this color...

You're putting me on.
Wow!
Your eyes are the color of this bay!
"Man, you're weird."
They are!

"- That's not Dennis, Mumsie."
- Of course it's Dennis.
- I should know.
"- Well, it can't be."
Then who was the man in the trunk?
"Oh, Mumsie, what have you done?"
What have I done?
!
You have murdered an innocent bystander.
Control yourself.
- Get this back to the barge.
- Why?
"If he misses it, he'll be suspicious."
"Besides, it pointless our taking it while he's alive."
"If I nobble him now, we can get it back."
Though why you had to go and warn him...
Hurry!
Hurry!
Our whole future depends on it.

I'm sorry.
l-l don't even like Nikki.
I was trippin' off Kenny.
"You can't help who you love, Derek."
You're not supposed to.
"When you love somebody, you love them."
Look at me.
At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going ?
"Stay out of my business, Chenille."
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
"Why are you trippin' off him, Derek ?"
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.
Hey.
Hey.
"Kai, I've been trying to catch up with you."
I gotta talk to you.
- Ready to roll ?
- l gotta talk to you.
- Wassup ?
"- Look, man. I ain't going with you."
What you mean you're not going ?
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?
"This shit is nonsense, Kai."
It's dangerous nonsense.
"Just back up off it, man."
Come on.
- You believe me?
- Yeah.
- Poor bastard.
"- Jerry's a good guy, so don't..."
"No, I'm not."
"It's just that,"
"I mean, man, it's gotta hurt."
"One time I kissed this girl who I was,"
- I had such a crush on...
- I don't need to hear this.
- I had to watch you kissing Jerry.
- Yeah but that's not...
"Anyway, I did the Hail Mary thing, and it was great, I thought, and after the kiss, I was like, here we go, this is gonna happen."
- OK.
"- Yeah, OK, that's what I thought. ""OK."""
"Except she said, oh, kissing me was like kissing wait for it... her brother."
- Oh that's so gross.
- Right?
That's not what it's like kissing Jerry.
What?
He's a good kisser.
I'm just being honest.
But not as good as kissing me.
I forget.
Mm...
Still not sure...
You win.
I'm going to Dallas because I love you.
Do you love me?
"I can't believe I have to ask, but..."
"Yeah, I do."
I love you.
That was your first lie.

Forever doesn't last very long when you're human.

I know that.
But Damon does.
- And you're gonna get it for me.

"Uh, where are you?"
What's up?
Uh...

How is Anna?
I like that girl.
She has fire.
"Uh, I don't know."
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?
"No, no trouble."
"Anna just owes me a call, that's it."
Is that the girl that I saw you with at the Founder's Pageant?
"So you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?"
When was the last time you saw her?
- Why?
"Don't mind me, Joyce."
I've worked the Samaritans' Christmas bazaar.
I know misery loves company.

Approximately 45 minutes after departure.
Friday is the worst day.
The ferry is always completely full on that day.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
- Look.
Good Sir Knight.
Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
"Very gracious of you, Sir Knight."
"We're very undeserving, really."
We're just humble fisher folk.
"However, we do have this maiden daughter."
As there is this custom the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
"Say hello to the knight, Griselda honey."
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
"What do you say, Sir Knight?"
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?

Shall we talk inside?
"Okay, come in."
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's position...
"If you change it, he will get hurt later."
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
I can't tell.
"-Hey, where's Lenny?"
"-Right here, Woody."
"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."
"Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl."
What's going on?
"Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys."
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.
"He tortures toys, just for fun!"
"Well, then we've got to do something."
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
"-Yeah, sure."
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
"Come in, please."
I know you.
"No, I do not think so."
Yes.
"In the university, you helped me to put fiancee in a taxi, you were very amiable."
You decide to me very well.
Why have you come?
"I will see, I..."
-You want that I take a look at you?
truth?
-Yes.
I am very badly.
"Please,"
Get undressed.
-Also...?
-Yes.
Lie down.
tell me?
what happens to you?
"I have you feel nauseous, fatigue, lack of appetite."
We are going to auscultate the heart.
You seems to me a little excited.
This tightens much to me.?
It matters to him?
Please.
Thus I am more comfortable.
We see.
"Yes, very it is excited"
It excuses.
"Nowadays, the bra, they make them very small."
Thus it is well?
We are going to see where hurts to you.
Look around you...
"new fallen snow, you're with your family."
I just know this is going to be a great day.
Sue?
Sue Murphy?
"Oh, fuck me!"
"Hi, Ginny!"
"Oh, hi, Frank."
"How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?"
Any nibbles?
I should've died in Korea.
"Go play with Maureen, that's fun!"
Sorry about Frank.
He hasn't been himself lately.
That's all right.
Failure can break down even the strongest man.
How are you?
"Must have been a difficult Christmas after, you know,"
Greg abandoned you and the kids.
"Oh, no, we're back together!"
Greg took a Catholic cruise with Father Pat and came back a different man.
We're going at it like newlyweds!
"Well, that's a dirty mouth."
"Mister, I'm gonna shut you up."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, hi, stud!"
"Dear Lord, give me strength."
"Vagina, vagina, vagina!"
"Hey, baby!"
Looking attractive!
"Christ, I hate it here."
Bunch of kids.
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
"Oh, there's Ms. Bossman."
( chuckles ) Wow.
"WAGs for the guys in the front office, too, huh?"
- Dallas does it right.
- ( chuckles )
- Spencer.
"- Hey, Tanya."
- You look beautiful as always.
- ( kisses )
- What are you doing here?
"- Well, I heard a couple of my friends were vacationing in my neck of the woods, I thought I'd come by."
"Yeah, and I grew up nearby."
Might pop into my mom.
"Tanya, my business partner, Joe Krutel."
"- Hi, Joe."
- Hi.
Boys are getting big.
"Ah, yeah."
"Henry is already 6'1"" and he's only in middle school."
They grow 'em big like that in Texas.
When are you gonna make some?
It's such a shame to waste those genetics.
"Yeah, I am working on it."
"Tanya, where is, uh..."
Where is your husband?
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?
"Over there, massage."
Something really got under his skin this morning.
Said he needed extra pressure.
"Huh, wonder what that could be."
Send for my chopper.
I can take 3.
Coming along?
I'm staying.
MacDANIEL:
"I see them, Dai Uy."
NIM:
Pardon me.
PETERSEN:
Weapons check in 30 minutes!
Fall out!
[SERGEANT SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen!
PETERSEN:
Charlie's building caskets and ladders.
A lot of them.
How far away?
About 15 clicks.
That gives us plenty to do before they get here.
Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp.
- Will systems be operational by dark?
- Affirmative.
"May I suggest we contact ""C"" Team?"
See about the weather.
- Petersen?
- Yeah.
What was all that about ladders and coffins?
"When Charlie knows he's got a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell."
The ladders?
They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us.
Later they use them for litters.
Hello?
"Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her."
Even the phones don't work.
"Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton."
"87,000?"
Give it to me.
"Don't be a fool, Stephanie."
"92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less."
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
"Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?"
Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"
"- What, old boy?"
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
"No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
(WHISPERING) Giants can smell blood.
And I'm always a gentleman.
(CORK POPS)
(CORK THUDS)
(GASPING) Ah!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
Bloody waste of it.
(EMMA PANTING)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
That's where the treasures are.
Where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
"The powder Mulan gave us, we need to use it."
We've gotta knock him out.
That's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
"Who's Milah, on the tattoo?"
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
Why not?
is it problematic?
"Come on, Christine, we're both adults."
Herman is so...savage.
He doesn't beat you?
"No, in bed I mean."
What does he do?
He just pounds away.
And he comes at once.
"No wonder, that boy is crazy about you."
"Yes, but there's nothing in it for me."
Zilch!
Doesn't he repeat the exercise?
Falls right asleep.
Tough.
Perhaps I can help you.
How?
I'm psychic as you've noticed.
Get that boy down here.
I'll apply my gifts to see why he comes so quickly.
- l could possibly cure him.
- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Good girl!
Up and at it!
"You're lying on something sharp, look!"
Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
Wait!
Hold it!
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.
I'm not that good at it.
"Now, wait a minute!"
Thomas!
Thomas!
Break it to her gently.
Break it to her gently.
He did it to me again.
"Hi, Lena."
Saul's got this little problem.
His heart attacked him.
"No, that's terrible."
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Could you tell me the status of a Saul Greenberg?
An ambulance brought him in a while ago.
Possible heart attack.
Sure.
I'll check for you.
No ambulances have checked in since this morning and that was a pregnancy.
That's impossible.
The ambulance left about five minutes before I did.
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?
Yeah. international Life Support.
- And his doctor?

[Sighs]
"Hello, Douglas."
So...
"You, uh..."
"You got your guy at the table now, huh?"
That's right.
Ne'er-do-Wells could be casing our house as we speak.
Yeah?
Then why you playing pinochle with him?
"Because, moron, if I don't treat Mr. safety like a real person, they'll know he's a fake."
"Yeah, well, I gotta tell you, still weird."
"What's up with the walk, frankenstein?"
[Chuckles]
"[Chuckles] I just joined the gym, and I might have overdone it."
"Gym, huh?"
Throwin' your money away.
"I got 2 words for you, friend:"
Dynamic tension.
"Give me a bag of rice, gallon of milk, and a rubber band, and I'll give you a workout you won't soon forget."
"Don't work out with my milk, ok?"
"I'm telling you, it works."
Look at the shape I'm in.
I weigh exactly what I weighed when I was 12 years old.
[Groaning]
[Sighs]
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.
It's downstairs.
Do you want to see it?
No.
What are we eating?
-Are you hungry?
No.
Do you like the house?
-Yeah.
Have you seen the soccer goal?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
You have to think about the political aspect.
"They here, however."
-They are already bankrupt.
I was not finished talking.
M r.
"Borgen, you've got a phone from Norway."
They say it's personal.
Do you have a privacy?
Put them over.
Can you please go?
-Hallo?
-Hi.
Aksel?
Aksel Nilsen?
-Who is it?
-William Hansteen.
-Are you there?
-Yes.
How are you?
Do you know Solar Tech?
-Why do you ask?
-Old Lifjord Mechanical.
We leave on the solar cell production a few years ago.
-We have lost an important contract.
-Scanbrazil?
You have the interests of the market for alternative energy.
We are facing a breakthrough on 4G.
If I sent you ...
-We are not interested.
-How can you say that?
I see there are Eva who is controlling the company now.
"Yes, I met a little wall after what happened with Karine."
Where are you going?
I don't know yet.
Can I come?
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.
"Well, we got to do what's in the photo."
"Right, bro?"
Where we going?
Nowhere.
I don't want to abandon Jasper in case something goes wrong.
Are we okay?
I got jealous.
This is a- it's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.
"And I, obviously, am- I'm not handling it well."
(SIGHS)
You got jealous?
(EXHALES)
Tell me more.
"So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise."
You said that already.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, can I get you something to drink?"
"You know what I like about you, Jasper?"
You never welched on a bet.
I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect.
And I can appreciate that.
I can.
Is that yours?
You mind if I see it?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
"You, too."
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
"Well, he came in."
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
-l can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
"This stuff is great, but it's like lead."
"Tell me, where you been?"
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
"Mom, I been working nights."
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and we hit one of them deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
"It reminds me, I need this knife."
I didn't know cats could smile.
(sighing ) Neither did I.
And there's a blue caterpillar.
Blue caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
off your head.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
(laughing )
Alice.NNothing can harm you there.
Nyou can always wake up.
Like this.
(laughing ) Ow!
(sighing )
Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""Nwas wearing a codfish on your head?"
-Would you wear it?
N-Alice.
a corset is like a codfish.
not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.Nl didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
Never since I can remember.
I want her to be able to learn
- how to solve problems on her own.
- Yeah.
"I thought you guys were, like, super old and gross or whatever, but you're actually, like, really cool aunts and uncle or whatever."
Thanks or whatever.
He dumped me.
- What?
- What?
W-What'd he do that for?
He said I was suffocating him.
I can't believe you guys made me talk to my boyfriend.
You ruined my life!
And mine!
SAMANTHA:
God!
- JEN:
Um...
- JENNA:
Let's get piercings.
Do you understand anything that just happened?
Yeah.
Teenagers are crazy.
"I mean, I think we got it wrong."
"Like, babies are not the hard part."
That is the hard part.
But we'll get through it.
- Yeah. (sighs)
- Mm-hmm.
We just gotta put our thinking caps on.
"Okay, just get the hat, Greg."
"Oh, yeah."
They still got it!
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time.
There's a bright side.
"So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up, tell him he better wash those sneakers."
"And I said ""Bye."""
And tell him to let them air dry this time.
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
Everybody's gonna be there.
Ok.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I... don't know what to do.
I need to talk to you.
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"Hi there, Billy, how ya doing?"
Glad to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
"Oh, here."
"I'll take it, it's my mom's."
Okay.
"Well, uh, how was your trip?"
Fine.
"Uh, did ya sit by the window?"
Yeah.
"Billy, tell Mike what you saw."
"I don't know, a bunch of clouds."
"Billy, come on, you saw the Grand Canyon."
"Hey, hey, you saw the Grand Canyon?"
"We're going to see the Grand Canyon from the ground, up close."
"Really, it's one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world."
So is Central Park.
Are we going to spend our whole vacation here?
"No, I'm with you, come on."
Wait 'til you see the trip I got planned for us.
- You're going to love it.
- I hope so.
"Listen to me, I'm telling you this city has grown a whole lot since you've left here."
"- I can tell, it's amazing."
"- Oh, yeah."
"I sell some lots, you know."
I sold some parcels out here.
I've contributed to its growth.
- Really?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Big, big lots?"
"- Oh, yeah, oh, huge."
they're on a boat
Near the south side pier...
"the heartbreak, dock 12."
Who is this?
Just a pal.
Tell me you na...
how did you get this number?
Have a lovely night.
Right.
Very good.
Who was that?
Anonymous tip.
Let's go.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
That didn't take long.
Oh.
Thought you were someone else.
Brannis told me one of you would be coming.
One of me?
Would it make a difference if I told you I won't make it easy?
Yeah.
"He told me that, too."
What did you do?
What did you do to my arm?
Aah!
"Well, that works."
Not if you want a massage.
Jarvis:
I imagine that'll be your colleagues.
We must go.
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.
"Okay, Jenny a-and I, we're looking to have a new nanny."
"Or in Tyler's case, a... a manny."
[Laughs]
- What?
- Yeah.
[Both chuckle]
Stop it.
"You're, like, the worst liar ever."
Who is this guy?
He's Lanie's new boyfriend.
She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.
"You know what this means, right?"
We... are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.
"Hey, Lanie."
I got your text.
And I've got your murder weapon...
"A picture of it, anyway."
I used the autopsies of The Phantom's victims to generate this.
Ryan:
Hmm.
Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Exactly.
Find the knife...
Find the killer.
Nice work.
"So, how's the background check going?"
"Oh, pretty good so far."
I don't like the sound of that.
"No, t-there's..."
there's nothing to worry about... y-yet.
It's... it's just a rumor.
Let's hear it.
Good luck with that.
Yeah I know.
Well it's not that big a deal.
It's not like Hannah Montana hasn't complicated your life before.
Yeah.
And I dealt with it then and I'll deal with it now.
-Hey there you are.
-Jesse!
"Whoa, whoa, dude!"
You're that guy dating Hannah Montana.
Did you know that?
Yeah I saw it on Leno.
[Laughs] Me too!
Up top bro!
Yeah.
Jesse what are you doing here?
Casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
-Nice.
-Your dad told me you were at the pier.
I just had some great news I had to tell you.
I can't wait aforementioned casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
Overkill.
My dad's coming home from overseas.
My gosh Jesse that's great.
Miley.
Dang it.
Hey it's okay.
I don't think anybody noticed.
One at a time bro.
"Oh, Hannah Montana's new boyfriend, Jesse,"
Apparently caught cheating today.
Ooh!
- We don't know yet.
"I'm so sorry, Nick."
You think you can figure out what this is?
I'm going to do my best.
"First, I have to test the cat's claws, but if I can't get it from the cat,"
I'm going to have to go see Juliette.
"Okay, are you good here for now?"
- Not really.
- Yes.
"Hey, where you going?"
I'm going to find Adalind.
[Cat yowling]
[Cage rattles]
[Cat yowls]
Maybe it just doesn't like me.
Blutbaden and house pets don't really mix.
"Except, you know, as the occasional between-meal treat."
I'm going to start with some valeriana officinalis.
[Cat hisses]
[Cat screeches] All right.
[Suspenseful music]
[Footsteps approach]
"No, no, no."
Don't shoot.
"Hey, come on."
Put it down.
Who were you shooting at?
Adalind!
Adalind!
[Cell phone ringing]
Yeah?
"He was here at my house, Nick."
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?
Nothing.
It's just...
Fresh margs!
This is some weak margarita.
Whatever.
You're the lightweight.
"Oh, ho, ho, say it over here."
Come here.
I hope your parents never come home.
"Seriously, dawg, let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground."
Who dat?
That freak from Chino.
He was all up in Luke's grill.
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.
I heard he's like a total psycho.
He's a little bitch.
"I see that kid around again, I'm going to beat his ass."
"Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure."
I gotta go.
Hey wait up.
Where you going?
I can't be here right now.
What's the matter?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about him.
He could be anywhere.
"Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine."
We should just try again when it's light out.
Could be too late by then.
- This is not the time.
- It's the perfect time.
"Truth, Gemma."
- I love you.
"- Oh, shit, Chris."
Give me another chance.
You know you want to.
No!
Sorry.
"Serious buzzkill, Chris."
"- I say the moment's passed, mate."
- Yeah.
I choose truth.
- Felix isn't in Chile.
- So... where is he?
"Well, what happened was that he hung himself."
What?
He hung himself.
"Right here, from that crossbeam there."
"- Is this a joke, mate?"
"- No joke, mate."
It's what happened.
I'm in Afghanistan stewing in sweat and fear and blood.
"And when I get home, my kid brother's found swinging from the rafters."
The groundsman cut him down.
True story.
But this is terrible.
"It's been hushed up, naturally, 16 generations of French Catholics."
"Suicide's about as shameful as it gets, not to menton a faggot cop-out."
So why are we here?
I need to get the bottom of it.
Family honour's at stake.
Coming up...
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
...Our competition for tips on the streets of San Francisco takes a strange turn.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.
[ Laughter ]
"And later, Rutledge makes a scientific breakthrough."
"Oh, come on!"
You unplugged it!
Ferrara:
"To celebrate our 25th episode, we've turned over control of the show to Rutledge."
I've got Wood.
"So far, he almost killed himself."
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Bleep]
And now he had me working the streets of San Francisco for tips.
Andrew?
I had $40 to Rut's $20.
Pow!
Yeah!
And we had our last passengers of the night.
I want to know more about this boy that you say you like.
I'm not sure about this.
He was really nice.
- I don't know.
- He was nice.
I thought he was nice.
Really?
You don't like him 'cause he's chubby and nerdy.
No.
That's not true.
Number...
"I mean, how hard is that?"
"I mean, a talking monkey could do her job."
It's embarrassing.
"Actually, that's 16."
"See, you're holding it upside-down."
"Oh, it's..."
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
It's no big deal.
"Look, I've seen it my whole life."
I've never seen it under the six.
"Why don't we ask Natalie, then?"
"Well, she's the expert."
Okay.
Okay.
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
All I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie.
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night, after the show, she got somebody fired."
Really?
One of the crew.
Sound guy.
There were some wires on the floor.
She was...
"You know, complaining."
"And, I mean, I met the guy when I was there."
He was a nice kid.
-You're not trained.
-Since when?
I meant you're not trained to work as part of this team.
There will be other missions.
When you're ready.
"But for now, stay put."
-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.
Ugh.
When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks.
My mentor.
My king.
I thought he trusted me.
Trust?
They don't even trust us with the basics.
They've got a secret H.Q. in space.
What else aren't they telling us?
I have a better question.
Why didn't we leave with Speedy?
What is Project Cadmus?
Don't know.
But I can find out.
COMPUTER:
Access denied.
-Heh.
Wanna bet?
Whoa.
How are you doing that?
Same system as the Batcave.
COMPUTER:
The funeral's over?
"Well, yeah, it happened."
We're getting married.
I told you you look good together.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now that Nana quit and Yoon-sung's gone...
The Blue House is so boring.
You said all you needed was me to be happy and...
This is why one shouldn't propose too soon.
Take it.
"Mine, too."
Da-hye.
It's OK if you're too busy to come to the wedding.
I'll text you my account number.
I wish you health and happiness.
Choi Eung-chan.
"Be happy, Eun-ah."
"Ma am, how about... we open a restaurant in the States?"
We can name it Delicious Korean.
What did the ex-president say?
"He's sorry, grateful, and he wished me happiness."
You know...
I was a chef on a ship once.
I love Korean food.
It's amazing.
The Americans need to taste my food.
I'll be famous.

Right?

I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed...
Do you know where he is?
Maurice?
Why?
Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead?
It'd kill him.
If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille.
The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago.
"In a restaurant, of course."
"I actually remember the restaurant. ""Beirut""."
"Lebanese food, nice restaurant."
But that was long ago.
Do you have a picture of him?
"No, I threw it away."
Or tore it up.
You know how a broken heart is.
You do all sorts of things that you regret later-.
Be a little like me.
How?
I don't even know who you are.
Just tell Ricky the truth.
"Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-."
You talk to me about truth...

- Ooh!
Let's do that again.
- No!
"Well, it's going to better use there."
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-we help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"Paige, you started lying to us..."
I didn't lie.
"Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
Do you?
- You lie to us.
You lie.
- Dad!
Stop!
- What are you doing?
!
- You go behind our backs.
- Stop it!
- Why?

Does this book tell you to do that?

What happened last night...
That's your friend from school.
Uh-huh.
"So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt."
I am.
Yeah.
"Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?"
"'Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band."
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.
"No, actually that was just a rumor."
But he didn't actually eat anyone.
And Crucifictorious is actually...
It's not power metal.
"We're more of extreme grindcore with like, heavy thrash influences."
Like what thrash bands do you like?
Like Napalm Death?
Like the Keep?
Like Cannibal Corpse?
"Carcass, I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl."
"Like metal, non-metal."
So...
Right.
"Well, mainly..."
You all ready to order?
Yeah.
I want the sizzling apple pie.
And I think also chips and...
"Oh, my..."
That's pathetic.
I'm back at the start.
What's up?
Um...
You have to get me out of here!
I can not go back.
I know.
We're going to America.
Thank you.
I love you.
We've got to track Zana.
-Sensato.
We will continue with the broad options.
Something will take us forward.
VG
-Tangen is out there.
-Falou With him?
"I told all I know, but it is not great."
He gave me a double and Coca-Cola sandwich.
Yes?
I am here.
I will not let it go.
But it is so serious that I will tell you first.
We have tips from a cocaine package by which Christer was responsible.
Right?
-you Do not know?
This is an interview or a complaint?
I can know about the whereabouts of this package.
Yes?
Camilla Bjerke?
We will take you in for questioning and searching his apartment.
Why is that?
-how Come?
-Recebemos A complaint.
-A Complaint?
About what?
"It's delicious, but I don't..."
Ataste.
Sausage?
A little dessert?
"Mom, some dessert forthe Director."
- I'm really fine as is.
- Taste it.
"It's good, a kind of chocolate."
"Kind of, it's called blood pudding."
It's chocolate with pig's blood.
- You have to eat it.
- I got that.
"Yourmother's right, it's not so hot here."
"They told me it was very hot here, but..."
"camels used to bring the mail, the directorwas a Bedouin."
- Are you making fun of me?
- No...
- Mattia!
- How's it goin'?
This guy?
Looks like the michelin man.
He's joking.
"He's the new director, from milan."
- I get it.
- What?
He always gets things late.
- Buy you a coffee?
"- No, I have to work."
"Wait, Iet me introduce two stalwart co-workers."
"little CostabiIe, one of our greatest employees."
- welcome to the famous CasteIIabate.
- Wait!
Was he on his way to tell me that he loved me?
What should I do if he wasn't?
"Gil Da Ran,"
I love you.
He was probably going to say it like that to you.
Alright then.
Is that so?
"It would be so, right?"
"If it's like that, I worried uselessly."
Like a fool!
"Yeah, yeah."
Like a fool.
Let's pack up your clothes!
This color suits Yoon Jae very well.
This color is good too!
This one matches well too.
"Here, go pack it up."
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
"Aish, what's this?"
Are these the keys for this house?
No.
Is it the contracted room for us after we get married?
What should we do?
"Wait a moment, and go answer the phone naturally."
What?
Hello?
"Oh, Yoon Jae."
- It's Se Young.
- So you were home?
- The doctor friend that you saw at the hospital.
I was so worried because you didn't answer your phone.
"You know, just go help Dr. Kovac with the rapid infuser, all right?"
No problem.
What do you need?
"Central line, supraumbilical DPL, rapid infuser and a t-pod."
What's a t-pod?
"Fine, I'll get it... again."
- What do you want me to do first?
- Find the O-neg.
Everything okay in there?
For the time being.
Call for four units of type specific.
Soon as I get this up.
Hypotensive pelvic fracture.
He needs the works.
Those are his kids out there.
"Hey, Frank, can you bring those guys to the Family Room?"
Sure.
"Come on, kids."
This way.
- I'll be right in.
- Great.
- Guide wire?
- I'm getting an error signal.
There's not enough water in the warmer.
- Thanks.
- Cordis inducer.
Stitch.
Where's Dori with the T-pod?
T-pods are on the bottom shelf.
Update his vitals?
"- Okay, infuser's on."
- Looks good.
- To New Yorkers.
They don't live here.
"I'm all f or love, son."
"Come on, hero."
And that's an order.
Washington hasn't released a story.
What gives?
Drake's the story. I'm not.
You see Johnny here-
- Johnny?
Sergeant Drake!
Johnny!
I didn't like that salute.
There was something final about it.
I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder.
He'd faked a birth certificate to enlist.
"John Joseph Preston, eh?"
The Yale pin said so.
All I needed was a telephone.
"Sorry, gorgeous. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance."
Yale University.
"Hello, Yale?"
Give me your top man there.
What college?
"Yale, of course."
"Okay, so it's a university."
How would I know?
I just own taxis.
"Yeah, one of my men f ound a pin with a name on it, class of 1940."
I want his address so I can return it to him.
"Thanks, lovely."
"General, if you won't authorize me to go after him I'm af raid i'll have to go anyway."
I am two people.
One was born when I met you.
The other one began in a downtown L.A. tattoo parlor.

SANTANA:
"My father, Pedro, was showing his love for my mother, Esperanza."
Por Vida.
For life.
my mother was a beautiful woman.
"They were pachucos, zoot-suiters, and proud of it."
In June of 1 943 America was at war.
"Not only overseas, but with itself."
The racial tension was running high against anyone that was different.
Excuse me!
WOMAN:
Esperanza!

"For me, esa, put together with a lot of love!"
"Yeah, esa."

"Come on, let's get out of here."
Let's bring our boys home to fight those zoot-suited dandies that are making it unsafe to walk our streets today.
"- Hey, come back!"
- Prostitute to get rid of this thief!
"- Stop, Give me that wallet!"
- Give the man his wallet!
"- He worked hard for the money, g.t guy!"
"- You worked hard, right?"
- Hold on there.
Do not fucking move!
- Fuck man!
Hello?
What's going on there?
- Want to play?
- Listen.
As for the last case?
"Laboratory, was caught in a match."
"- Mason, have checked the records."
You were right about the delivery.
- Where do I said that?
"- Yes, the better."
I received a delivery address in person.
1132 Orchard Glen Park Road.
- John ...
- Flee!
Jesus Christ man!
We take a look at dirt.
What are you doing?
"Yes, I hazırlıyorsun papers."
I love the computer.
"A real angel of death, believe me."
"Yes, I'd be more optimistic than we used to."
"Okay, Pete."
"All gone, tell him."
- Well ...
It's because of the surgery.
Do you think?
Yes.
I don't know.
How would you feel if you had undergone such an operation?
I don't know.
She is not like our mother.
Play it again.
Loads of kisses from me.
I can't wait to be back.
Pull up your blankets and close your eyes.
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
Goodnight.
Get mom.
Mom?
Lukas?
Lukas?
- Hello?
"- Hi, good morning."
That was a huge order.
So many at the same time.
- Throwing a party?
- No.
Who are all those pizzas for?
"Pepperoni, Pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"""May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel,"
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"Thanks, honey."
Not a word to Raziya.
"Okay, honey."
"If you ask me, Mom was a spy."
"She grew up in Algeria, right?"
- And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year?
- Yeah.
She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad.
Do the math.
Dad was in Intelligence.
- He was a cook in Intelligence.
- That was his cover story.
So the Algerian spy got her pregnant?
- Maybe he was an Arab.
- God forbid.
Maybe she was the spy.
Or a murderer.
Ever see her kitchen cleaver?
- I know.
She was a Nazi hunter.
- What?
Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz?
Since when did she have family in Oschwitz?
It was an educational tour.
We're Jews.
"Unless your father is a little Arab spy,"
- which makes you...
- No problem.
Good luck.
Can't push the chair.
- Hey.
LAURA:
"Hey, Johnny."
KELLY:
How was the ski trip?
LAURA:
"Oh, yeah, it was fun."
- You knock them dead?
- I never got you out there.
That was always a big regret for me too.
- Does Greg Medavoy seem off his game?
- Why?
He seems a little depressed.
"- Yeah, he's got a domestic situation."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Do you want to go out for dinner?
"- Sure, what's the occasion?"
- No occasion.
"- Okay, your call."
- Tonight?
- Fine.
- I'll talk to you later.
See you later.
Martinez will be with you at arraignment.
We think you'll get a recognizance release.
He'll see you home.
It's better if you carry me down.
"Yeah, the chair nearly went over coming up."
Let's pick him up.
"All right, now."
"Here, we're gonna start weight training."
First things first...
Squats.
Okay.
That's it.
"Uh, that looks really heavy."
Look.
This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.
We gotta really get into it.
It's gonna hurt.
"- Yeah, but I can't lift that."
- Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.
Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.
Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.
Look.
You wanna fight like a man?
You gotta train like a man.
"Now, come on."
Gimme a squat.
- Ready.
Go!
"- Oh, my God!"
- Go.
Keep it up.
"- Daddy, I can't."
- It's...
I can't.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Doctor Gilbert Venin, I presume?"
"Shit Livingstone, asshole?"
Your finger's on the pulse.
Mickey the Arab wants a word with you.
I'm very expensive.
"- Playing for keeps, or you got the creeps?"
- Don't you worry.
We're in a pest controlled area.
What's on Mickey's agenda?
Disneyland!
- That's gonna be tough.
"- No, a straight split."
"Tomorrow, midnight, where you want, ladies as witnesses, face to face, all holds barred."
It's high time.
"You shit flies, keep buzzing around Mickey."
"If he ever comes out of the Casbah, he'll regret his mad wanking."
"He's not mad, he's here!"
Skedaddle!
Oh my!
Oh my!
Your what?
Do you have an aspirin?
Your lovely brothers.
"Simon and Edgar, for instance."
out of your league.
Forget it.
Edgar. 5 am.
Blow deal.
Rue Lenine.
In Charenteuil.
That's our turf.
Sure you've got no aspirin?
Some of the kids at school told the police...
-...that you and Taylor didn't get along.
-Yeah.
But I never wanted to kill her.
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
[SIGHS]
A couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you happen to smell anything?"
"Anything, like what?"
Like rotten eggs or sulfur?
No.
"Okay, um...."
Did you notice any black smoke?
"What, are you crazy?"
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
The way she talked about being there mentally but not physically.
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
-Kind of?
-She didn't see any black smoke.
Or smell sulfur.
Maybe she's not a demon.
Kids can be vicious.
"Well, I mean, we're already here, might as well check out the school."
Right.
The school.
-What?
"-Truman High, home of the Bombers."
No!
Not again.
Get...
Go back!
Frank.
Frank.
"Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream."
You were having another kid.
"Maureen's the last one, right?"
Tell me she's the last one!
She's the last one.
"Oh, thank God."
It was horrible.
This baby had teeth!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
"Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now."
"So, heat it is."
"Frank, we'll get through this."
We always do.
I'm here for you.
The kids love you.
Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
"And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm gonna go downstairs.
"Oh, Sue, don't do that."
I haven't showered in days.
"I meant the kitchen, Frank."
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
Only if I get hit by a bus.
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"- Anna, your face."
- It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb under the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"Twenty-seven vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
"Hey, Bethanne."
What are you guys watching?
You've been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
- Mm.
"Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
"Anna, are you hungry?"
Did you want a little?
"No, thank you, Miss Gibbons."
Why don't you lay down and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?"
A medical friend?
-Why it interests so much to you?
-Or a medical friend?
And if outside thus?
"So that by your part, we have finished."
You were wanted who it.
"In agreement, but I can run?"
no?
-Until the shutdown of the street car.
-In agreement.
"It starts, damn it."
-It does not start?
"-No, it does not start."
First you invite to me and soon it does not start.
You had to fail to me indeed now?
Eh!
taken care of!
-I do not touch myself.
"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.
For here.
-Let go of the hair. let it go!
- You will never change.
"We go, only I have requested you a little kiss."
-You kiss with the hands.
"-But, only with one."
What do you want?
-To where you go?
They see here.
We speak.
It vetoes the devil.
You have what you deserve.
She can't be.
She never goes out.
KNOCKING
Hiya!
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
"It's Melissa, isn't it?"
Yeah.
I'm Peggy.
This is Elaine.
I know.
OK if we come in for a sec?
"Yeah, sure."
You have the most incredible skin!
Have people told you that before?
Not really.
So pretty it glows.
Let's open that other bottle.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
The drawer nearest the fridge.
"(If you don't want to do it, just say no.)"
CORK POPS
"Did I mention, this woman is a genius with a lens?"
PEGGY CHUCKLES
"She will make you look better than you have ever looked,"
I guarantee it.
"And if she can't, hell, everything we do is airbrushed, anyway."
I don't think...
I don't really...
We have a deadline.
And there's literally no-one else we can ask.
As a neighbour?
I like pain of every kind.
Needles through my nipples.
Needles in my back.
I've had two needle corsets.
"Blows of all kinds, with marks, without marks."
Slaps.
"Verbal humiliation, being scolded."
That sort of thing.
I can free my mind.
totally let go.
And simply enjoy.
Simply be myself.
It's wonderful.
I need it.
Bend over it.
Spread your feet.
As wide as you can.
Nice.
- Do you like whips?
"- Yes, Master Walter."
Count out loud.
- One.
- Good.
Two.
Three.
I met my first husband when I'd just turned 15.
We were together 7 years before we married.
For me the marriage was like a death sentence.
In quotations.
He thought I was his property.
That's how he treated me.
He beat me when he was drunk.
"Yeah, actually, Gibbs..."
No.
That's it.
Thanks.
We should have told Gibbs.
Later.
"Come on, McGee, answer."
Aren't you gonna get that?
Yes?
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.
Okay.
Yes?
The air marshal I mentioned before--
I need you to dig up anything you can on him.
Name is Mike Beers.
"Well, that could take a while."
TSA personnel files are always tightly wrapped.
What's this about?
Bishop knows the guy from somewhere.
She's trying to figure out why.
"Soon as you can, McGee."
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
Just do it.
Is everything okay?
What took so long?
"The air marshal, where'd he go?"
"He's, um... the charging station."
"What was that about, Tony?"
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs until we're sure about this guy.
Sure about what?
"Well, that joke I told back there."
You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"- That's what really scares you, isn't it?"
- Stop it.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going nowhere.
- Shut up!
Shut up.
Youshouldhavecalledmum.
She's all that's left.
- You abandoned her.
"- No, no, no, no!"
Get out of my head!
You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.
You'll never see your mother again.
You're going nowhere.
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.
You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
- Yes.
- Listen.
- Yes.
See that boy sitting there.
Yes Big Boss.
- Give one to him too.
- Yes.
I don't have money.
I didn't ask for it.
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.
Here.
Take it son.
Hey boy.
Won't you thank the Big Boss?
Offering water to the thirsty is a good deed.
And you've earned a merit because of me.
So should I be thanking him or will he thank me?
I must admit.
He's no ordinary boy.
Because he talks about common sense.
I forgot Lallan.
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.
And you Dushyant.
Why don't you setup a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?
You made a big mistake... taking up enmity with Dushyant.
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axe...
And all of North India... won't be able to put you back.
Hey boy let's go.
Stop.
"I know with our history, you'll think I made this up--"
"Andy, what?"
"Now, an incident has occurred at my apartment. lt's not fit for visitors."
-l don't believe this.
-You wanna know what happened?
-No.
"-Hey, John, good morning."
"I've heard about fungus in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--"
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?
What happened?
"Well, I have a very bad gas leak."
"Now, I called the gas people."
There is no way I'm gonna feel comfortable exposing you to danger.
-We're back to square one?
-We are definitely not at square one.
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a changed man. I have a dangerous leak.
"That's all we're talking about here, now."
"You want some advice, Andy?"
Get it fixed.
WOMAN:
Mike?
Roberts?
-Mike Roberts around?
I gotta see Mike.
DONNA:
He's not here.
Mike?
"-Hey, Roberts."
-Excuse me.
"Yo, how long you two been married?"
Come on.
Play ball.
"Okay, all right, time-out."
Time-out.
My time.
"You, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"No, I've played once or twice."
Yeah?
"Yeah, I mean, I can see that."
"It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better."
You know what?
"Football was my sport, okay?"
Yeah?
Now you tell me that?
"Hey, you ready to quit?"
- No.
- Yes.
- Which one is it?
"Can you just give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right?"
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh?"
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
"All right, I can do that."
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge, here it is."
A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube.
"Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that?"
It's a man's hat.
- Maybe Morn bought it for Dad.
"- Yeah, right."
"Anyway, this is what we have so far."
1.
The picture. 2.
Dates of Mom's trips.
3.
Algeria - black hole.
"And, oi course, Aunt Rosa."
She's obviously hiding something.
The conclusion is:
We have a father and we need to find him.
And the conclusion is:
"There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them."
"""Have a father must find him!"""
"Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either."
Don't pretend.
"What are you getting at, Shai?"
"Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight."
Maps.
Even new swimsuits.
The hotel has a pool.
You are nuts.
He's nuts.
We fly a week before Passover.
- I can't.
"- You're on vacation from school and Dorona, you're free now anyway."
- But...
- I spoke to Raziya.
You told Haziya?
Hadn't you better catch him up?
You don't want him taking the hump again.
"Oh, lord, he could be anywhere."
I'll see you at Popmobility.
Thanks for everything!
Bye!
Bye.
"You'll have to take the lift, love."
"Oh, flip."
It's all right.
You don't have to fling me into the gutter by the seat of my trousers.
It's not the Beano.
"Quick as you can, boys."
Up over there!
Who is it?
Sir!
"It's Jimmy Baker, he's up on that ledge."
Everyone shush!
"He's too late, though, isn't he, sir?"
"Because he didn't come on the tram, sir."
"Climb over, jump down, I'll catch you!"
Look lively.
Is everything all right over there?
Get in your place!
"Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton."
Baker was just helping me up.
"Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge."
Good man.
I was Naval Reserve.
North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.
You said Baker hadn't turned up.
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?
"Man, where the gefilte fish at?"
It's in the fridge.
That shit's perishable once it's open.
"They ain't in the fridge, man."
"Hold on, man, I know I put that shit in the fridge 'cause don't nobody want no hot-ass gefilte fish."
"Just like I said, right behind the peanut butter."
"Ain't no peanut butter in here, man, just yogurt."
"- Where the fuck are you, Ricky?"
"- Where you think I am, man?"
"I'm in the motherfucking kitchen, bro."
I'm in the kitchen.
I don't see your ass.
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God!"
"Yo, TTD, call the cops."
There's a weird white kid in our house.
"What house are you in, Rick?"
- Ricky?
- Uh...
- Ricky?
"- Oh, shit."
- Ricky.
- Boy:
"I know who you are, asshole."
- You're not gonna get away with this.
"- TTD, call Spencer."
( car alarm chirps )
"Wayne, Wayne!"
( panting ) Wayne!
"Well, look what the breeze finally blew in."
"Better late than never, though, right?"
It was just a question of time.
"Shall we go, son?"
Now?
You wouldn't want to worry Mama.
"No, I wouldn't."
Take good care of him.
"Oh, he'll be taken care of."
I don't want to go.
"Why, Wilbur?"
"Yes, tell her why."
"Well, because, you see, I'm not really a little..."
I like it here.
I want to go to school here.
This is a girls' school.
That's why I like it here.
"Now, Wilbur, you mustn't hurt your father's feelings."
"You wouldn't do that, would you, Wilbur?"
No.
You know how sensitive I am.
He's very sensitive.
"You're choking him, Mr. Hoolick."
Oh.
(COUGHS)
"Come along, son."
You don't have much time.
"It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Hoolick."
"It's been very nice meeting you, Mrs. Brendan."
"Goodbye, Wilbur."
"Don't say that, Mrs. Brendan!"
"All right, you."
Where is it?
Why did you tell Mrs. Brendan you're my father?
- It's at Jay-Mo's Diner.
- [Siren wailing]
[Coughing]
[Siren continues wailing]
[Grunting]
[Tires screeching]
[Coughing]
[Tires screeching]
- Backup's on the way.
- There isn't time.
"All units, 565 East Jefferson."
"I repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
This is Lieutenant Al Garner requesting available fire and EMS units.
We got a man inside.
Requesting additional alarms.
"- Repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
- [Coughing]
[Man] BP's 84 over 36.
[Garner] The owner's car was stolen.
I need to ask him some questions.
- He's in and out of consciousness.
- [Labored breathing]
I'm with the FBI.
Can you give me a thumbs-up for yes and a thumbs-down for no?
Did Kaman Scott do this to you?
We have 15 minutes to get him to the hospital.
Do you know this girl?
Tracy.
Tracy.
Don't let him...
- Please stop him.
- Is Tracy nearby?
My Barefoot Cinderella.
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
And then you'll say do you wanna take a chance.
And stay with me forever.
No one'll ever be more beautiful.
"My barefoot, barefoot Cinderella."
[Audience cheering]
[Music stops]
You rocked.
Not hard when I'm with you.
"Hey, hey, hey."
I'm Hannah.
Hannah Montana ladies and gentlemen.
And apparently her new boyfriend.
Why is it always the guitar player?
Why not a nice cameraman like my nephew Lenny?
"But seriously, I'm happy for you Hannah."
And what's your name?
"Ah, you don't wanna know my name."
Come on.
You kissed her on national TV.
What are you shy all of a sudden?
Come on what's your name?
-Jesse.
-Jesse!
There you have it.
Hannah and Jesse America's new sweethearts.
Good night everybody.
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
Bye.

"there you are, my little worker bee."
Second one's almost there.
- Cool.
- And this device I invented... will monitor the vibrations of the audience.
- That's great.
- Just keep the music coming... from the baddest jazz trio in D.C.!
And I got some women lined up for you.
"Michael, I told you."
I don't want to meet anybody.
"Come on, Jeff."
You got to get over Stacy.
It's been four months since you broke up.
"You got to move on, experience life."
- You're right.
"- Anyway, first show..."
Debra's bringing her cousin Denise.
"She's kind of fat, but she's got a cute face."
"Cool, cool."
"Second, Anita's bringing her girl."
Says she's a ten.
- A ten?
- Uh-huh.
"Without a weave, she's a six."
That's cool.
I got to go.
Warden.
Just appease her.
"With this baby here, you won't be here much longer."
"Move over, Wynton Marsalis."
Cool.
"Aren't you going to say excuse me, Dre?"
Excuse me.
"Thanks again for calling, Mr. Reed."
Not when he's your dad and he acts like your diary is part of the collective unconscious.
Wait.
"Sorry, I keep thinking about people sitting on this couch talking about being sexually abused."
That's what makes it fun.
You're a good kisser.
Am I a manly kisser?
Do you want to go to my prom with me?
N.Y.U. has proms?
Shit.
I'm drunk.
I should be honest with you.
I don't go to N.Y.U.
- Where do you go?
Hunter?
- St. Anne's.
The high school?
How old are you?
- Old enough.
- Wait wait.
"You want me to go to your senior prom, right?"
You're 18?
"- No, junior prom."
- You're 17?
- 16.
- 16 years old?
But I'll be 17 in two weeks.
You're 16?
"Oh my God, oh my God."
Don't freak out.
I haven't been a virgin for almost a year.
I probably know more about sex than you do.
"I know plenty about sex, okay?"
(BAYARD sniffing )

"Reason is the Salty Treat blew out an amp the other day, rockin' out pretty hard to some Lifehouse covers, which will happen."
"So, I'm pickin' up the slack."
I'm happy to do it.
Way she goes.
I'm Lisa.
Are you ever.
Look at you!
It's America's little sweetheart over here.
You're like a little Katy Heigl or like a little Katy Hudson.
What can I get ya?
Do you have cookies and cream?
Do I...
Do I have cookies and cream?
I sure do have cookies and cream.
(SIGHS) And I'm thinkin' maybe a vanilla-fudge swirl chunk for Mr. Newman over here?
"- That'll do, thank you."
- Okay.
And you're gonna keep an eye on little Caty Blanchett here
- for me till I get back?
- Sure will.
Thank you!
Be right back!
"- So, you're a farmer, Wayne?"
- Can confirm.
You don't smell like one.
(CHUCKLES) I'm kidding.
I'm a pre-school principal.
Do you like kids?
- Hmm...
"- I know, everyone likes kids."
They're so silly.
"65,000 children."
That's more than are born in Denmark in a year.
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.
- What do you get out of this?
- Nothing.
I keep my good life.
I buy remission for my sins.
And we're almost family.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm assuming you're interested.
"Yes, damn it."
Of course I'm interested.
"Jacob, stay here."
You'll get to know Anna better.
You could take out Helene for dinner.
I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.
We're going fishing.
"You're a strange man, Jorgen."
She has to eat.
She's a terrible cook.
"- Take care of yourselves, okay?"
"- We will, mother."
- Don't lose too much online.
- I won 235 dollars last night.
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.
- Mom did it up wrong.
- We can't have that.
There.
Hop inside.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Impossible!
The enemy?
Hi!
You've got some nerve!
Isn't that the warning alarm?
Shut up!
You horny robot!
Let's hurry.
"Yes, but this may be a false alarm..."
"See you later, Romlin."
"But, I would like to continue..."
Is everything okay?
"Yes, all hands are preparing for battle."
What's going on?
Nobody's attacking us...
"Right, Manami?"
I doubt they've retreated.
Here it comes.
Are you really going?
Disengage Dimension Code Protection.
Manami!
"Condition level, rapidly deteriorating."
How's the pilot?
"Flail, do you read?"
Flail!
It's no good.
There's no response.
It has incredibly fast reaction time.
Who is this enemy?
I'll leave the rest to you.
Keep calling out to her.
Who is it?
It's Gargan.
Long distance.
- Huh?
- Gargan.
- At this hour?
- Yeah.
"Hello, Mr. Gargan."
"Oh, listen, Thompson, I'm gonna be out of the state for a week or 10 days."
"Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Gargan."
We'll miss you.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
"But listen, I gotta make a business trip."
"When I come back, I'm gonna have a conference with the governor."
- You get me?
"- Sure, I understand, Mr. Gargan."
"I don't know how long it's gonna take me but meanwhile, I want you to get this straight."
I want everything run just exactly as I left it.
No changes.
"If there's any argument, whatever Miss Griffith decides, goes."
You understand?
- Is she around there now?
- No.
"I think she's in her cottage, Mr. Gargan, I could get her for you if--"
"No, no, that's all right."
Never mind.
Just tell her I called.
"Yeah, so long."
"And remember, no changes."
"All right, Mr. Gargan."
"Yeah, I understand."
"Take it, son."

"Go,"
I am coming too.
You go to their home yourself and tell his mother.
"- Zaer, I do have to play kettledrum_"
- God willing.
What do you mean by God Willing?
Yes or no?
God willing means god willing.
"No Zaer,"
- It's not my answer.
- Definitely yes or definitely not.
"- I said ""God willing""."
"- I said ""definite answer""."
"You are repeatedly saying ""definitely""."
"If you want a definite answer, its been ""No""_"
"So why would you say ""God willing""?"
"Just say no, at first_"
- Just No. now I am relieved?
- No.
"Come on, take it."
Shush
"Thank you so much, sorry to disturb you."
- Goodbye.
This was a dream come true.
I'd landed a custom '66 Mustang.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ] There you go.
I knew I had to go easy on her if I wanted a good tip.
But I had to take a shot.
How drunk are you?
[ Laughs ]
"Had a few, I'd say, at least."
[ Engine revs ]
"Oh, I will have you home in no time, my friend."
Done.
[ Laughs ]
"I don't want you to baby this thing, all right?"
You have nothing to worry about.
Seriously.
[ Both laugh ]
"Oh, that's sweet."
This was great.
"If I could just keep him happy and not wreck his car, a healthy tip would be in my future."
Don't baby that clutch.
Come on.
Give it a little gas.
[ Engine revs ]
[ Tires screech ]
Perfect.
[ Laughs ]
There's no way Rutledge was having this much fun.
You're the best driver that I have had yet.
Wood:
This was an inside job.
"So I'm gonna get to see you sometime this week,aren't I?"
I don't know.
[giggling]
I guess that's a yes?
[laughs]
Get your hands up.
Don't--don't shoot us!
Give me the bag!
Now!
"Okay, okay."
Give it to him.
Give it to him!
The purse.
Give it to me.
He's gone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
(Leo) The receptionist's alibi checks out.
She was outta here by 10:45 last night.
Same with Marla's assistant.
Her roommate said that she was home all night.
That leaves only two people.
Marla and Gus.
Can you think of any reason that an artist would want to steal his own art?
Publicity.
There are more reasons for a gallery owner to do it.
Insurance.
Selling the work without having to give Gus a cut.
Maybe you should talk to Ms. Saffer some more.
You can't actually believe I took Gus's work.
What would you believe if you were me?
For coming.
"Honey, we discussed this."
Just come tomorrow and help with lunch.
I keep my nose out of Dorona's business.
I'm afraid she'll hit me.
It's time to go.
"Come on, honey."
I'll drive you home and come back.
I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-.
"It's ok, I'll close the door."
- Were you smoking?
- No.
Liar.
Give me one.
- Where's the pack from?
- They're Mom's.
"Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak."
- Mom smoked on Sabbath?
- Where did you come from?
She promised not to smoke on Saturdays.
- It's cold.
- Did you take them home?
Kobi has an ear infection.
They don't need to be here.
- Where's your pervert friend?
"- Stop it, Natanel."
On the way to Frankfurt.
- Really?
Is he a flight attendant?
"- No, he's a lawyer."
Why?
I thought you were all flight attendants.
You know that.
Do not want to get involved with them.
He lived for the club!
-And Died for him too!
-My Condolences.
Thank you.
My condolences.
He was a good man.
-I Can send flowers?
-Of Course.
Thank you.
My condolences again.
Let the memorial later if you want.
They will make a memorial at the club and want me to be there.
-You Can stay with Jimmy?
"No, you will not."
"You can be a cop, but you can not order me around."
We can have it.
Let's leave it.
Health then.
-It Was a beautiful funeral.
-Yup.
He was a very good people face.
"He was like a brother to me, you know?"
'You just said that.
"Yes, but he was there."
I do not sit and stare at someone kill my brother.
Raymond!
Free your mind.
Preserves you!
Sorry about that.
-Get It.
Josie!
Jim!
"Look, josie."
1621/2. i got 'em cornered.
I got all the gold there is!
"They've got to buy from me now, at any price i name."
Here it is.
Gentlemen!
President grant is releasing unlimited gold from the united states treasury!
The gold corner is broken!
Jim fisk!
Let's get jim fisk!
Luke!
Line up the soldier boys.
We're marching on wall street to show 'em who's king!
"Jim, come here!"
"Jim, look!"
There's something wrong!
"Jim, what's happened?"
"I... just lost a bet, josie."
"We're not gonna march today, luke."
We're never gonna march again.
"I'm broke, josie."
Jim fisk is busted.
I'm right back where i started.
"Jim... don't worry about me, josie."
I'm all right.
"I was just laughing to think that for the first time in his life, nick was smarter than i was."
And i thought i was bigger than anybody else.
"Don't you worry, josie."
You've got yours.
See how smart i was to make you take all those things i gave you?
Split!
Where to?
Come here!
Don't stand and watch!
Get her!
"Bravo, aunt!"
That was wonderful!
Maa!
Remember your Maa now?
"Always remember her, before you touch another woman."
You can even remember me.
"Sure, Mom!"
"Call me ""aunt""...not Mom!"
"You were great, young lady!"
"Thank you, Laxmi."
What for?
This is my duty.
Not for the juice.
You did me a great favour yesterday.
You have protected my children like a member of the family.
"They're dear to me, too."
"Anything could have happened, if you were not there."
The worthless doctor just fled!
And I was thinking of getting him married to Janki.
I've changed my mind!
The doctor does not deserve Janki!
Have you asked Janki too?
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.
Maybe she loves him.
She was in love with that idiot of a film-man too!
But what happened?
- I don't know what he knew.
This is crazy.
"You're saying Dad hid one of his kids from us for years and then gave Holly the land, so his affair is thrown in our face because of some girl named Rebecca?"
I wish I could tell you what he was thinking.
- It's a shock for me too.
- I don't know why.
- He lied about having a mistress.
- That's not fair.
Why should I be so shocked that he lied to us too?
This whole family revolves around lying.
"- Justin, please!"
- Grandma!
Aunt Kitty!
- Hi.
"- Hi, Grandma."
- Hi.
Hi.
"- Hey, guys."
"Hey, sweetie boy."
"Hi, guys."
- This is wonderful.
- Joe.
"- Hey, Nora."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Kitty."
- I can hardly pick you up.
Please help me understand how you could discover your father has another child and not tell me?
- We were trying to spare you the pain.
- How?
By keeping me in the dark?
God.
You should've seen Justin's reaction.
Just army.
"Why are you here, Harper?"
You boneheaded Paddy!
So...
"The Chosen Men, eh?"
Well...
I didn't choose you.
But remember this
I know you all i've always known you you and your kind all my life
All I know is how to fight.
"So if there's any man amongst you expecting a quick ramble through this war, now's the time."
Be sure now.
Right.
Join the column.
"At the double, left face!"
Trail arms!
Quick march!
Halt!
"Company, halt!"
"It's that way, sir."
We'll wait for dawn.
Sergeant Williams!
Sir!
- We'll make camp now.
- Sir!
"All right, lads, make camp."
"Fletcher, Jones, Edwards - fetch firewood."
Morris and Brown - sentries.
Column dismissed!
Not you Sharpe
Take your men up that slope and see what the terrain is like for tomorrow.
"Well, you heard him."
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.

Im not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
We are moving.
What do you mean?
"The factory is cutting back, There is no work for Rolf."
He got an offer as an mechanic in Notodden
And i have got a job on the bag production factory.
What does Lise say to this?
Do she want to go?
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think
I could get more more money for the house if I did some work in the backyard.
"Why are you telling me this, Peter?"
"Look, I don't want you to worry about these... decisions."
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
"Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way, but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood."
Okay.
I won't.
"So... we're making this work, right?"
"Oddly, yes, we are."

"Daniel, help!"
"Larry, Kim."
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
I did sort of a half get-up there.
"- For my niece, fake niece..."
- I should've done a full stand.
I think a full get-up would've...
It's the thought that counts.

"You know, I mean, I could take a look at it."
I'm not really...

Huh?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
What's all... what's all that?
Look at all his gifts.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to bring a present.
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.
- Hello.
Johnny was she sleeping with him?
"If I'd have seen something like that, I would tell you."
You think that maybe he was just an old friend?
That's all there was?
We didn't talk.
He didn't seem impressive.
I handed him an envelope.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He's gone and he knows not to come back.
"You know, that would be just like her."
"You see, you know, always looking to help someone."
"I'm dying, John."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"It's gonna be okay about this guy, so forget about it."
- I let Jimmy down.
"- No, you didn't."
He's gonna die now...
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
"- Listen to me, he knows you love him."
"And all he wanted was a little more time, where it didn't hurt so bad."
And he's gonna get it.

"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.

[ Lounge Piano ]

Yeah.
"Would you, please, be so kind to describe them... to better understanding of how good it looks now?"
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the elbow... and the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"The skull was dented in and there was this, um..."
"His eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shredded to pieces."
Just all right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little extraneous.
Stay close.

Hurry up!

"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
Come on.

What do you mean?
I just...
"I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her."
"Blair, she's been kidnapped..."
I know.
She's probably traumatized.
"I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right?"
I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet.
You're basing all of this on nail polish?
Yeah.
Did you get a good look?
Yeah.
I know.
I think so.
Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped.
How do you know it?
"It doesn't matter, I just..."
"I think, I think maybe we should tie her up."
Tie her up?
Are you listening to yourself?
She's been tortured.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
Are you guys robbers?
"Sorry, Vivian, we..."
Who told you we were robbers?
Your leader.
He wasn't very good.
Connor.
I think it's my fault.
I think I took a wrong turn.
I don't know.
- Even money Stoker don't go the distance!
- Twenty says he does!
"I'll take that, and as much more as you got!"
Break it up!
Come on!

Stoker don't like it there!
Who does?

Cop a Sunday?

Can't you take it?

"Yeah, I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea."
"Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch."
So you have no idea where Ryan might've gone?
I don't know.
He did say something about going down to Mexico and gambling on cockfights.
"I mean, I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys..."
Quit joking around.
Will you answer his question?
"Yes, I did."
I really don't know.
I do not know the guy.
I never got the chance.
"Hey, there's eggs."
"Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check."
Does Caitlin really need a pony?
"In a couple of months, she's not even going to like horses."
What?
!
I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.
We're not giving up China.
"Now go wait in the car, sweetie."
Mommy will be right with you.
"I'm sorry, kid, I, uh,"
"I don't know, man."
6 months on the sidelines.
I guess I still have a few blisters where I used to have calluses.
I don't think that's what this is.
"Oh, no?"
Then what is it?
You're about to be a dad.
You know?
You have to expect the world to start to feel different.
It just feels so hard.
Not as in difficult.
Literally hard.
Like asphalt is hard.
Like pavement.
And children are soft.
Yeah.
Defenseless.
That's why every day we try to make this world a little safer.

So what do we know?
"Our father's dead, daughter's missing, but we may have caught a break here."
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.

"Oh, shoot, I didn't bring enough double-stick tape."
Could you run down to the storage room and grab me some more?
Me?
"Yeah, I'd go myself, but I have nice shoes on."
"Oh, nice shoes."
"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
I get all my shoes at the car wash.
She works at a car wash?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
[GRO ANS]
"God, my shoes are nice."
I spent $40 on these shoes.
"- Oh, God, I hate those women."

All women.

- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.

"Well, legend says that it's hidden in the Tower of Fear."
"And, uh, the Greek word for ""fear"" of course, is, uh Thera."
"Uh, where's the picture?"
There-
- There--
There was a picture.
The picture.
Where's the picture?
Yes.
I'll show you.
"Ah, here we are."
"Yes, here we are."
That's it.
"And there I am, MacGyver."
"There I am with your grandfather, and there is the Tower."
"Professor, you know that volcano is still active."
"Yes, I know."
But there are ruins near the crater.
Simon took me there once.
That's right.
A dual role?
!
No.
You will play a cook!
A cook even in films?
!
"There are songs, I hope?"
"You're going to the in-laws' place, not for a role."
Why send me there?
Will you have me released?
Not the cop-house!
My in-laws!
They need a cook.
Wow!
My head on the block?
!
But they're Brahmins!
"You must play a Hindu cook, although you're a Muslim!"
And cook what?
Biryani?
And paya?
Remove the meat from the rice and the dish turns vegetarian.
Don't worry.
"There's a woman working there, Aunt Laxmi."
She'll take care if you tell her you're my friend.
Folks there must be highly educated.
If I speak...
"Only if you speak, that is."
What does that mean?
Is Babu your name?
"What was that ""Ba"" and ""Bu""?"
"Not numerology, is it?"
It looks like there's some tidy minge here.
"Yes, it's tidy because there's no hair on it."
"Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there."
It's her who write your Valentine?
"Oh, yeah, shit."
She looks quite fit actually.
"Right, I'll go over and tell her you fancy her."
- No.
- Why?
"Well, you going over and telling her I fancy her, seems a bit, y'know, childish."
When in Rome.
That's how you got to play it with younger girls.
You go over...
"Shit, she's coming over here."
So did you get my valentine's card then?
"Oh, yeah, great."
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.
"No, I mean a proper drink."
Oh... right.
"Yeah, thanks."
You're fit.
- Sorry?
"- Oh, forget it."
Come on.
"You're well sexy, I used to stare at you in assembly."
Right.
"Ooh, you're so horny."
Tongue me!
"Um, how old are you?"
"Blimey, that didn't take long."
Why can't you compromise on something?
Anything?
Because then I'd be you.
A real Hollywood agent.
"I want to look like that French girl in ""Last Tango in Paris."" Oh."
Where are my heels?
"She had that hat, remember?"
It's black with the flower?
Clothes are not what I remember about that movie.
What?
You're nervous.
[scoffs] [laughs] It's cute.
You're cute.
Just cleaning my boots.
[sighs] [brush swiping]
"Do you love me, Nick?"
[laughs softly]
I wouldn't want to be on this ride with anyone else.

Doesn't matter.
See?
You keep to yourself some things too.
But it's not the same.
-Why not?
You're 13...
Daniel is 18...
I'm your father...
And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy!
"Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.."
And nothing else!
Had he kissed you?
I said nothing else.
Won't you have slept with him!
That's why you're worried.
The whole point was this.
It's not funny.
What if I'd answer yes.
Nothing.
What could I do?
Who knows..
The first thing would be telling mom.
Do you think I should tell her?
You should know.
So you've slept with him.
If you say so...
Want to make me angry?
That's what you said when I was little.
And what are you now?
If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this.
"It's true, but now..."
-Now everything changed right?
"J. D. , come on !"
"Go call an ambulance, man."
Go call a fucking ambulance!
I told him not to move.
Hurry up!
SANTANA:
Thought I knew it all.
Ended up in juvie hall.
And the shit got even deeper.

To the right.
Open up your mouth.
"Okay, pick your clothes up."

"Fuck, yeah."

"(panting) there'll be shit on my knife, not on my dick!"
Fucker.

"Damn you, you fucking asshole!"
Kill him !
Kill him.

SANTANA:
killing that first night got me the worst that juvie had to offer.
An extended sentence with a guaranteed bus ride to the big time as soon as I turned 1 8.

Deep breaths.
What are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
"Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down."
I...
I...
I thought you loved me.
I do.
For everything you've just done for Marcus and I.
Who is infected now?
"I know it hurts, mom."
- Please don't!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!
It has to work right?
Tell me it's gonna work!
I'm so thristy!
"I can smell him, he's right there."
"I'm so thirsty, honey, please!"
Why isn't this working?
"She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long."

"If you need anything, then..."

Morning.
I've come for Peter.
He's my son.
You want it.
Yeah.
Why can't you get better for me?
We had so much and it's all fucked up forever.
I'm so lonely.
I know.
Do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
Of course.
That's what love feels like.
What are you doing?
Lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
We're not...
Not in the way you're thinking.
Effy?
What's wrong?
It keeps happening.
OK.
Lie down.
- Do you mind?
- No.
"I like this story, anyway."
Thanks.
"""Orpheus was the greatest poet who ever lived."
"""His music was so beautiful that when he played rivers would stop flowing,"
"""winds would stop blowing,"

He's been lying to both of us this entire time.
Who is that?
I don't want to sell this house.
Me neither.
"Wait, stop."
- What is it?
- Mm.
Oh.
I just thought we were good.
You're right.
It's too soon.
Sorry.
You should be.
For thinking I want some lame missionary position.
"There's just something about bedroom sex that's... so predictable, you know?"
"So... so ""old married couple."""

Beds are for sleeping.
We were married?
I had no idea.
Oh.
"Oh, don't stop."
Don't stop.
Don't move.
Shit.
Who is it?
Hope this isn't a bad time.
"The phone, Adriana."
"You need something, call."
But then I wouldn't get to see your beautiful face.
"I don't think you are, Dad."
"You know who's in there, right, besides the little girl?"
Her mother and her father--Charlie.
That means he knows.
And that's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years.
They have to go.
"Dr Penzler, too."
I can't risk a leak.
It's too important.
They don't matter anymore.
It's all about Allie.
"You're not in charge here, Mary."
I am.
Take a step back.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"Just, the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous."
- They could really gum us up.
"- No one's getting killed here, Mary."
Of course not.
CYNTHIA:
I got to go to the bathroom.
Grab a cup.
Knock yourself out.
"Lisa, hows he doing?"
He's still breathing.
Are you all right?
I just don't want any more bad news.
Mr Watson?
"Luke, when he died, he wasn't mad at you anymore."
DALE:
"No, quite the reverse."
Knock-out drops.
Surely you've heard of them?
- For knocking out what?
- People.
Who else?
- You mean a sleeping draught.
"- I suppose so, but instantaneous."
"My dear madam, you're asking for a Mickey Finn."
- Am I?
"- We have a mild soporific here, if you're sleeping badly."
"I'm sleeping perfectly well, thank you."
Mickey Finn...
Mickey...
Thank you very much.
"Desiree, you are the expert on crime, how would one obtain a Mickey Finn?"
"Well, I get all dope on drugs from a little crook called Maury Fish."
He hangs around in a pub called the Limehouse Arms.
The Limehouse Arms?
Thank you very much.
(Piano music and chatter)
- Yes?
- Gin and...
"Port and lemon, please."

I want some Mickey Finns.

Not very.
DETECTIVE:
So how did you ID this Ray Malcolm?
DUD:
Neighborhood snoop across the street recognized Ray's car parked out front.
Did they see him?
"Mmm-mmm, but she did see a black guy with glasses come out a little while later, get in Ray's car, and split."
"She didn't even know Ray's last name, but she thought he was staying a couple blocks away with some dopers, so we checked it out."
Can you separate it?
Mmm-mmm.
Not yet.
That Ray's package?
So who's this black guy?
"They call him ""Pluto."""
"Evidently, he's been hanging with Ray for the last couple of weeks."
They say he's from out of town.
Pluto.
That's it?
For now.
So who's the girl?
Fantasia.
Bullshit.
Good-looking.
Ray's old lady.
Here...

"No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her."
There is nothing to forgive.
I thought you'd never get here.

"Thou dost stone my heart, and makest me call what I intend to do; a murder... which I thought a sacrifice:"
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him:
send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
- He hath confess'd.
"- What, my lord?"
- That be hath used thee.
- How?
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.
- He will not say so.
"- No, his mouth is stopp'd;"
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O!
my fears interprets:
"- what, is he dead?"
- Had all his hairs been lives... my great revenge had stomach for them all.
Alas!
He is betray'd and I undone.
"Out, strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face?"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!
"- Hay, if you strive."
- But half an hour!
"- Being done, there is no pause."
- But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
"My lord, my lord!"
"What, ho!"
It broke.
I don't know what happened.
"Oh, it's ok."
I'll fix it.
Unless you forget where you put it.
"Don't you worry, I'll find a perfectly safe place for it."
We're out of juice.
Norman.
Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
"Jess, come on."
I'm serious.
"Look, I feel bad enough about what my Dad did already."
Everybody's always giving Roman a raw deal.
He's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just...
I know you don't see it but...
He scares me.
And I don't trust him.
"Remember, I'm the one that caught him snooping in our bedroom."
"Come on, Jess."
He's not a bad person.
I plead his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
I can't do this for another 18 months.
We need to get him into a halfway house.
Alright.
"As soon as we find a place, he's out of here."
Hello.
Hey.
YOU LIKE ANGLES WITH THE TARGET ON YOUR RIGHT-HAND SIDE
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEFT-HANDED.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNEW I LIKED YOU.
PUT IT ON.

HUH?

PATHETIC.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.
LET'S GO.
WE HAVE A BIG DAY AHEAD OF US.
I'VE GOT TO TURN YOU IN.
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS.
IT WILL BE PAST LUNCH BEFORE WE'RE DONE.
TURN ME IN.
"A LOT OF SECRETS, A LOT OF ENEMIES --"
"I THINK IT WOULD BE A SHORT STAY,DON'T YOU?"
"NOW,DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT?"
I DON'T THINK SO.
"NOW,BE HONEST WITH ME."
IF CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DIFFERENT DO YOU THINK THAT WE COULD...
NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.
"MAYBE THE NEXT ONE,THEN."
THE INDICTMENTS CAME DOWN YESTERDAY.
THAT WAS QUICK.
"THEY FOUND A LEAK IN THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE,"
"AND EVELYN,WOW --"
THEY'RE GONNA BE WORKING UP HER FILE FOR YEARS.
"SHE WAS A VERY,VERY BAD GIRL."
I MANAGED TO KEEP YOU OUT OF IT SO FAR.
Why don't we let Dr. Lockhart present the case?
-Absolutely.
-She's disoriented.
She's repeating questions.
I just wanna get another CT.
-How long here?
-About six hours.
"Luka, your malrotation in Exam 4 is puking blood."
-l'll check back.
"-Yeah, well-- ls she responding to commands?"
Yes.

"When you say a truck, do you mean they were driving an SUV or a pickup?"
"SUV, it was blue or black."
It was definitely black.
"- Okay, Judy, we're going to sit you up."
"- Ow, my chest!"
"Did you see the driver or any of the passengers, ma'am?"
There were at least two of them.
"The driver was young, a teenager."
"White, black, Hispanic, Asian, what?"
White.
I'm not sure about the passenger.
Lungs are clear.
BP 112/78.
Or you're just acting blind to the truth that we're husband and wife!
And the way to Bela is the only thing I remember.
Can't you understand that?
"I don't want to understand it because I'm so tired of you, Migs."
"Well, I'm tired too."
I can't take it anymore.
One more chance?
I will change.
"If I would keep you hoping, you'll get hurt even more."
"Migs, I need you."
I'm begging you.
-I'm here for you now.
-What are you doing here?
.
This is wrong.
-Wrong!
-Wrong?
.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My heart and mind says you're the one I love.
You're the one my heart is screaming out.
"But what if, what if your memory comes back?"
How?
What if the accident really happened so I can come back to you?
.
I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What did she say?
.
"Hello, this is Joy."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
Yep.
"They're both cold, heartless war machines."
"Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
I hope my dad's all right.
I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
What about you?
I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq."
Looking for me?
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
"Yes, I did."
Stop!
He's mine.
You are not the true chief.
I am.
And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
"But Ms. Viola, there many dangers along the way."
"Hazard-no, challenges."

"Okay, find Uncle Ramon ..."
"Send him to bring friends, Adélie how he can."
-Is ...

The RE-MASH.
"Come on, Uncle Bud, we have too many fish to catch."
"-So, what news?"
-Ruins.
"Every corner, every direction, completely blocked."
There are rumors of people thinking the unthinkable.
"Noah, are calling The Iceberg's End."
-How to answer this?
-We will try again.
-We can not ...
Return- to seek hundred times.
-There is no escape.
"-Thousands of times if necessary, there is always a way out."
"It does have, and right there."
"Ice, no ice, but it has ice tone and testing ..."
Let me help you.
"Ready, you can go."
"Erik, no!"
Bounce!
"You saw, you saw?"
"Never, do it again."
"Father, I flew!"
-Erik.
-I flew!
"I beat my wings, was very quick."
Come on.
"One, two, three!"
Wow.
That train is not moving very fast.
This window won't open.
That's why we need to get back in there.
Could pick up the pace.
You're not going fast enough.
I am too going fast enough.
No job is done until the paperwork is complete.
Stand by.
Where the hell is Rudy?
Okay.
"Oh, boy!"
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, wow..."
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal.
Wow.
You're making...
Come on.
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.
Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up.
Hand you the chocolates?
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.
How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate?
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
Is it my forehead?
What?
Last week I told you my hairdresser said I had a big forehead.
"You said it was fine, but you were lying, weren't you?"
"To protect you, yes."
[Man chattering on t.V.]
"Hey, fellas."
Could I speak to Arthur in private?
He's for safety!
That's all.
Watch this part.

I'm comin'!
Coming.

Whatever can it be?

"Oh, thank you, Colonel."
It is only a very modest treasure chest.
"""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""."
- Will it not be too difficult for me?
"- Oh, by no means."
"You may find it even more exciting than ""The Mysteries of Udolpho""."
But I shall have hundreds of questions to ask you.
My children.
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.

Good.

Come in.

The war is like a time bomb for everyone who stuck their neck out.
How did you recognize me?
You said my name right away.
Your voice.
It hasn't changed.
"Like in the past, when you'd brief us before we'd go."
I'll visit again soon.
Maybe with good news.
"Whatever you'll do, good luck."
"The children would say ""Mazzel and broche""."
Ok.
Thanks.
More chicken and we're also out of orange juice.
"Ab, come on."
-Orange juice.
I like to have a full fridge.
In case something happens.
What happens?
-Anything.
War.
-You and your war.
There.
-Thank you.
Juice.
And juice.
I called you at the office earlier.
-I wasn't there.
And you weren't there yesterday or the day before yesterday.
That's true.
I was away for work.
-But they didn't know where you were.

"You know, show Migs why he fell in love with you."
I just find it so hard every time he sees me but he doesn't remember me.
But I can't make it obvious.
I have to hide it.
-It hurts so bad.
"-Sis, you can do that."
I have to carry on.
I'll show him why he loved me.
Take a bath.
"You know, this is where we had our second date."
And you always take something home for Raya and Mrs. Robles.
That's why Raya loves you so much because you always bring her food.
-It's because you keep bribing her.
-Is that so?
.
-Who were you talking to?
-It's Ara.
Later...
"I'll go to our house, I'll just get something."
-Do you want me to go with you?
.
Kevin.
I'm Frank.
Brad.
-Hey.
"-Oh, hey."
"Oh, God."
"Come on, come in."
Excuse me.
What do we do now?
Just ask her to...
you know.
You kids see a lot of hookers?
"No, this is our first one."
Why do you have a picture of Grace Kelley?
'Cause I'd like to be like her:
Marry a prince and never get old.
"When you take your clothes off for money, do you get cold?"
Depends on the room.
"I have this dream that I'm naked at school, and I have to get home without anyone seeing me."
"I have that dream, too."
"Last time I had that dream, there was an alligator chasing me."
You ever get that one?
Nope.
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Yes.
Are you married?
"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
The meter's ticking.
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!
"Now, how do you want to do this:"
standing up or on the bed?
"Yeah, here, want this?"
That should clear up the infection in about 24 hours.
"However, the world might look a little fuzzy to you for a while."
"Here, put these on, Paula."
It'll cut down the glare.
(JUDY SCREECHES)
Judy.
Take that-- that's my new hat.
For Pete's sake.
"Around here, all hats belong to people."
"But if you find one in the bush, keep it."
(CHATTERING)
- And where're you going?
"- Well, to make lunch."
"Lunch has already been prepared, courtesy of Jack, our new short-order cook."
"Well then, I better check on it."
I wonder how many ways you can boil eggs.
Chief cook and bottle washer.
"Boy, what a waste of talent."
Hmm.
(CHATTERING)
(CHATTERING CONTINUES)
(CHATTERING)
"Oh, for crying out loud."
Judy!
(SIGHS)
"Ok, Toto, enjoy the peel."
"Look, for once, please try to be a good girl, huh?"
Just today?

- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
"- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100."
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he?
Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
"Hang in there, Alma."
We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea.
You talk to them.
So.
"Newbies, huh?"
You don't wanna work here.
"- Haleh, get that dead body out of here."
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
"Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!"
"We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us."
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
JOHN:
It's really green as hell.
"You know, I'm a country boy, John."
That's a bunch of crap.
You were born in L.A.
Mmm-mmm.
Malibu.
(SIREN WAILING)
JOHN:
What the fuck?
Howdy.
Dale Dixon.
"Welcome to Star City, boys."
"We've got a full day, so if you'll follow me we'll get you unpacked and get you something to eat."
"As soon as I saw you drive by,"
I knew you were the boys from California.
"(TRUCK HORN HONKING) Cops look the same everywhere, I guess."
Follow me.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Oh, shit."
WAITRESS:
"That's three scrambled and a cold Bud, whole wheat, sausages."
You boys are in for a treat now.
"Say, Fern, can you bring us some extra biscuits, too?"
"Sure thing, Hurricane."
"Some more coffee, too, please."
She call you Hurricane?
Folks call me that.
I never have figured out why.
I figure we can wait up in the woods.
"When the bad folks show up, we'll put the stopper in the bottle like that."
They'll be sorry they ever heard of Star City.
Ahem.
"Okay, you're not helping, really, with my nerves here, so I gotta go."
Goddamn it.
"Hi, I'm Lucy Miller."
Um...
You must be Maggie.
I'll be representing you.
"I brought warm, comforting beverages."
Or what's left of them.
The rest is on my new white shirt that I wore to impress you.
"Uh, can we sit?"
Great.
Oh.
Sorry about your chips.
Um...
"Look, uh, yours is not a hopeless case."
Seems pretty hopeless to me.
Hm.
I can see that.
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
They do have your son's voice on the 911 call.
I don't even know what happened to me.
I didn't mean to scare him.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
"You know, um, I'm scared too."
You're scared?
This is my first day in the field.
That's comforting.
I volunteered.
I specifically wanted your case.
A charity case.
Because I think I can help you.
Is that what you want?
"If we stay around here, we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Very good.
Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
"Jimmy, I don't know."
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
Okay?
"As soon as you talk to him, e's got to call me."
It's very important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this.
It's a couple of thousands.
"- Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
"All right, all right, all right."
"So, what do you think?"
They see us?
"No, man, I think we're good."
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
"Oh, no."
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is...
Wait a minute.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
- What?
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
"Foon, that painted face did it."
That clown again?
The opera troupe might be involved.
I thought so!
You stay out of this!
"Marshal, if you need any help, just ask."
No need.
I'm the Marshal of seven provinces!
"When I'm on a case, I can withstand anything!"
"Reporting for duty, Marshal!"
I've arrested all the painted faces.
But I don't know who's the murderer.
Quiet!
Reporting for duty!
Who's the murderer?
Reporting for duty!
"Marshal, you've made a mistake!"
I've got to go on stage any time now!
- Snake Tongue!
- Here!
Are all the painted faces here?
Yes.
We got everyone.
What about him?
- He escaped.
- Numbskull!
- Useless...
- Reporting for duty!
Stop!
Make way!
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing?
A clown ba...
It's like a baby...
It's like a clown that is a baby.
- I said cl... clown baby.
- Mm-mmm.
You said baby clown.
- I don't even care.
- Yep.
"""Clown Baby""?"
What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?
"Bro, it's perfect."
Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.
He's gonna be a huge underdog.
- Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
- Exactly.
"- Oh, that's brilliant."
"- Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby."
"Oh, Dennis. 500?"
"That's all we got, dude."
You saw Charlie.
We turned that kid into an animal.
"Oh, yeah?"
Call me a Holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?
"Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true."
We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...
Wha...
Where the he...
Who took my shit?
I might have had some.
"What did you just say, you little bitch?"
I might have had some of your pills or whatever.
-It was New York.
-Johnny Sack?
What was it?
The fat joke?
I'm sure that didn't help.
Carmine.
"This HUD thing we're into, they wanted a piece of it."
I think they confronted Ralph...
-things went sour.
"-What'd he say, John?"
Wasn't what he said so much as what he didn't say.
We're talking about New York here.
Before we do anything in terms of a payback... you go to your people.
I want a full investigation.
Nobody makes a move until we know what happened.
You understand?
What the fuck?
-What's going on?
-Have a seat.
I'm Dominic.
"I know you don't know me, but...."
You're the guy who broke into Stew Leonard's that time.
You stole all those pork loins.
"Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today."
-We're here to talk about your drug problem.
-What?
"-Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?"
"-Sorry, baby, please."
"No, fuck this shit."
You were told once.
"Now, sit down."
Sit down.
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY:
"Shut up, Fitzgerald."
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Why?
"Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
Did he kill her?
"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY:
That's enough!
"You're forgetting your place, boy."
"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
HENRY:
"You move along, Fitzgerald."
That's an order!
Listen!
There's only a couple hours of light left.
We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
Let's go!

"Trauma panel, type and cross four units."
- He could've bagged his spleen.
"- Look, I'll get the other one."
- We need you here.
- We'll be there.
"- Now, Gallant."
- It's cool.
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.
"- Come on, let's go."
- You've got two doctors.
That's enough.
We've got a critical patient who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
- I
- I can't help that guy.
"- This is what we do, all right?"
"Now, get your ass in there."
Come on.
Come on.
"John, it's beautiful."
Absolutely beautiful.
Marriage can be a great thing.
- Can be.
- Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
"Right now, I'd like to see the chain the dog"
Was wearing in the park.
Greta's leash?
Why?
Mm.
"Grasping at straws, I guess..."
Nothing for you to worry about.
"Well, OK."
Sure.
OTIS:
"How is she, Greta?"
AUDREY:
"Oh, fine."
Maybe a little more restless than usual.
[Snarling]
Here it is.
What's important about the leash?
"Oh, nothing probably."
"You know, I'm just checking on anything."
Do you have a headache?
Yeah.
"It's an occupational hazard at my age, I guess."
Probably a lot of sinus too.
There's a lot of dust in the air today.
"Well, let me get you some aspirin."
Oh.
"If you would, uh, think this will be better."
"If it's a little seltzer, if you'd dump it in a small glass"
"Of water, please."
Sure How about some coffee?
"Uh, no, no."
No thanks.
I know it!
I know now!

What do you want?
Are you blind?
Just wait a second please.
No!
Please.
Sit here.
Let me examine you.
"Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!"
You want a fight?
That's fine with me.
Stop!
That's no way to treat a patient!
"I as just arranging your seat, Master."
What's wrong with you?
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!
I'm Huang Fei-hung.
I'll examine you.
Let me warn you first.
I've crippled several of my doctors!
Your pulse is weak!
Can you do something about it?
Of course!
No problem!
Back to normal now!
I'll get the money tomorrow.
You focus on the arrangements.
Are you done with the hospital arrangements?
I came here after paying the advance amount.
My brother's friends are with him at the hospital.
He is repeatedly asking to meet you.
"Once the transplantation is done,"
I will be the first person to meet him.
She is cooking a story to rob him.
Priya?
Are you crying?
"Thanks for being there, Vikram."
Be strong.
I'll be there for you.
Your company is all I need.
Everything will go smoothly.
Who is this woman?

Even I want to fall in love with her!
I'll pay.
What's your lover Vasundhara saying?
"Start, start..."

"Summer, you're okay !"
I am so glad to see you.
"Hey, where's Ryan ?"
He's...
Hey.
"Hey, Atwood."
I got to look for Pancakes.
"Oh, my God !"
Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
Seth.
Ryan.
"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
Michelle's pregnant.
Dad?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed my husband.
We're gonna get you in a cast later.
You can have everybody sign it.
"You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay?"
All right.
You want to talk about it?
No.
I can't.
All right.
Okay.
"I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me."
There's a lot of people that want to help you.
Okay.
"Well, maybe later."
All right?
You still playing soccer?
Yeah.
Starting fullback.
"Oh, yeah?"
Starting fullback.
"That's, uh..."
"Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer."
You could ask me about basketball.
I'm good with the basketball.
"Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries."
Is my dad gonna be okay?
Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
He's in good hands.
"Okay, so crits are stable."
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"""Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."" I wonder what's in there."
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens.
Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
"- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens."
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
"Now, listen."
"What we don't take, we ain't got."
Look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
"All right, whoever's in here, come on out."
"Come on out, I say!"
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids.
I heard them.
Come on out of there.
"Come on, you hoodlums."
You won't get away.
"- Come out, or I'll come in after you."
"- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now."
"Come on, Rocky!"
Jump!
"Hi, Snowflakes."
"- Hi, Jerry."
- Hello.
What do you hear?
Did anyone come to visit me?
who do you mean?
We are all here.
My friend.
Which friend?
Did anyone by the name Deepa visit me?
Deepa?
No.
No one like that had come.
Where is my phone?
Did she call me?
I need to talk to her immediately.
I'll leave.
"Sadhana, wait."
Where are you going?
He is asking about someone called Deepa.
I asked for my phone.
I need to talk to Deepa immediately.
I need to see her.
What is this?
Sadhana was the one who took care of you.
You didn't even talk to her.
"I will talk to her, later."
I need to talk to Deepa now.
Will you give my phone?
What do you think you are doing?
We have been praying for your recovery...
We have spent a lot of money and waited.
You must be happy for getting your vision back.
You are reciting someone random woman's name!
- What did you say?
What?
Possible.
After my careful analysis...
Possible?
No way.
"Excellent judgement, Marshal."
I traveled far for White Tiger.
So I leave this insignificant case to you.
I'll hold you responsible for your fail this.
Responsible?
Me?
Marshal!
You've come such a long way.
How about having dinner with me tomorrow.
Please...
We weren't invited to the restaurant's opening.
Why?
They've invited Huang Fei-hung.
Huang?
It's his birthday a couple days later.
Send him a birthday suit.
He'll like my suit for sure.
Is everything ready for my birthday?
"Everything is ready, Master."
Master...
A tailor's here to make a suit for you.
What?
Your birthday suit.
Show him in.
How come it's different tailor?
Ah To's away.
Let me take your measurement.
Fine.
I just wanna walk.
How is he?
"Well, he's doing pretty good, considering."
Do you think she ever really loved him?
It doesn't look like that matters.
"- Breathe, Harriet, breathe."
- I am breathing.
We need to come up with a better game plan for that next contraction.
You're doing just fine.
- Let's just have a look at you.
- Okay.
You're going to feel a little pressure.
A little pressure might be a nice change.
Where's Dr. Gettis?
He was due in here 10 minutes ago.
- I don't know.
I paged him.
- Get him in here.
- What is it?
- I need you to roll over on your side.
- I need Dr. Gettis right away.
- Okay.
Get that pillow down.
Yes.
- Don't push yet.
- What's happened?
Just something the doctor needs to look at.
They can't find him.
I've got Dr. Chadway.
"Doctor, we have a prolapsed cord."
The baby's heart rate is showing decels.
"Yes, sir."
"I love you, and nothing's gonna go wrong."

I won't let it.
"I love you, Bobby."

I have to get back to the club.
Hey.
"Come on, now."
"You don't want me to be late on the night I'm gonna elope, do you?"
"Diane, why do you have to go?"
Why can't we just get out-- Bobby.
"Bobby, I have to go back to the club."
"If I don't, Jessie'll be suspicious."
"Don't you worry, honey."
No man is ever gonna lay a hand on me again except you.
I swear it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.

Correct.

I'll show you an amazing trick.
I'm going to make this Pikachu disappear.
Wow!
What did you do?
It's gone.
We created a mini black hole ...at the micro level.
It's called a worm home.
Where'd the paper go?
"First, it became incredibly small."
"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."
Where's the other worm hole?
Wanna see it?

Why else would Louis choose Aramis particularly to be his personal guard?
He knows.
CONSTANCE:
You don't know that for sure.
The King has hated me for five years.
I know things have been difficult between you but...
Our marriage has been for public show.
"In private, he's ignored or slighted me at every turn."
You need to stay strong.
You're still the Queen of France.
Perhaps not for long.
Do you think that the King would want a scandal that could endanger the throne?
"The Dauphin is his son, the King could never admit to anything else."
I had hoped that everything with Aramis was over.
Forgotten.
"You're in big trouble, mister."
- No.
"Oh, God."
- Yup.
- You're gonna have to pay for it.
"- I told them, Officer."
"I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me."
That's good.

They got your commercial on TV up in Indian Ridge.
"It's 4:00 in the morning, but it's TV nonetheless."
You trick-or-treating?
Was wondering if you knew anything about Ken Mersey going missing.
"Yeah, what kind of trouble he got?"
"The considerable kind, I guess."
Ooh.
"Really taking yourself seriously in that uniform, ain't you?"
Don't mind going after an old drinking buddy like that?
"As far as I can see, he's under arrest."
If he's still alive.
How do you take your coffee?
I don't.
Well...
No sales being had.
No maintenance or repairs being had.
It's just a whole lot of nothing.
I haven't had a real need for Ken in the garage.
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.
He took them with.
He didn't say anything.
He just... went.
That don't sound like him.
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
People page.
Names...
"Karl W. Taylor, Eric Sawyer."
- Page thirty-three.
- Society world.
It's a photo of a couple that just got married.
Centerfold.
What does she do?
"She's an actress, a model... a dancer, and a dental technician."
She enjoys cooking and hip-hop.
"She's wearing a black bikini, and she's fine."
Yes!
What's her measurements?
Thirty-eight...
"After you touch it, it only lasts for thirty seconds."
You really got superpowers!
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
"- Man, this is wild."
- Check this out.
"Jeff, you were hit by a meteor."
Think anybody else got superpowers?
Larry?
"Larry, come in here."
Something's wrong with this TV.
"What's wrong, Mary?"
The channels keep changing by themselves.
They keep what?
Fix it.
It's this thing.
It's this right here.
"Oh, see, I know what's wrong."
I know what's wrong.
He's cute.
I know how to make him feel better.
"No, I know a better way."
Lift him up.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What are you doing this time, Jimmy?"
He's still conscious?
Yes.
Hello.
You'll be fine.
You just gotta get a little bit power.
"Ladies, could you give us a little space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
Here we go.
That's wonderful.
Now we can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you at the lab.
Hello?
"Oh, thank you."
They're Here.
They must have followed you.
I can't...
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry.
"I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time."
"Thank you, Sheriff."
But you know I can't go just yet.
"Well, why not?"
I'm not sure these tires can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
"Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?"
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
"Grazie, Mr. Lightning."
Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!
"I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!"
"All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got."
No!
"No, no, no."
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
"They say, ""Look at me!"
Here I am!
"Love me. """
"All right, you're the expert."
She thinks she's doing her job.
I am going to pull him from her class.
Don't overreact.
The agency said there was gonna be emotional scarring.
"Hey, give it back!"
How could you like to be his parents?
Where are my baby fish?
Mr. Michaelson bought them for his aquarium.
They were mine!
They were grown up.
It was time for them to have their own home.
You had no right to sell them!
"- Mikey, what's wrong with you?"
- They were mine!
Calm down.
They were only fish.
You don't care about how I feel.
You don't love me.
I hate you
Calm down.
Stop it.
"When Daddy gets home, we'll talk about it."
He's not my real daddy.
You're not my real mother!
I hate you!
I wish I never met you!
"Mikey, wait!"
( Door Slamming )
I'm sure there's an explanation.
If we could just get him to talk.
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.
He died of love.
"I mean, he must have been killed by a jealous lover."
Makes sense.
This was brutal.
"Marshal, could it be White Tiger?"
- According to my calculations...
"- Not him, right?"
- Could be.
"- Yes, yes."
- After serious consideration...
- It's him.
Not him.
The Marshal is right.
I came from the North to GuangZhou just to catch White Tiger.
Minor cases like this should be settled at your level.
"If you don't solve this, you'll come to regret it."
I'll regret it!
"Marshal, Marshal!"
"Marshal, you're here all the way from the North."
Come for dinner tomorrow.
- OK.
"- Please, please, please..."
"Sifu Tam, we haven't been asked to perform our lion dance at the start."
Why not?
They asked Wong Fei-hung.
Wong Fei-hung again?
His birthday's in a few days.
"Junior, deliver a birthday robe to him."
He'll like the robe I make him.
"Foon, it's my birthday in a few days."
Are we ready?
"- Yes, Sifu."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God!"
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.
- It's Josh Peters!
You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.
The system could be mining some of your personal memories for texture.
Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?
He was a bully.
I wasn't scared.
"I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and..."
Man!
Take a couple of Krav Maga classes and I'd be ready.
I'd be ready!
Kali ma!
Dah!
I'm gonna get some wine.
Re-up.
"I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so..."
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Catch ya later, Peters."
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.
"I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great."
I was in France.
"I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival."
"Now that, that wine was good."
I know that.
You're being discursive.
- What is discursive?
Discursive?
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
How can something like this happen?
What are the chances?
"But they'll say, thanks to all those tonics, he survived."
I know.
But nothing appears to be wrong with the thermostat.
And I couldn't find anything wrong with the lights and the TV either.
Okay.
So what is it?
"Something strange is going on in this suite, Danny."
Not you too.
"Come on, Don."
[Scoffs]
Thirty-nine degrees.
"Your, uh, dairy storage is exemplary, Delinda."
I bet you say that to all the girls.
[Chuckles]
Whoa.
Sorry.
"Well, filters clean."
Ventilation good.
Everything looks perfect.
"So, uh, we passed?"
"Oh, with flying colors."
I'm not supposed to reveal that until the official report is issued.
It'll be our little secret.
[Chuckles]
"Okay, so..."
Just...
Just one more thing.
What's that?
"Um, I was wondering if you might have dinner with me some evening?"
"Oh, Mr. Ackerman."
"Oh, no."
"Call meJerry, please."
Jerry.
I don't recognize anybody's voice.
Don't make any mistakes here or do anything stupid.
Don't tell me how to live my life.
- Cut them loose.
- All right.
OFFICER:
"All right, this way out."
MARTINEZ:
Let's go.
[DOOR OPENS]
"- Hey, Greg."
"- Hey, John."
KELLY:
How you feeling?
MEDAVOY:
Okay.
"You know, all right."
John....
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
"John, when you got separated, did you give that a lot of thought?"
"Did you have it pretty well worked- out, what you were going to do?"
- It was her call.
- It was Laurie's idea?
Yeah.
"For me, you marry, you marry for life."
Me too.
"You know, that's exactly me too."
"But when it happened I was so busy being pissed off and hurt, I wasn't listening."
She was trying to tell me why she wanted to leave.
But you know what?
She was right.
"And that, you know, makes me uncomfortable."
[SCOFFS]
"Well, just because I'm comfortable with myself doesn't mean I don't wanna fit in."
"- What, you wanna fit in with us?"
- Yeah.
"I mean, you guys could try and be a little nicer to me at school."
"- Okay, well, we could try."
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Good.
- Okay.
Good.
- This is good.
- This is good.
This is a tip for you.
A tip?
"No, Marly, that's not..."
"Oh, a hundred bucks?"
"Whoa, thank you."
Somebody's getting a haircut.
And a new pair of shoes.
"I'm not looking, I'm not looking."
I just wanna get my purse.
"I don't wanna see anything, or, God forbid, touch anything."
"It's okay, he's gone."
Ah.
"Well, I am leaving."
I wanna thank you for a particularly humiliating afternoon.
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad at you?
"No, that was great."
"I don't know, which part was my favorite?"
- Getting ready for the theater.
Theater?
Sure.
It's Laura's opening night.
- I forgot.
- You promised to come.
"Yeah, but..."
- I couldn't stand it tonight.
- Why not?
I had my share of amateur dramatics today.
You're mean.
It's supposed to be really good this time.
Can't we lie in bed and watch TV instead?
How original.
"""A Streetcar Named Desire""..."
perhaps it's on TV tonight.
Vivian Leigh instead of Laura Kirsch.
"Marco, I have to go, and I want to."
- You can come here and watch TV.
- Yeah?
"Yes, I'll tell Laura you're ill."
Yeah?
"Yeah, see you soon."
"My God, they're full to bursting."
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
Please.
Look at my figure.
"Did you know that I haven't put on an ounce... in ten years, Stella?"
I weigh what I weighed...
How much do you think this exclusive casserole set costs?
- Yeah.
You do?
What should we do now?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"Oh, yeah."
Memory serves.
"Now that I have your attention, listen up."
"You do not come into my town, threaten people I care about."
Going after Elena?
Bad move.
You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits.
Because I do believe in killing the messenger.
You know why?
Because it sends a message.
[GASPS AND GRUNTS]
"If Katherine wants something from me, you tell that bitch to come get it herself."
[KNOCKS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
I couldn't sleep last night.
"You were obviously upset about something, and I just walked away."
That's not me.
That can't be us.
"You're my friend, Elena."
"If you need me, I'm here for you."
And I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
Oh.
Was it?
Are you okay?
[GRUNTS]
TYLER:
You're his kin.
"People would keep coming in, 'cause they associate you with your old man."
Maybe you should hang with las viejas on 190th.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Doctor says you're getting out of here soon.
They set you up with a daytime nurse for a couple of months.
I spoke to the insurance lady.
I put a little extra in to get you through the next few weeks.
- Gracias.
"- You've got a real gift, Carlos."
Don't let go of that.
"- Put me down, carajo!"
- I got you.
"- Put me down, coño!"
- I got you.
Nice!
Let's get some light in here.
"Better, right?"
"You have some nice plants here, Mr. Eddie."
Let me knot it for you.
They could use some water.
Let's take this jug.
Carlos:
"Turn it, dude."
You're gonna break the window.
- Mickey:
Stop fucking bitching.
- Carlos:
What did I tell you?
- Daisy:
You'll hit the walls.
- Shit.
Why aren't you trying anything on?
Did you take your meds?
"What do you mean, did I take my meds?"
Of course.
"For God's sake, Mom."
Ha-ha-ha.
"It's just, you don't spend money like this when you're on them."
"- What are you saying, hm?"
- Nothing.
It's nothing.
Just having a good time with your friends.
Isn't that all right?
"Just because I'm sick from time to time, I can't have a good time?"
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We're having a good time.
See?
That jacket is gorgeous.
You see that jacket?
"It's beautiful, right?"
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, with the shoes."
"Oh, my God, it's perfect."
"Come on, baby."
Just try something on.
Try these on.
Wanna try these on?
They're really cute.
We'll get three of these.
We'll get one for you and one for Grace.
Let's get three of them.
"- Thanks, Robin."
You're awesome.
Slapped you!
"You probably think I'm finished, huh?"
!
"No, there's another one!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!"
There's a slap for you!
"Slap, slap, slap!"
"Yeah, there you go!"
"Here's a little ""reach around the back of the head"" slap!"
"Oh, God, please!"
"You have to get away, he won't ever stop!"
"Oh, I'm going slap happy!"
"# I'm goin' slap, slap happy #"
# Slappity slappin' you #
# Teachin' you a lesson for comin' in my house #
"What are you looking at, Robertson?"
!
They're here!
The audition results for the school musical are in!
"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy!"
- All right!
"- All right, Wendy!"
Who's the male lead?
"No surprise there, it's Bridon!"
"- All right, Bridon!"
"- Cool, Bridon!"
I get to be a stand-in!
"Congratulations, Bridon!"
Guess we'll be working a lot together!
"Yeah, great."
Goddamn it!
What else?
"Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable."
-You won't score points by telling her.
-Okay.
Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts.
She doesn't need your life story...
-... beforeyougetthe salad.
-Got it.
"As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all."
"Right, right."
"I'll be cool, aloof, distant."
"She's here, she's here, she's here!"
What about the-
- What-
- What--
What about the kiss goodnight?
-Should I ask or just go for it?
-Go for it.
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.
-Get it out of the way early.
-How early?
"After dinner, when you walk to the car..."
"... openherdoor,waitforher to say thank you..."
"... smile,leanin ,andkissher."
"Oh, nice."
"Hi, Alan."
You ready?
"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you."
That's another way to go.
-Madam.
-Thank you.
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
John.
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
I tried to get you on the one to
"Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Marjukka.
Your dad's about to die.
Who's stroking your hair now?
Who's enjoying my happiness?
I hope he's better Than I would've been for you
My heart still sings for her
My red-haired girl she is
Although you're not by my side
Let my thoughts come to you
Silence!
"In front of this congregation, I'd like to apologize to you, Jesse."
Your childhood was ruined because I studied plastic bags.
"Forgive me, Jesse."
I love you.
Dad...
-What?
The fire devil...
I've settled my score with him.
Really?
I'll be damned...
Then I can die in peace.
Can lemma mm my hand?
"Yes, she can."
"Bye then, grandpa."
Nice to die when it's not raining.
What next?
"Take good care of Jemina, will you?"
-I will.
She likes you.
She's like her Mom.
And her Dad.
Your flame is burning bright
"Hello, Goni."
I smell that wonderful soup of yours.
Gonki!
We're eating!
"I'm sorry, my darling."
How was your meeting with Alex?
Where did you meet?
At the theater cafe.
- And?
He asked me to direct a small insignificant play.
Do you know it?
"I know the playwright, that's enough."
I don't want to play anymore.
I hate that piano.
Why are you picking on the piano?
You don't have to practice if you don't want to.
"Still, he asked you to direct."
Yes.
In the basement hall.
That playwright is a disgrace.
Delicious.
Daddy made us such good soup.
"Gonki Galonki, why aren't you eating?"
Taste the soup.
I made you soup!
Did you see the doctor?
- Tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
You were wrong.
I'll pour Gonki Galonki some lemonade.
Now try the soup and tell me if it's good.
"Are you sick, Mommy?"
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.
Really.
Please try to forgive me and understand.
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.
If I'd known it was down there...
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.
Please try to forgive me.
"If you need anything, just call me."
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.
"Phil, when you get a chance, take a look at this article."
It has been a day!
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.
Had me running back and forth.
I can't wait to get out of here.
No.
I'm talking about the one right there.
No.
"Look over there, girl."
Stop.
He's all right with me.
He's cute.
Of course he's cute.
That's why I'm telling you to look.
"You having a problem there, Jessica?"
Yes.
"I put my money in there, and it keeps eating my money."
I can see through their clothes.
This is weird.
- It.
Move.
Mother!
Let go.
Mother!
They do not touch to me.
"We go, walk."
You do not resist.
-You lower those hands.
Mother!
Paulino.
I am the Dr. Cicchirini.
Let go!
Mother!
I am innocent.
-Poor little bastard...
-It is a Judiciary error.
How it is going to be a judiciary error?
Paulino!
Paulino!
They are going away to cool meatballs.
Son mine!
Senorita.
Whereupon expensive you return to appear?
You have found another disease to arrange for me?
"No, no."
"Then, stop to bother me."
By the way?
"You know nothing of an ambulance, of a patient who flees?"
No...
"Better, because my fiancee spent three days in the jail before clarifying the misunderstanding."
If I discover who has been I twist the neck to him.
"- Robin, how could you?"
"No, she's right."
Maggie deserves some time to herself.
"Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup, but that's when we discover who we really are and what we really want."
She deserves that.
OLDER TED:
"And kids, I meant that."
Which is why I'm not proud of what happened next.
It's around the corner.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
(MEN GROANING)
Hey.
"Maggie, sorry."
Class ran a little...
- Who's this?
- (CHUCKLES) This is Adam.
And it's so crazy.
We grew up next door to each other.
"God, we haven't seen each other since..."
- (LAUGHS) A long time.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.
OLDER TED:
And then Maggie Wilks told us the second-greatest love story I've ever heard.
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
I just moved to town and I had to look her up.
(MAGGIE LAUGHS)
I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah.
"Yeah, of course."
OLDER TED:
"So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door to the guy next door."
"Well, see you next time."
Do you understand?
"May your knowledge rain upon Toni's bar, so the seeds of education and prosperity take root."
What do you want?
I saw mom in the supermarket.
- Attention!
Report to 08...
- Supermarket...
The last time I heard from her she was in Sweden.
That was the end of the seventies.
What would she be doing in a supermarket around here?
What do I know?
You imagined it.
Why would she suddenly just show up here?
Sweden is much too far away for a short visit.
But suppose I did see her.
You've got her mixed up.
I didn't get her mixed up.
Do you hear that?
"This singing, you hear that?"
Isn't that great?
It' s been going on for days.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
You'll get the file in the morning.
Alright?
Fine.
Shouldn't I come with you?
It's not necessary.
Too bad!
"A 1,000 Euro show."
"How come 1,000 Euros?"
What were you thinking?
Toni's 999 Euro show?
That's hilarious.
Get me some soup.
Yep.
Uh-oh.
"Thequestionis ,willthe  House pass the bill as amended?"
This is a 15-minute vote.
"Oh, my God."
My ass is killing me from that shot.
But I feel pretty good.
Really?
- Ma'am.
- What?
"Oh, boy."
Here we go.
It's like I want my baby to live.
I don't want my baby to die.
"Maybe think of it more of as a bill, which in a very real way is what it is."
- Mm.
- There's Pierce.
He even walks dumb.
"Every time I see him, I hear circus music."
"Come on, Owen."
"It's your time to shine, you dim fucking bulb."
- He voted no.
We lost the vote.
- Oh!
We are victorious in defeat.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
"Okay, so I lost the vote."
I won by not winning.
"God, I don't know how I feel."
"Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head."
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!"
"Oh, my goodness!"
Why would I do that?
Ha ha!
"And right behind you, there was danger!"
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
"It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge."
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
"No, please!"
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes!"
- Aah!
"- Num, num, num!"
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No!
Anything but that!
No!
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
-(overlapping chatter)
"What do you think of your old squad, huh?"
I hate to admit it-- you look almost human.
(laughter)
Pass the glasses around.
"Listen, you want some cigars?"
-Anything you want.
-(overlapping chatter)
"Here you are, pappy."
"Say, pretty classy, pretty classy here."
-Yeah.
"-Oh, I was going to get a whole floor, but some maharaja beat me to it."
(laughs)
TUBBY:
"Doing all right for a PFC, boy."
PFC?
"Look alive, Tubby."
That was ten years ago.
"A lot of things must happen, you know, in ten years."
(laughter and overlapping chatter)
"Hey, hey, if you're not used to it, that's champagne."
Take it easy.
"Yes, I'll, uh, I'll have to go easy."
I've got a big day at the office tomorrow.
Office?
"Working at an office, huh?"
Good boy.
"Gave up driving a truck, huh?"
"Sure, he's got his own company-- Morgan Truck Lines."
Morgan Truck Lines?
Mm-hmm.
That big transcontinental outfit?
You still want to play charades?
Yeah.
I got to go.
(laughs) Really?
Mm-hmm.
Parker.
"You know, I can help you, Doc, with your ex."
(chuckles)
"No, you can't."
"Oh, yeah, I can."
I need to go home and check my judgment.
It's about Wickes again?
You were right about the tell.
He looked at that photo for a reason.
"Yeah, he did."
That's not enough.
"So, you were wrong about the guy."
No one here likes you any less.
"I want to stop running, Gibbs."
Really see the people around me and not just blurs as I fly by.
Really see them.
I just don't know if I can.
Not yet.
"I'm here, Doc."
I know.
(clears throat)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
Previously on Dance Academy...
Our problem is with your kind.
You're a second-year in a first-year leotard and we don't like the second-years.
"Even if there was a moment, we've probably missed it, so there's no point in..."
A jam in Los Angeles.
-Let me...
-No hydraulic fluid
-for the platform lifts.
-This is ridiculous.
You guys are making me laugh.
You call yourself truck operators.
"-What's your dram, hydraulic fluid?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, what are you driving, diesels?"
-That's right.
"Well, you simply drain the lube fluid out of the hitch gearbox, transfer it to the hydraulic lifts."
Look alive!
Stop jamming up the works out here!
-Get going!
-(phone ringing)
"-BILKO: $10,000 a year?"
"-Oh, $10,000."
That's nothing.
That's just the beginning.
You're worth a fortune to me.
"-Hello, hello!"
-I'm calling about the Dawson figures.
-What?
!
-Dawson figures-- I have to have 'em right away.
I got to get downstairs and sign some papers.
"-(overlapping chatter, phones ringing)"
-Go to it!
The Dawson figures.
What about the Dawson figures?
-(phone ringing)
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
"Hey, you speak Italian?"
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
"Abbandando, meet my nephew!"
How's business?
"It's good, it's good."
Fanucci's mad.
Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy.
"People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount."
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure.
He wants double from everybody.
Even from my father.
"I'm a friend, right?"
So you'll let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
"You've always been good to me, ever since I came here."
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
"Oh, no!"
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway.
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- Milan is amazing.
It'll change our lives.
Who is it?
It's Mario.
Guess where we are?
What?
I'll call you this evening.
Problems at work?
"Optimism, Silvia!"
- Yuck!
- Darn it!
- WELCOME TO THE SOUTH -
You can't do anything?
I've been working there for 15 years!
You promised!
You know I was counting on it.
I understand.
"It's not fair, though."
Bye.
Shoes!
"Naples: gunfire downtown,"
Minister Maroni in visit to the regional capital.
"102 deaths since the year began, 1,300 in the last ten."
It's as if an entire village were erased from the map.
- What is it?
- No transfer to Milan.
What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in Milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't your friend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
Liz:
The drug will take her soon.
Narcan.
Heroin antidote.
All the agents looking for you have it.
"[Gasps, coughing]"
"Liz Kenyon, you killed Kevin Whitfield, didn't you?"
I took him to protect him.
"Yeah, well, now I'm taking you."
[Police radio chatter]
[Handcuffs click]
James:
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
So why would you ever promise those parents you'd find his killer?
Because...
"They believed in him so much that it made me believe in him, too."
[Young woman coughs]
You're a hell of a lawman.
"Thank you, son."
So are you.
But I got to ask you to stay away from Gracie...
Until I figure this out.
Figure what out?
She's my granddaughter.
She misses me.
Yeah.
Because you died.
Just give me some time with this.
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
"So, this is Peng's."
GIGGLING
GIRL GIGGLES
"I'm sorry, I..."
Wait.
Please!
I'm Adam.
Patricia.
You must be his friend.
You must be his son.
"Come in, then."
Can I get your opinion on something?
What's wrong with this picture?
You want me to say she looks fat?
Would you say she looks at ease?
She's smiling.
You think?
I'd say that was a smile.
She's uncomfortable.
Self-conscious.
"Then, why did she do it?"
I'll call you.
HE SIGHS
I should...be getting back to work.
"So, what is it that you do, Patricia?"
I'm a journalist.
"Oh, so you work together."
"He really hasn't told you anything about me, has he?"
"I bet he hasn't talked about me much, either."
So we should be equally insulted.
"Well, maybe he's being cautious."
You've been seeing each other for over a year now.
Then he has told you something?
BY EVERY OTHER ONE IN THE COUNTRY.
"WHY, IT'S JUST ANOTHER MURDER."
I SUGGEST THAT THE LIFE OF A HUMAN BEING
IS NOT BENEATH YOUR CONSIDERATION.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET ONTO IT MYSELF.
JON?
MAY I REMIND YOU
THAT YOUR FIRST EDITION IS ON THE STREET AT 7 P.M.?
ALL I'VE GOT LEFT IS THE FINAL.
I'LL PUT THIS ON PAGE 2.
HOW MANY WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES USE LIPSTICK?
HOW MANY WOMEN ARE THERE?
I WANT EVERY ONE OF THEM SCARED SILLY
EVERY TIME SHE PUTS ANY ON!
"CALL THIS BABY ""THE LIPSTICK KILLER""-"
SMACK ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE!
"WHATEVER YOU SAY, AMOS."
HOW ABOUT PICTURES?
I'LL SEND THE MEN OUT RIGHT AWAY.
Kyne:
AND I'LL SEND YOU A SPECIAL LETTER OF COMMENDATION.
"NOW, GET OUT OF HERE, BOTH OF YOU, AND GET TO WORK."
DO YOU WANT ME TO FEATURE THIS THING ON MY TELECAST?
"ED, I'M REAL JUMPY."
SO AM I. I'M ON THE AIR IN 4 MINUTES.
WHO'S GOING TO RUN THE WHOLE SHOW WHEN MY CARBURETOR CONKS OUT?
YOU'LL DO THAT YOURSELF FOR MANY A YEAR.

SOMETHING THAT'S TAKEN A LIFETIME OF BRAINS AND GUTS TO BUILD...
"AND IN ALL THAT LIFETIME, I FIND I'VE MADE ONLY TWO BIG MISTAKES."
"WELL, I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU ADMIT TO THAT MANY."
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
- Don't bother.
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's not very...
Buckley.
"It's not your fault, you know."
It really isn't.
"You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole."
Exterior train.
Station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
"""I didn't mean what I just said."
"And, anyway, you said worse."""
It was a declaration.
"- ""Stupid bloody fool"" was good."
Did you think of that beforehand?
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
No.
What I'm trying to say is that... if all of this stopped... the sparring and the jibing and the insults and the arguments...
I'd miss it.
"Even if I were dead,"
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.
On and on and on and on and on.
What do you mean?
Have you heard of the killer Chou Lien-chan?
Chou Lien-chan
"No, and I have no quarrel with him"
He's chief disciple of Tiger Yeh
"You killed Tiger Yeh, and he'll come for you!"
It's been 30 years-why bring that up?
Show me your stuff before you die
"En garde, Knight Fan"
You're playing this for real!
I wouldn't joke about it!

Master Chang
"What is it, Ah-fang?"
The boss is waiting for you in the vineyard
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
Splendid.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
- Mumsie!
- I have it all worked out.
- I've recced his barge.
- Wrecked his barge?
!
"No, Reconnoitred."
He lives on a barge.
"- But, Mumsie..."
- Shh!
Hello?
Are you that Dennis creature?
This is Flora Ransom here.
I have your money.
Come and collect it at 7:30 tomorrow night.
"Now, you get the pills, I'll prepare the trunk."
"""Solder wire to hole marked Z."""
And that's that.
- Wonderful.
- Whatever's that?
"That, my friend, is the bomb completed."
Now for the gunpowder.
Get out my Indian army colonel with the overdraft clothes.
(Doorbell)
Mr MacGregor?
My name is Lord Mayley.
- Yes?
- We haven't met before but you're said to be a very decent sort.
- You're very kind.
- I'm sure you agree that we should help each other.
- How much do you want?
He'll be coming soon then.
Though I hope that's after the bill is passed through.
Why do you look so weak?
Eat some of the chicken that you love and be strong!
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo is so pitiful.
I know Chairman Cheon Jae Man too...
That person did that...
There is no trustworthy person in this world.
Everything is pitiful.
Everything is scary.
Unnie take this.
What?
This is a man's?
Give it to Go Ki Joon!
Go Ki Joon!
?
Did you change to Go Ki Joon!
?
Unni... do you not have any sense?
You and Go Ki Joon go well together.
Me and Go Ki Joon ssi?
You two date.
I came for Da Hye's tutoring.
Go in.
Is this what you came to find?
You really are fearless.
Even entering the President's study.
It seems you don't know when to stop.
Stopping...
Doesn't quite suit me.
Let me ask you one question.
What is the reason that you're doing this?
That's what I just said.
"Where did he get it, right here?"
So why are we here?
Johnny Cannata and Frank Doss own this hotel.
Why would they kill a comic?
I don't think they did.
FBI has had them under surveillance.
"Price was involved with Cannata and Doss, very tight."
Silent partner?
We don't know.
Let's go nose around.
How was fishing?
Rainy.
Hi.
Someday I'm gonna be wearing threads like that.
Mrs. Noogman.
"Yeah, definitely his better half."
Where's Miami's favorite mouth?
I don't care.
I got an agent.
I'm a singer now.
I ran into Annie downstairs.
Said she saw a cocktail waitress named Dorothy Bain... head up here with Morty Price about 4:00 this morning.
What's your connection with Miss Bain?
We're acquainted.
"She's a sweet kid, Sonny."
You'd like her.
She's got a cute little boy.
Yeah.
I'd like to meet her.
You know where we can find her?
My lips are sealed.
That's all.
"Keep an eye on them, Seymour."
"Company, attention."
Fall out for five minutes.
"Oh, Quigley."
Come here.
I've already warned you a couple of times this week.
Look at yourself.
"Well, what's your excuse this time?"
Walking around on my knees to give my arches a rest.
Let me see your hands.
Ever try using soap and water?
Let me see the other one.
I thought so.
You heard what Mr. Jeffries said.
That's your last warning.
If you're late again you'll be dismissed.
[IMITATES ELEPHANT]
Feature goes on in 15 minutes.
Seats in the balcony only.
"Stairway to the right, please."
"""Coming:"
"Edward G. Robinson in Dark Hazard. """
- We've gotta get a load of that guy.
"- Yeah, he's not bad."
You got a Mickey Mouse on the bill today?
"No, not today."
"What, no Mickey Mouse?"
"- No, no Mickey Mouse."
- Why?
He's making a personal appearance in Jersey City.
"Oh, you're trying to kid somebody, huh?"
I totally forgot to order it without peppers.
Yeah.
Even though I told you seconds before that I hated green peppers.
- My head still must be a little fuzzy.
- Must be.
So what kind of food does Bo like?
- Nothing special.
She seems like someone who'd like a good steak.
- Maybe.
- What's Bo's favourite restaurant?
We don't really eat out much.
...We..?
- Yeah.
"""We"" this, ""we"" that."
"You're pretty much right in there with Bo, huh?"
"Right by her side, day in, day out."
Yeah.
"You know, we're kind of a team."
Is that healthy?
"I mean, don't you want to branch out on your own one day so that both of you can flourish?"
- Yeah.
"You know, you're totally right."
I'm actually planning on going back to school and getting my law degree.
"Oh, law."
- That's so great.
- Yeah. it's so great.
- Gotta pee.
- Okay.
"Oh, jeez."
"On, shit."
"Oh, my God."
"On, God."
"Well, open the door!"
Okay.
"Hi, Wilbur, how are you?"
I'm in no mood to get engaged today.
"Do you feel all right, Wilbur?"
I'm fine.
"What's on your mind, baby?"
"Well, Mrs. Brendan wanted to see you in her office right away."
Why?
She didn't say.
I'll walk back with you if you want me to.
"Okay, but no swans."
No swans.
Get my coat!
"Sure, sure."
Skeets!
Yes?
(WHISTLING)
Nothin'.
Wilbur's a very remarkable boy.
"In this day and age, it's so difficult to rear a child properly."
Yes.
I wouldn't give you 10-to-1 on a boy like Wilbur living to grow up.
"Oh, that's a little on the pessimistic side, Mr. Hoolick."
"All right, I'll make it 8-to-1."
"Oh, really."
"Here he is, Mrs. Brendan."
"Hello, Mrs. Brendan, did you want to... (STUTTERING)"
Surprised?
Of course he is.
I've had a hard time catching up with Wilbur.
Now you have him back safe and sound.
Here you go.
Brittany Gold.
Get out of the car.
I'm sorry about the tape.
Don't worry.
"Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife."
Karl Stoltz is dead.
"You know who that is, right?"
Did you really think
I was going to let a bitch like you set me up?
I'm really sorry--
You know what?
I could run you in right now for the vials of shit that I know you have on your person.
- Fucking bitch!
- Aah!
Chain in or out?
"In, please."
"All right, listen, I don't know who's going to be there today, okay?"
- Yes.
- I need you on your A game.
- All right?
- Okay.
Laser focused.
Okay?
- Pee less.
- Right.
"Also, please learn how to tie your own tie because you're a grown-ass man."
"- Oh, well."
- [sigh]
"I'm so proud of you, sis."
What are you--
What the fuck is wrong with you?
10!
10!
- 10 cardboards!
- Wonderful!
- Ugye?
- Great!
It was worthy.
"We struggled for him, but was worthy."
Where is the kind Tót?
He was it here yet before.
- Lajos.
- Daddy!
Do not sleep eternally.
#Girls!
Respectthe lad well.#
"I am glad that you have a so good mood, my dear Tót."
"I do not know it, how I shall express my gratitude."
"- Come on, major lord."
"- But yeah, yeah."
- I'm happy and satisfied.
- I am glad.
I say only so much that was Helebrant second lieutenant till now my room-mate.
"But, if I return onto the front, the your dear Gyula your son gets into his place."
"This is beneficial because it surrounds the schoolhouse, a guard doubled where I live."
Oh my God.
"For my son, good man like this his commander."
We thank you.
Kind angel.
Oh what are you doing?
!
Na!
Mariska!
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
- He'll be fine.
- Jackass!
- Stop calling him that.
- Climbing in places like that?
- He got a good person killed!
- It was an accident.
Peter... a cop died!
There was no intention.
"In fact, he tried to stop her."
You're defending him.
He was just trespassing.
It was a sad and tragic accident.
I think you're minimizing just a little.
I have to get to work.
Can we talk about this later?
- Or we could not talk about it at all.
- Mel...
No.
I'm just surprised you feel that way.
"Alright, buddy, much as I love spending time with you, where the hell is this bar?"
Where is Natasha?
Um...
She works at this bar...
She works...
"The bar is, uh  somewhere."
"Hey, you and Natasha,"
- you sure she's going to want to see you?
"- Dude, she loves me."
She never judged me.
- Worst thing I ever did...
- Dumped her?
Yeah.
"The thing is, you don't know."
You don't know.
So stop saying that you know.
- Okay.
- [Knuckles Cracking]
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish... cruel, nasty people."
[Sighs]
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension.
Maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha...
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha.
- Gaad is not your friend.
- [Click]
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
[Agent] Eew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
[Click]
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
[Crying]
I can smell it.
"You know, somehow Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of."
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
"What are you thinking of, Buck?"
"Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking."
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
"It's getting late, Jack."
Think I'll say good night.
"Not guilty, Your Honor."
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
"Oh, boy!"
"Hey, somebody pinch me."
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
"My, oh, my, oh, my."
I do declare.
Hey!
"Hey, boss!"
Boss!
"Come here, quick."
Hmm.
Look at this.
"Oh, my."
Oh.
"Lookit, lookit!"
Tell me if I'm dreamin'.
"Here, you three can go."
Allez!
Let him go!
"You ""reviendras""?"
You will come back and see me?
Leave them in peace!
"- But, Officer..."
- Sit down and leave them in peace!
- Evening.
- Bonsoir.
"Next time, vous ne sortez pas sans passeport!"
- Sorry?
- Don't go out without passport!
"- Ah yes, passport..."
- Mon amour!
"- Go and call a taxi, I'll wait for you here."
"- Yes, bonsoir!"
"- Excuse me, the Hotel de Bon Commerce?"
- Hotel du Bon Commerce?
- You know it?
"- Yes, Boss."
"Via des Beaux Arts, near the Place des Abbesses."
"- Ah yes, Abbesses Place."
- If you could write...
Shouldn't we call a doctor?
You should start by not fighting all the time.
"She's got indigestion, that's all!"
- Where have you been?
- With Gremier.
"I wanted to come back sooner, but the car broke down."
That'll teach you to go out with the first people you meet on the street.
"They're not the first people I met on the street, they're..."
"Look, I've never met anyone like me before."
"Apart from the first time, and that was mostly fighting him off."
Badly.
Please.
No-one's ever taught me how to do this.
"Adam, here's the thing, right?"
I don't care.
"Yeah, like I want to hang out with some whiffy Goth anyway."
Excuse me?
Just cos you're a vampire doesn't mean you have to smell like the undead.
"One word, Mitch."
Deodorant.
Tch!
"- Oh, good."
You two have met.
- He's just leaving.
You want to watch yourself with this one.
She's been giving me the glad eye ever since I arrived.
- Loves a bit of fang.
- I do not!
That is a terrible thing to say.
I do not like a bit of fang.
"Not his fang, or anyone else's."
"Er... you know, I'm not ruling it out."
Just if the right fang came along.
But I haven't even thought about it.
At all.
For ages.
Oh.
"OK, ladies."
I'll catch you later.
Can we?
"It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked."
Another plausibly fruitful option.
New GTA and COD out today.
We're going to sesh.
- Been gaming much?
- Always gaming.
- You?
- Just gamed.
Stimulating morning game.
Evening game will eclipse.
I gamed a 4:00-to-4:00 shift last night.
You're gaming taxi driver's hours?
I gamed a 10:00-to-4:00 shift today.
Gaming banker's hours.
I'll probably game a 5:00-to-7:00 shift now.
Cing a Sept.
Nous aussi.
You guys wanna hit up a happy hour?
We're gonna hit another happy hour.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Heads up!

I'm Lisa.
Wayne.
GLEN:
Wayne!
"- Glen, how are you now?"
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.
"- Well, I guess the teddy's out of the tickle trunk on this one, too."
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
Ugh.
"Oh, I do not want this vacation to end."
"Promise me when we get home, we'll only speak French to each other."
"Oh, ce sera comme nous sommes sur notre propre île privée au paradis."
I was kind of hoping for English with a fake French accent.
But of course.
I had such a good time.
Mm.
And you are really sexy.
"You put the ""moan"" in Mona Lisa."
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
"You put the ""oomph"" in arc de triomphe."
Ooh.
You put your hands in my pants at the Louvre.
"I know that that's not what we're doing right now, but it was fun."
Yeah.
It was all fun.
"Yeah, it was."
And you know what the best part was?
What?
No Mansfield.
"I mean, you blew off opening a new office in Hong Kong to go to Paris with me, and your boss didn't even call or e-mail or text."
He fired me.
Take a look!
Take a look!
300 workers illegally held 300 workers illegally held
Take a look!
Let them go!
Stand back
Whoever can bring me the head of Fei
Will be my sole adopted son!
Still want to take Barry's place?
"- Get out of here, Barry."
- I'll go get a teacher.
You want to go?
"I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk."
Why not?
You chicken?
Come on!
No.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
"- Hey, get back!"
Get back.
That is enough.
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I chould have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It was tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth,"
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
It's...
L.A. You can wear whatever you want.
"Ok, I'll just grab my purse."
I'll get your heels.
"Well, hello to you, too."
Thought you said you had...
a meeting to go to.
What?
"You said you had... a meeting, remember when I texted you... earlier?"
"Oh, yeah."
"I did, but uh, but I'm done now."
"Oh, great."
"Hallie, what's up?"
What's going on?
What's going on?
I think I should be asking you that question.
Excuse me?
"What is going on, Dale?"
"Uh, nothing."
"Look, I'm just-"
"I'm, did I miss something here?"
Wait.
Do you like him now?
Is that it?
"Look, I'm just gonna leave."
All right?
Of course you are.
"Zach, you're a piece of crap you know that?"
You're just another famous asshole guy who thinks he can screw around with any girl he wants and then not call them.
Well... fuck you!
"We're not... even dating, Hallie."
I've told you that 10... times.
"Xiaotian, I love you!"
I'll wait for you!
Yawang!
Mother!
Father!
How is it?
Was it hard?
- Yes.
"- It's allright, no problem!"
"It's done, don't think about it anymore."
Let's go home and rest.
I have cooked some delicious food for you!
- You came too?
- Uncle asked me to come.
"I see, you forced to come."
"Yawang, I really miss you!"
Are you allright in the university?
"Sometimes, I think..."
"You have entered the university that you want,"
I have entered the military academy.
We are getting close to our perfect life!
"I told you, we will be together for not much time anymore."
Let's go for it together!
- I...
- Is the next stop is your school?
When yor class will be ended today?
5:40 p.m.
5:40 p.m?
I'll pick you up.
Let's watch a movie later!
I don't really like movie.
You don't?
"Oh, I shouldn't worry about that."
He's an actor.
"Unless you review them, have intercourse with them, or do both simultaneously, they don't remember you."
"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce you now to a young man to whom we all owe a great deal."
Soon we hand him back to the RAF for a very different kind of shooting.
"Until then, he is our very own American."
- Mr. Carl Lundbeck.
- Hi.
Hello.
"- Alex Frayle, director."
Hi.
Good to meet you.
Wyndham Best.
How do you do?
I'm playing Johnnie.
"Carl Lundbeck, Flight Lieutenant."
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Mr. Hilliard.
- If I've got the right--
Mr. Ambrose Hilliard.
Yes.
"Sir, I saw every Inspector Charnforth picture there ever was."
Just used to go right back and watch them again.
Oh!
"""You see, someone has made a mistake."""
"""A simple mistake, but easy to miss."""
Yes!
Oh!
"Sir, I need to wire my mom."
There's our secret weapon.
Now you write him in.
"His pride, my pride."
- Please.
- Enough talk.
Time to play the game.
Hello.
Hello-ah.
Friend of yours?
"It's Jonesy, open up!"
Get rid of him.
I'll be listening.
"Luke, Luke, what's going on?"
I've been calling you for hours.
"- Sorry, man."
"- Not a sound, people."
Thought it's gonna be some country house megabash.
"No, it's a total wipeout."
No one here.
Just a few losers.
"- Well, I may as well come and say hi."
"- Seriously, you don't wanna go in there"
"Seriously, I do."
I've been on the road three hours.
"20 pound carried from the station, treading through this mud, to follow your fucking GPS."
"Plus, I've got a shitload of gear that I'm supposed to be shifting tonight."
"Can't let you in, mate."
It's a private party.
Is this some kinda wind-up.
"What's going on, Luke?"
N-Nothing.
- Are you standing me?
- No.
"That's it, isn't it?"
Fear of bodily fluids.
I need a break.
Let's take a break.
Okay.
"Okay, I'll get him."
Richard.
Why don't you walk around in those and see how they feel.
- It's Peter.
- Hello?
"Oh, no."
Really?
"Well, did you call your mom?"
"Oh, right."
Damn.
"Well, can you make it through the day, Petey?"
Are you barfing?
Okay.
"Okay, let's see here."
"I don't get off until 6:00, and we are just slammed here."
It's a sale day.
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.
This is why we have neighbors.
"We're part of a community, Peter."
Does your mom make you do that?
"No, this is my own towel."
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.
"See, this is the bath sheet... and this is the hand towel... and this is the washcloth."
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.
"When they hang on the rack, they go like this."
No more than five.
- I know a way in.
- No.
"No, your Abbess..."
- She doesn't need to know.
- She said they search every inch.
We can't.
There are inches Mother doesn't know about.
Ladies.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
This is...
Sister Marie.
- Miri.
- Since when do we bring strays home?
She's going to help hide our men at the Abbey.
Then she should be at the Abbey.
Why is she here?
She knows our plan.
I prefer not to let her out of our sight.
We'll need a car or a way to slow the Germans down.
The Abbey has a truck.
They take it to town on market days.
"I could ""borrow"" the keys."
When do you need it?
Walking freely is a privilege.
- Brilliant.
- Maybe now you will think twice before attacking.
Alfred's going to have to find a way out from the inside.
- How?
- I don't know.
He's going to need our help.
"Look, what do you want?"
"Look, I'll make any kinda deal with you."
What the hell do you want?
"Hey, listen, who put you up to this, huh?"
"That-that caputo guy, huh?"
Carmine caputo?
You're not gonna get away with it.
"Do me a favor, huh?"
Listen...
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"You see the thing is, my friend needs the money you've taken out of his pocket all these years."
[Chuckling]
"Hey, hey punk, that's easy."
"Twenty, thirty thousand dollars..."
I'll give you anything you want.
"Just get me the hell down, ya hear?"
"Hey, hold it, hold it."
"Hold it, please."
Now where's your house?
"It's over in englewood, new Jersey... 26 ocean road."
How do I get in?
That's easy.
"I'll give ya key, huh?"
This one here is the front door.
The alarm system...
Be my guest.
Where's the safe?
"It's the first room, right behind the kitchen."
You can't miss it.
It's to the right.
What's the combination?
"No, wait a minute, okay."
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.
your consciousness wouldn't teleport onto the computer.
You just have created a pretty teleport onto the computer.
You just have created a pretty accurate A.I.
You just have created a pretty accurate A.I. simulation of yourself.

"Brian, just stop, all right?"
"- All right, but I just think..."
- Brian.
"Oh, shit, that's Dad's room."
Dad.
You!
You told me to go into the light.
- What?
"- Oh, yeah."
There was a light.
"I almost walked right into the goddamn thing, you ungrateful little shit."
You wanted me dead.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
And I'm a freaking five?
I said you were making a comeback.
I'm a goddamn ten.
I'm just...
I'm just glad you're alive.
"I know you are, kid."
I'm just breaking your balls.
Look at this.
I've been up ten minutes.
Already my Tinder is blowing up.
"Yeah, all right."
"- How do you feel, Mr. Farrell?"
- Never better.
These comas are a dynamite way to catch up on your sleep.
I might need another one in a couple of months.
Being single is exhausting.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.
I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back.
Let's go see about those dresses.
How are you girls holding up?

I most certainly was.
With that piece?
"-Quick, what is it?"
-A little memento.
"We fly from such a great distance, with a noble mission."
and you steal in a supermarket.
That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers.
-Thank you.
-All right.
Hello.
What does this mean?
We can't figure out the process in which this works.
-Can you give us some advice?
-What is in the can?
Great.
But we can't see in there.
"Do you have matches, doctor?"
No!
"Jeez, it's petrol!"
Where did you get it?
This must go immediately!
-What if someone saw you?
-It was lying in front of the house.
Unattended.
"The man who owns this, saved a long time for it."
-Worked.
Went without food.
-Really?
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
I've been saving all my life!
That's very interesting.
Doesn't somebody get intelligent and realize children must grow up their own way?
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.
Kids get born and you just worry about them and you hope for them.
"Well, I gotta get going."
"- Good night, Nellie."
"- Good night, Allison."
Hello?
"Oh, hello, Mother."
I've been thinking it over.
You can invite anyone you want to your party.
"Oh, Mother, thank you."
Thank you very much.
I'll be home in a little while.
Bye.

That was close.
"We can't go running around like that, okay?"
Look!
That would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?

Of course I do.
"Yeah, he's-- he's lost his wife, and you are recently divorced, so..."
So...

"Also, certainly, a thank you to Coach Masters for his-- his help on the field."
- Paul...
- Yeah?
"You remember Stephanie, Jacob's mom."
Of course.
Hi.
How are you?
"You may not be aware, but Stephanie is, uh-- she's recently divorced."
"Oh, well, that got to the point."
To the--
"Oh, you're setting us up."
It was my idea.
I know.
"But at some point, I thought, ""Why be coy?"""
She's right.
"I mean, you're both single, you're both smart and nice."
Smart and nice.
Wow.
"Stephanie, can I offer you a refill?"
- Yes.
Thank you.

Hello.
I've come to see Rose and Lily Starling.
I'm not to talk to papers.
I'm not to let no one in.
I'm not from the papers.
I'm from the Ministry of Information.
The Film division.
Film?
And then you went to Dunkirk?
We meant to.
But the engines stopped five miles out.
Broken bearing.
We never got there.
"But in the paper...it said, you got home troops."
This steam tug on it's way back gave us a tow.
Soldiers spilling' over the rails.
"So we pulled someone in, see."
Someone seen us docking' and put it in the paper.
They got the wrong end of the stick.
Didn't they?
"Dad said, we'd be a laughin' stock."
"Said, ""You mustn't tell the papers""."
But you write in the papers.
For the pictures?
Can Lily ask you somethin'?
Yes.
Have you ever met Robert Donat?
The famous actor?
No.
"No, I haven't I'm afraid."
Dad!
What are you doing?
Big Brother has such a tragic death
Can't I even make him an altar?
There's not enough space even for the living
Who cares about the dead!
You...
What?
What are you guys arguing about?
Don't you know that dad is sick?
"Brother Jin, please rest in peace!"
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Go away!
"Master Fan, I've a secret to tell you!"
What secret?
"We shouldn't talk here, I'll wait for you at hillside"
Come here quick!
Come here!
Hey!
I'm here!
What secret?
You really want to know?
Since I asked you out
I'll surely tell you!
Someone wants to kill you!
Who?
Who dares to kill me?
Say!
This man is very skillful
I don't think you can handle him!
Do you remember a year ago

Why are you doing all this for me?
Hurry up.
There's coffee if you'd like.
Laure!
"Laure, it's Gilou!"
- Calm down!
- How's it going?
"So, who was right?"
You switched your phone off?
"Sorry, I went back to sleep."
"I'm taking a shower, I'm coming."
"- Wait, I'll make some coffee."
- I don't have any left.
I'll see you at the office.
"See you later, then."
"Fuck, just what I didn't want to happen."
"You're entitled to a private life, aren't you?"
I don't know.
What?
How come you don't know?
- Aren't we serious?
"- Yes, we are."
"Anyway, I've got to go."
I'm taking someone in for questioning.
What kind?
The kind of dealer involved in settling scores in a squat.
A guy got hit in the lung by a bullet.
It went through the ceiling.
He is dead?
He'll survive.
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling isn't mutual.
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
I think I can stand that.
[Greta snarling]
DAVE:
Scrub right here.
[Shower running]
[Monique gasps]
What the?
Oh well.
"Hey, this isn't so bad."
[Monique giggling]
"Dave, what's that?"
[Doorbell ringing]
I'd better see who it is.
I'm gonna check the breaker box.
The breaker switch jumped off for some reason.
"Hey, who was at the door?"
MONIQUE:
"Whoever it was, they left."
"OK, Richard."
"Stand there by the front, over there"
A little closer to the center.
That's about right.
"OK, now, I'm gonna kick the car out of gear."
"OK, you got it."
Can you hold it?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I can hold it."
I'm not gonna push it far off hill though.
"Well, uh, tell you what, now."
What I want to do is to kind of ease up on it a little bit.
"Like, you know, let it... as if you"
Were gonna let it roll forward and pick up a little momentum.
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.NYou are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyoneNfall in love with her. (animals GRUNTlNG )
even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
is it not betterNto be feared than loved?
Not certain anymore.
let her have the rabble.Nl don't need them.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be workingNat my trade again.
It's just a pityNyou have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(chains rattling )
(THUNDER crashing )
Hatter.
Have you any ideaNwhy a raven is like a writing desk?
Alice.
I don't like it in here.Nlt's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
"I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
"- Oh, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They stole it right offthe street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Yeah, well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
Yes.
"Where's my car, please?"
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
Let's go!
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.
"- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight."
"- OK, babe."
Take care.
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Give 'em the gas!
Hold your fire!
"Yes, Miss First Lady."
It's in my pocket next to my heart.
"You know, Mary Todd gave it to Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to do good things while he was in that chair."
- I hear you.
"Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?"
I love you ladies.
Miss you.
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.
Did you know that 1.5 million people visit the White House every year?
"No, I did not know that."
"Look, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to your talent show.
I'm not.
Seriously.
Did you know the White House used to be called the Presidential Palace?
"Look, I need you to hear me right now."
Look at me.
I really wished I was there.
"No, you don't."
All I-
- All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.
"You know that you don't have to do that with me, right?"
- What?
- Have thick skin.
You're 11.
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, sir."
- How are you?
"- Fine, thank you."
Yourself?
"L""m damn blissful."
"Pete is happy, Joan."
He loves you.
The two are completely separate issues.
My PI was right.
Marriage is a big sham.
- How old is she?
- Twenty-two.
"She""s the towel girl at the 24 Hour Fitness."
"For weeks, Pete was complaining:"
"""Why aren""t our towels as white as the towels at the gym?"""
"And then one day, not another word about towels."
"That""s when I knew."
- I guess I have to leave him.
- I would.
- No way.
- Brenda.
"You""ll just have to win him back."
"Women""s Club."
Same time every Tuesday.
When was the last time you and Pete had a date?
"We went to Tiffany""s soccer game on Friday night."
"A date, Joan."
"High heels, tight skirt, pretending to be the maid?"
"Joan is a grownup, not a Barbie doll."
She has real-life responsibilities.
- Pete needs to suck it up and be a man.
- Says a woman twice divorced.
"Look, Joan, is Pete being a prepubescent jerk?"
Yes.
"He""s a man in his 40s."
What do you expect?
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.
Let's get going.
I'll see you around.
"And by that I mean please, stay away from me."
"See you later, ghosts of staffers past."
"Madam President, I brought you Congressman Pierce."
"I brought him also, ma'am."
Richard Splett.
She already knows who you are.
You can go.
"No, no, no."
Not you.
Not you.
We're such big fans.
I'm a big fan of yours.
"Thank you, Madam President."
I am here to serve.
How can I help?
The president needs you to do something for her.
"And in exchange, she feels that you deserve a better job."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
"Ambassador, perhaps."
How does that sound?
Ambassador?
Me?
"Oh, wow."
Not what I was expecting.
What's your favorite city?
Dallas.
"I love Dallas, Texas."
"No, it needs to be a foreign city."
"Uh, we knowwhat risks you've taken in inviting us here."
[Translator] I took no risk.
I am too old to be afraid ofwhat anyone thinks.

Both are dogs.
"Mr. Chairman, there's an old saying in my country:"

[Translator] That has the added virtue ofbeing true.
"[Kissinger] Yourwritings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman."
[Translator Speaking Chinese]
- [Speaks Chinese] - [Translator] Bullshit.
My writings mean absolutely nothing.
[Mao Speaking Chinese]
[Translator] I want to knowyoursecret.
"[Kissinger] My secret, Mr. Chairman?"
[Mao Speaking Chinese]
How a fatman gets so many girls.

"Thank-- Thank everybody, please."
"- Yeah, just let us know."
- Just let us-
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- If you get some more info.
- If there's an update.
- Yeah.
Um...
Guys.
"Look, this is the hard part."
Pete's gone.
"- Yeah, I know."
"- No, I mean, like, when someone is missing..."
"Hey, we've had more manpower on this than we've ever had looking for someone."
"I mean, I've got the fire department involved in looking for him and I hate firemen."
- No.
"- No, it means a lot."
- Yeah.
"- Ricky, thank you."
- No.
What Iâm trying to say is...
"You know, someone in Pete's condition?"
He didn't go anywhere.
He couldn't have gone anywhere.
He's gone.
He's in the river or something.
And it's hard when a body doesn't--
Doesn't turn up.
"Look, this isn't the first time I've had to have this talk, but... when it's people you know, it's hard."
"- What are you trying to say, Ricky?"
"- Horace, he's gone."
New York City.
"Relatives, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, you have a good time, anyway."
- Yes.
Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.
- Good.
"- Thanks, Saul."
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know.
You heard him.
"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."
- Here.
This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.
Will they keep the shop open while they're on vacation?
They might have someone part time to take orders.
Out of business?
"Hey, brahda."
Bet you'd like a ride to Diamond Head.
Ten bucks round trip.
Ten bucks?
"No, thanks."
X-rays are up.
"-C-spine clear, mediastinum looks okay."
-Very good.
-So where are you registered?
-What?
-Definitely have to.
-Could someone get SonoSite?
"My ex-wife didn't, we ended up with clocks."
"With my sister, salad bowls."
Seven of them.
Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient?
"Okay, then."
"Can we have that SonoSite, please?"
Neela.
Can you get away?
-We need to go get a license.
-We don't know where to get married.
-We do.
Hospital chapel.
-When did we decide that?
"-You were busy, I thought you--"
-And Jerry's gonna marry us?
"Yeah, he has some kind of minister's license, so l-- ls that really who we want?"
"What's Frank gonna be, the ring bearer?"
We don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.
-Are you gonna choose the flowers too?
"-No, no."
"But you like lilies, right?"
"-Michael, we have to talk."
-About what?
-l think this is getting a little-- Dr. Gallant.
You're so tall.
Get lost!
So sorry.
Goodbye.
"David, sit and eat with us."
I've to work.
Thanks.
Thank God having David here.
I'll never know how to deal with those members.
Like it?
We can change it till you like it.
Can you stop spending money to me this way?
"When you did something wrong, sent me gift."
Now you buy me a car.
So what?
I'm not that greedy.
You know how bad that makes me feel?
What?
Aren't I nice to you?
You just walked out on me.
Why did we've to split up?
You really want to know?
Tell me.
"You're ill-tempered, stubborn, give me no sense of security..."
"Ok, cut it out."
"You're not my cup of tea, ok?"
Then imagine me to be coffee.
"Milk tea, tea and coffee mix, anything."
"Michael, let's just be friends."
"It's all my fault, ok?"
"Lisa, is everything ok?"
This is your tea.
Not now.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I keep it running perfect.
"It's Tony's sister, she did it."
She's as weird as he is.
"Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly and continuously without interference from your sister."
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- It's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"Hey, wait for me."
"Come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
Okay.
Less gay it is.
Great!
"I'm gonna give Wes a call, see what he thinks of the glasses idea."
"Oh, Jack."
He has no idea what he just...
Anticlimax.
What's wrong?
My boyfriend back home thinks that college is gonna make me some sort of... sex robot.
Tell me about it.
Mine thinks it's gonna turn me into a brainwashed sex doll.
You know what?
We should teach them a lesson.
Yeah?
If they're gonna treat us like that... maybe we should just act like it.
Yeah!
"Okay, close your eyes."
You tricked me.
What are you gonna do about it?
- That.
- Ouch!
Not too hard!
Stop!
You stop!
"Oh, you're so sexy!"
I feel so much better!
Me too.
Pillow fights fix everything.
"You know, I heard that but I always thought it was a sham."
A pillow sham?
"Ooh, good one."
I've never done that before... with a girl...
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr. Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr. Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
Hey.
"Hey, Benigno."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
Want to come?
I'm meeting my editor.
Sparkly!
"Fine, you can't live with Elliot!"
"But you're not living with us, so get your crap out by Friday."
Friday?
Friday.
Friday's my birthday!
I've already e-vited everyone to a party at our place.
Whose place?
Your place.
"Look, I can't just un-e-vite everyone"
I've already got two e-yeses and twenty-four e-maybes.
That's a lot of e-sponses.
"Bambi, I'm gonna put my e-foot up your ass."
It's a Mexican-themed fiesta.
on the first anniversary of my 29th birthday.
That means I'm turning thirty!
Donde ?
56 Wallnut Drive.
Cuando ?
Thank you for asking ocho-thirty until upside-down question mark.
Sombreros at the door.
I'll be there.
Gracias amigo.
I borrowed one of your dictionaries!
"Since there were twelve surgical residents at Sacred Heart fighting for four attending spots,"
Turk was ass-kissing the senior staff.

DR. WEN!
-Hi there.
-Hi.
"Just set it down there, OK?"
Are you studying the stars Miss Sylvia?
Exactly!
Thank you!
Oh my god!
God miss Sylvia?
Oh add out 20 percent.
"Very good, thank you."
"I'm falling asleep I'm tired, I'm falling asleep and you're boring me to death."
"Please don't die, I know you'll love it,"
Hurry up please!
hop
"You'll love it,"
Fuck!
I'm fucking you.
Fucking you...
"Sorry, you're eating."
Oh It's my pleasure.
How did you meeting go with the girl?
She didn't believe me.
Who would believe a man who's capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?
"Oh, what did you got?"
This is for you.
This is what I drink.
"Oh, thank you."
"Start getting your dinner, I shouldn't start talking about your duty again."
"Here, open it."
Hey you?
Hey you?
What's with these glass arrows in the head?
"- Ok, ok."
"- They make a good team, you know."
"Jin-san, I wonder if even now you are being discharged, you want to stay."
"Hold on, Captain."
Before when we were running under the bombing... you know I could have done it alone.
Don't you?
But... we are trained to don't let no one behind.

I found the main point.
It was true... there's a special warhead...
Male here.
Entered inside the TL.
Good.

Yankee.
Can you immediately put together a log?
Yankee?
What's going on?
Yankee?
"Gimlet here, over!"
"Male, reply!"
Gimlet here.
Male here.
Can't contact Yankee.
I'll send a scout team to the surface to investigate.
To the surface?
Hey!
Male!
Didn't earn your points yet?
- We should all be drunk for this.
- Let's get really drunk.
- All right.
- Yeah.
You know what?
I'll get some beers.
- Come with me.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Let him go.
- Mmm.
- I don't know what happened.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Deandra, we've been at this for days now."
It's like you have no motor skills.
Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck.
Hey!
How's the chip off the old block doin'?
"- Bobby, not now, okay?"
"- Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61?"
"They billed it as ""Beauty Versus the Beast."""
Wasn't much of a fight.
First-round knockout.
- He went down like a...
"- Wait, wait, wait."
Hold on a second.
"What's goin' on with you, Thunderson?"
"What, are you trying to humiliate me?"
"Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago."
You know damn well you hit me after the bell.
Incidentally you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night.
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"I know, I realize, but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"When she's better, I'll ask her."
It couldn't hurt.
In the meantime....
That's okay.
"I really hate to ask you this, but for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
Where's a pencil?
Right here.
She'd love it!
What's her name?
I lied.
It's for me.
The spelling is on the back:
Kinderman.
"You know that film you made, Angel?"
I saw that six times!
Really?
It was beautiful.
Thank you.
-'Bye.
-'Bye.
"Please, no!"
-Do it!
"-Please, don't!"
You bitch!
Do it!
"Please, no!"
Let Jesus fuck you!
"Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner."
Then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab..

"So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross.."
it just isn't gonna happen.

"How's my favorite dog, huh?"
How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.
-Will you excuse us?
We need to talk.
-Sure.
"Oh, me, right."
-He's miserable.
What happened to him?
-Nothing.
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
"Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!"
This is the happiest dog in the world.
"He spends a day with you, and look!"
He's breathing.
"Okay, well, he's watching us so just look happy, okay?"
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
"Come, Ashwini."
Let's go.
Let's not stay here.
"Who is it, Ashwini?"
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my doing.
Do you know how many years of jail for a hit-and-run case?
"Keep quiet, Ashwini."
Sir...
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
"I'll miss you, Manoj."
Be careful.
I'll be awaiting your call.
Call me soon.

Did he call you?
Get me my bag from the backseat.
Get it.
"Oh, you ...."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you ...."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you ...."
What can I do then?
I got an idea.
What is it?
I can guarantee success with my idea.
- Your Highness will have to be patient.
- Why?
"If you can be patient,"
I'll guarantee you'll have the books of Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword.
Brother!
What is it?
Fung-wu killed his master!
He killed his master?
How can it be?
How can it be?
It's true!
Fung-wu's master was playing chess with His Highness.
"Suddenly, he held a sword in his hand and plunged it into his master's body."
That's unreasonable.
How can it be?
I saw it myself.
His master told him before he died that he'd done the right thing.
Done the right thing?
That's strange.
What happened afterwards?
His Highness arrested him for murder.
Did he resist?
It was useless!
He's helpless!
"Yan-ling, don't be sad!"
I'll find out the truth.
"1, 2, 3!"
"1, 2, 3!"
"People, please, move out of the way, please."
Keep this door open.
"Come on, open the door."
- Bring him in.
Is he conscious?
"- No, ma'am."
"- Oh, my God."
- Calm down.
He's going to be all right.
He's going to be all right.
We'll cut him right here.
Gauze.
- That's good.
- On your left.
"Thank you, nurse."
"Dr. Simmons, take a look at this."
Heavenly father...
I know everything happens for a reason... so I'll just leave it in your hands.
Amen.
Excuse me.
I need somebody to talk to about my friend.
I'm worried about his condition.
What time you get off work?
I just want to discuss his condition.
Visiting hours are over.
Good night.
"You're doing much better, Mr. Reed."
Don't try to talk.
You need your rest.
"My name is Vanessa, and I'm going to take great care of you."
Understand?
Just push the button on the side of the bed... and I'll be there.
"- Oh, this is your car, right?"
- Yep.
See?
Fixed it.
Okay.
You're backing up?
Just fucking go straight.
"I took a precision driving class, Dan."
I think I know what I'm doing.
"Ma'am, we've lost Pierce."
I'm sorry.
We should have hired Navy SEALs instead of those two actual seals.
How do you lose a whole person?
"A cuff link I get, but not a person."
Okay.
She said she's losing her voice.
Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.
"- Oh, my God."
- Jesus.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"She said you fucked up, Ben."
And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.
You need to get him out.
"- She didn't say that, Gary."
"- Yes, she did."
"Everyone, shut your fucking holes!"
The president is not sick.
- You guys are.
You're parasites.
You're like an infestation of mediocrity.
I don't care if you're a 1950s radio broadcaster.
Master!
Master!
Why did you kill Law Ching?
Why did you force my master to die at my sword?
I didn't force him!
Now I understand.
This is your filthy trick to get our book.
Nonsense!
It was the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Why?
The poison your master drank is familiar to the Shaolin.
Shaolin temple!
Stop!
Sung Chi!
Execute him for the murder of his master.
"Your Highness, Law Ching has cheated you."
His student definitely knows 8-divine Sword.
Arrest him!
8-divine Sword?
Don't stop!
How are you?
Speak!
"Yes, or you'll have to suffer more!"
But I don't know 8-divine Sword.
How can I tell you?
"Your Highness, please stop!"
Why?
The man has the same temperament as his master.
He won't tell you even if you kill him.
That hasn't changed.
You don't lose a steady hand.
"Except, back then it was control."
Now it's rheumatism.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're in the oldest part of Amsterdam."

I'm killing myself dragging my husband around.
He insisted on going on a holiday.
And it had to be Holland.
Wanted to see the old mother country?
Niels!
-Ab!
Wout!
He recognizes us!
-Of course.
Thank you very much.
Does your husband still enjoy a sex club?
He thinks it's beautiful.
He can't move well anymore.
He's had a stroke.
"But his brain's still working, isn't it?"
My sweetheart.
"Miss, help me, please."
Miss!
Shoot.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
Please.

Mumbai is my dream city.
And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me.
I can't lose this opportunity.
And you can lose me.
"Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination."
And not to stop them.
Understood?
I am just a path for you?
You are not my destination too.
"Fine, Gul."
"You will meet me once before you leave, won't you?"
Of course.
Go to sleep.
Your daughter has returned.
Ask her where she was the whole night.
Her friends had thrown a bash.
Farewell party.
And so are we.
You are so explaining this to me.
"Hey, baby."
"If this bar were a meat market, you'd be the prime rib."
"Oh, god."
"You reek of cannabis, Bender."
Cannabis?
"Hey Maxine, you've got something on your chest - my eyes!"
Go away.
It's never going to happen.
"Hey, are you like a parking ticket or something?"
"Cuz you've got ""fine"" written all over you."
I have a headache.
You can stand here but don't talk to me.
"Look, you look a lot like my next girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?"
"Oh, my god."
How long does this go on before you actually quit?
I never quit.
That's one thing that you're gonna learn about me.
I never quit.
Never.
Fuck it.
[BENDER] Fuck what?
Fuck it - let's do it.
What?
Where we going?
We're gonna go to your place.
We're gonna go- we're gonna go to my place?
Mm-hmm.
Sweet.
- Now.
"- Oh, now."
(voice cracking):
including... my poor wife.
(creaky door opens)
"Oh, hi."
I need to switch rooms.
This guy is bumming me out.
I don't know if you have any singles open or...
Silence!
"Now that we have you, we don't need this frail, old man."
"Well, that was a stupid move."
You're all under arrest.
(dramatically):
For murder!
(surf rolling)
"Aw, this soaks deck."
"Hey there, Chief."
You mind if I pick up here tomorrow?
Say between 1:00 and 4:00?
"See, I'm a cable installer..."
"Good, because our cable is out."
We missed the last Mad Men.
You will fix our cable.
"Oh, this will be easy."
Good luck.
We've tried everything.
"Oh, so pirates couldn't fix their cable?"
That's right.
"Exactly, so let me do what I do."
Caw!
Caw!
PIRATE:
It is working!
Go!
Thank you.
Get out!
Do you still love me?
I gave you my reasons.
Do you still love me?
"Say ""I do not love you."""
Say it!
Say it!
I do not love you.
You're a liar!
"You did the right thing, coming to see me."
I do not have anyone else.
You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?
Yes.
"You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love."
Only one course remains open to you.
What do I have to do?
There's someone you should meet.
Who?
His name is Guibourg.
Who is he?
He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.
Where shall I find him?
Monsieur Guibourg?
Yes?
I need your help.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the Marquise de Montespan.
And how may I help you?
I need to reclaim a man's love.
Are you helping him with his homework?
"Oh, ."
No.
He does it all himself.
"He's getting a ""d."" maybe you should help him."
"Oh, no."
We do.
We do.
We totally do.
"It's just that we can't help him, 'cause we don't really understand it ourselves."
"Okay, okay."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to set aside some extra time...
An evening next week...
To teach parents a math class.
Oh!
That would be so...
Wait.
What?
A class for parents?
Is there a problem?
No.
That just sounds like a lot of work...
For you.
"Welcome, parents."
I'm sure we're all thrilled
"To be here on a night when ""the mentalist"" is on,"
But tonight we're gonna learn...
excuse me.
Ms. Rinsky?
How wonderful.
An interruption.
You didn't forget your phone again did you?
"Anyways, Aunt came out to check her bank account, and it broke her heart."
Give her a call ok?
Welcome!
This is driving nuts!
Give me a can of beer that's past the expiration date.
There's no such thing.
It's $1.70.
-Get money from Jang Min.
-Sis said that she will kill me.
"If that kills you, I should've been dead 88000 times."
It will be $1.70 sir.
I don't have money.
See?
"Fine, let me call my sister first."
Chan!
Come on Chan!
Geez.
"""Sis isn't answering her phone."
"I left her a voice mail."""
"""I told her that you cried your eye balls out."" Hehe look at this kid."
"""Ok."" Send."
"This is so simple, Honey."
Hey what time are you coming home?
"Yes, mother around 7?"
"Ok, I'll get ready then."
"Ok, Mom see you."
What did you want to eat?
Just make whatever you want.
Fine!
"We can just text this, ""What time?"" ""What do you want?"""
"""7,"" ""Kimchi"" It's so simple."
"""With hasty regards, Tadao. """
"Grandma, it's a very good idea!"
"You should go, absolutely."
- Everybody to Hawaii!
- Wonderful!
- It will be a great holiday!
"- Grandma, let's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie. """
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from Clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."
"""of your eldest brother..."
"""Suzujiro Haruno."
"""Ever since my father..."
"""came from Japan..."
"""to Hawaii in 1920..."
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
"-Oh, that is cold."
"-No, it's not."
It's clear.
"You're gonna keep me in my place, are you?"
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
"Well, I'm not moving, for your information."
"You can work your tough-girl thing, but I know you're in love with me."
That's irrelevant.
"Kind of tired, babe."
You know?
-You're up early.
"-I know, and I'm not happy about it."
-You need some Valium?
-I don't wanna get back into that again.
"Yeah, that wouldn't be good."
Try swimming.
It helps.
-So how are you?
How's work going?
-Good.
-Just not sleeping enough myself.
"-Oh, I'm sure."
-Hospital's been busy.
"-A lot of psychos, huh?"
"No, just a lot of pained souls."
"Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex."
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex.
I like her a lot.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wonderbar!"
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!"
"And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!"
Well...
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh...
What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
"Okay, fine."
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
"- Oh, ha ha."
"Very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja.
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
The mailman put one of your letters... in my box.
I'll give you some medication.
I'm growing a mustache.
Miss Brody.
It's me.
It's Detective Ridgely.
"You all right, honey?"
Take this.
Miss Brody.
Don't you ever try... to sneak off on me like that again.
You understand?
It's all right.
"Hey, Barry."
"Long night, squire?"
Hospital bills.
You got a file for every nosebleed in Illinois?
If you'll just be patient...
Thank you.
But this says 3B.
Yes.
Miss Brody lives in apartment 2B.
Somebody made a mistake.
That's right.
Valerie Wheaton died in apartment 3B.
Who has access to these files?
Only hospital personnel.
I want a list.
All right.
Do you by chance recognize the handwriting on this?
This looks like Dr. Pierce's writing.
What were you doing at the El station... so late at night?
Why do you want to know?
"Oh, mate."
That'll be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
"Without wanting to give the game completely away, they're twins, from Macedonia and..."
.. they don't have keys.
You - out.
"Laters, bro."
- Mr Douglas.
- Calum.
"- Oh, no."
- John Mercer!
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you shared the cell?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
- I'm not staying here.
The lad's an idiot.
- That's a bit harsh.
"Granted, he's no Stephen Hawking."
"- John, mate, don't be like that."
"- Don't ""John, mate"" me, please."
- I'm not staying here.
- You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
Get rid of him.
- John!
- What are you doing?
This way you get the flat to yourself.
"John, mate, please, I've changed a lot since then."
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please."
John!
Please!
Don't...
Here.
Look at this one.
"Oh, that's great."
Great.
With the smoke around Jivver's face.
Yeah.
So how's Hallie?
Looks like...
"you guys are an item now, huh?"
No.
"No, not an item."
Definitely not.
"She's a very nice girl, but um, she doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"
"Well, you're a big boy."
I'm sure you can handle... her.
"Hey, um, I wanted to ask you did you tell her to pursue me?"
Uh...
- Hello there Miss homebody.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
For what?
Did you forget my big screen debut deal?
We're going to my L.A. Red carpet premiere.
Hello.
"What do you think, Johnson?"
I think she's dead.
No excuses.
Seven was supposed to tell you.
Yeah.
"Well, he didn't."
"Oh, my god, I did actually."
It's just that you had your head buried in those photos and you didn't notice.
"Well, can I wear this?"
"So, do you know what everyone is saying?"
What?
About how you and Angela had sex.
- Who?
- You and Angela.
No.
Who's saying that?
I don't know.
People. I mean.
"She told me the truth, of course."
What truth?
How far you guys went.
Well.
Yeah.
Because nothing happened.
"Right, so how come it's all over school?"
"I mean, you're not talking it up like some low-life..."
"derelict cretin telling everyone you did her, are you?"
J ust checking.
- H i Brian.
- H i.
- This is Gina.
- Hey.
- Right.
H i.
- Brian saw the entire thing.
I heard you actually chased the gunmen.
- Chased the gunmen?
- l would have screamed.
I have to leave the room when my father uses the electric knife.
"I think chase is a little bit strong, but I was going to check out the situation ..."
because you know if there's a gun--
Mr. Yagami?
We were in the same class.
But we did not go.
"I saw him yesterday, to my work."
He had to return to that time.
I see!
Good!
Sorry for inconvenience.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause in .
It's that 'an accident.

I am in a rush.
I do it on.
I want bread.
I freaked out yesterday.
Sakota
"During his run, he had a pain."
"Sometimes you what, Sakota?"
"It crashed into the train, and is the result."
"It's been what, in fact ?"
- This would be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
This is not true...
This is not true...
I can not believe.
This is impossible.
No...
No...
Do not be sad guy.
- Huh?
- It was a night protection.
"Okay, I'm making out with this guy..."
PG stuff.
"And he mentions that he's going out of town, he's gonna be out of touch."
Run.
But maybe he is going out of town.
Where?
Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?
Where are you going out of town to again?
Um...
Uh...
Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh.
Run.
"So, what, now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?"
Yeah.
There's not gonna be anybody left.
I don't know why I'm saying this but I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
What do I do?
"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?"
But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
[SIGHS]
BEN:
"Yeah, the boat looks great."
You say that like there's only one problem.
God knows what Lance is going to come up with while you try to produce a mother out of thin air.
Pay the bill.

Marjorie:
Okay.
How soon can you make it to Bridgeport?
Why?
Because I need you to be the rope.
Okay.
Who am I playing?
Pete's mom Maggie.
"Uh, isn't she, like, north of 50?"
"I just played your mistress a few years ago, Marius."
"What, now I'm your mother?"
"What is this, Hollywood?"
"Well, we're screwed if you don't."
Ohh.
Do you have any idea of her height?
No.
Oh.
Good.
I'll sit.
"Uh, need to be dark, and I'll need something that makes them not want to look too closely."
Okay.
"I need to know a few things about her, please."
I don't know much beyond her name.
"Well, figure it out."
- [phone rings]
- Shit.
Yeah.
AKAN:
"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia, and, at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.
This is a rare surviving bat.

You freely admit you killed this man?

"But this is my day in court, and I aim to finish."
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.
- What have you been up to?
- When?
All this time!
I've been looking out the window.
The window?
What were you looking at?
"Just looking, Barbuda."
I see.
How are you doing in school?
"The principal says that I'm behind, Barbuda."
Behind?
How come?
Didn't you showher how you can read?
"How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope."
Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day?
"Don't worry, sweetie."
You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Don't worry about that.
I miss you already!
I hope the circus comes by Rio de Janeiro again.
"Next time, I promise I'll bring Foguinho."
"Come on, my tightrope walker."
Barbuda.
Can you take me up there someday?
Ask your grandma.
She'll take you.
"I want to go with you, Barbuda."
Can you take me?
- Mom!
- Maria!
!
- Are you starting again?
!
"Why is Kobi screaming, honey?"
"Then who is that, Yitzhak?"
"Why are you crying, Yarivi?"
Your father called me.
He said he might want to come too.
Suddenly everyone's interested in me- I'm a celebrity-.
"It's all kosher, dear."
"Poor Jonah, my beautiful sister."
"She was better at everything else, but I could teach you how to cook!"
"So what are you up to, Aunt Rosa?"
What can I do?
I teach Hebrew.
"Besides your leg, are you feeling better?"
Why?
- Are you better?
- What do you mean?
He's asking if you're better.
You said you were sick.
"- Me, sick?"
- Aren't you sick?
I'm as healthy as a horse.
This is in Paris.
"You came to visit, remember?"
Your mother came every year.
Do you know where in Paris?
- Do you remember?
- How?
I was only five.
Then how should I remember?
"Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
Look what you've done.
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- Sickle!
Go back!
Sickle!
No!
Letha...
look.
- I can't look.
- You must.
It's miraculous.
"There are no miracles, Letha."
Only scientific explanations for everything.
"Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing."
It... must be that... boy.
There's a...
There's a force that centers around that boy.
A force capable of countermanding the basic physical law of...
gravity.
"Victor, I don't know what you're talking about."
Molecular mobilization.
"I need that boy, Letha."
- I need him desperately.
"- Now, just a minute."
"Brilliant, my boy."
Mukesh.
Come here.
I don't care what people will think of me...
But you will never be able to face anyone again!
Put the knife in me!
What?
You don't have to kill me!
Insert it in a little bit!
Sarika!
I'll break open the door!
He will kill both of us!
Good!
We will die together like star-crossed lovers!
I am warning you for the last time Sarika!
That felt good.
First class first!
It was never Johnny who betrayed me...
It has always been you.
"And today, you want to get away again."
Not this time!
This is Mukesh.
is Johnny there?
"Who, Karpov?"
Yes.
He took off.
To Mauritius.
The lucky fucker ran into a bag of cash!
Johnny!
"Brother, we have reached."
Where are you?
We have been waiting outside the train station.
Are you coming?
How?
I've got no place to work.
What's wrong with the country?
MaIIefiIIe is there.
"The children do need a tutor, but..."
I just can't stand the sight of him any more.
I tell him outright I want him to leave and he plainly refuses.
"I'm a coward, of course."
I can never simply boot my lovers down the stairs.
- Ha!
- What?
Why don't you stay here in Paris and write?
Because alfred's here.
I've got to go somewhere.
"Anywhere, I don't know."
"Maybe I should just curl up and die, yes?"
"Listen, BuIoz."
"I need 3,000 francs now."
Let me read this... and we'II talk tonight at the Baroness Laginsky's party.
I hadn't planned to attend.
alfred might be there.
I know for a fact that he won't.
AII right.
- What's that?
- marvellous.
- Her memoirs?
Am I in it?
- No!
This bit's about her childhood.
"You'II come in later, after she chews up her husband and a hundred others."
It's true.
She's a cannibal.
"If you divide 98 by 12, it makes $8 a year for her loyalty."
"Then throw in Señora Rodríguez, Señora Salcedo, Señora García--"
"Son, we have to have the sense of the community."
That's very important.
"- Tito understands that, right?"
- Claro.
Carlos:
Tito understands everything.
Woman:
You're a day late!
"Hey, Miss Mercedes."
Miss Mercedes!
Ah-ah-ah!
I need you at the other building.
- Can I clean up first?
- Later.
What's the fucking rush?
I told you we have to get these windows in by the end of the month.
Why are these cans in with the newspapers?
Didn't we have this conversation before?
- I posted notices on every floor.
- That's not enough.
"At the end of the day, you're responsible, not the tenant."
My man!
What's happening?
"- Maggie, my buddy Mickey."
- What's up?
- Mickey... and Daisy.
- Daisy:
Fuck you...!
"Daisy, what's happening?"
This is Berna.
"Seventeen black, we won!"
Great!
"Fortunate in games of chance, unfortunate in games of love."
we won.
"What, thats all?"
yes.
Ok then
Thanks
Here.
You where splendid.
"Truly, you looked marvelous."
"Enough with the complements, you know that there is no room for them between us."
What time is the meeting?
Tonight at midnight.
And Uli?
He is carrying out a small mission.
You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova.
Me?
Why do you say that?
I have my reasons.
Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car?
"No, bring mine!"
"Adriana, wait!"
wait.
What happened to you...you are quite the mess.
I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman.
Who was he?
"I do not know, It was dark."
And who was she?
"Don't know, I only saw her shadow."
"Oh, sure."
"Ah,I see, there goes your ""ghost."""
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
(Engine starts)
(Birds chirping)
"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
Why?

They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hi.
So are we doing something tonight or not?
I can't.
My girlfriends are sleeping over.
I'm having a sleepover.
This is like the first normal thing I've done since I got pregnant.
"All right, well..."
Just let me know where I fit in here.
"Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody and Francine and I'll let you know."
(SCOFFS)
I'm just joking.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, not funny."
And...
You know what?
This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"No, I have to go."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"And I don't like your friends, either."
They're not nice.
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.
We'll see.
"Yeah, we will."
Boyfriend problems?
He thinks my friends aren't nice.
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.
But it's high school and you have to have friends and these are the only friends I can get right now.
My job with you always comes first.
I promise.
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
"I like the other one better, the one on the trolley cars."
What do you think?
I don't know.
"Oh, my God."
It's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that.
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
"I can't believe it, either."
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember your predecessor, Marissa Kessler?"
Murder victim?
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Randy and the Captain are probably already there.
It should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24. 24. 24.
Are you done?
Sorry.
Let's do this.
What's the guy's name again?
You're confused.
He's confused you.
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!
"I said, don't move.!"
I mean business.
Goddamn it.!
Would you think about what you're doing.!
This guy's a scumbag.!
He doesn't want you!
He's only using you!
Come on!
Put the gun down!
Back away from Jack now!
- You've gone completely crazy.
You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.
How do you plan to get us out of this one?
Watch me and weep.
"It takes all kinds, Dalt."
"Okay, Bill, Wendy, I hope you're getting this."
They are walking directly towards the helicopter... and they're staring at me like a couple of crazed dogs.
I'm gonna try to get a word from them if I can.
"This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen."
This...
"- Oh, my..."
- Get out of there.
"- Let's go, pal."
Let's go.
- I'm being asked...
- Come on!
Go!
I just got so nervous.
- You were great.
- It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Good job.
"Well, thank you, mr."
Monk.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
"Natalie, where you going?"
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
The phones are lighting up like crazy.
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did.
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
So...
what do you say?
- About what?
- About doing it full-time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you you're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
- What's going on?
- I just got fired.
"Oh, my gosh, are you serious?"
"Oh, don't act so shocked, Carrie."
"All the times I've watched ""All About Eve,"""
"and I didn't even realize you were ""All About Eve-ing"" me."
What are you talking about?
Me?
I didn't want to get you fired.
"I mean, I've been working my butt off to save your job."
Yeah?
"Well, nice work..."
Taking my assignment and all.
"Bennet, you vanished."
I couldn't reach you.
"And apparently, you were out partying."
So what was I supposed to do?
Not stab me in the back.
Thanks for being such a good friend.
I didn't mean to get him fired.
Oh.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dorrit...
Bradshaw.
I'm just waiting to meet my dad.
"Oh, I didn't realize Tom had kids."
"Yep, me and my sister."
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I just need some money.
Got it.
"Don't tell him, but he's super easy to manipulate."
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Take it!
Go!
"Hold it, lady, what are you doing?"
Looking for somebody!
Who are you looking for?
Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung is at a chess game with his master and Highness.
Having a chess game?
I'll join them.
His Highness has ordered that there be no disturbance.
It's alright!
I won't tell anybody if His Highness loses.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking for his student.
No!
No?
Surround her!
This is ridiculous!
"Go away, or we'll do something!"
I won't leave unless I see Fung-wu.
Brother!
"Yan-ling, why do you figtht with them?"
You better go away with your sister.
And don't disturb the chess game!
The chess game?
He's playing chess with Mr. Law!
You came to find Fung-wu.
"Yes, they just won't let me in."
Mr. Royal Guard!
We are friends of His Highness.
You should at least tell Fung-wu that she's here.
That's right!
It's all yours.
Delicious.
It's so delicious...
So delicious.
It really is delicious.
Sorry.
Welcome.
"Please press the button to select your room, then receive your key at the front desk."
Resting or staying overnight?
Overnight.
"Overnight is 14,000 yen, plus day fee of 5,800 yen."
Really?
That's the rule.
So expensive.
200 yen is your change.
"The girl's no good, she's not sexy and she's loose down there."
"Seriously, and she mentioned her dad is a cop, too."
Don't tell me you fell for her sob stories.
Where are you?
The bathroom.
Bet she's already stolen your stuff and left.
What?
First time?
Never done this?
Not for this reason.
No one here.
"Oh, an employee."
"""What are you doing here?"""
Not throwing it?
"Well, I just bought this phone."
Tired?
Hey there.
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
Howdy folks.
Who are you?
Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Matira?
No.
Over the mountains then?
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
"Take it, you don't get many strangers around here?"
No.
Especially not those who travel near dark.
Why's that?
- You really don't know?
- Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business really, we're just travellers."
Then you best keep travelling.
Ya...
Alright then.
Wait!
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
May not even start tonight.
"It's been three months, how much longer do you think it will wait."
"Hi, what are you talking about?"
The Daemus.
He just got out of intensive care.
"We should probably go visit the man, considering it's kind of our fault that he's in there."
"Man, would you quit saying that?"
It is not our fault.
You know what?
You're right.
It's your fault.
Hike.
Go long!
Come on.
I got a cannon over here.
"Further, further!"
Oh.
Ooh.
"Usually, I'm a big fan of physical comedy."
Pratfalls and what not.
Yeah.
When I heard that crunch...
"- Actually, it was still kind of funny."
- Yeah.
"Look, you know what?"
"We'll go visit him, give him a balloon, draw penises all over his cast."
He'll smile.
We'll be in the clear.
"Hey, Aaron."
You okay?
I'm not really sure.
"Well, he should be more than okay because he had lunch with..."
Liza Blue.
Liza Blue?
The porn star?
"Okay, first of all, that's not her real name."
There is some problem.
Where are you going?
To have a smoke.
Pia.
"- Yes, sir."
Where is Gul?
- She must be around in the office.
Where is Adi?
He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.
Alright.
Thanks.
Adi.
- Hi.
What do you think?
By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready?
"It will take another three-four days, sir."
The workload is very heavy.
Gul is there to help you.
She must have also prepared some designs.
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.
She is new.
She will learn gradually.
We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute.
Along with Gul everybody else will also learn.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
Just stop kidding.
"If she is not talented, sack her."
Throw her out.
You know we are short of time.
It is better you do this job.
"Yes, certainly I am."
Do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault?
What?
What?
I was too permissive?
"No, no, no, no."
"I'm not talking about the liberal child-rearing sense, Mom."
You blame everybody but yourself.
"You go out of your way, it's me, it's Kevin, it's Dad."
Where were you in the picture?
Do you ever think about that?
I don't see any ocean out there.
This is a terrible place to come to.
Please!
Please!
Just one minute!
One minute!
It's for my little girl.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
This must happen every night.
"Yeah, it's like ""Sophie's Choice"" in here."
What do you need?
I need a grass Hawaiian skirt for a hula.
"There's miriachis, which would be Mexico..."
Coconut cup?
Closer...
Ukelele...that's a good sign.
Sorry.
"No, don't tell me that."
Don't tell me that.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
"The way he talks, you'd think he had something there."
Excuse me.
Hey.
Look at the dude.
- Come on.
Let's give him the works.
"- All right, kiddo."
"- Hey, watch out!"
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
"All right, come on!"
Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
"How'd you get it, Crab?"
I hoisted it over the transom in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
"Boy, we'll be in the money now."
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
"Hi, Soapy!"
"- Soapy, look what we got."
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
That's not really an answer.
I totally thought I was being abducted.
"I was so happy to wake up in my bunker and not some alien mother ship, but also, same time, a little bummed it didn't happen."
"I, uh..."
I need a minute with Oleg.
That's fine with me.
How's everybody doing?
Good?
(gun fires)
"(man screams) No, uh, everything's fine."
At ease.
"Uh, he's got it under control."
"I'm pretty sure, okay?"
(man shouting in Russian) Thanks.
See?
You get it?
Yeah.
Great.

Open up there.
"Yeah, those."
Plug the jacks in there.

"Sorry about that, boss."
Sorry about that?

Is that your fault?
"Well, it was O'Leary, sir, he, er, completely went for it."
He went rogue and started typing things into the computer...
I didn't go rogue.
"Anyway, you said you 100% trust me, I didn't go rogue."
"Oi, big boy, look at me, yes."
"Explanation now, yes!"
"OK, I thought the killer and the kidnapper was Miley Cyrus."
Did you?
Yeah.
"Right, why?"
"She had motive, there was a bypass going to go through the old people's home."
"I thought the old people loved the VHS, she knew her way around a VHS."
And the...
And the delivery of the ransom note was in VHS.
Albert.
(Camilla starts crying)
"Oh, sweetie!"
Why don't you sort things out with him?
- Because I think it's too late.
- It's never too late.
"If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself?"
"You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding."
"Oh Camilla, now you got me going too."
"(light waltz, both girls laugh and cry at the same time)"
Hey... silly me.
I can be such a wise-ass.
Didn't I realise I was talking about myself?
Apparently not.
I needed one more push.
And that push came from an unexpected place.
(knocking on door)
May I come in?
Are you all right?
- Entrez.
I'm almost done.
- Sure?
We used to be lovers.
Can you believe that?
You and Pierre?
"Yes, I know."
I thought he was the love of my life.
Are we talking about the same person?
- Yeah.
Unfortunately.
- What happened?
- L'amour rend aveugle.
Open it!
Get out here.
Get out here!
Tell him to come out here.
- Tell him!
"- Do what he says, Dennis."
Thanks.
Please don't do this.
I got three kids.
Shut up!
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.

This is vinaigrette with...
With garlic.

And this is 'Iyutenitsa'.
"It looks like ketchup, but it's natural."
Do you want to taste it?
I?
Mr. Lloyd?
What's up?
OMG.
The Turkish security officer.
Jesus Christ.
I think he would have accompanied us to Sofia's embassy.
Absolutely not.
The escape of the king would be a humiliation for the Turks.
It could cause a diplomatic incident.
Bulut would bring us back to Istanbul to overthrow the scandal.

I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- Yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's Yo-Yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
- No.
I am good.
"I know your speciality, Gul."
"You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you?"
"Yes, Mr. Bajaj."
There is one thing common between us.
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.
I see the same hunger in you.
"You want to be very, very successful."
Nothing wrong with that.
The only difference is you work too hard.
I have a philosophy.
Party hard.
And work smart.
For instance this waiter.
How many hours does he work?
10?
12?
14?
"I mean, I don't know."
How much money does he earn?
Look at me.
I work for three to four hours.
And both of us know how much money I earn.
That's why I have an offer for you.
Join my company.
Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract.
"Salary, whatever you want."

He had left her?
Left her where?
A husband is no baggage to be carried around!

But he will return.
How's that?
He has a return ticket.
God!
I'll have the railways cancel his ticket!
I want Laxmi!
I've no interest in life without Laxmi anymore!

He's redderthan a beet.
That little closetfairy's got no choice.
"He hates McGovern and Kennedy so much, he's gotta love me."
- And Lyndon?
"- He looked old, didn't he?"
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
- I'm sorry!

Amy's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
"Oh, my God, Clark."
"Don't look, it's pornography!"
The worst kind...
Long-form narrative.
"""Clark's Playbook of Scenarios to Help Jack Break Up with Amy""?"
"Okay, I'll give in."
It's my playbook of scenarios to help Jack break up with Amy.
"It's a little overthinky, right?"
"It's weird, but kind of sweet."
I wish someone paid that much attention to me.
Maybe there's someone that does.
And he's a lot closer than you think.
Have you tried... online dating?
"Damn it, Clark."
"Amy, I wanted to talk to you because..."
"Oh, I just thought of another crazy payroll story."
Buckle up.
"It was a Friday, of course..."
"That controls the automatic functions, breathing, sleeping, wakefulness, intestinal functions."
She can open her eyes but as a mechanical action.
"Her brain is dead, she's got no ideas or feelings."
Come in.
"Hey, you!"
Come on in!
"Yes, you."
Hello.
- My name's Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga.
This is Alicia.
- Was it your first night here?
- Yes.
The first is the worst.
Then you get used to it.
What are those boots for?
They stop her feet from twisting sideways or falling forward.
- They look like Ibizan boots.
- Do they?
I've never been to Ibiza.
I know you.
From my writings?
No.
It was at the theatre.
We happened to be sitting together.
I didn't notice.
At one point you started to cry.
I told you about him.
"He cried watching ""Cafe Muller."""
I have to go.
So soon?
We haven't had a chance to talk.
There's still due process.
"Out here, due process is a bullet."
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
"After delivering a Montagnard baby, he was on his way back to camp and..."
His friends found him about 3 clicks out.
"Beheaded, mutilated."
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V.C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.
DOC:
Next.
Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.
Now just hold still.
That's it.
Don't move.

Now that's my good girl.
Candy.
That's for you.
Take it.
That's it.

Want me to take a look?

I have an offer...
Zero.
You say island white is the most addictive narcotic on the market.
Where's your proof?
It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me.
You want proof?
I want 100% customer retention.
Follow me.
"Guys, I found Bosley."
- What?
Where?
- Here...
"Here, and..."
"Oh, my God."
- That's Amanda Kane.
- What has Finch done to her?
Looks like he's turned her into a human Guinea pig.
- I'm going in there.
- I'm riding shotgun.
I'll be your eyes and ears.
Meet your first and only customer.
- Who is she?
- She's nobody.
- She have a name?
- None she remembers.
Your narcotic's impressive.
Just keep looking.
"Pussycat, nice."
"Station him, park him for a bit."
"Oh, there's another animal coming along, what's that animal?"
Kangaroo.
Kangaroo and a pussycat.
Yeah.
They're fighting.
Yeah.
Who's winning?
The pussycat.
Let the pussycat kill the kangaroo.
OK.
So who's won?
Pussycat.
That is your spirit animal.
"Aah, that's nice."
You could've been anything you wanted to be in the world and you chose a pussycat.
You're a curious goat.
"Yes, I know, but..."
What I need you to do now is call to your guide.
"Make the cries of the pussy cat to the heavens,"
Sleet and I will join you.
DERMOT MEOWS SLEET BLARES
"It's a very quiet pussy cat, Dermot."
"Sleet, Sleet, that's great, can we hold the goat for a second?"
"Keep going, Dermot."
Sounds like a very sad pussy cat.
Or an owl.
"Sounds more like an owl, doesn't it?"
More like a sort of...
"Imagine, just a bit angrier."

He's good.
So go ahead.
Tell me to go fuck myself.
Tell me what a fucking bitch I am
Because I don't know what a good man I'm losing.
That's not what I was gonna say.
I will tell you this...
I wish we had more time.
"Somebody needs to go there and stomp that nigga, son!"
Entiende?
"Yeah, he lives up on Webster Ave,"
Right by my cousin Tina.
"Just say the word, E. Man, okay,"
"And it's done, we got you, man, we got you."
"You don't have to worry about shit, entiende?"
"(Man) We gonna fuck him up, E."
I'll handle it.
"Oh, shit, this mother fucker's gonna do"
Some Lone Ranger type shit.
"Come on, man... talk to this motherfucker, man."
"Hey, you sure, E.?"
"Yo, I got it."
"What the fuck, man?"
"I don't know, B."

Hey!

I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him all worked up.
- He's the toughest guy we know.
"- Yes, he is, but he..."
"Hey, Mac!"
"Get a chair, smash it on my back."
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right attitude.
I'll tell you what.
"Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts."
- Let's take things to the next level.
- Yeah.
- But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
- Let's get drunk!
- Whoa!
"How you doing, Ed?"
Ooh.
Terrible.
I feel like that drill was driving right through the top of my head.
It might be a good idea at that.
Let out that beer you slopped up last night.
"- Quit riding me, will you?"
- I ain't even started on you yet.
- Come on.
Let's eat.
"- No, Frank, I couldn't."
"Come on, do you good."
You gotta eat.
- I got just the thing to straighten you out.
- What is it?
Some nice ice-cold oatmeal smothered with lard.
Go get some more.
Yeah?
Let's get some more.
Come on.
"Tomato juice, eh?"
Hmm.
"Well, next best thing in the world for a hangover."
Yeah?
"Well, what's the best?"
Heh.
Laying off of the booze entirely.
What time did he roll in last night?
"Oh, I wouldn't know that."
- I never check up on me boarders.
- Your daughter's checking on him.
Right.
Right.

Bringing Doug in tomorrow mornin'.
Great.
We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You thinkyou can let the job be whoyou are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think thatyou can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been--
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."
Don't deny it.
Fine.

"Babe, I didn't see the harm."
Dinner's almost ready.
You and the kids get started without us.
"Come on, come on."
"Come on, come on."
Uh...
"It was my fault, not theirs, you know."
I-I pushed them into playing.
"Yeah, you're good at that."
Why did you do it?
The card game.
The kid you found dying in the street.
- No.
- How about not lying to me for once in your life?
I was trying to get out from under.
These guys-- they had my money.
Whose money?
The money for the... for the shop?
The money you loaned me-- it wasn't enough.
Shadab!
Wait!
Don't beat!

"You are bloodied angry, today."
"You are no more that Faiz, who I had loved."
Yes.
Just a little shaken.
"Well, that's understandable."
"Don't worry, I got all the ones in the mall."
You're safe for now.
Ugh.
Blue looking for someone?
"Well, someone's found you."
[grunts]
Yah!
Ugh! Hello?
Is anyone here?
Are those things gone?
I thought they were going to get us.
You're safe.
I took care of them.
But now I need you to help take care of the school.
Look for any other kids that might be hiding.
We've all got to look out for each other now.
Stay strong.
You guys can do this. [grunting and groaning]
"Oh boy, oh boy."
It's good to see you.
I was so worried.
Are you all right?
Ugh.
We're fine.

Oh.
It's so good to see you guys.
"Likewise, buddy."
Mad Men is on.
There's Pete Campbell.
"Ooh, that Pete Campbell is a weasel."
Isn't he?

They went without me?
"Oh, which hurts, but I should save them, which will require swimming."
"Hmm, just had those saltines and cottage cheese 20 minutes ago."
"So, in ten more minutes, I should be G-2-G."
I met the nicest couple from Baltimore.
They said their neighbor's granddaughter would be perfect for me.
You think that's code for fat or black?
Probably both.
A wee little thing like you should be enjoying yourself.
Do you like to get high?
"Mm, naughty girl."
I only have this much.
"Uh, we can do blowbacks."
"Oh, it's been a while since I've had that... but I don't think so."
Do you have a light?
"Hm, sure!"
I knew I would be of some use.

"Robbie, chill out, man."
It's $200 if I gotta recover that table.
You gonna pay for it?

"Robbie, this isn't American Bandstand."
Get off the table.
"Come on, man, you're disrupting this whole establishment."
"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.
"Police officer, put the gun down."
Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."

Back off.
You never pull a gun out unless you're planning to shoot somebody.
You got it?

How are you?
Why haven't you called me up?
Why...

They got enough orders to paper this shop.
Oh.
Dombrowski said.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
- That's the fourth drill you've burnt up.
"- Well, what's it to you?"
Dombrowski's trying to sweat a record out of us.
"Listen, Frank, get down to work and quit knocking Joe."
Let her down.
We could've missed something.
All right?
"Look, here's the plan."
We're gonna...
"Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them."
Then we'll run.
There is no plan.
What are you gonna do with that?
I don't know.
I shouldn't have borrowed that money.
"No, Blair, this is not your fault."
Okay?
It's not.
All right.
Two kids come back from Christmas break.
"The first kid says to the second kid,"
I had the best Christmas ever.
"Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team."
What did you get?
"Second kid says, I only got a sweater."
"First kid says, why."
Second kid says...
"It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy."
I know you're scared.
"No, it's..."
Actually kind of funny.
I'm pregnant.

On purpose?
- Of course it was on purpose.
Shut up.
You know very well there are no wreckers anymore.
Who knows?
The tide may have washed up the bodies.
I asked you if you were there.
- What about you?
Were you there?
- Me?
No.
I was herel
"So, why have you got blood on your shirt?"
You're crazy.
There's nothing there.
God curse the wreckers!
The sun is rising over the shore!
A sad and gray day!
The tide is out!
I can see two small figures.
They are getting up!
- They start walking.
- That's enough!
- Shut up!
- They are still weak.
They support each other and stagger forward.
Be warned.
Let him go.
Husband...!
Who are you and what do you want?
"I'm a local salt cooker named Pan-dong, sir."
And?
I came to give you an important information.
Could I possibly get my tax reduced in return?
What?
Is this a joke?

"No, no!"
You'll have a big problem in your hands unless something is done!
A big problem?
"Sir, are you all right?"
Thanks.
Be careful.
Arrest this man!
What is the meaning of this!
Let go!
We know what you've been going around doing.
I have done nothing wrong!
We'll find out once we get to the government canter.
Take him away!
Let go!

I think it's time for us to go.
"Listen, would you wait for me outside?"
Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.
I found the guys that did this to you...
And I've taken care of it.
It was strange.

"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
-Take care.
"Plus, I get Dannon points."

I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.

- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."
You're not gonna tell me who it was?
I made that up!
Where'd you meet?
On the street?
While I'm risking my neck and showering you with money?
"Get away from me, you tramp!"
You tramp!
Damn you!
Get out of my sight!
I'm out risking my neck and slaving away like crazy!
Franz!
Let me go!
Let go!
This is my home!
Leave me alone!
This is my home!
Open this door!
Just wait until I ―
"Now, we are famed for our seafood."
You what?
See food?
What's 'see food'?
"Fruits de mer, sir - cockles, whelks, crabs, mussels..."
Them shiny pebbles?
"That's food, is it?"
"They are something of a delicacy, sir."
"Well, bung 'em in the bag."
And give me one of them pies with legs.
"No, no!"
Keep still!
"No, you're not even supposed to be in here."
Two points for straight in?
Wicked.
And one point if it goes in off the backboard.
Backboard?
Do you mean me?
What are we calling this game?
How about...
'Get the ball in the jug'?
Or 'Super juggy throw throw'?
Or...
Jugball?
"Yes, jugball!"
You're a genius!
We should play every day.
Make it company policy.
"Right, yeah!"
Brilliant.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
That would be brilliant.
But need no urging in the night

- Did you ask if Maurice works there?
"Not yet, but it's an Arab club, so Natanel, forget your disposable forks"
- and take off your skullcap.
- Are you crazy?
- Or wait in the hotel.
- It's my right to wear it.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.
"- Yes, you are."
"Fine, I'm shouting."
Happy?
I know this music.
Isn't this...?
What is this place?
"Judging by the food, it's still a Lebanese restaurant-."
Judging by the hairdos it's Yemenite.
Israelis?
- They're onto us.
- Should I take it off?
- You're paranoid.
- So why are you whispering?
Tel Aviv?
Are you from Tel Aviv?
- Jerusalem.
- Why didn't you say so?
Menashe!
All Israelis are our guests.
We'll treat you like kings.
I'll get you drinks and we'll have a toast.
What's going on here?
"- Hey, isn't this song..."
And that is you will never see me dance.
I'll put money on it.
"One day, you'll dance."
Who's that out there?
Jude Cassidy.
Don't think I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
Argument about the M25 got out of hand.
An argument with the M25?
You can't leave me here on my own.
"I don't know who to go to, Rose."
No sign of him leaving Mercer's flat.
I'll have to tell Lenny.
You'll sign Calum's death warrant.
Somebody's lying to me.
What's given can be taken away.
"Calum, let's discuss Jude's disappearance again, shall we?"
Pete?
Emergency services.
Which service do you require?
Which service do you require?
Hello?
"Hello, is anyone there?"
Hello?
- I didn't...
- What?
- Know anything.
- What didn't you know?
It wasn't...
You knew.
- Mwah!
Oh!
Mwah!
[Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies.
"- Okay, noon."
Noon.
"- Oh, ladies?"
Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."
$230 for a night's stay.
Or how about you can support me on this?
I think it's disgusting.
Whoa!
What?
The two of them together is just gross!
It should be illegal!
"All right, I'm done with this."
- Come with me.
"- Dad, help me on this!"
"I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot."
Let me show you something.
See that crazy old man right there?
- He comes here every day...
- Hey!
To protest the love in this house.
"Yeah, and he's right."
Certain people just don't belong together.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
I guess you could say that there were 12 million people with a motive.
"Myself, included."
This was the lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What is what?
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
"Hey, Gabby."
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Monk?
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He...
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.
Really?
Kids.
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think I'm some kind of hero."
It's written in my notebook right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
"Please, come on!"
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil."
"Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off."
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
- Here's that list you wanted.
"- Great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I should've put more lights back here.
"No, you can't blame yourself."
It was after midnight.
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
- That is it!
"- Come on, baby!"
Come on!
Come on!
Mike doing a good job.
Made dağıtıyorsun.
It is not easy anymore.

"Gangsters, such as handbook o."
"Thank you, honey."
Good night.
"- Mike, you ettiriyorum promoted."
"Tomorrow, Rook'a to LA'ye I want you to aid shipments."
- Why not?
- Too much fun.
My daughters house beats.
Always use stops.
I do not trust him.
"- Well, Rook is a party man."
- So.
He carries the goods under the counter.
I stand here and had to protect the interests of Arment'in.
The problem is that not only protects their interests.
Arment'e tried to say but I did not listen to me.
What can I do?
The man's son.
So we need to go to the shipment to go somewhere I want to sağlamanı.
And all of them.
Mike ...

I'll pick you up at noon.
Get your ass back to work.
I need a word with you.

Of course.
Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.
tell Todd I hope he's feeling better.
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
Like I told you:
"Hit me again, I said."
Do you remember?
Nobody knows what the girl has gone through.
But now we must speak about it.
"The truth - and nothing but the truth, so help me God."
Pauline Kraka.
"No, it's not for me."
I have only written here.
Poste restante.
Mr Harald Brennemann
I have no identity card.
- Maybe you have his forwarding address?
- Where has he moved to?
I don't know.
To the West.
"Brennemann, Brennemann..."
Brennemann...
Brennemann...
"No, but there are a bunch of letters there."
"Christ, no!"
- He never picked them up.
- He can still come by.
"- Please, I'd like to have them back."
"- No, it's not that simple, Miss."
- They are returned to sender.
"- But please, that's me."
"- Yes, by postal route, Miss."
"- But please, I no longer have an address."
They could get into the hands of strangers.
"Please, give me the letters."
- Please!
Baber's story checked out.
You guys are free to go.
"Huh, technically, I'm supposed to say that."
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You can tell them about the fertilizer.
"Well, it turns out Baber, being the frugal shopper that he is, bought the cheap stuff,"
So what you have couldn't even blow up a dollhouse. [ They laugh. ]
Uh-huh!
"Could not blow up a dollhouse, could I?"
- Challenge accepted!
- No!
No!
No!
That's not what he meant!
Thanks for letting us go.
And for not waterboarding us or making us stare at the moon.
- O...
K.
- OK!
"Let's go, you guys"
I'll buy you an ice-cream sundae for your troubles.
"Oh, no!"
"Sweetie, I'm fine!"
"Yes, absolutely, I'm fine."
They dropped the charges.
"Well, there really were no charges, so I'm a free man!"
What?
"Oh, that's great!"
That's great news!
Amaar!
You didn't even think about it.
what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just got to get a key.
No problems?
I'll take care of it.
Tell him what you were telling me.
Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.
Americans change their money over into French money and send it back here.
Calm down.
It's beautiful.
totally untraceable.
but I got a plan.
he's a piece of work.
all cash.
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it.
It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.
It's beautiful.
Nanteuil.
What's the matter?
We've been robbed.
- How?
- On the train.
The gold was bound for the Bank of Munich.
It wasn't monitored?
The conveyors didn't last long.
- They were thrown off the train.
- By whom?
A man.
Dressed in black.
A conveyor crashed on a pylon.
The others could make it but they're in poor shape.
A man.
All in black.
- Are you Mr Fandor?
"- Yes, why?"
"You must go at once to 46 Bonaparte St, 4th Floor."
This is Juve's address.
You must be mistaken.
No.
Not at all.
"Fandor, my boy!"
My boy!
Juve?
Is that you?
It's me in the flesh.
"When Lady Beltham's hotel blew up, you were found dead under the rubble."
"This is what I have made believe, in agreement with the Director of the force, Mr Havard."
"Immediately after the explosion, several of my men were found dead, some shredded."
One of them was unrecognizable.
- She's adorable in any outfit.
She is.
Damn her.
I looked like...
I literally look like a man who is...
Like a man who's...
A big man in this school uniform.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who invented that?
- You're nuts.
"- Ari, you look adorable."
"- Oh, thank you, honey."
And I look like crap.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
"- Here we are, two girls..."
- Exuberant.
...off into the night.
You just came out of that door looking like you're surprised that you came out of that door.
- How did you achieve that?
- What does that mean?
You came out of the door like you didn't expect to.
Maybe one of the one of the ADs just pushed me out.
"- Oh, right."
- I didn't realize that we were rolling.
"Is it true that there's only, like, a few Yugos in the world?"
Here's a story:
I hit my head here really hard.
- It hurt.
- Would you?
- Mm.
"And, well... kinky."
Filthy.
Just arseholes.
A pair of complete and utter kinked-up... filthy racist arseholes.
"We've just left a vulnerable young boy with a pair of not only instinctive killers, but heinous pervs."
You do realise I'm zipping my coat up and going back there?
"Yeah, and I'm coming with you."
Mitchell?
Yeah?
Mitchell?
Are you packing?
"Unpacking, still."
"Oh, boys."
Your phone rang.
"Oh, thank you."
It's a withheld number.
Which usually means something official.
"Like a job, say."
They've left a message.
- It won't be good news.
"- Oh, you don't know that."
- Put it on loudspeaker.
- Uh.
Go on.
"Please, please, please."
"Hello, John."
This is Nita Mawulawde.
- That's how you say it.
- Duh.
I'm calling in regard to your interview this morning.
"Brígida Bonazzi. divine, it enters, Brígida Bonazzi, enters, enters, between..."
"Ah, you, Brígida Bonazzi are very good."
It will not do damage to him?
"No, it will seat to him either, it will seat to him very or."
"Oh, what pretty you are..."
You have paid attention?
"Small nose, small nose, small nose..."
Nothing is heard.
In the end that son of puta fuck really.
What is going to fuck that.
-You are very bad?
poor truth?
"-Who, I?"
"Oh, there are lost the memory."
"Calm, now you will see."
"Yes, yes, I want to see."
"Well, slowly, first I clear this to me..."
You do not hear anything?
Listening...
"-Thus, slowly?"
eh?
-Yes.
"Yes, now you will see pretty legs."
Thus...
Thus...
Fuck!
Now you are going to see.
"It quiets, you do not move, I am in charge."
-Let go.
I do not touch myself.
-It quiets.
You do not resist.

"Ariel, I was flying-- I was--"
"Ofcourse I was flying, and I-I saw the-- the watch--"
The witch was watchin' the mirror... and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?
"I mean, when it's important?"
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun sets on the third day.
"Ariel, grab onto that."
"Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you."
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
- Wh-What about me?
What about me?
- You!
"Boy, what a night!"
I'm so glad that is over with.
"- Oh, well, nothing lasts forever."
- In sports...
Together forever.
- Together forever.
- What a nice surprise.
Together forever.
Hey!
"So, what's up?"
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever.
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty."
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Why don't we just sit down and discuss this!
Then they ate me.
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I gotta go.
They were my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they eat you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Busted.
"You made it up, didn't you?"
I...
"Hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night.
We got from now on to celebrate.
"- I'm not hungry, Mrs. Grogan."
- You've got to eat.
All you had for lunch was a can of tomatoes.
Go on and eat.
"- Oh, don't worry."
I'll be over this tomorrow.
- You will if you stay home tonight.
- Yeah.
"- Never mind, I'll get it."
Hello?
Oh.
"Just a moment, please."
"Ed, it's for you."
Mrs. Danvers.
"- Thanks, Betty."
"- You're welcome, I'm sure."
Hello?
"Hello, Eddie."
"Oh, I'm fine."
I just wanted to find out how you were.
Huh?
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, it must have been the gin chasers."
It couldn't have been the beer.
"Oh, I just called up to tell you I'm not mad about what you said last night."
No.
"Well, you know, about our not having any more dates."
"No, I've forgiven you already."
Uh-huh.
I couldn't stay mad at a swell guy like you.
"Well, that's fine."
Why won't these people let me do my job?
I know!
What's that stuff you're always playingwith?
"""Silly Putty""!"
It calms me down.
"'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""?"
I love them.
- They're the best band!
"- You know ""Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""!"
"Totally! ""The Americans"" is my favorite song!"
"That's impossible, no one in the States knows them."
I saw them when they went to London last March...
- in Cambridge.
- That's insane!
I was there!
Get out of here!
You were there?
That's crazy!
I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?
"- Well, I designed that, actually."
- Do you know them?
Bob Green and I went to Eton together.
"Paul, I've been looking everywhere for you."
"Everywhere except my office, I guess."
I heard you were in the shitter.
Roxanne needs you to discuss the concept for the cover shoot...
"Pardon me, Jocelyn."
"Hey, cut it out."
You can't go through his drawers.
- Does he not smoke?
What is this?
"Because I should feel terrible, and I don't."
"And you're right, it does feel good to say that."
Dam... broken!
Go-to guy!
"Hey, girls!"
I did it.
I broke this dude's dam.
"Hey, I'm going to bed."
"Okay, I love you."
You can sleep outside if it makes you feel more comfortable.
"Oh, and make sure to close the window so the alarm sets."
I got it.
See?
Go team!
"Uh, or you can just keep it open, in case there's a fire, so you can just throw me out of it."
I love you.
Ugh.
"Oh, balls."
"Oh, my God, a squirrel!"
Aah!
"Okay, calm down."
I...
I can't.
You know I hate rats.
"Okay, it's just a squirrel."
"No, no, squirrels are just sexy rats."
Everybody knows that.
"I think it touched my leg, ugh."
Where is it?
"I don't know, I don't know, all I feel is a squirrel touch, ugh."
"Okay, it's fine, all right?"
"It is much more scared of us than we are of it, all right?"
- Lucy...
- Yes?
"Lucy, I..."
"I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I..."
I...
I think you should know that...
"Mama, I do know."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"Goodbye, Daddy."
Bye.
"Billy, you missed your tea."
"And you, Faber."
Have something at the pub.
- Thanks.
I'll just have a wash.
- See you there.
"- Freddy, can I come?"
- I don't know about that.
- You in the army yet?
- Tell him about that miracle cream.
"Oh, yeah."
Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off...
"Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you."
- We mustn't let that go to waste.
"- Not with this rationing, we mustn't."
I'll be down in a minute.
"24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it?"
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
- There we are.
I believe that my prayers will be heard there!
How can the medicine work when you are hungry?
Are you hungry?
You are starving for last two days.
And you claim that you are not hungry?
I wiIIjust come back.
"O God, I have looked for him everywhere!"
But I couldnt find him.
I dont know how he is doing now.
"God, you have bestowed me with everything."
But without him its useless!
"God, I want to find him!"
"Yes, I do!"

How is little miss?
He is Krishna!
My mother says she's well.
Has she eaten or not?
"Yesterday evening, she took her a meal."
She didn't touch it.
My young uncle fed her.
He's fallen out with my mother.
They don't speak.
Why?
He wanted to feed her?
No.
They fell out a long time ago.
"Why is he your ""young uncle""?"
- How many do you have?
- Three.
- Are the others older?
- Yes.
Bravo.
Where are they?
"One is in Ahwaz, the other in Kermanshah and I don't know where the third one is."
Don't they visit their mother?
"Yesterday evening, my uncle told my mother that his holidays were over."
But they've fallen out.
How did he tell her?
My uncle speaks to her but my mother doesn't reply.
- The others aren't coming?
- No.
"Yesterday, my uncle told my mother that he has to go back."
He's leaving then?
Yes.
What about us?
I don't know.
I have exams that I have to take.
Lamaze.
Is that where they do the breathing that ease the pain?
"Yeah, it actually works."
"You know, you breathe fast and then slow, you know, like..."
"I don't know, like-- like a dog or something."
I wouldn't touch that line with a road crew tour bus.
Do you remember everything you've ever touched?
I'm just saying.
"Gentlemen, seriously, this has been a pleasure."
"Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?"
Take care of yourself.
"All right, Morgan--"
All right.
Later.
"All right, everybody in."
Come on.
"Come on, let's go."
Ante up.

"Hey, beautiful."
How was the poker game?
Mmm.
Ah.
Broke even.
Oh.
But...
This little one chillin' inside your beautiful belly didn't do so badly.
Whatever that means.
"Master Y an, Master Zhou has been slain"
The body is lying outside
"Dad, don't know who did it this time?"
"Brother Y an, you see!"
You see!
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Who did that?
"Brother Y an, what should we do?"
"That's right, Brother Y an, what should we do?"
What should we do?
Let's go!
"Go, go!"
"Wait, it'll be dangerous for us to stay here!"
What do you mean?
"If we stay here, we'll be killed all the same!"
I guess we should leave tomorrow!
T omorrow?
Now!
The bad guys of the boxing world
"I'm sorry, did I scare you all?"
How come everyone is here?
You want to flee?
Leaving Y an Qingwang here all by himself?
He'll be lonely!
So it's you!
It's too late now to know!
No wonder you look like a pig!
"Y an Qingwang, why are you so late?"
You should've come sooner to see my act
"You bastard, since you're here!"
My brothers died suddenly
Okay.
Action.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
To which she replies...
Ooh.
I'm Rose.
This is Nancy.
The Nancy.
To which you say...
Rose...
"Do you know, if one were 20 years younger and differently inclined, one might almost be tempted."
Cat-
- Catrin...
Catrin!
"Cat, don't make me run."
"They're always gonna be like that, aren't they?"
"Younger, in awe of you, like I was."
"Oh, come on, Cat, you had a choice."
You didn't choose me.
I'll come back in a few days and move my things.
"Oh, for God's sake, the flat's yours."

It's a success.
I'm glad.
Hmm.
"You know, the first time I painted you outside the steelworks... maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away."
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
We need a new set of jerseys for the under-fifteen lads.
They've all grown bigger since the start of the season.
"Here, we'll take a few for Sharon's snapper, will we?"
That's a very good idea.
No!
"Here you go, Georgie."
Here.
There.
"Thanks very much, lads."
That's great.
"Oh, give a little."
Helps a lot.
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.
Listen...
Do you think she'll get married?
What's that?
"Oh, no."
No.
"Jesus, no."
"They've more cop-on these days, eh?"
"I mean, would you get married... if you were that age again... these days?"
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.
"Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon getting married that young."
She's her whole life ahead of her.
Exactly.
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.
Having a baby's the most natural thing in the world.
- That's right!
"- Oh, good shite!"
"Olé, olé, olé, olé"
-...on your memorable family experience.
WYATT:
"Just a reminder, though, this is going to be worth half your final grade."
Leave him alone.
WYATT:
Don't screw it up.
"-Shh, I'm going for a record."
WYATT:
"Um, what you write about...."
I said leave him alone.
WYATT:
--than how you write about it.
I wanna know how--
"You wanna take his place, midget?"
WYATT:
"I'm looking for the brutal, funny..."
-Yeah.
Sure.
-...maybe even the painful truth.
WYATT:
"Okay, everybody, if you have any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
Good luck.

[BOY MOANS AND GASPS]
Sorry.
I meant the other Mario.
I've abandoned him to his fate.
- He behaved very badly.
Did you send him the bill?
- I don't think now's the time.
"Do you think, they'll condemn him, Sir?"
- It depends on who defends him.
If it gets into the hands of any old pettifogger..
- He's toast!
"Poor Mario, he was so nice!"
- Isolina!
"Noble Ophelia, get thee to a nunnery!"
"No thank you, Sir."
I don't smoke!
"- Oh, sorry."
"- Excuse me, sister."
These clients are serious.
- Yeah?
- They have a ton of money.
They have the fuel.
- Praise God..
May he always be praised.
- Always!
"Bye, Dad."
- We must go now.
"Yes, sister."
"Be strong, Isolina."
"Blessed sister, you don't know what it's like to have two husbands."
"Be brave, daughter."
You'll see that you too will find peace here.
I have great need of it.

Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
What's it take to get a menu here?
"Okay, I'll handle it."
That's all right.
I'll handle it.
And ruin your popularity?
"You know what, why don't you guys just sneak out the back?"
What's going on with you two?
Hey!
How's it going?
Hey!
Front door.
Hi.
"Hey, guys."
How you guys doing?
"You like the food here, too?"
It's pretty awesome.
"Shut up, queer."
"Well, at least I don't shave my chest."
What'd you say?
"Luke, come on."
I just said you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.
"Do you want me to break you, Cohen?"
Hey!
No way.
Look who's back.
"You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile."
"Luke, don't!"
"What are you, like spokesperson for geeks of America or something?"
You know what I like about rich kids?
Nothing.
That was awesome!
Okay sir.
Want to hear their death cries?
Listen.
- No one should escape.
"- Gocha, my father  my people."
Tell police not to shoot them.
Hello... hello...
There are little children.
Hello... hello...
Do you think I will cry  beg you?
Those who are in the bus are your men not mine.
You said Konda Reddy called us.
But you are taking us elsewhere.
"If you're a smart ass,"
I am a much smarter ass.
I know you will do such a thing.
You said you framed them.
I changed everything.
There is an important guest in the bus.
Do you know who it is?
Where are you trying to escape?
Why are you leaving us?
Police?
Go  catch them.
- Listen.
- Go fast!
Those who kidnapped the marriage party are running away.
- Who are you?
- I am Konda Reddy's brother.
I know Konda Reddy's brother.
I am Gocha's son-in-law.
Does this dirty face need Gocha's sister?
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
"Thank you, Doctor."
And now you'd best have a look at this rump.
- You've humiliated me.
- Good.
You'll be too embarrassed to speak of it.
No-one must know what's happened.
"- Gentlemen, do I have your word?"
- Yes.
"And you, monsieur?"
"After all the time we spent together, how could you?"
In cold blood?
It was easy.
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him.
- He needs peace.
- I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
- No.
No.
"On the contrary, you wounded him."
"In his shooting arm, too."
He never even had time to fire.
H i.
Very funny.
So I guess you've heard.
Sharon's dad is okay.
That's great.
"No, I hadn't heard."
I'm obviously the last person in Pittsburgh to hear.
- So you're friends with Sharon now?
"- Well, so, you are, right?"
Look.
"We all know what's going on around here, okay?"
- Which is that you are jealous.
- What?
And you.
You are totally flipped because...
Rayanne finally did something nice for once in her life.
Which she did by taking Sharon to go visit her dad.
And now both of you just want to be sure that you both still are friends.
Which you are.
So shut up!
Let's kill him.
"Say a prayer, Vasquez."
I'm going to kill him.
"- l've been knocking, but..."
- What?
Your mom let me in.
I came to drop off your bag.
- What are you listening to?
- A group you probably hate.
"Okay, I'll go."
I'm glad your dad is going to be okay.
My father almost died.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know.
"By erasing Simeon, you made space for me."
I fill him now.
"More than snow, more than Simeon - even this old body is strong in my control."
Argh!
Do you feel it?
Winter is coming!
Argh!
Winter is coming!
"No, you must fight!"
"Hang on and fight, boy, you can do it!"
Captain Latimer...
your children... they are afraid.
Hold them.
It's not really my area.
It is now.
What's happening?
Doctor!
The globe.
It's turning to rain.
"All of it, the snow, look."
He's dead.
What happened?
"The snow mirrors, that's all it does."
It's mirroring something else now.
"Something so strong, it's drowning everything else."
There was a critical mass of snow at the house.
If something happened there...
Salty.
Salt water rain.
It's not raining.
It's crying.
"The only force on Earth that could drown the snow, a whole family crying on Christmas Eve."
Faiz is in danger.
They will kill him.
Why are you'll looking at my face?
Go and call for the priest!
Go!
"Where are you, priest?"
How long will you take?
This marriage should happen today.
Talk to the priest later.
"Tell me where my brother is, first."
Did you mortgage him to me?
Listen you prince!
"If something happens to my brother, I shall destroy your world."
Threaten someone else!
Kayyub!
Come on!
Come on!
"Come on, inside!"
Brother we have put the girl in the vehicle.
"Your ""Would be"" bride shall be with us."
"Give me my brother and take away your ""Would be"" bride."
- Come on!
- Away!
Away!
"If something happens to my brother, everyone shall be killed."
"Brother, the girl!"
Sit in the car!
You'll attack us?
Get up!
Get up!
Don't beat!
Shadab!
I have decided this!
Let Yawang do it.
"And go to the location immediately,"
- to know more about the environment!
- Yes.
"Mr. Qu, Shanhua Desig n Garden Company is here for the design plan."
"Thank you, Mr. Qu!"
"You are new staff in Shanhua Gardening, right?"
"Yes, I am ."
Your attitude is not bad!
Excuse me!
"I have to deliver the plan, and leave now!"
Good bye!
Thank you!
- See you tomorrow!
- Yawang!
No way!
You shouldn't ask me to work like a slave!
Don't play around!
Do you want this job?
Or you can leave!
Not like that!
I just pout to get your sympathy.
My body can not afford to work any longer.
I want to cry!
Oh mine!
"Each one of you, having done so little work, are leaving so punctually!"
Who is her?
"She is our Department Manager, eho resguested male trainees included you to work in this site."
Hi.
My name is Zhang Jingyu.
I am Yawang's friend.
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
I don't want to let them down.
"No, of course not."
"Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not so very far off.
"No, it's not so very far off."
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
I've ordered cutlets Milanese... and semolina... pudding.
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?
Yes.
"I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister."
Ah.
His office.
"Last night, he was working late."
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I am unable.
Mr. Hilliard?
Mr. Hilliard?
"I'm afraid, my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did so myself.
"You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers missing from his left hand."
"I'm sorry, we try very hard to... to make a whole person."
For the relatives.
Oh!
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent.
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
"Oh, God."
"Oh Albert, I love you."
Do it this way.
Oh yeah...
Oh Albert!
(wistful cello music)
That'll be nice.
You can pick me up at the airport Charles de Gaulle...
Anna!
I met this guy...
"I look forward to work with you, too."
"No, I talked with them yesterday."
Thank you.
"OK, goodbye."
Au revoir.
- I met this handsome guy at the gym.
- So Albert is history now?
No.
"But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away."
"That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all."
"Thank you, God!"
This guy will make your mouth water!
Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away.
He can pick up the keys on Saturday.
I love you!
If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering -
- I'd never have said yes.
- I know a trick.
- What's keeping him?
- What if he can't find it?
- Relax.
He's smart and he's gorgeous.
What?
It's no good.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And don't get artistic.
Just peel the bloomin' thing.
Harris tweed.
Your father had a suit not dissimilar to this one.
I remember.
It lasted him for years.
"It's a lovely colour, Janet."
Hmm.
That's as may be.
That's it.
"You don't think it a little heavy for the summer, Mr. Penhaligan?"
"No, the advantage of tweed, Miss Widdington, is that it allows the wearer to breathe, as it were, because of the openness of the weave."
- I see.
- I like it.
It's also very hard wearing.
And the price?
Um... just over three guineas.
"Oh, good Lord."
[Whispering]
"Oh, yes."
And that includes an extra pair of trousers.
And without?
"Zip or button fly, sir?"
"Zip, please."
[Penhaligan]:
2 pounds and 15 shillings.
Fine.
Shirts?
Certainly.
What are you...?
Nothing.
Oh
"You know, it's okay if you don't wanna be my girlfriend."
You don't have to make stuff up...
- Can't we just keep things the way they are...?
- Yeah.. sure...
Well...
Do you... have to... do anything special?
when you go steady...?
No.
-So everything's the same?
- Yeah...
Okay.
- We can go steady.
- Really?
Yes.

I'm gonna... hit you with it...
If you try anything...
Really?
"Well, listen."
"Since I already lost my deposit and all, maybe we should light up."
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you want to do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
"I just have to go, is all."
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And you know, pot is, like, stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
"So, you want to go grab some some dinner?"
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We cool?
"Your satellite's on, by the way."

I just think it's asking a lot.

He's done nothing but apologize.
Is this going to be every weekend now?

"- mama, can we open our presents now?"
Hey.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
"Look, I wanted to say thanks for the other night."
You always drink like that?
I thought you left.
I did.
I am.
"Ryan, we're all set."
You ready?
"Hi there, Marissa."
What are you doing?
Nothing.
We're just hanging out.
"Oh, look, it's somebody's birthday."
I guess my invitation probably got lost in the mail.
It's my friend Summer's birthday.
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.
That's what I heard.
I don't know.
That was a guess.
You guys are up to something.
"Dude, what did you tell her?"
I didn't tell her anything.
I think the black turtleneck in August tipped her off.
"Okay, I was going for stealth, and also it's slimming."
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.
You should probably be off.
Newport social scene awaits.
"Oh, yeah?"
Why won't you tell me where we're going?
This is pretty far away.
The Wu-tang Sword is really fierce.
Please stop or someone will get killed!
How come?
We're good friends.
"Mr. Wong, this way please!"
Let's go!
Shaolin and Wu-tang are really so fierce.
"Yes, Your Highness!"
I saw them fight myself.
Chin Kang Fist of Shaolin!
8-divine Sword of Wu-tang!
If only...
"Your Highness, that's easy!"
We have gyms of both martial arts schools here.
We'll bring them here!
Wait.
- Sung Chi!
- Yes!
Invite the master of the Shaolin martial arts school here.
I have an idea!
Cheers!
I've always admired Shaolin kung-fu very much.
"Especially your kung-fu, Mr. Liu!"
"Not at all, Your Highness!"
"I just know a little, you don't have to praise me."
I haven't exaggerated it.
Your fist is really marvelous.
"Of course, if my master's kung-fu wasn't good,"
I wouldn't be his student.
Shut up!
"Please excuse her, she's spoiled!"
She's right.
-All right.
That's for the dead cop.

"He didn't lie to us, he lied to his father."
Huh.
"Your parents are still married, aren't they?"

Did Dad have me followed anyway?
"I don't know, Marce."
Probably.
Are you with Ben?
No.
I slept in my car.
What are you talking about?
I'm scared.
"Look, whatever's going on, just come home."
I can't.
Not yet.
The FBI wants to talk to you.
They know you and Sara were fighting.
How do they know that?

What are you doing here?
Getting you out.

Here is a... cashier's check for 4 million dollars.
It's what you need to get that property from Taylor.
- And you want in on the deal?
- No.
I only want Chase.
"Alex, you do know that relationships between Pure Bloods and non Pure Bloods is frowned upon."
To speak nothing of a... financial arrangement between Erebus ans the House of Chthon...

"No one knows I'm here, this is strictly between you and me."
"So... take the money, buy whatever you want, but let Chase go."
You're buying me.
I'm rescuing you.
There's a difference.
"Yes, there is."
You're right.
"Since Berlin, I'm just not the same."
"Fine, go."
Let me say goodbye properly.
"Pour us a drink, Chase."

No.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man before?
"- No, sorry."
- Sure?
"Yeah, I'm sure."
I didn't know you were back.
We've brought in Renee Bentley.
I came back to join the manhunt... but I've just been sat in here for half an hour.

It matches the bracelet Julie-Ann was wearing when she died.

"Like you said, I need to keep busy."
It's his wife and kids.
SlPOWlCZ:
"Ernie, listen to me."
- What?
- Was there anything good?
- What do you mean?
"If you stop now and nobody gets hurt, you won't have to go away."
"But before any of this, was there anything good in your life?"
"Yeah, I had my chair set up how I wanted."
Chicky and me had some things worked out.
"All right, you got your chair back, and I'm going to put Chicky in jail but I never noticed any shortage of whores in town."
"Now, come on, Ernie."
"What do you say, huh?"
"Come on, Ernie."
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Just relax now.
Come on.
That's it.
And he has to absolutely speak to me?
"Okay, I'll be right down."
KELLY:
You okay?
"- Yeah, thanks."
How you doing?
No fun busting this guy.
I think he's gonna get ROR'd.
- The booking's clear.
- Thanks.
DONNA:
"Detective, here's your file."
- I gotta take you to get fingerprinted.
- Thanks for the coffee.
Well ...

It is in vain ...
That's nice of you.
Addons For question 2.
"In addition, compared with a tattoo on the back"
"Addons have pircing on the scrotum, created three years ago."
How nice ...

"I'm not sure about that, Dave."
Addons For question 3.
Amy girl in the photo.
"Addons A student from France, study in the UK."
"Addons you know that last week, You slept with him."
Addons And you have to live with until the next morning.

"You think you can escape from us, the Magic Knights of Estabul?"
What's happening?
An enemy raid from Estabul!
Red-armored knights are flooding in!
They're attacking us...
Red armor?
The Estabul Magic Knights?
"All hands, retreat!"
"Run into the woods, fall back and regroup!"
Sion!
Are you safe?
"No, not Tahile..."
He had left to fetch water.
He said we'd be safe as long as we stuck with Sion!
- What happened to Kiefer?
- I don't know.
Let's split up here.
"Tony, Fahle, you two go ahead."
We'll stall them here.
Sion!
Don't worry.
Go!
"There may still be survivors, including Kiefer."
You're going to save them?
It's impossible!
It does seem that way.
- See them?
- No.
What's wrong?
"Hurry and run, Roland brats!"
Turn the cannons on them!
Turn the cannons!
"Break them, Lo!"
What's happening?
I can't see what's happening to my boys!
What's happening to my boys?
"Major, give me your glasses."
There's a rebel.
Take him prisoner.
"Will you help me up, please?"
"Sir, could you tell me what your name is?"
Who you are?
I would like to see General Hancock.
Do you know where General Hancock may be found?
"I'm sorry, sir."
The general is down.
- He's been hit.
- No!
Not both of us.
Not all of us.
"Please, God."
"Sir, we're having a surgeon come as quickly as we can."
"Can you hear me, son?"
"Yes, sir."
I can hear you.
Will you tell General Hancock that General Armistead sends his regrets?
Will you tell him how very sorry I am?
"I will tell him, sir."
I will tell him.
"General Webb, sir."
"Let go of the horse, Major."
"Major Sorrel, I said let go of the horse."
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
BRYAN:
Why?
- To dance.
You know...
[ALL SNICKERING]
"Now, why would I wanna do that?"
- To free the penguin nation.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
BRYAN:
Uh-huh.
MUMBLE:
By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey!
Bryan!
"Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time."
"Maybe after winter or something, okay?"
"No, that's too late."
Way too late.
Bryan!
You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
"But right now, I got problems of me own."
"Everyone's cranky, looking for biff."
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
"If you don't come now, multitudes will die."
Here we go.
You saying it's my fault now?
And to determine the degree of infiltration.
-Infiltration by whom?
-Alpha Draconians.
-Draconians?
Jaelen!
"Jaelen, what's happened?"
Jaelen...
"-They took it, Robert."
They took our baby.
-Alright we gotta... we gotta go.
- I'll take you to my house.
- That'd be perfect.
-It's safer.
- Our army is coming here to establish complete dominion.
It has always been our intent to shield you from this threat.
But we are entrenched in war and we haven't the means to bring the fleet here to protect you.
It is to be your darkest age.
"- Man, look at that."
Look at that.
Look at that.
That's amazing.
-Open that one.
-Wow.
-Open that one.
That's amazing.
Wow.
- We're gonna set the world on fire with this.
-And I think soon.
"- There, I got it."
"- Dude, we got a helicopter."
Right behind there.

How was your little sit-down with Weaver this morning?
She was telling me and Dr. Clemente how charming we are.
"-Oh, really?"
-You don't think I'm charming?
I think you're extremely charming.
I just also think you're--

"Alex, what are you doing here?"
So nice to see you!
"I was dropping off some contact sheets and I figured I'd stop by... and say ""hi""."
How are you doing?
Holding up?
Barely.
I just about to transfer... the Western shoot all day.
Yee-haw!
- Do you wanna get some coffee?

"Jocelyn, I'm sorry you had to work late."
Hang in there!
Paul.
"John, Simmon, How sweetie!"
Hello there!

- Brutal!
- Brutal...
I can't even think about it before breakfast.
"- Jocelyn, you missed it!"
- What?
Raw brilliance!
Helmets...
- helmets.
- Helmut Lang?
Safety is chic.
Living is chic.
Helmut Lang.
"Helmets... for motorcycles, mopeds, vespas and scooters, even."
- Hold on.
- What?
I hope this is the fever talking.
This lack of compassion and tolerance is very disappointing.
- That is not the little girl I raised.
- You guys are disgusting.
What was that?
"I told you, we should've had more Jewish friends."
[Whispers] You never told me that.
"Yeah, you suck!"
We're friends of the Jewish people!
- We don't have any.
- We've got a couple.
"No, not one."
Nick is half Jewish.
Who's Nick?

"I need to... oh, shit, this guy is rich."
"Hey, uh, uh, I need to know if you sent that product, okay?"
"It's very important you call me, so pull your head out of that big mound of coke and..."

I think this is you.
Hello?

Why can't they see that?
Those fools!
It's me.

I'll be right there.
"Chief, the medical team reports that Miya Shikitani has regained consciousness."
She's conscious...?
Dan...
Gai...
Oh...
Is it that time already?
Shall we go?
You haven't changed at all.
"I was just about your age, too."
How strange...
"For the past 17 years, you and I have lived together as one..."
From that day I first met you...
All this time...
Who... are you?
Protect it...
What is this?
Dangaioh.
Dangaioh...?
- You're almost there.
"Yeah, you got that."
Areyousure it's okay that we came here ?
"Well, it is now, but ifwe're going to keep on doing this, we're gonna have to fiind someplace else to practice."
Did you always want to be a doctor ?
Who said I wanna be a doctor ?
Chenille.
Everybody.
Right now!
Geez.
It's 11:29 at the tone.

That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.
"And I know I could do better on the road, because this last stretch of beach is all soft sand."
"What do you think this is, a gymnasium?"
"Hey, man, you stay in pretty good shape, huh?"
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.
Eight.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?"
Now and then.
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?
"T.C.,"
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
Honest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"First you swim five miles, then you marathon 26 miles, then ride a bike a hundred miles all in the same day."
"Yeah, this is Rick."
I bet you could do it.
No bet.
Okay.
"Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate."
There's a woman here to see you.
This has gotta stop.
"I mean, as Higgins would say, this is a private club, not an office."
Not an office.
My aunt was a Grimm all these years.
I didn't even know it.
Look.
I can show you film right here that will blow your mind.
[Door closes]
Juliette!
I know how this sounds.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
This is why my aunt told me I shouldn't be with you.
"You need to talk to somebody, Nick, but it's not me."
"Juliette, I'm trying to explain."
Okay.
"Okay, remember that hair you found on the horse when it was attacked?"
You couldn't figure out what it was.
That is what I'm talking about.
You need professional help!
"No, Juliette."
"Look, yes, I understand why you're saying that."
There's one more thing I can do to prove to you--
"- Nick, please."
"Stop, okay!"
- You're really scaring me!
- I don't want to scare you.
I just want you to know the truth.
Come with me.
Just give me this one last chance.
"Hey, Nick."
Juliette.
What a pleasant surprise.
I think.
Come on in.
All right.
Tore it apart.
"All right, I'm on my way home."
"If he hit your place, he's probably going to hit mine."
Is Juliette home?
- No.
"- Well, don't let her go home."
- She's in the hospital.
- What?
What happened?
- Is she okay?
- I don't know yet.
But I can meet you at your place.
"No, you stay."
You take care of yours.
All right.
Then call for backup.
"Come on, work with me here."
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man but I am perfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.
Get out!
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
No.
Thought not.
Now...
Ooh!
I see this is one of your business cards - it says so on the front!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This.
"Wakey, wakey!"
"That is highly valuable equipment, you must step away now."
We are the Intelligence.
Oh!
Why aren't you in uniform?
It doesn't fit me anymore!
He must be a right fucking bastard!
I know what I'd have told him.
He blushed.
You should've seen him.
"Just 'cause I said ""toilet."""
"Is he good-looking, Sharon?"
"Ah, you're joking me."
You know Roland the rat?
"Well, he looks like him, only not as nice."
"He asked me why I wasn't wearing me uniform... so I stuck out me belly... and I said, ""It doesn't fit me anymore!"""
"You were dead right, Sharon."
You should've stuck one of your tits... in his mouth as well.
You should see the state of me nipples.
Jesus.
"Frank Kinsella's a ride, isn't he?"
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.
It wasn't anybody.
"Now get off me bleedin' back, will ya?"
I'm sick of it!
- She didn't...
"- You keep out of it, right!"
"He is a ride, though, isn't he?"
Frank Kinsella.
Bitch.
"What's that that's on, Sharon?"
All rise.
"For his excellence, inquisitor general don Tomás de Torquemada."
I must send you on a mission I wish I never would've had to send you on.
(WHISPERS) Look.
It can't be.
Do you care for my daughter Amelia?
Of course I care for her.
"I'm here, dining with you."
(ISABELLA I OF CASTILLE) What is this?
Abraham Levi is under my protection.
"I believe that there is only one possibility left, and you know what I'm referring to."
Run!
Guards!
Obey.
No man will be left behind.
(SALVADOR) What do you think?
that I don't wish he were here instead of burning at the stake.
(WHISPERS) Destroy the diary this very night.
Quick!
She's here!
"Quick, hurry up!"
"- Hello, everyone."
- Hello.
Am I late?
No.
"I'm even early, it seems."
So...
Is everyone here?
"Oh, no..."
I see that...
Our own Philippe.
You're late!
The last 15 minutes..
"I've been a fucking roller coaster of emotions, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I lit some of this.
"I fired on my nerves damn you, you know?"
And there you are.
It's okay.
You've just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, bring me some of this strong Russian shit, girls."
"Okay, now where is that ... pump?"
Where's that?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...?
Yeah?
"Fuck you, no!"
This is it.
"This is it, yeah."
Okay.
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, we gotta get this little fucker in there."
Whom I kidding with?
I'm not in condition to do this.
"I'm sorry, I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
What's wrong with his hand?
Who is he?
Is he a robot?
[Phone rings]
Hello?
Who is this?
"Oh, Detective Burris."
"No, it's all right."
I needed to get out.
What would you want with the dog?
"All right, then, but she's not here."
Hester took her to the vet.
You'll have to pick her up over there.
"No, just bring her here after."
And Mr. Burris?
Take good care of her.
[Dogs barking]
"Detective Burris, this dog's a pussy, let me tell you that."
There's no way that I'd ever make her a violent.
"When a dog acts like that, she's never going"
To have a killer instinct.
"Well, thanks a lot."
You just shot my best theory right in the ass.
"Come on, Greta."
"Let's go, girl."
Come on.
There we go.
[Dogs barking]
Oh.
Going a little fast.
"OK, Greta."
"I'll go buy you a hamburger, all right?"
"[Dog barks, kids playing]"
Think you let me win today.
I never let anyone win.
I didn't do nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Stacey, put up that gun and listen."
You're sunk.
"I know it, big boy."
I just want you to listen to what this rat's gotta say.
Remember what happened to Limpy?
"In about two minutes, you're gonna get worse."
"Honest, Stacey."
I ain't done a thing.
"In two minutes, you're gonna get this .38 between the eyes."
"Don't shoot me, Stacey!"
I didn't never snitch on you.
I ain't talking about you snitching on me.
I'm talking about something I learned from Shake Edwards.
"No, I don't know nothing."
I'm talkin' about you framin' Ross into this joint.
Honest.
We never framed him.
[SCREAMS]
Start talking.
I can't.
I don't know.
"Wait, wait."
I'll talk.
Okay.
This is a confession without coaching.
"And it's gonna spring Ross, so remember it."
"Okay, canary."
Start singing.
Who framed Ross?
I did.
(HORSE WHINNYING)
PORTHOS:

"Well, that answers that."

I'm not sure but I think we can assume it's more than two.
PORTHOS:
Yeah.
- My ammunition's out there.
"- Yeah, mine too."
- How much have you got?
- Not enough.
(GRUNTS)
"When you were, uh, searching before, you didn't happen to..."
No.
"No other entrances or exits, and there's no way we're getting through these windows."
"Of course not, because that would be to our advantage."
Okay.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
I'm not dating...
I know.
I get it.
"What about you, smart guy?"
Did you really think this one through?
"Well, I have a right to display my art."
"Oh, give it up."
I'm gonna have to side with chloe on this one.
I wanted it in my show. it's my best picture.
There's a red dot on it.
Who bought it?
"oh, god. that feels weird."
Nobody bought it.
"I didn't want anyone to have it,"
"So i-i put a ""sold"" sticker on it."
Yeah.
Maybe.
Out of my way!
you!
"Oh, pooh. you're late. sorry you missed all the fun."
Oh!
not really.
I brought my own fun.
"Hello, andrea. come in early tomorrow."
Do you mind?
I want to show you your new office.
i think you're gonna like it.
"If you need to make a copy, it's super convenient."
"Okay, so you don't like practical jokes."
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
[ENGLISH ACCENT] ...hello?
"- Oh, good, Portugal's here."
"- We saved that wall for you, Christine."
"Oh, great."
"Oh, I get the whole wall."
Okay.

"Yeah, you know, Christine, you don't have to stay."
I'm sure you have a shift to run off to or something.
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't work shifts, Marly."
"I assign shifts to people, because I'm the boss."
I have a corporate credit card.
I've got 35 points accumulated.
"Two thousand more, I get a flashlight radio."
[LAUGHING]

So you wanna open up the bottle of port?
Heh.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh.
"- You don't have any vodka, do you?"
"- Yeah, where's Russia?"
[LAUGHING]
You know what would help?
If you could set out the plates for the international feast.
"Oh, sure."
"So, I have this new guy cooking for us."
Others?
I do not know.
Are all there ...
It is sad.
Addons last question ...
"Addons What's the first, purchased by you,"
"This site us, and why?"
How the hell do you know?
Buying goods online.
Addons Let me refresh your memory to tell you.
I've never bought anything like that.
What's this?
"Addons you score ""zero"", Max."
I've never bought anything like that.
Addons The correct answer is ...
Addons 1: you are at level 1.
You fall for the exam 7 times.
Addons 2:
"Profile of the most frequently visited is ""Leeps Jennifer""."
Addons And you've seen pictures of 234 times.
Now obviously.
Addons Question 3:
Your order solution genitals.
Addons Once you come from Poland.
He was 17.
"Addons short: dirty people like you, interesting disease."
Well done.
Confidential.
I do not buy it.
"Addons Gwen, your question starts now."
I do not think that there is a game.
Problems that are too personal.
"I was 20 bucks up, but with only enough time for one more pick-up before the bars closed,"
I needed to make sure I chose a wealthy client.
[ Cellphone rings ]
"""Honda Civic."""
I'll forward that to Rut.
"I wanted a bigger tip, so I held out for another car."
And I'm glad I did.
"Oh, my gosh!"
I don't even want to know that.
Woman #2:
It's crazy.
[ All talking at once ]
No!
"No, no, no."
I can't even begin to guess what they're talking about.
Yeah.
It's a package.
I'm just saying.
"Look, I don't wear toe socks around town."
I am out of my element.
He was weird because I went to his...
"While Rut was off driving a cheap Civic, my last pick-up took me to the Castro district, and I was looking for a big tipper."
Hi.
Did you guys call Zingo?
- We did call Zingo!
- I'm Adam.
"- Ah, Bobby Pin."
- Bobby Pin.
I called 1-800-babe.
Is that you?
"No, but thanks for asking."
- Okay.
"""Una poco de gracia. """
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
That ain't a trick question.
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
"# Bamba, Bamba"
# Bamba... #
"We're going to the seaside, pack a bag."
"# Bamba, Bamba"
Me llamo Calum.
Me gustan los churros y las chicos.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
Reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, Mum and Dad used to take us to the seaside."
"Me and my sister would sit in the back, eating digestive biscuits."
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time or a light or whatever.
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tons.
I suppose I'd better save some for my mother.
You OK?
I'm just trying to deal with this shit. I didn 't ask forthis.
"What, and I did ?"
I climbed on top of myself and got pregnant ?
You want me to take him to my mother's ?
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready.
Get him ready !
"Oh, no."
You're not going now here with my son tonight.
"Not on that temper, and not with that attitude."
"Look, you know what ?"
Fine.
"Then, I won't take him. I'm outta here."
"Go ahead, leave."
That's what you're good at !
Your son ain't seen nothing but your back since he was born !
- [DoorCloses] - [Baby Crying]
"[Babies Crying, Murmuring]"
[Woman] Shawana Clarke.
Shawana Clarke.
Do you want me to take him ?
No.
"[Woman] Travis, come here."
"Come here, Travis."
"Travis, put that down."
Excuse me. I have been here for an hour and a half.
Am I gonna be able to see a doctor anytime soon ?
"I've already told you, we'll get you in as soon as we can."
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.
I don't want a dime extra.
And you're not gonna touch him again.
You hear me?
I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again and I hope you don't...
I don't give a crap if he gives you a reason.
"You're not gonna touch him again, just say it."
"Billy, let's go."
You need to calm...
You need to tell your little brother...
"Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch!"
"You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me?"
How's Jackie?
You don't touch...
Billy!
Billy!
You're barking up the wrong tree!
Hey!
Get out!
You are barking down the wrong tree!
Billy!
Go!
"Jesus Christ, Billy!"
"What are you thinking, man?"
Get in the truck!
"Barking up the wrong tree, Billy!"
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.
Just get in the truck.
Keep your little brother away from me.
Start the truck.
Start the truck.
I'm trying!
Segovia?
"Yes, to the jail."
The jail?
Yes.
I need to see Benigno Martin urgently.
I know it's irregular but it's a matter of life or death.
The Director is waiting for you in his office.
For me?
Where's his office?
The officer will accompany you.
This way.
On the right.
"Empty your pockets, please."
"Hey, wait, don't run!"
Wait.
It's there.
At the end.
Good morning.
I'm Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
"Dear Marco,"
It's still raining.
I think it's a good omen.
When Alicia had her accident it was raining.
I'm writing minutes before I escape.
I hope that all I've taken is enough to put me in a coma and reunite me with her.
You're my only friend.
I'm leaving you the house
I prepared for Alicia and me.
"Wherever they take me, come and see me, and talk to me."
"Tell me everything, don't be so secretive."
"Farewell, my friend."
It's the station.
Excuse me.
Wesley.
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.
- Yeah?
- We found the body.
Can you be more specific?
Sid Thomas-Haye.
Guy who escaped from the hospital.
"Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head."
"Okay, nice work."
"Not so nice for him, but could be good for you."
We found his phone.
"A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call, so we ran that number."
Name came up as part of the Harris investigation.
What's the name?
Morgan Lewis.
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected?
Sid had a charge for possession.
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.
We got probable cause.
"Morgan, you home?"
Morgan?
"Frank, I got something."
Yeah?
What do you got?
Car service receipt.
Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.
One last hurrah.
I know that look.
"Me, too."
"Money or not, I'll stay."
I'll need a third.
"Sorry, Captain."
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.
"Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree, much less some boys."
"Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears."
"A hundred, then."
This man is the only reason we're still alive.
We were 45 men when this started.
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.
HAWK:
He's my father.
He can have my share.
JIM:
"Mine, too."
He can have my share also.
All right.
"If Mr. Bridger feels the same way,"
I'll lag behind with them.
You?
Yep.
You already lost my share of the pelts so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
$300...at least I get to go home with something.
"Glass is to be cared for until, understood?"
Yeah.
You have my word.
I understand.
HENRY:
Thank you.
This is good stuff.
Real good stuff.
Why are you driving me nuts?
Know how much I cried waiting for you?
You did?
I'm sorry.
Know how hard it was for me?
I was crying on the porch because of you.
Let me ask you something.
Please be honest.
Please.
"That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room?"
I'm getting sick of this.
It's that again?
I don't know.
Don't know anything anymore.
"Joongrae, don't lie to me."
"Please, don't lie."
Do whatever you want.
What did I do so wrong to deserve this?
What did I do?
I'm sick of it all.
"What's wrong with you, Moonsook?"
That's not important.
Somebody walked over me.
"You two walked over me, huh?"
"When I was outside, you two walked over me."
"I thought I was dreaming, but it was real."
I don't believe this.
"Walk over me, did you?"
How dare you?
I heard that you were in an accident...
How are you feeling...?
As you can see...
So you're okay...
I'm good.
I'm a little itchy.
This body has allergies.
So...
You have a lot of rocks in the house.
Oh...
It's a hobby of mine.
So people collect rocks too...
That's something.
Ouch!
You shouldn't be touching those...
These rocks represent my family
The large black one...is me.
The pretty white one is my wife.
The nice smooth one is Da Ran!
And this tiny little one...is Choong Sik!
"It's a rock family, a rock family!"
Dad rock...
Mom rock...
Child Rock!
"(The way it's pronounced, it sounds like Idol)"
Yeah...
"Well, since you're a part of our family too now...."
Let's find your own rock that we can put next to Da Ran together.
No thanks!
Why would I want that?
Shall we look for one?
A son-in-law rock?
What?
What?
"Ah Eiji, sorry to keep you waiting."
That Echizen sure is slow.
Get someone to bring him here.
Why don't you go?
Why me?
"Damn late, Echizen!"
"Ah, my apologies."
You see we are not open for business today.
"Ah, dozo."
Sorry about it.
- Come back tomorrow.
- But they're eating...
But they're eating...
"No, no, no."
That is just a minor incident.
Don't worry about it.
Carry on.
It is okay.
It's okay.
- Taka-san.
- Yes?
Good accuracy.
What about Higaki?
Don't worry.
There's a reason to make Higaki lose.
To control him better.
If this carries on it might lead to the damage of your whole body.
Rest for a year without playing tennis.
Concentrate on your therapy.
Wait till the National Finals.
You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?
"Oh, you're Jenna's favour."
This is Emily.
"This is Em, my daughter."
My father is a very special man.
It's nice to meet you.
I paid her to say that.
- Let's get started.
- Okay.
I don't know.
Just...
"Sorry, I gotta ask."
"You didn't marry Jim Finnerty from Sigma Chi, did you?"
- That guy was--
- An asshole.
"Yes, he was."
"This is my colleague, Special Agent Todd."
Standard Secret Service protocol requires a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.
"- I'm sorry, I just looked at him."
- You're only to look at me.
So we just-
- Okay.
The subject is John Cale.
"Born 1980, grew up in the District of Columbia graduated Hill High in 1999."
Looks like you've bounced from job to job.
"Mechanic, limo driver, construction."
Is my credit score in there?
"Yes, and you should be ashamed of yourself."
"It's a recession, okay?"
Married Melanie Schopp in 2002 and had a child six months later.
Filed for divorce in 2005.
No.
You're not wearing pantyhose.
It's hot.
Take them off.
No.
Ridiculous.
I'm so sorry.
"Oh, my god."
Where have you been?
"We just wanted to make sure everything was set up, you know, perfectly at the reception and the dinner, and it's great."
Wow.
You look amazing.
You look like a princess.
What's wrong?
Don't cry.
"It's just, I've dreamed about this day my whole life."
Since my first communion.
Is that weird?
"No, hon."
We've all been dreaming about our own weddings.
Now that I'm here this doesn't feel right.
Everything will work out as it... should.
The future kind of has a funny way of doing that.
You just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.
Deep breath.
Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Hey.
Wait.
Picture.
No.
No pictures.
I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
"Uh, yeah?"
You bitch.
"You told me you were selling me oxy,"
But those pills were antibiotics.
"Yeah, I didn't get high."
I got a yeast infection.
¶...
For an audience of one ¶
¶ ooh ¶
Dad.
"Look, I can explain."
I came here to tell you.
"Jenny, please save your breath."
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home...
To Brooklyn.
"¶ ooh, ooh ¶"
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait?
"The producer from CNN just flew into town,"
And I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
"Come on, Dan."
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right?
"So whatever happens, we'll figure it out."
Thank you.
"I, uh..."
Got you some stationery
This is your night.
You've worked so hard for this.
That's not what I work for.
"-No, But still."
Sometimes it's good to take a break and enjoy the achievements.
It does not help to look back.
"Here, keep it."
You can get it.
I do not care who you were with.
Just get your ass down here now.
"But Aksel, you should have seen her."
A gorgeous blonde.
Her tits is the size of melons.
-Beina is as long as my dick.
"Fuck you, Degang."
"So, ScanBrazil?"
People all over the earth tremble enough in his pants now.
"Dispose of CDN, Genergy, Oxon and the European branch of Mintec."
Can anyone make some coffee for us?
It's going to be a long night.
Talk Pronovo and Sandelman.
Buy what you can.
"Go, go."
And I need a clean shirt!
Look here.
This is how champagne is opened.
55 million so far.
They supply them now.
I love the smell of bankruptcy in the morning.
"Quiet now, Degang."
-What Tsirk?
-There is Belarus.
"I don't mean that, but there's a..."
"Well, there is a certain way to do it."
"Oh, you mean little girls come with a set of instructions?"
No.
"No, what I mean is there are different kinds of kisses."
There.
Is that clear?
No.
Unless you mean little girls and little boys should kiss like this.
"Yes, yes, that's it."
Is that what I was doing?
"No, I'm..."
I'm afraid it wasn't.
You mean I was doing something like this.
Yes.
(STUTTERING) Yes.
That looked like what you were doing.
And I should have been doing this.
"Yes, that's it."
Now I'm all confused.
I forgot what I'm not supposed to do.
Wilbur.
"Oh, yeah."
I remember now.
(STUTTERING) That's enough!
"Hello, Bob."
Hello.
"Look, you stick to the little ones."
The big ones are mine.
"Now, don't... don't be silly."
I was just telling Willy here how to protect himself.
I don't think Wilbur needs protection.
"Yeah, well, I fucked up."
After that night on the bridge...
I blamed you for Jimmy.
"Yeah, I blamed me, too."
- I looked for you at the funeral.
- I couldn't deal with it.
An empty coffin like my mom's...
The river took half my family.
"It never gave them back, either."
I was wondering what happened to that picture.
"You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin."
All going to be cops.
- Brilliant idea.
- Look at us now.
I'm a dropout.
Jimmy's dead.
- And you're one of those...
- Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault what happened to Jimmy.
He had something wrong with him.
"He did, like my mom."
"Nobody noticed it, until he beat that suspect."
But I noticed it...
I never did anything about it.
You did the right thing.
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.
"- So, are you back now?"
- I'm back.
- You want to get something to eat?
"- No, I've got to meet a girl."
Danny...
and it can lift up to two or three persons.
I can't believe you have to be armed with such things.
Emergency alert!
An armed group of intruders have been spotted at excavation site one.
All defense units and medics are to report immediately!
So they've come.
I'm going to try these babies out right now.
What's going on?
Damn!
He's a monster!
Run for it!
Withdraw!
Why you..!
What happy people!
How dare you act so vulgar!
Spriggan!
Yu Ominae..!

I leave him to you!
Come back here!
you little traitor?
What?
Major Fatman!
It's a pity Ominae..!
Did you lose your abilities when you joined Arcam?
How come?
How come?
What's wrong with you?
and what we trained you for!
Bastard!
Who the hell are you?

"Hey, Sarge."
"Having a ball, huh?"
Did those meatballs ever figure on you coming in with six stripes?
"(laughs) Knocked them over, huh?"
"I went over big, yeah."
"I had the suit pressed and everything, all real sharp."
Yeah.
"Big, big."
"Hello, Sarge, Rocco again."
"Listen, the motor pool is in great shape, so just relax and have a ball."
"Hey, Sarge, they really flipped, huh?"
"Look, this is costing you guys a fortune."
You better hang up.
I'll be seeing you soon.
Take care of yourself.
Give my best to the gang.
"So long, Rocco."

You lied to me.

ANNOUNCER:
CBS Television presents You Are There.
- This week she thinks it's 1935!

"- Oh, dear!"
Tell you what.
I'll p--pop over tonight.
"If she catches us cuddling,"
-- you can introduce me as Stanley B--Baldwin!
-
"- No, thank you!"
"Play your cards right, I can get you a place on my cabinet!"
Or maybe in my sideboard!
I'm going to work.
Come over later and I'll get supper.
Lovely.
I'll b--bring a bottle of wine.
W--Wear something comfy.
"As we're almost related by marriage,"
I think it's time I introduced you to the secret practices of the small shopkeeper!
-
- Out of me way!
-
- Ow!
Ooh!
"Oh, dear!"
Not the easiest place to stick a plaster on!
G--Granville!
Fetch your toolbox!
"Oh, dear."
Where's y--your vest?
What are you doing out without a vest?
"Now, don't start."
I'm finished with all that clobber.
What is it?
What's wrong?
"Sorry, it's just..."
Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits...
It's cooler.
"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
It is very cool.
Bow ties are cool!
"No, the room."
The room is getting colder.
She's coming back!
What's she going to do?
Is she going to punish me?
Uh... uh...
She's learnt not to melt.
"Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast."
She's going to eat you.
Run.
"Children, what is exp..."
Who the devil are you?
!
What are you doing in my house?
It's OK!
"I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs... kissing!"
"Captain Latimer, in the garden, there's snowmen!"
"And they're just growing, out of nowhere, all by themselves - look!"
"Good evening, I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife!"
This dwelling is under attack!
"Remain calm, human scum!"
So!
Any questions?
Nevermore.
No.
No.
Here you go to believe.
"Do not believe this about me, major lord!"
Towards a dawn Mariska's limbs started becoming stiff.
Ágika was refreshed again.
He was Tót in the baddest state.
His brain rumbled.
His sense organs stopped working.
He hallucinated.
It was light.
"I think, his time to go to bed."
This was superb one.
We felt very well.
- I hope for it tomorrow we continue.
- Of course.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Major lord.
Sweet dreams major lord.
"Sleep tight, Ágika."
Mom.
He kissed my forehead.
What do you say to this?
"We have to go to bed, my sweet good Lajos."
"Ow, my Gyula, my Gyula."
My small son.
"Well, not wonderful, mom?"
He was not tired.
"With regret inform it the Hungarian Red Cross, that yours son, Tót Gyula is an ensign in the fight against the enemy, died a hero."
(Field post 809/3)
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.
Now I got to go call krzeminski's wife.
I'll call his girlfriend.
♪ There's a somebody I'm longing to see ♪
♪ I hope that he turns out to be ♪
♪ someone who'll watch over me
♪ I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood ♪

I thought I might
Tell you about my day if you have a moment.
"Yeah, that would be a nice change."
I got plenty of time on my hands.
All ears.
"Uh, it's just that..."
One of my co-workers died today.
"Geez, peg."
That's too bad.
Right there on the job?
"Yes, it was sudden."
I know how you feel...
blindsided.
Like when my cousin ralphie got hit by a bus.
"Granted, he did just knock off a newsstand, but still."
Big shock.
Shit.
All the cameras are down.
Audio's on a separate file.
- Yeah.
- Pull it up.
Here.
Nothing.
What time was that?
- One hour ago.
- Earlier.
Fuck you!
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
Go back further.
We just gotta hold out a couple of hours till Emerson gets here and then I hope...
- Quiet!
- Get off of me!
- Where is she?
- Fuck you!
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
Would you please just admit it?
I taught you about loyalty.
I fought tooth and nail with your mother for your custody.
Me.
Good old Dad.
And I am not the kind of man who would hurt my family.
"Now, I am disappointed in you for even thinking it."
"L""m hurting."
"Oh, my God."
"Daddy, you""re lying."
Lying right to my face!
"Oh, my God!"
- Keep your voice down.
"- How could you cheat, Daddy?"
How could you cheat on Clara?
Get out of my house.
"Clara, honey, patients are waiting."
"You know, Lisa hasn""t shown up in four days."
I guess whatever she has is contagious.
"- How""s David?"
- Fine.
- Are you okay?
"- Why wouldn""t I be?"
I fixed the scratch.
"The Mercedes the other day, I fixed the scratch... but now there""s a rattle."
"Driving to work this morning, it was rattle, rattle, rattle."
"L""m sorry."
"It""s all my fault."
"Of course it is, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, do you love her?"
- Do you love me?
- I want to come home.
Okay.
Thanks very much for calling us.
Yeah.
Appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
( Clearing Throat )
Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today.
There was an accident at Ben's house.
Is Ben all right?
"Ben's all right,"
- but his sister's boyfriend is dead.
- What happended?
Some bizarre accident.
He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi.
I've been doing research into Mikey Trenton's background.
I really need to talk to you about this.
"Yeah, okay."
You go to your class.
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
"Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax."
"""Electric chair""?"
We were so stupid.
"Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid."
He was probably just changing the station or something.
I went in to answer the goddamned phone.
Do you believe there was some pervert on the line?
I'm glad you're not dead.
God!
I wish I was.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
[Tuning]
[Hits bad note]
Shall I play something else for you?
Give me.
[Tuning]
[Plays Penruddocke's song]
[Woman from outside]:
Bravo!
Encore!
Encore!
[Woman]:
Forgive me.
I simply couldn't help responding to such marvellous playing.
Was it you?
It was neither of us.
"Well, whoever it is is extremely gifted."
"Yes, they are."
Now if you'll excuse us.
- You don't think that was rather rude?
"- No, I do not."
[Speaking German]
It's no good looking at me.
Who was that then?
I don't know.
Never seen her in my life before.
Would he like me to leave me fiddle?
"Oh, that would be very kind, Adam."
"You can be assured, it will be well looked after."
It's all right.
You can hang onto it for a bit.
[Speaking German]
"Well, now."
- Did Iris come in at a bad time?
Maybe.
"Okay, then next time!"
"Next time you cry, be sure to show me!"
Didn't you have a report from Ryner and Ferris to give me?
"Oh, yeah."
Here you go!
"The dog is Ryner, and the angel is Ferris, I take it?"
Yup!
"The wild beast and the dazzling beautiful avenging angel, Sister Ferris!"
"Same as always, hm?"
What's this?
"Um, they dug a hole and pulled out a dagger-looking thing."
"They had no idea what it was and threw it, and a dragon suddenly came to life, they said!"
A hero relic?
They really existed?
- Your Majesty.
"- What is it, Miller?"
Have a look.
You're certain of this?
The information comes from him.
"You know who I mean, I'm sure."
Iris.
"Sorry, but would you mind returning to Ryner and Ferris immediately?"
"Okay, Ryner."
Take care of today's portion.
"Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango!"
"Sion, you..."
"Sion, you!"

"Well, I won it."
"Hey, mate."
I want a shot to get it back.
"Fuck you, Commodore."
I won this money.
All right?
"It's all right with me, pal."
-Good meeting' with ya.
"-Come on, Jim."
Wait a minute.
Let's play.
Did you see that good-looking girl that I was talking to leave here?
"No, I don't know where she went."
"Okay, you can turn 'em on."
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this up in the rain in the first place.
"Finish up, already."
-You check the connections?
"-Yes, I checked the connections."
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
"Well, go check the hookup."
"Your boss say, ""Sign work both day and night."" I wanna lights on."
"-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?"
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
"Well, hurry up."
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
"Where the hell is it, anyhow?"
"Go around there, he said it's around to the left."
"Yeah, I think I've found it."
He would have found us anyway.
"It's a morning thing, right?"
When you wake up?
You work too much.
Sure.
Excuse me.
"Oui, mon ange."
"Yes, sweetheart, I know."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Daddy will call you back, but now I'm... wait, hang on."
Would you excuse me a second?
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
"Honey, I can't talk to you now."
"Rachel, check out that guy for me... now."
Of course you're coming for vacation.
Sure you are.
"No, honey, I can't come get you."
"We'll do just like last time, I..."
We'll see.
"Okay, I'll call you back."
Love you.
Don't ever do this to me again.
Ever.
I've got a screwball in my office.
"He may be a screwball, but he wasn't lying."
He's head of a department at St. Louis.
Ross didn't tell you anything else?
"No, nothing."
"They say the swan sings only once, just before dying."
"Yes, I know."
"He senses he's going to die, so he sings."
It's not because of the pain.
"Once she starts, she'll never stop."
- How true!
"It's so different, seeing it in real life instead of just reading a book about it."
This goes on every evening at our place.
He just comes home from the orchard...
"Let's not forget, hydroponic agriculture only started in the 21st century."
Back in this century they couldn't even control the weather.
Gee!
My dad!
"- Bye, then."
- Bye.
Didn't I tell you to get home earlier?
What's that in your hand?
Give me it!
Fido!
Fido!
Adam!
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Give it to me!
"Dad, I didn't..."
I just...
Fido!
Dear God!
This dog is driving me crazy!
Look what he just did!
"You're the one who should look, at all these women!"
- Take it away!
- It's disgusting!
Wasting time on this instead of studying!
- My dear son!
- This kid will never amount to anything!
Huh?
[ Gasps ] I'm falling!
"Oh geez, I'm falling."
Guys!
"Yeah, but if he did have a jet pack, he could just put it on upside down!"
"Uh, they still cant hear me!"
My phone!
I dropped my phone!
Why do my powers just keep coming and going?
I was just so happy to be home.
Wait!
That's it!
Happiness!
My floating power's tied to my emotions!
"[ Groans ] Right, just like all my stupid powers!"
Ooh!
"Okay, right, I can control this!"
I just have to think happy thoughts and no negative thoughts!
"So, what makes me happy?"
Donuts?
"No, I'm not gonna get any."
The beach!
"No, that's where I'm going to die."
[ Thud ]
Mom?
"Oh geez, those feelings are complicated."
"Come on, come on, brain, time's running out!"
I just need something that makes me happy!
Something I can always depend on to cheer me up!

My guys!
They spent all night with me just to keep me company.
J.D. :
There.
There he is.
[vin GRUNTS]
[BOTH grunting ]
We've got some unfinished business in Texas.
JOSlAH:
All right.
Take him away.
I know you wanted him alive.
You did what you had to.
I can't clear my name if I'm dead.
Well...
"... youwin,Mother."
You alwaysdo.
"Well, of course, darling. I've known you since you were an itty-bitty baby."
That's always gonna be my trump card.
That's a mother's advantage.
"Now, come here and give me a kiss before I leave."
EZRA:
You're leaving?
But your place is a gold mine.
It's booming.
"Well, that's the whole idea."
You buy a depressed property.
You get it going...
... andsellit at  the height of it's popularity.
I made a fortune.
"Spend it in good health, Mother."
"Oh, I already did."
I reinvested it in another very depressed property.
You aren't.
- Huh?
You must have gotten somebody else.
Nobody hates the army more than Klinger.
He's spent his entire career trying to get season tickets to Section Eight.
"Gee, I don't know."
"This Klinger... dark, hairy guy, big beak."
Let me see that.
"[Chuckles] When I saw him in the ""O"" Club... crying in his beer over some skirt named Laverne..."
[Fingers Snap] It was all over but the signing.
"Vickers, you're a vulture."
"Doctor, you operate your way."
I'll operate mine.
[Clicks Heels]
See ya.
"- ##[Jukebox. ""Harbor Lights""]"
"- Klinger, come on."
Get up.
- Huh?
- Get up.
The maid wants to put fresh linen on the bar.
"Oh, please."
"Didn't you read the ""Do Not Disturb The Dead"" sign?"
- This is no time to let a sleeping drunk lie.
- ## [Stops]
Oh!
Don't!
All I have left of Laverne is that song.
"Klinger, do you have any idea what you did last night?"
- Last night?
"- Last night, yeah."
- Last night.
- Last night.
He doesn't mix with dirty Arabs like you!
Dirty Arabs?
Reminds me of waterboarding.
You got a bathtub in here?
Buildings and Investments operate through the Pole Pot Bank.
"Forget the bank, I want the banker!"
"Apart from banking, what does the banker do?"
Walk his dachshund through the park?
Rare?
Medium?
Well done?
Overdone?
The theater.
He took a shine to some piss pot actress.
Care to impart her pseudonym?
Aglaé.
Gla Gla!
That tip would have saved your hide.
"Unfortunately, I have a kiss from Mary."
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing!
Why do I make a show of it?
Because... you're my friend.
"You know what I feel, right now, here?"
I'll tell you.
I'm gonna barf.
What am I good for?
Nothing gives.
Makes a void inside.
You got religion?
No!
Here.
But those days are done.
- Oh.
- Mm.
Huh.
"Well, I guess I'm not in control of everything, am I?"
"Funny, isn't it?"
"You can try and try, but in the blink of an eye..."
You can lose everything that matters to you.
"Dad, are you okay?"
Don't you all see what's going on here?
Dad really wanted that milk.
I almost lost you guys today...
All of you.
- Aw.
- Just like that.
"Aw, daddy."
"Oh, honey."
"You spent the whole day trying to control everything, and I spent the entire day trying not to, and neither way worked, did it?"
Nope.
"I may fight you on this, but I'm gonna need you to make me get rid of Jolene two."
- She's a biter.
- I know.
As soon as we're done with this hug.
"Hey, whatever this is, I need to get in on it."
I almost died today.
- Grandpa.
- Daddy.
"- Aw, dad."
- Hey.
Come here.
- Aww.
"- Come here, you."
"He is, but do you know him?"
"Of course, I do."
"He's incredibly kind, generous--"
My dry-cleaning guy is kind and generous.
Where's the prednisone?
Left bottom shelf.
I know him. I do.
Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it...
... andthenforgetstoputitback when he is done?
Clips his toenails in bed?
-Drips when the toilet seat's down?
-Abby.
-Likes jam on his grilled cheese?
-l can learn during the marriage.
"-Yes, but I don't think that's-- -l love Michael..."
... andI couldusealittlesupporthere.
"I am very happy for you, I really am."
"And, of course, I'll stand up for you."
I wouldn't miss it.
-Great.
-Okay.
"Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?"
-Sure.
-Walk with me?
All right.
"This young man, K.J. Thibeaux?"
You've been sponsoring him as a Volunteen.
Yeah.
"He got in the surgical floor storeroom, stole a digital video camera."
-What?
Get out of here.
-l don't wanna make a big issue...
"Yeah, true."
Might as well.
How'd it go with the sponsors?
Not well.
They love you.
They just don't think it's a great fit.
What did they say?
They weren't impressed with your last fight.
"I told them you were sick, but the real issue is the stuff with your dad."
Ryan.
"What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, Lisa?"
I already went to fucking prison.
I know.
I think it's just getting people to understand what you've been through.
It's none of their fucking business.
That's personal.
I don't want to talk about that.
Maybe there's a way to do it that doesn't suck.
Let me think about it.
All right.
[Indistinct chatter]
Alvey:
Yes?
[Door opens]
Mario Goldsmith's here.
"Oh, yeah, send him in."
- The poison pen.
"- How are you, Alvey?"
I'm great.
I'm great.
Have a seat.
Thanks for coming.
Someone]
Whoa!
Nana!
How you doing?
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.
[J.D.] Date time.
Dude.
There you are.
Two things.
"First, aliens are here wearing tracksuits."
"- Oh, no, that's Nana."
- Second...
I got a job.
- Nice.
"- If you hadn't pushed me to do that extra mile stuff, that wouldn't have happened, so thank you."
You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar.
You go get her!
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?
"That's one of my conditioners, yes."
"[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said..."
This girl really digs hair.
It's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
Ah!
How was your first stress-free day?
Horrible.
You?
Worse.
Let's make a baby.
"If it doesn't work this time, I'll kill myself."
Not helping with the stress.
"Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager."
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
"In English, please."
- Sorry.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know.
I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
"If I were him, I'd only sign for 1 5."
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
"Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me."
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
"Of course, Mr. Vermont."
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
"You know, Americans are sticklers for details."
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
Sound?
Sound rolling.
Speed.
"Dunkirk film, scene 17, take one."
"Good luck, Lieutenant Lundbeck."
Action!
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Come on, boy."
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there.
And he's got a friend.
It's a Karabiner 98 Kurz.
Best damn gun since the Win chester 73.
I'm most awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I've lost my line.
Cut.
Jesus.
Twenty-three takes.
We only stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War Office wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
And no one thought to give him a bloody screen test?
"Well, can't we replace him?"
This film has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
- He's the template.
"- If that lump of Yank stays, the film fails and the national case with it."
He is a brave boy.
Would you or I be so brave?
Is Mr. Baker all right?
- He lost one of his grandsons.
- Oh...
"I said, all right, Horace."
"I called a time out so you can go take a leak, all right?"
"I mean, what am I gonna do?"
"He's my nephew and he's crying, right?"
"So I said, okay, honey, go to the toilet, I'll put Ralphie in right field, all right?"
So you can go take a pee pee.
"And he's crying, just standing there."
"I said, what's the matter with you?"
I thought you had to go make a pee pee?
Now go make a pee pee!
"And he says... (high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!"
I look and he's got piss all over his pants!
His pants are covered in piss!
"Remember that, Horace?"
Remember when you peed your pants in little league?
Where you going?
"Oh, come on, you little crybaby!"
"- Don't cry, little Horace."
Horace:
He's all right.
"He's all right, Pa."
man:
"Oh, Jesus."
"- Hey, Horace, didn't your other boy play baseball, too?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, Little Pete's good."
- Yeah.
"- He's on a team, he's great."
"Shortstop, and he can hit it."
Fantastic.
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Where you been?
"Higaki, we're counting on you."
- We are counting on you!
- We are counting on you!
Isn't this what idiots say?
Don't be jabbering around me.
Apologize Higaki.
I can't forgive what you said just now.
"If I lose, I'll kneel on the floor to apologize."
"Higaki, you know what you gotta do?"
The day I lose to that chibi is the day I die.
I'm a pro.
Sixth match.
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.
You... are the pillar of Seigaku.
"Ah, you don't have to be so bothered, it's just a tennis game."
"But chibi, it doesn't matter what kind of genius you are, I won't give any chances."
I'm the real genius.
A dog that doesn't bite barks the most.
Hoh!
A kid like you wouldn't know.
"Weak, huh."
Love - 15
- Out!
- 15
- All

That fellow.
40 - 15
Game Seigaku.
One game to love.
Seigaku leading.
"Damn kid, dares to look down on me."
Enough.
"Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think I can't do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?
"- ""On something""?"
- Yeah.
- I never said you were on something.
- Then don't.
Don't start.
"Hey, now we're talkin' here."
She's a killer.
You're goddamn right I'm a killer.
You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
"- I will eat your babies, bitch."
- Bring it!
- Nobody's eating babies.
"- Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?"
- No.
No fight.
She's not ready.
"- Oh, I'm ready."
"- No, you're not ready."
- I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.
"- What about next Friday, huh?"
- Yeah.
How's Friday?
- You're crazy.
- How's Friday to you?
"What's the matter, ""Frankie Fat Hands""?"
- You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?
- That's good.
That's not what I said though.
- What do you mean?
- When you were... born.
When I was born?
You mean changing diapers and things?
- I did that.
- I know you did.
"Remember, once I went out into the road... and you waited, and you gave me a spanking... for going out in the road?"
- Do you remember?
"- Oh, I remember that one too."
That was a tough -
- And you -
- That was a tough corner.
And you used to take me fishing?
Right?
"Oh, I did."
Every week.
Every week we went fishing and horseback riding.
Remember?
- Do you -
"- Well, I liked doing those things."
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- We did enjoy ourselves.
I'm still livin'.
Yes.
And I'm glad you are.
"- I'm not bad, eh?"
- I think you're great.
You still look pretty handsome to me.
[Chuckles]
- I'm not bad.
That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
You're here.
And so are you.
"Officer Hauser, the twin tree..."
any leads?
Not yet.
But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well, I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?
Fix her.

"Hey, Trent, quit twerking."
Don't look at me while you're twerking!
- Don't look me in the eyes while you're twerking!
- He's looking at me!
Tell me where you pawned Candace's ring please?
Oh the ring.
News flash.
I never pawned it.
- You turned it into a tongue stud?
"- Oh, my God, it's perfect!"
All right.
You're gonna give that diamond back
OK.
"As Matthew McConaughey would never say, all wrong, all wrong, all wrong."
Trent says no.
Trent smells so good.
"OK, OK."
I got this.
I got this.
Come on.
You heard the lady.
- The diamond belongs to Candace.
- What are you gonna do about it guv'ner?
"Well, I think that speaks for itself."
"Sorry, guys."
You're never getting this back.
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go show my capitalism."
Capitalism's what I call my dong now.
"Hey, Trent."
You're on the main stage in five minutes.
Watch out.
"No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop."
And now they're gonna be in a show together?
!
"Jesus, it's all over for me."
They'll probably even have a kissing scene!
What did I do to deserve this?
And what am I supposed to do now?

"It's our son, he's running away!"
- I'm gonna get a palliative-care specialist...
- There must be something else you can do.
- To come down here and discuss your options.
- I will try anything... anything.
"I will try an experimental drug, uh, uh, more surgery."
"Uh, anything!"

I-I can't pass up lobster.

I'm a fellow traveler here.
"Uh, Larry..."
Larry Janson.
Do you like lobster?
"Well, my... my religion forbids shellfish, but I-I-I'd be happy to take you."
You just wait right here.
I'm just gonna get my coat.
God bless you.
And you.
"Look, you Boss told you to give me something in this replacement."
Then give me and go.
"No, How could I give you that?"
"It's not your age, Age not concerns."
"You know, how many little people has gone there."
"Look, I can't raise you up."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"You were the only Laxmi, Who was my last hope,"

"Kill me, please!"
Kill me.
Let me go.
What you've done?
We stop him to go.
"Don't touch him, He is my Laxminarayan."
"No, he's our Laxminarayan."

"He's our piece, He's not a piece, he's Laxminarayan."
"He's ours, He's mine."
"He's ours, He's mine."
One minute.
"Yes, Madam, Where are you?"
You know Laxminarayan was coming on 11:00.
"Yes, Madam but how could he?"
He's lay down here.

It's Max.
Were you having dinner?
"Well, don't worry."
It's not urgent.
"No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion."
Because...
I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way.
Yes.
You said I was a fanatic intellectual..
From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth.
Well...
I'm not trying to sermonize you.
I just wanted to end the discussion.
"Okay, go eat your dinner."
But don't think that's an end to this.
You and your bitch will regret this.

- OK.
I need a drink.

Your name is reynolds and before that it was knealy.

This is my wife.

It's Khurana's stuff.
He sells this cheap stuff.
Why the police?
Stand in line everyone.
Open your bags.
- l know.
"Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate, and let's not get any more involved, please."
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
Alright.
"Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?"
- English lady.
- That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace in the last hour?
"- No, sir."
- Wait a minute.
This is very important.
- She had my little boy with her.
"- No, sir."
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.
- He what?
- Checked out.
- But he couldn't have.
"- Yes, sir, he did."
"Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses."
"Yes, sir."
He checked out.
"(Sighs) I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted."
"I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell her she can bring Hank back."
"- Just hold that call a minute, Jo."
- Why?
Because I asked you to!
"Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?"
I hope not.
"Well, then stop acting like that."
I merely said I was going to call Mrs Drayton.
"She loved me, you must understand."
"What, you think I don't understand love?"
It's better for the other.
- What's next?
- For what is above.
But you talk to God?
Could you not remain just for two minutes?
It would be sad.
- What isn't?
Open your eyes.
- I don't know how to see.
- But I know inside and I see later ...
- And have I came inside?
Young.
Want to check?
- So I'll be like your bitch!
"- No, you would not do."
And is this what you want?
"You are truly a beautiful asshole, cousin."
It's André.
"André, that's my cousin Leon."
André is a guy who fucks good.
"It is well established by my mother, and I was placed in his lap."
"Marivaux is nice, but side slut, he prefers me."

"No, thanks."
So I'm sure you've heard about Heather Weather?
"Yes, that she was murdered."
"No, that she'd been shaving her age."
She's really 62 years old.
"Wh- oh, um..."
I'm not surprised.
What's yourshow tonight?
"Here, this is formaking a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need yourfilthy stuff.
Ah OKthen...
Don't you everwear colorless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answerthe phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brotheris saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we neverforget to smile.
Abig round of applause.
"That's one, two, three solid leads."
Three.
We'd need 30 private contracts to make up the kind of revenue we're out.
"Hey, we're doing our best here."
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's
Stop it!
Hyo-ijn!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
You asked how long we've been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes...
Alright.
- We met in a hospital.
- In a hospital?
Yea.
"It was that dull hospital over at Lexington, know it?"
No.
We were doctors.
"I mean, surgeons."
Violet tells me to say surgeons.
"Working at the hospital never gave me bad dreams, that's for sure."
"Anyway, she's my best friend ever."
I'm kinda worry about her sometimes though.
"Half the time, I wish I was more like her."
And then...
What?
I don't know.
She reminds me of my daughter.
Is that her on the phone machine?
But it's not important.
"It is, but... don't let it distract you."
- What's with that?
- What's with what?
The numbers you two have.
- This?
- Yes.
"Oh, that's our rank."
Officially I'm killer number Nine and Violet's killer number Eight.
And how do you move up?
Makin' hits.
Vi says it beats dead entries.
"No, no, that ain't the woman!"
I ought to know!
"- Curly ought to know, too."
"- You're screwy, Curly."
That's just somebody who looks like her.
"You ain't going to work the boy over, are you?"
"That all depends on you, Joe."
You wanna talk?
"Listen, boy- You're not mine, see?"
"They just think you are, see?"
"So no matter what they do to you, you can take it."
I know that you can.
"Just like your old man, see?"
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me go home to mother and dads!
"Don't let them throw you, Joey!"
Start him off.
"I think you'll decide to talk, Joe."
"Start walking, Sonny."
- What ?
- Get a move on!
Walk!
Pick them up!
Feet!
Feet!
"All right, my son."
Dad's at breakfast.
"You're not going to sleep all day, are you?"
"Oh, always throwing your things around."
Don't you want to eat breakfast ?
Paul!
Paul!
"Oh, Rache ..."
Why did I bother?
That does not bother to.
"We both miss him, John."
- I gotta go.
Talk to you later.
- Okay.
OK.
"- Hey, thanks for your looking for."
- No problem.
I never listened to?
Newer attırdım their signature.
Will be very famous.
This is a great Rook ...
Many are not my favorite kind.
You will understand what the hell is?
Shall I wear something on me.
Then they go to Sam to figure out.
"Tell your father, the latter one."
"After that, the file will not be another, right?"
"Losing it, Rook."
What do you mean?
Do not count on this halledebileceğime?
Jade told me to do.
That's it.
Asshole ...
The sculptures of pure heroin.
"Calculates according to the head, the value of $ 20 million."
"- It's beautiful, is not it?"
- Seems to be crying.
"Yes, I know."
The flows of goods.
I was always different.
My mom is an angry woman.
Life was neverthe same.
When I moved to Istanbul for university... she hired Zindan.
"Even so, she destroys my clothes... if she doesn't like them."
Why can't you be honest and tell the truth to yourparents?
Honesty is the easiest.
You don't understand.
Honesty will kill me.
"No, I can't understand."
What could possibly happen?
They are your parents.
They love you.
My mom is obsessed with cleaning.
I am not clean.
"What ever happens, happens."
We can change it.
We're going to the police.
"Tomorrow, OK?"
"Sir, we need to ask you a few questions."
Yourson Ahmet filed a complaint.
These youngsters...
You know how my wife can get...
Nevermind.
"Hello, you're still sleeping?"
Don't shout.
I need a driver.
"Can, have you gone nuts?"
Yourfoolish aunt didn't tell me...
"Thanks to Ahmet, she doesn't know."
Come in...
Come in.
Don't you talk about Haziya.
At least use a decent knife.
What's wrong with you?
Unbelievable.
It's Isabelle Moretti.
So answer already.
"Remember, only Ricky talks."
She gave us exactly 15 minutes.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"Come in, you can leave the gate open."
Are you the one I spoke to?
- Are you Jonah's son?
"- No, I'm her daughter Dorona's husband."
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
"- And these are her sons, Natanel..."
- Pleased to meet you.
"Pardon me, I'm religious."
- And Shai.
- Pleased to meet you.
"At first I thought you were an Israeli producer, that's why I said I don't make movies there."
I don't like the Mideast any more.
Your smile looks like Jonah's.
- Did you know her?
"- No, but Maurice showed me a photo once-."
How is she?
She died three weeks ago.
I'm so sorry.
I thought her children wanted to bring her and Maurice together but I guess that only happens in movies.
Come.
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
And now I'm here.
- So you want money from me?
- Money?
"Earn it, yes."
Together with you guys I wanna earn money.
Work together.
I thought it would work out in a more respectable way but I've been a fool.
"Now, I'm here."
What am I supposed to do?
Play a barrel organ?
"No, I'd rather be a thief."
I did the best I could.
"But that is over, forever."
Even if I lose my head now.
- So that's your new attitude?
- No no no no!
I did the best I could!
Now I'm here and I will stay!
Now you can think about it.
- What are you doing here?
"- Franz, come home please!"
What happened to you?
- What happened to you?
- None of your business!
It's gonna be allright.
Do you really think so?
I've been starving and freezing and it all turned out just fine.
You are Mieze.
I used to be Franz's girlfriend.
I'm Cilly.
I really know nothing about Franz.
You look very pretty.
- Capote.
- Capote?
- Capote.
Sweet tooth.
"Straight-up fag, Mr C."
- Flaming!
"- Thank you, Mr Ricard."
We can now promote you up to kindergarten.
Anybody else?
"Once, twice..."
"Miss Johnson, I apologise if any of this is over your head."
"If you see me after class, I'll give you some chapters."
Anybody?
It's a non-fiction novel.
"Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up."
He created a new genre.
White folks back then felt safe.
Capote scared them.
He took hardcore crime out of the ghetto and placed it in America's backyard.
That's what makes the book special.
"Yes, that's part of it."
That's all of it.
We got a debate going on now.
Capote wasn't first.
Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same.
"Wasn't nobody trying to read them, though."
A lot of people read them.
A lot of people like who?
You?
Didn't think so.
"Hey, yo!"
"Mr C, Mr C."
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
- Now?
- Yeah.
"Aw, God almighty."
"Jesus, Sharon."
"You'll soon be the same shape as me, what?"
Thanks very much.
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
He's coming!
He's coming!
If you received my letter
We should have met him at the airport.
Not at all.
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If
You still want me
"Well, tie a yellow ribbon"
'Round the old oak tree
It's been three long years
Do you still want me?
Still want me
If I don't see a ribbon
'Round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
"Craig, love."
Sharon's having a baby.
Is that right?
"That's right, yeah."
- Come on.
"- Oh, my goodness."
Are you getting tired?
You want me to wheel you?
- No!
- All right.
- Absolutely no.
- All right.
This is a big place.
Do you know where you're going?
When we come in the first building - You come into the building -
One second.
Could it be over there?
"- Yes, it must be."
- You think it might be there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause there's more than one entrance.
- But we're gonna look at them all.
"- Well, there's a fence there."
Let's have a look.
Do you see it here?
"- No, not here?"
"- It's downstairs, where you come in."
All right.
Let's go to the other entrance.
I think I know which one you're talking about.
This way.
- I'm thinking it might be along here.
- It's in the entrance.
"Well, let's - let's have a look here."
And he never even told me it was there.
- He didn't tell you?
-Of course you're sorry.
is that your signature?
We record the receipt of all documents.
What about phone calls?
You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.
Glamour.
"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."
Maybe we can nominate them.
I thought it was all cut.
"Cut, not cut."
Politics.
Nothing's cut.
Where you going?
I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
- His doctor?
I don't know.
"Oh, wait a minute. it could be a Dr Kessler."
"Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here."
"- Could you check with him, please?"
- Sure.
Let me check.
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I went to the market for five minutes and he's gone!
Where is Saul?
"- Take it easy, Lena."
- Rick won't tell me nothing!
- What's happened?
- Saul may have had a heart attack.
"- Oh, God, no!"
- It's all right.
We don't know yet.
- Is there any word?
"- No, not yet."
"Dr Kessler will be here in a moment, but he knows nothing of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack."
And international Life Support haven't dispatched an ambulance since last night.
Where is he?
What happened to Saul?
Where is he?
"Please, where is my husband?"
"Oh, Thomas."
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?
Why don't you just go and find my Saul instead of torturing me!
- Lena!
Officer?
Just hold your horses.
POLICE RADIO:

Who is she?

She was electrocuted in the bathtub.

There's no shelf or anything above the tub.
It's funny.

Saw who?
Who was in there?
"- What, you got bumped?"
- No.
"Mm, they, uh, found a girl with better hobbies."
Would you quit?
No.
I decided not to be on that list.
Because...
"Well, just because."
Don't feel like you have to cancel your blind date.
I'm not going on that date.

I just didn't feel like going out tonight.

I have to fine you for speeding.
"Make it fast, I don't want to miss the sunset."
"You know, when the sun goes down into the sea?"
hello Ma'am.
I came to say hello.
- I'II make you some good coffee.
- It's not forthat.
"Here you are, would you Iike some?"
"No, if I may, this time I'm bringing you something."
"It's a specialty from my area, smell the fragrance."
"- ""Invernizzi Gim""."
- It's gorgonzoIa.
- You'II like it.
- Thank you.
"It's soft gorgonzoIa, excellent for appetizers."
It should go in the fridge.
I'm off.
"- Wait, some coffee."
- Duty calls.
I have to work.
"Oh, come on."
Who'd check out some gorgeous hottie walking down the street?
- Thanks.
- I was talking about me.
Alex... there's no reason to get paranoid.
But just to be on the safe side...
- What?
- Just go with me on this.
Who was that?
No idea.
I'm really starting to like this hiding thing.
- Don't answer it.
- Not planning on it.
I have to answer it.
It's my assistant.
"Hey, Molly."
"Okay, calm down."
I'm on my way.
I have to go sign some contracts that were dropped off at my apartment by mistake.
Can we pick this up a little later?
It's not like I'm a faucet.
You can't just turn me on and off.
Step.
Step.
We're just going in there to pick up some documents.
Fine.
- And make out a little.
- Works for me.
Surprise!
"Scott, this is everybody."
"Everybody, you all know Scott-- the enemy."
Molly... you did all this for me?
"Normal saline, wide open."
"Four milligrams morphine, IV Push, PRN."
"Immobilize that spine with a collar, side head supports, and straps."
Be very careful.
"Okay, that's a roger."
The respiration is rapid and shallow.
"Oh, yeah."
Easy.
Did he say anything about who hit him?
"No, man, he didn't say anything."
Easy.
There we go.
Sugar.
"Ollie, he's going to crump on me."
Can you...
Do you want me to pull over?
"I got it, I'm styling."
Just get us there.
Watch for Mary.
Listen for her bell.
It's a death bell.
"I'm bagging away here, but I'm getting airway resistance."
Has his trachea deviated?
"Big time, to the right."
Fudgebar.
He's going V-Fib.
"The fun never ends, huh?"
Clear.
"Come on, Danny."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're back."
"Liz, get a cutdown tray ready for chest tube insertion, please."
You okay with this one?
And... and you're right.
You're right.
It's not... it's... it's not just about you and me anymore.
And being a good mother means doing what's best for your child.
"And you may not understand this, and you may never... forgive me for it, but I..."
I walked out that door tonight to do what's best for Lucas.
This is what's best for Lucas.
You're what's best for Lucas.
This is me being a good mom.
Violet?
Violet.

I had a dog like him once.
I went to have him put down.
He jumped out of my arms at the vet's and took off for the park.
Sometimes I still think I see him out there...
... watchingme...
... gnawingonan oldbone.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Nettie."
Can I help you with the basket?
"No, no. I didn't know Frank was expecting you."
Due espressi?
.
Maybe later.
"99 out of 1 00 times, we can beat something like this."
I don't like the odds.
We go back a long way.
"I know, I know."
"I tried to close the door, Frank."
Couldn't get it shut.
-What do you want me to do?
-Take the pressure off yourself.
Here's the thing.
They'll tell you:
"""""Yeah, yeah, sure."
You have the key to the cell.
"Go ahead. """""
But you won't be able to open it without singing.
You're a singer.
"Give me a chance, and I'll show you how quiet I can be."
"It's out of my hands, Frank."
"Do the right thing, will you?"
-Make it easy for yourself.
"If she doesn't pay, it comes out of my pocket."
Why call the police?
We'll make her parents pay.
Do you really need the police?
I feel bad for her.
"What, are you willing to pay what she owes?"
"No, but..."
"She won't tell us her address, she's a runaway."
Hey!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey!
He's not coming back.
"He hasn't replied yet, right?"
You were tricked.
Shut up!
He said he's not doing that anymore.
He tells that lie to everyone.
Get your hands off me!
What're you doing here?
Ow...
Let's go.
He went and fought for her.
What about you?
They must be in round two.
Take it easy.
I have to go.
"Does your husband do this to you, too?"
"No, he won't even lay a finger on me."
Sergeant Fujita must be asleep with your kid now.
Don't...
"You're a naughty wife, leaving the kid to your husband."
You watch your job!
I don't understand him.
What's this man talking about?
"Come on, boys, don't be crazy."
Because of you all the gang is at a stand-still.
"-Boys, come on."
-No boys.
Look.
-Reproduction artists.
"-We are starting a new life, boss."
"-Here is the agreement, master."
"-""Group Biceps""."
-We are going down the artistic road.
-Therefore... we can fuck this job.
"Cursed, fucking job!"
"Excuse me, do you have some cursed, fucking job for us?"
And now we will play for our Rose from the canteen.
This is a magnificent feeling!
Splendid.
Indeed.
How does it work?
What's wrong with you?
"Well, what's up?"
Nothing.
I'm working.
"Well, you're working, but this isn't working."
You're right.
And does yours work?
I can't see a button anywhere.
Maybe it's centrally controlled somehow.
A kind of central control.
Hallo!
Have a nice life.
Françoise.
Thank you.
Thomas.
You hate me.
Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What?
I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes.
They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it.
I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess.
-Everybody to Hawaii!
-wonderful!
-It will be a great holiday!
"-Grandma, Iet's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie."""
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."
"""of your eldest brother..."
"""Suzujiro Haruno."
"""Ever since my father..."
"""came from Japan..."
"""to Hawaii in 1920..."
"""he lived with the pineapples..."
"""and he will soon die as an American..."
"""leaving me this vast farm."
"- Oh, the setup is all wrong."
I'm bound to wind up behind the eight ball with you.
What do you mean?
"Well, by your standards, I'm a wrong guy."
- You're the sweetest guy in the world.
"- No, you don't know what I mean."
- You don't know my racket.
- I don't care about your racket.
You sure?
"Not now, I don't."
Hello?
Mike.
That guy gets in your hair.
"- Hello, what do you want?"
- I'll tell you.
- You better get down here fast tonight.
- For what?
This Joe is on the loose.
They're stringing with him.
"I'm telling you straight, the guy threw me out."
You're frozen out.
Tell him to get here.
Tell him what he tried to do.
Louis is burned too.
He said Joe tried to hold him up today for cash.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, listen, you tell Louis I'm getting right down there."
"- Yeah, right away."
"- Yeah, okay."
"- What's wrong, Patsy?"
"- Oh, no, nothing."
Nothing at all.
"Hey, you!"
Help the women!
Hurry up!
Try to get into the church!
"Faster, faster!"
"Run to the church, everybody!"
Hurry up!
They could be here any second now!
Stop!
Stop or we'll shoot!
Stay where you are!
Stay back!
Close all entrances.
Anyone who tries to escape will be shot.
"- Get back, everybody."
Come on.
- Get back.
What are you going to do with these people?
"Mind your own business, priest."
"- Father, what do these men want?"
- Begin.
No.
"For heaven's sake, no!"
No!
- You're insane!
Bloody murderers!
- Get back!
Carrasco used you so that he could escape.
"- Come on, take out two more."
"- All right, Coronel."
Get up!
Come on!
"Have you got a cold, Ed?"
I didn't have a minute... didn't have a minute ago.
"Scratch me there, will you?"
- Here?
-(sneezes)
"Boy, this usually only happens when I'm... when I'm around dogs."
(sneezes)
- You got a dog?
"-Uh, yes, I have, Ed."
- Maybe you'd better go.
-Huh?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I'm all right.
"It's just, uh, the..."
Whose dog is it?
It's mine.
I got it at the pound.
But please don't say anything to Ralph about it before I do.
He doesn't think we should have a dog in the apartment.
"Oh, no, no, no, I won't."
I won't.
I won't.
"I'd like to look at the dog, if you don't mind."
"Well, do you think you should, Ed?"
"Oh, I'm-I'm all right."
It's just... (begins to sneeze) ...just after the initial attack is over then I'm all right.
I want to look at the pooch.
Where is he?
"Hi, there, little poochy boy!"
"Oh, what a beautiful dog this is."
Hey!
Hey!
Carl.
Carl?
Carl.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no."
Someone's taken Carl's brain!
That is what I've been trying to tell you.
Really?
"Well, you haven't been very specific about it!"
I know I haven't.
"Because they says if I tell anyone,"
I'm gonna lose my job dancing in front of the car wash.
"Well, I'll tell you what, we're gonna do something about it right now."
"Look here, we can keep this cool, between us 'cause, look, this the third job I lost this week."
Come on y'all.
We're gonna go get us a car wash.
Are you outta your mind?
They take your brain out!
I know that!
They take your brain out over there.
"Here, I got a coupon."
"That's okay, Carl."
I got the employee discount.
Free triple foam polish with UV protectorant.
"Come on, Shake."
I'm trying to create a show here.
I'm a show.
What time the show come on?
Brain:
"Brain Slave, report to Brain Quarters."
"Brain Slave, kindly report to Brain Quarters."
Brain Slave!
- There's no problem?
- No.
Where's my camera?
"Ali, where is it?"
I haven't seen it.
Look in the glove-box.
- Wait for me.
"- Farzad, put the bread there."
"Hello, engineer."
Hello.
"Farzad, wrap up the bread or it will dry out."
Would you like tea?
"Yes, thank you."
My colleagues are sleeping.
We'll have a walk and come back.
Off you go.
Which way's your school?
This way and that.
You have two schools then?
"No, there are two paths to school."
Where's the square?
This way.
You don't mind.
"Come this way, I'll get my camera."
What a handsome white village!
"Why is it called ""Black Valley""?"
The ancestors called it that.
"Can't you call it ""White Valley""?"
"No, we have to call it by its name."
It has to stay that way.
That's how it is.
"""When you're fahed ho be black..."
[Brakes Screech]
[Cloudy] Here.
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.
He made me too.
He lives on four.
He went up to six.
He's cute.
Real cute.
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
- [Cloudy] Come on.
- Look.
My partner and I made this case.
You know?
Originally.
We don't want any feds screwing' it up.
Case?
So far you haven't showed me a damn thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right in the middle of next week."
"- Aw, get out— - [Cloudy] Knock it off."
"- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it."
- We don't need this.
"Now, cut it out, will ya?"
For Christ's sakes!
We're cleared here.
Surveillance had them all going inside 45 minutes ago.
- Did anyone bail out on the perimeter?
"- No, ma'am."
All secure out here.
"Boss, this isn't a meth lab."
So why an escape tunnel?
Need to take a look at this.
Hotchner.
When?
Did they raise the terror alert?
"No, that's probably best."
"All right, get everybody in now."
I'll be there in a minute.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just have to go to the office.
"It's 6:15, and you're talking about a terror alert?"
"It's bad, isn't it?"
I don't know yet.
Please don't lie to me.
It might be.
I may not be home tonight.
"I mean,"
- I might be home late.
- I know.
Shoot.
I forgot.
Tomorrow is the day we... scheduled to take Jack
- to have his pictures taken.
- Don't worry about it.
- I'll reschedule.
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Now just pump the brakes right there.
- I got a question.
- Have at 'er.
Then I got a comment.
"Well, let's hear it, good buddy."
"Now, my question."
"When have you ever heard a girl go,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- Well...
- Other than in a porno.
- I don't believe I have.
- Me neithers.
That's because we don't say that.
- Well...
- Not unless it's in a porno.
WAYNE:
Now my comment.
"You see, the way Dary did the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes"" in pornos."
That's the way they do it.
"The girl gets all excited, and she goes,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"Yes, but the way you're doing the ""yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
DARYL:
It is the way they do it.
"They go, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- That's exactly how they do it.
- WAYNE:
"No, they don't."
What they do is they find a super-high pitch for those first four yes's.
- Really?
- Sure did.
"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
"Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi."
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
"No, I told him to send you my regards."
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
"- Yeah, regards."
"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug."
"Oh, I hate smugness."
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
"Oh, my God, that man over there."
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex- boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Sir, sir?"
- Yeah.
"If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
"Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
Alex looks nervous.
"Oh, God, I hope I'm doing the right thing."
I think you are.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the party is about to get started."
The dance floor is all yours!
"Okay, girls, lick your lips."
Come in close.
It's good to see ya.
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.
Your husband's a lucky guy.
- Mmm.
- Oh!
- Waiter!
Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.
"Two more drinks when you get a chance, please."
That would be nice.
This looks delicious.
I'm so happy.
I can't believe he's married.
I can't believe he chose Claire over you.
- I can.
- I told you not to introduce them.
"Well, she already had a husband."
I thought it was safe.
- How are you handling all this?
- I've learned my lesson.
No more fantasies about good-looking men.
You never know.
There's a guy out there somewhere for you.
"Oh, yeah?"
Who?
"Hey, Allie, my girl."
"Oh, how are you, sweetie?"
"Daddy, this is Luke."
"- Hi, Luke."
"- So nice to meet you, sir."
- I've heard a lot about you.
- You too.
And this is my sister.
I'm Lucy.
Hi.
Is anybody hungry?
Is anybody hungry?
"Luke, something wrong with your dinner?"
"No, no, no."
"No, everything's great."
I will guard the bathroom.
Just eat.
So the doors are off because...?
"Long story short, a few years ago, I locked Allie in her room and tried to strangle her with a nightgown."
I totally get it.
"Uh, my brothers and I used to fight all the time."
- It's not like your brothers.
- You don't know my brothers.
"Ha, ha."
"So your sister tried to kill you, why?"
The smoke detectors told me to.
Why they didn't just tell you to bake muffins is anybody's guess.
Did the smoke detectors talk to you?
"Yeah, mostly, back then."
Ahem.
"Luke, did Allie even tell you that she had a sister?"
"Yeah, yeah, but just that you were in law school."
-ls the mission possible?
"- lfwe were given this mission, it is possible."
Do you understand what all this might end with?
"If everything is all right, I'll get the USSR Hero Star."
Posthumously.
"No, everything is all right, comrade mayor."
Everything is OK.
Everything is all right.
is the line from the Chapayev movie?
And I'm not good at singing.
Neither am I.
Join in.
-And I do not know any more lines.
- Neither do I.
Still go on singing.
Let's go overthe same line again.
"Marysya, sweetie!"
is it him?
"-Misha, is that you?"
"- Master, it is us, Grisha and Valera."
Bloody hell!
"Folks, you are wet to the bones!"
"Take this, warm up a little."
"Take, please."
-What about yourfriend?
- The friend can not afford this.
Why so?
"Everything is all right, auntie."
"Comrade captain, we are sorry."
"Please, do not get offended..."
But we will not untie you so far.
"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."
"Look, it's 14 to the right, then you go twice around to the left 'til you come to 22..."
And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?
"Those two bums, that fuckin' whore..."
They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?
"Hell, no..."
You kiddin' me?
"Hey, look, I swear."
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
Hold on!
"You gotta be kiddin', buddy, I got your message."
"This fuckin' guy's crazy, man."
Wait until I get that fuckin' Johnny and Tony...
I'm gonna cut them both off.
Somebody get me out of here!
Get me out!
[Mourning dove calling]
[Dog barking]
[Dog growling]
[Electric knife whirring]
[Dog whining]
[Coughing]
[Water running]
"Hey, wait-wait a minute..."
"No, no, what are you doin'?"
Are you crazy...
Don't do that!
Stop it!
"Jesus Christ, don't!"
"Please, please, don't do that."
There's been a breach in the sim room.
JEANINE:
Get me a remote feed.
I wanna see who the hell is in there.
"The cameras are down in the sector, too."
I'm sending guards there now.
Let's go.
Bring up every cell.
Now.
Show her.
Tori finally found a way to get 'em out safely.
EVELYN:
How many others?
Every last one.
Let's go.
SOLDIER:
"South corridor, 40 yards down."
Tris?
"Tris, come on, we gotta move."
"Tris, we have to move."
I can't.
I can't.
My mom died protecting whatever's inside of this.
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.
"Tris, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna get outta here."
I have to do this first.
"Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but you have to trust me, please."
"With my life, apparently."
MAN ON PA:
"All security teams, be advised, breach in..."
Do it.
MAX:
What a pleasure.
Good to see you.
"Good to see you, Bob."
"Dad, um, do you have a second?"
I want to talk to you about something.
Sure.
Please sit.
¶ not to let it go ¶
"You know, the contest that I won at boarding school..."
It was for drinking...
"Absinthe,"
And that was probably one of my-my tamer nights.
"The truth is I-I've had a pretty wild past,"
And I've been a part of more than one scandal.
"Serena, I don't care about any of that."
¶
I know.
I guess I was just...
Scared that...
"Once mom gets better,"
You...
You may not wanna stick around
If you knew the real me.
¶
"Honey, I want nothing more"
Than to be a part of all of your lives again.
I'm trying to figure out how big a role I can play
Without stepping on anybody's toes.
Yeah.
"You know, I love Rufus..."
But you're my dad.
He's not.
We had you in the top three for St Trinian's with Ricky from Kaiser Chiefs.
Did he do it in the end?
Yeah.
You weren't available.
LAUGHTER
Cheers(!
) That was a narrow miss.
Yeah.
What did you do before you became fabulous?
You were a beautician?
I was a beauty school dropout.
"Oh, lovely."
From Grease.
Now you're getting down to my level.
So that means you can look at people and make judgments.
Be very honest.
OK.
"Noel Fielding, Rob Brydon."
Two out there guys.
If you had to...
Give me a minute.
"If you had to pick, if you had to single out one for being a little bit styly..."
"Oh, I don't know."
It depends whether I like smart guys or Camden guys.
Suddenly there's a rivalry between us.
I like a bit of both.
Do you?
Oh...!
LAUGHTER
Did I?
"I wasn't, was I?"
I just didn't imagine I'd be having a threesome with Rob Brydon.
"Now, if somebody comes around your little sister and starts talking like that, you just gonna stand there and smile?"
No.
"You're gonna ask him to stop, which I did."
"And if they don't stop, what?"
You're not gonna do anything?
So are you saying you should not have apologized?
Not the way he's talking.
So that's a yes?
He didn't deserve an apology.
He deserved worse than what I gave him.
I should've messed him up worse.
"And with that latest salvo from Smash Williams, it appears the Dillon Panthers problems are far from over."
"Turn it off, will you, Crowley?"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Hubby's home.
"How was your day, darling?"
It was...
It was good.
It was good.
"I sold a car, so..."
What?
You did?
Out-freaking-standing!
"Oh, man!"
You did!
Whoa.
"So, what?"
"You're like, you're like a car salesman now."
You're like Willy Loman!
"Yeah, you a salesman, huh?"
Yeah.
I guess I am.
The new Brain Slave refuses to report!
Ain't nothing but a brain.
"As are we, Son."
And we do our job!
"You right, Daddy."
You right!
"Go on and fetch this Brain Slave, and kindly ask him to be on bug removal!"
Permanently!
"Customer, Daddy!"
Get my blue fright wig at once!
"Greet them with a smile, Son."
A hard plastic smile.
"We got a free dashboard cleaning, get the lint balls off your car, free tire shine!"
You'll get all that with a free brain removal.
Carl Brain:
"Moron, don't tell them!"
I meant to say car wash.
Now gas them!
Quickly!
"Look, I just came by to tell you that I've told the police about your little brain operation here."
"Yeah, and they didn't believe us."
"No, they didn't."
Then we shall call them and show them pictures!
"That's a good idea, Daddy."
It is a very good idea.
Where's Carl's brain?
I am Carl Brain.
"No, Carl's Brain."
I am Carl Brain.
"No, no, no."
"Different carl, okay?"
I am Carl Brain.
I will take this further if you wish.
"- It's over, as far as I'm concerned."
"- Are you sure, Mrs. Coyne?"
"Yes, Captain Dreyfuss, I'm sure."
"Oh, excuse me."
You didn't come back.
"The shore, The Far Rock."
I walk there every day.
"That's how I know, but... you must feel free to walk there."
"The lough, this place, it's for everyone."
"You have a young fella out there, Michael, you might want to..."
You're not welcome here.
Surely to God you know that.
"I just got posted, sir, all right?"
I'm due to depart for England real soon.
I just wanted one last drink with my pal here.
"Michael, let him in."
The lad's off to do his duty.
Go on.
One!
Noches!
"Hey, Noches!"
"Give me a hand to redd up, will you, Barney?"
Noches!
He went home a while ago.
- Mr. Coyne.
- Lieutenant.
"I'm, er, you know, I'm, er,"
"I'm really sorry for what happened, sir."
I-I didn't mean any harm.
"Go home while you're still ahead, son."
Good luck to you.
You didn't tell me about Amiri.
What's that got to do with it?
The difference between us is that I don't bug you.
Hide as much as you like.
"No, Dorona, the difference between us is that Ricky is crazy about you, God knows why."
"Amiri, on the other hand, just doesn't love me."
That's why he left.
"And yes, I'd love to be a surrogate mother for you if I could."
"Sure, sure."
"Look who's here, Elijah the Prophet."
Raziya says it's okay.
What?
You could have asked what my size is.
I asked Haziya.
You can come in it's a public place.
- Why did you come?
- To the sauna?
I'm cold.
To Paris.
Was it my brothers' idea?
- Then why?
- Because I love you.
- Those are just words.
"- True,"
- but they're kind words.
- For who?
- You're so beautiful.
"- Yeah, sure."
You're naked!
So what?
This is Europe.
Everyone goes in the sauna naked.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no, no."
That's all right.
Do we have an appointment?
"Actually, I wanted to make one."
It's about next semester.
"Uh, oh..."
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?
My head is swimming.
It's hot.
Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
With all that make-up?
"You don't wear any, do you?"
"I'd still look like me, only in color."
You're too smart for that.
"You're a confident, no-nonsense woman."
- I sound like an airline.
"- I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong."
"It's just that you don't need any of that, Rose."
Thanks.
How's your head?
- I think food will help you.
"- Pizza, maybe?"
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There's that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
It was a brand-new cigar.
You stay here.
"If you notice something odd, whistle."
Whistle?
Don't you get it?
I gotta get out of here!
- Shut up!
- I gotta get out!
- Who is that?
That isn't one of our cars!
- Another car!
Someone ratted us out!
- Seems to be the police.
- Police?
"Get out, rat!"
He's not gonna rat us out again.
- He has learned his lesson.
- I told you he's gonna cause trouble!
"What was that, Karl?"
"A big bump, even for such a bad road."
I can't see anything.
- Who is there?
- Just open up!
Took longer than usual.
Where is Franz?
- What is she doing here?
- She even wanted to call the cops.
You caused us a lot of trouble with your man Biberkopf.
- What happened to Franz?
- They snatched him.
Who?
That can't be true!
Don't hurt my daughter!
Let her go!
Deepa!
"Had you given the money, you would've saved a life."
"Trying to be a hero, are you?"
Go to hell!
"You moron, I'll kill you!"
If you even think of going to the police...
You will be inviting trouble for yourself.
Deepa.
Varun...
Varun...
Stop.
What happened?
Where were you?
What happened?
Every last piece of gold jewellery bought for the wedding is missing!
I called you N number of times.
Aunt told that you left the house this morning with a bag.
All the jewels are missing.
And you turn up like this now!
What happened?
Mom...
Deepa...
- Her again?
Why bring her up again?
What happened?
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.
He said Deepa was kidnapped and asked for my help.
So...
"So, I took the jewels to save her."
But everything went wrong.
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!
(MaIIefiiIIe) George!
"Not that one, monsieur!"
He's a devil!
By God!
"Goodbye, gone."
When do I start?
Let's go.
"- Listen, this isn't a great time for me right now."
- Oh.
"- I'm sorry, I apologize."
"- Oh, Iâm sorry, just give me ten minutes, though."
"Just give me ten minutes and then you won't have to see me again 'til tomorrow, at work."
Horace.
- You want an interview now?
"- Yes, please."
"I mean, that's what you said and I'm in a hurry."
I have popsicles in the car.
Popsicles melt.
And then it's juice.
"Who likes juice, Horace?"
Please?
"- Sure, have a seat, would you?"
- Thank you.
- Okay.
"Now, I know this job starts tomorrow, but Iâm gonna need next weekend off because Iâm gonna go to Chicago."
They're having a bit of a--
"Like, a little party thing that I want to go to."
And I like going to parties.
- In Chicago?
"- Yeah, in Chicago."
"The land of pizza, yes."
This is a nice place.
Do you have any termites?
Everything's wood.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
General Zavros has a point.
"Let's go, professor."
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.
Lord Cleeve is right.
We cannot afford to have you follow us.
"Oh, MacGyver!"
"Kelly, try to get this rope over your head."
Come on.
Ohhh!
Come on.
Oh!
You okay?
I can't believe Atticus would do that.
Oh.
"His passion, Cleeve's greed."
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I know you looked up to him.
Used to.
We did exactly what Cleeve wanted us to.
"Now he and Zavros are going to steal the Treasure of Atlantis, thanks to us."
Maybe not.
Cleeve's estate.
Let's find it.
Kind of looks like they're planning a trip.
We can't let them take off with the artifacts.
I know.
Wait here.
Just look at it.
Unlike anything the world has seen in thousands of years.
It is truly magnificent.
Probably the finest item I'll ever acquire.
"Union or no union, if you,re not ready, you,II pay!"
"- We,II see about that."
"- Yes, we will!"
"We,re not afraid of the minister."
"I,ve got a few things to tell him."
If you bother the minister with your problems -
This is the control room.
"hello, Schneider."
Did you drop something?
"This is Dr. GoIdberg, eminent psycho-futuroIogist, and his assistant, Mr. -"
Very interesting.
What happens here?
"That,s what we,re here to show you."
follow me.
This is our team.
"It,s an honor."
What is it?
"You're a Brahmin who's here to cook for Jai, right?"
But Jai is a non-vegetarian!
How will a Brahmin cook that?
That's between Jai and me.
Why must you interfere?
Okay.
I have something else to say.
What is it?
That's between Jai and me!
"I'll tell Jai, of course!"
"Atleast you tell me, Ratna."
"I will speak to Jai, too."
Okay.
Sit here and wait for Jai.
I'm off for a bath.
Higaki!
Careful not to get hurt.
The match will start in a short while.
We are currently preparing the court lightings.

All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
This can't be right.
"Sir, we have nuclear missiles spinning up on the Albuquerque."

Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill..

Father?
I don't understand.
you're...
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
xxx
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!
No one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this.
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not going to make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
"You... have to understand... that when I found her,"
I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.
"She was just lying there, helpless."
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl."
xxx
No.
No!
It's all right.
Take what you need.
I can't.
"Yes, you can."
"Oh, thank you, dear."
"Yes, I'll be right over."
Of course.
Goodbye.
What did you find out?
Cause of death?
Drowning.
Her lungs contained water.
But it's hard to tell.
"Cardiac risk occurred about the same time,"
Caused by electrocution.
Signs of struggle?
None.
"She was burned somewhat, but that's"
Consistent with electrocution.
Was it an accident?
"Well, I don't know yet."
"Just, uh, let me know if you find anything, Doc."
Anything at all.
"Well, there was something else."
Maybe not much.
There were a couple of hair in her hand.
Looked like animal hair.
Get those to the lab.
"And, Cliff, I want that report fast."
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
"Come on, Greta."
[Door creaks]
[Ominous voices echoing]
[Pet squeaking]
[Owl hooting]
"Oh,for crying out loud, I'm not gonna shoot you here."
"Besides,I need you."
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO TELL ME WHERE DOUG IS.
"OH,HERE."
YOUR CAR IS IN THE CAMPGROUND PARKING LOT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO RESOLVE OUR PROBLEM?
"WELL,I THINK OUR PROBLEMS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT,"
"BUT,YES, LET'S RESOLVE THEM."
"YOU KNOW,YOU AND I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL CONNECTION."
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHO I'M TALKING TO.
"OH,WE MET, IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING --"
ISTANBUL ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO.
"JULY,SEVEN YEARS AGO --"
YOU TOOK OUT THOSE TWO DIPLOMATS.
YES.
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU CAME TO CATCHING ME?
"NOW,THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE."
"AND EVER SINCE THEN, I'VE KEPT TABS ON YOU."
YOU MIGHT SAY I'VE BECOME A FAN.
I HEARD YOU GOT BURNED AND GOT THIS GIG IN MIAMI.
SO THE STARS JUST KIND OF LINED UP.
I LIKE THE NEW LOOK.
"AND YOUR BRUISE,IT HEALED."
"YEAH,WELL, THAT WAS TEMPORARY."
I'VE BEEN STUDYING UP ON YOU.
IT'S NOT EASY WITH SOMEONE AS SECRETIVE AS YOU ARE.
"BUT,OF COURSE,THINGS GOT A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU GOT BURNED."
YOU'RE NOT CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ANYMORE.
LUCKY YOU.
'CAUSE I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR EARLY YEARS.
"YOUR DADDY WAS MEAN,HMM?"
SO I FIGURED AN ABUSIVE HUSBAND
YOUR OFFICES JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL."
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
"A LITTLE OF THIS, A LITTLE OF THAT."
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN GETTING YOUR REPORTS FROM YOUR FBI BUDDIES?
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING THEY COULDN'T FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
"IF YOU TELL THEM,"
"THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES, DO THEY?"
"UH, I..."
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT TRAINED ME
IN THE DELICATE ART OF GIVING PEOPLE USELESS INFORMATION.
"I SAID NICE THINGS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH."
THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE A JOB FOR ME?
"A WOMAN I MET, EVELYN."
SHE HEARD I WORK SECURITY.
SHE ASKED ME FOR HELP.
I GUESS HER EX RAN OFF WITH THEIR SON.
"WE RAN CHECKS, CREDIT CARDS, AIRLINES, GOT NOTHING."
SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME LEGWORK.
BUT A JOB THAT SMALL -- NOT REALLY OUR THING.
YOU THOUGHT OF ME?
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A FAVOR IF YOU TOOK THE JOB.
AND THE MONEY'S NOT BAD.
MONEY'S NOT THE PRESSING ISSUE.
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
IDENTITY.
NOT FOR TRAVELING?
"MICHAEL, IF YOU LEAVE MIAMI,"
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT KIND OF THING.
All right.
He's the one I'll go after.
Wait a minute.
It's cold outside.
You'll freeze.
Here.
I'll lend you my fur.
Hasn't she prettied up the place?
"Wait till you see how gentle she is, and good as gold."
You have everything you need at the bar.
Enough about the bar!
Here she comes!
Hide and don't make a sound!
"Stop right there, Mieze."
You have to swear first.
Swear you won't look behind the curtains.
"""I swear..."" Come on!"
I swear.
"""I swear I won't look behind the curtains."""
- Fine.
- Good girl.
"You got me another present, didn't you?"
Don't buy me any more presents!
"Why not, sweetie?"
We have everything we need.
I have my dress.
You have your things.
Why do we need more things?
Because they're nice to have.
What is it?
Franzie...
I have something to say.
I just want to see what's going on with him.
You catch a vibe?
I've seen him at two different fire scenes.
"Chief, if we got a firebug here, you know it's next to impossible to prove anything."
Can you just spend some time with him?
See what we find out.
"Yo, Ernie."
Don't let Mills here make you do all the work.
He's what we call a candidate.
You know how there's all those rungs on the ladder?
He's the bottom one.
- Oh.
"- Come on, I'll give you a tour."
"Hey, heads up."
"Hey, what are you doing here on Thanksgiving?"
Reinforcements.
"[Alarm beeps, buzzes] Truck 81, ambulance 61."
Multiple gunshot wounds.
1542 Elmwood Park.
"Hey, would you put the turkey in?"
- Sure.
- Thank you.
This meal is very important.
"- Kid, you should stay--"
- Forget that.
Come on.
- Chief.
"- Yeah, I got him."
"Ernie, stand here."
"Let's go, let's go!"
[Engine starts]
[Engine starts]
"I'm not prying or anything, but as the manager, I should..."
What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."
Miyu.
What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
"I'm his wife, I have to be here!"
-We'll take care of Migs.
-His blood pressure?
"Just stay here, we'll take care of this."
We still can't be sure of the extent of the damage but he's still lucky he didn't get a fracture in the skull.
"-Doc, when is he waking up?"
-There's a lot of possible outcomes.
But I promise...
"Whatever happens to him, I'll still take care of him."
Is there anyone looking for me?
.
No one.
But I already found the man I love in the whole world.
How's Migs?
He hasn't waken up yet.
I'm sure he will wake up.
Aren't you going to visit again?
.
"You know, I'm not supposed to be there."
My son!
My son!
Brother!
Come here.
Come.
How are you feeling?
"Come, one more."
There's Joy.
Who are you?
.
I'm your wife.
I'm Joy.
I don't know her.
"I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy."
Heather!
Daddy does those things to Mommy.
Okay.
Yeah.
_
Yeah.
Lark just would not stop crying today.
- Yeah.
"- And 45 minutes later,"
I found out her shoe was on too tight.
How am I supposed to know that?
"I know, it's gonna be so much easier when she can talk."
"Like, we won't feel like we're, like, on a Japanese game show we don't know the rules to."
Hey.
- Is that Sam?
- Yeah.
"Hey, Sam, what's up?"
"Hey, Uncle Greg."
"Move, you're blocking the view."
"Oh, of what?"
"Oh, the security guard stuck against the wall on a Segway?"
"No, we're spying on my boyfriend."
You have a boyfriend?
Irving Rosenblatt... he's the coolest boy in the class.
He's been acting weird.
I'm not even sure if we're boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
He liked three of Lexie's pictures on Instagram.
"Oh, I hate her."
Unless you're Lexie.
"No, I'm Jenna."
Lexie's a monster.
"I mean, it's neutral."
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
So it could be whatever.
"It could be an office, it could be a guest room a gym, a baby's room..."
[LAUGHS]
"Wait, did you mean ""neutral,"" or ""gender-neutral""?"
- I don't know what you're talking about.
"- Oh, really?"
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.
BEN:
Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.
But I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.
[UP-TEMPOED MUSIC PLAYING]
JARRAD:
So that's the last time I do anything pro bono.
[GIGI LAUGHS]
"Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to the office."
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?
I met you.
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?
- Of course.
"- Oh, great."
Here is my info.
"- Nice to meet you, Janine."
- Nice to meet you.
"Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi."
"Oh, wait."
So how are we doing this?
"How you doing back there, Sam?"
"Not good, Mike."
We think he was out too long.
"Okay, clear."
Yeah.
"Come on, buddy."
"Come on, buddy!"
Clear.
"Come on, Schmidt!"
"Come on, man!"
Wake up!
Wake up!
Oh!
There we go!
There we go!
"He's back, Mike!"
We got it!
"J-j-Jabbar -- Jabbar, is he --"
Don't you worry about him.
We're wrapping his sorry ass up right now.
Was I -- was I dead?
!
You really want to know?
No.
"No, I'm good."
I'm good.
"But...just a little -- yeah, you were a little dead."
You were dead.
Counterintelligence usually starts as a subtle game of cat and mouse.
"Your adversary pretends not to be watching you, and you pretend not to notice, but the longer it goes on, the more inevitable it becomes that you'll end up in open warfare."
"Afternoon, Mrs. Westen."
Oh.
What?
"We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice."
You gotta be kidding me.
You start there where the road begins.
You finish down there where the road ends.
Holy shoot!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
How long is this gonna take?
"Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days."
Five days?
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!
"Then if I were you, I'd quit yapping' and start workin'!"
"- Hook him up, Mater."
- Okay-dokey.
Freedom!
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie and then...
then took the boot off.
Whoo-hoo!
"Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!"
"California, here I come!"
Yeah!
"Oh, feel that wind."
Yes!
No.
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Outta gas?
How can I be outta gas?
"Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are."
"But how did, how did... you...?"
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.
- Ka-chow.
"Hello, this is Kim Na Na."
What... me?
I'm qualified?
"Yes, thank you!"
"First of all, welcome to Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House)."
But...
"Don't assume that by coming into Cheong Wa Dae, (Note:"
Cheong Wa Dae
- Blue House) you can afford to slack off and relax.
You must give 100 percent and do your best.
Who are you?
How can a security officer be late on his first day of work?
Why are you dressed up like that?
I'm not a bodyguard.
"Then, who are you?"
They told me to come here.
Dr. Lee!
You're here.
This shameless person has a doctorate?
The National group of communication network is not here.
You have to go to the next building.
"Oh, it's the guy with a doctorate from MIT!"
MIT?
You are... 10 000 Won?
I'm right?
"So, you are a Blue House security guard."
No wonder you're so strong!
Do you know each other?
- Yes.
- No.
He has come a long way... he got his phd from MIT.
He has achieved a lot and he is only 28 years old!
- All right.
Come here.
All right.
"I'll allow this but if you start making strain noises,"
- we're breaking up.
- We should go.
- I'm sure she's fine.
- She should just move on.
She falls all the time.
What do I care?
What we need to be concerned about is getting that diamond back.
We need someone to kiss Trent.
- Can you do it?
For Candace?
- Oh no...
I'm not into that kind of thing.
"- Yep, that's Trent"
- I'll do it.
I don't like seeing you all torn up like this.
You know what?
You know what we could do to cheer you up?
Let's do that thing where we pretend to be an old couple that's been married for 50 years.
Come on.
"I'm coming for you, stud-muffin."
Hot wheels.
Almost there.
Sweetie...
This usually gets me going.
My heart's just not in it.
Guys.
The fight with Danny is killing him.
I know.
He's in a hospital in Miami.
"He had a stroke, but recovered okay."
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him.
That he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What?
Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
"Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia."
"Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods."
But you don't even send a dress to my house.
No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should show me some respect.
You should let me wet my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each.
- Goodbye.
- Hi!
What faces!
- We were worried.
Knowing you were around here alone...
The town's dangerous.
- It's not Iike milan.
- Not at all.
- Where were you?
- Around.
- Here?
- I was looking for a perfume shop.
"There aren't any here, there's a town store."
- The NannineIIa.
- It's not a perfume shop.
"- If you ask, what'II she say?"
"- ""No, not on yourIife."""
"What can you expect, we're in the South, right?"
"In CasteIIabate, right?"
"And I'm an idiot, right?"
"Darling, wearthis, they might shoot you."
Think she knows?
Get out of my sight.
I tried to tell you the truth so many times!
"- The alcohol, friends, mandolin?"
- What?
"It's true, cholera, threats, ""I sacrifice formy family."""
- I said what you wanted to hear.
- I don't get you.
"We've created a strange magic, it's been better since we separated."
"So, we'II continue being separated."
You have to forget about Chicco and me.
- I'll call you back in an hour.
Bye.
They belong together.
They've danced for the Pope.
What kind of music is that?
They brought it with them.
Who would want to listen to that?
The Pope?
How would I know?
"Man Viktor, I wanted a singer."
Ask them if they can sing.
Excuse me.
Do you have a song prepared?
"Singing, songs!"
What's this pop shit?
What's this one's name here?
-That's Angie.
"Angie, Bring me a soda."
That's going to take a little while...
"First, I have to finish up the glasses, boss."
We could forget about the girls and just do your uncle's quiz show.
Why can't she just bring me a soda when I order a soda.
She likes to do one thing after another.
"Listen Viktor, let me tell you something."
Even if the quiz show works out...
Which we have no idea about yet...
It will work out.
I want a number here with a singer.
High class!
Alright.
High... class!
I'll take care of it!
"Oh, God!"
Tasik!
- What is it?
"- Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong!"
- Roll out of here!
- Naturally.
"I have no other choice, but you're wrong."
"Why did you fall, Tasik?"
Now let's be serious.
Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house!
- We'll survive.
- Naturally.
"But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us!"
"- Step aside, please."
- What?
"- Step aside, please!"
- You're welcome.
Who needs you?
"Well, that's it..."
"Oh, damn it!"
"Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman."
I think your daughter...
Don't come near me!
I'm standing.
"She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter."
- Look...
- Don't touch me!
Ciao-miaow!
Let me through!
Hello?
"No, I didn't chase anyone."
Just turned my son-in-law out.
Sex with a minor was all they could get him on.
Why was that?
She wouldn't cooperate.
Said he was a genius and apparently that's what geniuses do.
I wouldn't know what geniuses do.
I'm just a dumb arse cop.
I know nothing about art.
"Sleep well, Mr Greene."
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
I hear you had a big win.
"Oh, for God's sake, Barney."
Alright!
He was a man that I met at the Adelaide conference.
He's English.
And he is now safely back in Devon with his wife and he will never ever come back here.
What's his name?
Does it matter now?
You don't know him and I'm never gonna see him again.
OK!
OK.
John.
Bartrop.
John Bartrop.
There.
You happy now?
Bleeding saints.
Recognise this?
Guido Reni.
In six months the streets would have made him ugly.
He would have died in a crack haze down some lane.
"I gave him that, his moment of absolute perfection."
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
"Ready, set, go!"
"Hi, Harvard."
Going to invite me to the big game?
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.
You've certainly improved with age.
Things must've been dull for you these past months.
You're right.
"Come on, let's take a walk."
What would your father say?
"Look, Betty, I don't care about that."
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.
"Let's grab some sandwiches, I've got a pint and go down to Crystal Pond."
"Hey, you can think for yourself once in a while, can't you?"
Okay.
"Hey, let's go get a hot dog or something."
- Okay.
- Good.
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.
Okay?
- See that.
- What?
"Allison and Norman on their way to Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves."
So what?
"They're young, happy, maybe in love."
What trouble can they get into?
!
"The same woman, twice, and she died both times, the same woman!"
"Doctor, what are you talking about?"
"Something's going on, something impossible, something..."
"Right, you two stay here, stay right here, don't move an inch."
Are you coming back?
Shouldn't think so!
But where are you going?
"To find her, to find Clara."
Ha-ha-ha!
But Clara's dead.
"What's he talking about, finding her?"
"I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains after all."
Where are you going?
Short cut.
Through there?
I hate this place!
Don't you think it's creepy?
"No, I don't believe in ghosts."
Clara!
Oswin!
Oswald!
Watch me run!
Ha-ha!
Miss me?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
I'm an alien from outer space.
"I'm 1,000 years old."
I've got two hearts.
And I can't fly a plane.
"You're running away with a space man in a box, anything could happen to you."
- No.
- Huh?
Are you goin' sick?
- No!
"What do you say we ""popeye"" down to the Chez and have a couple of drinks?"
- I'm beat.
I'm gonna go home.
- All right.
One drink.
- Drink this.
- Whip it out. [Laughs]

[Gasps]
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
"I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed."
"But, Dad, I..."
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
"Ariel, you know that!"
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
"Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling..."
"Daddy, I love him!"
[gasps]
No!
Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
"So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you."
"And if this is the only way, so be it!"
Daddy!
No!
No!
Please!
"Daddy, stop!"
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell... is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
There are no other customers.
Why do they keep adding up bills and cooking noodles?
Why would a small shop like this hire so many workers?
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
"Even if you're in GuangZhou, we still have to arrest you."
"Bounty hunters from both sides of the rivers, ZheJiang, SanXi, GanSu and Hubei, all join forces to capture us."
You want us to turn ourselves in without a fight?
Come and get me.
Watch out!
Think you can get us?
Fat chance!
Husband!
Husband... run.
Boss Wong!
Boss Wong!
- What?
- I'm here to collect the laundry money.
Come and get it.
I just sent him away.
He's such a coward.
Lucky I've not been bitten by that dog with rabies!
Big Mouth.
- Big Mouth.
"- Yes, Boss?"
What can I do for you?
Get Ah Seng to dress me.
Big Mouth.
Still memorizing your script?
Where were you last night?
What's with the make-up?
Hurry up!
Don't take advantage of my good nature!
No cameras.
It's the perfect spot.
"See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau, his daughter and heir. (WHISTLES)"
"Harry, wait."
I need more.
I just crossed a pretty scary line for you.
You owe me a proper explanation.
I owed Freddie Lau money.
Gambling debts from his casino.
But this has got nothing to do with me.
"I don't care how you get your kicks, Harry."
"But if I'm going to have your back,"
I need to know it's coming from the right place.
(BUZZER)
It's Harry.
(BUZZER)
"- Hello, Josie, is he in?"
- Mmm.
Harry's here.
JOSIE:
Napoleonic.
Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia.
Me and your brother fired them on the heath last night.
Half-brother.
Is this official or unofficial?
You better come in.
70 grand.
I need you to um... look after it for a while.
"Who does it belong to, Harry?"
- It was in transition.
- From you to...
A man who died this morning.
"I was little, but I was so angry."
That doesn't sound like you.
I've got to cram for my lit exam.
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.
"Don't you have, like, everything to sign up for?"
First day.
You got a lot to do.
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.
- Okay?
"The cafeteria, the office..."
- I'll...
I'll show him around.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- He's a pain in the ass.
- I'm standing right here.
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.
"So, it must be weird starting at a new school in the middle of the year."
Used to it.
We move around a lot.
Living in one place your whole life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
"So, yesterday, in the hall..."
Yeah.
Right.
I was wondering when you'd bring that up.
- You knew who I was?
- ‭Yeah.
And you chose to screw with me because...?
"It was more fun than ""Hey, I'm Eli."" ""Hey, I'm Emma."""
"You could use your influence, I'm sure."
"And of course, you'd know your secret would be safe with me..."
Servalan.
I'm sure it would.
But I don't submit to blackmail.
There's always a first time.
And it's better than being executed.
"After all, how many people have you killed to conceal your secret?"
You mean now?
Twenty-six... so far.
"You can't afford not to believe me, Avon."
- How the hell did she get off the Liberator?
- I don't know.
"Look, we both saw her."
It was Servalan.
You're just running away from the truth.
"All right, I believe you."
I didn't want her to die like that anyway.
I need... to kill her myself.
- Yablonski.
- Ho.
Hutchinson.
"Hey, Hutch, this is your lucky day."
They finally forwarded this from your old unit.
- I'd glad I got it before I go home.
- Horner.
"Klinger, Maxie."
Mulcahy.
Maxie?
Maxie.
Maxie.
Whose idea was it to run him off without a wedding?
Shut up!

"- Hey, Ponch."
Wake up.
- Why?
What are you doing?
Clocking a sparrow?
She's beautiful.
"Tall, tan, legs up to here."
You better keep your eyes on the car in front of you.
She wears these short shorts and little flip-flops.
And she's even got sexy feet.
Feet?
- How long you known her?
- She just moved into the trailer park.
I haven't met her yet.
Did you see what almost happened to me?
"It was only almost, Ponch."
I'm gonna give that bozo a piece of my mind.
And maybe more.
"What's wrong, officer?"
I was only going 45.
Maybe 50.
Okay.
"It's possible that I was going over a little more, but it's..."
- But...

"Watch and learn, little brother!"
I will use natural selection.

Instead I'll climb on his head.

Penguin.

"We become legend, Bill."
That something important!
How much longer?
It's close.
"Hey, you idiot!"
Are you the licks kelp!
I guess I was wrong I thought you were ... a cruel machine to kill.
Want to try a penguin?
"Back, Bill."
The animal will pick up!
He's a warrior!
"But soon, he will fall, he is seeing death in the face."
"Good morning, handsome."

It was a mistake.

"Fine, I'll kill your punk ass one more time!"
"Well, let's go, nigga!"

"There were at least 53 recordings of the incident, Mr. Freeman."
"Me, when I go to the movies, it's just for the music."
And I'm in love with the prettiest babe in the world.
"Me, I've never been in love."
I've only been sick.
What's the difference?
Me...
I was locked up in a mental hospital.
"I was yelling in the streets, because my father, see, was put in jail."
- Did they bang him up?
- Five years times two!
- As for my father:
One times even equals seven!
- My name's Léo!
"You're kidding, that's my name too!"
But my father was top dog... a King!
- Mine was only a Prince!
- Mine was old school:

All right.
"Then, go home!"
"In a minute, Grandma, as soon as he's had his coffee."
How does it look?
What would Marco say?
Mark would say he should go home as soon as he's had his coffee.
I'm sorry.
-Who's Mark?
-My fella.
He's coming home from Europe tomorrow.
"I mean, today."
"Rosa, why did you do this?"
Why did you bring me here?
What was your first idea on it?
That I thought you were pretty?
It looked as if they were gonna turn you into tomorrow's headlines.
I thought it might be messy for your wife.
It was awfully nice of you.
Shame on you!

But you're not worried about what Mrs. Bourne will say.
-Mrs.
Bourne will be very understanding.
It won an Oscar.
Rocky IV has Stallone in it... and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens.
"Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow."
Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.
- Girls can't fight.
They don't have muscles.
- It's true.
"Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say."
It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.
Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
- Can you pull trucks through snow?
- I absolutely could.
- You can barely walk in the snow.
- Excuse me.
Time out.
Is the truck parked in neutral?
- Hey!
"- What, dude?"
Empty your pockets.
- Now.
- Okay.
"Hey, let's just all stay calm."
Nice friends.
Maybe... one to two inches of snow?
- One to two inches...
- And a Ford F-150.
Right.
"In park, but no emergency brake."
Maybe I could pull it four feet.
- I'd give him four feet.
- I'd give him five.

"Ok, for starters, I have Jeffrey Anderton upstairs eyeing out my collection like it's a fucking yard sale."

That's not Alfred at all.
This gets better and better.

The day you die is just like every other day.
You wake and dress and eat and drink.

We don't talk to the priest.
Just between us.
Sometimes he says something.
But that's it.
But I'm not the priest.
No.
You're my father.
I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me.
Sometimes I'd like to slap you face!
No.
Better hit me with your belt!
Like Elena's father.
And who's Elena's father?
"A beast, who else."
"Well, let's calm down."
I'm calm.
I assume I was bad at you.
But you were too.
Me?
Why?
You never give up!
You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel.
If he were 15 you'd be so happy.
15 is a much more similar age for you.
That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15.
He seemed nice.
Normal.
Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult?
Then when there's someone older you guys lie?
And you lie to me?
Tell me.
You lie to me.
"No, they'll think I liked you."
"Thank you, sir."
Bloody silly place to die.
Captain Murray's dead.
Bury him.
"And what then, him?"
"We're lost, aren't we?"
So we'll be heading south towards Lisbon and home.
My orders are we continue north.
What for?
What are we doing up here anyhow?
"Did you ask Major Dunnett or Captain Murray to explain their orders, Harper?"
No.
"But with all due respect, Captain Murray and Major Dunnett were proper officers."
"Now they're dead, there's no shame in going home."
We go north at dawn to Casa Antigua.
"Carry on, Harper."
We've been having a chat.
We?
Me and the lads.
And?
We're not continuing north.
We want to go south.
MEN Aye
- What the hell do I care what you want?
Eh?
who the hell do you think you are Harper?
Do you think the British army is a bloody d-d...?
"Democracy, sir."
Comes from the Greek word demos.
It means...
"Shut up, Harris!"
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise your arms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise your arms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we never forget to smile.
A big round of applause.
Are you taking care of yourself?
Are you eating properly?
"Yeah, yeah."
I don't believe you.
Your voice tells me otherwise.
"Oh, stop!"
You're not my mother.
I am also not your girlfriend anymore.

Something I found in Chuck's room.
Well then I bet it's good.
Are you dressing for someone?
Yes.
Someone I hope is finally ready to love me
The way Cyrus loves you.
Cyrus told me.
You told Chuck how you felt and...
He ran away.
You seeing him tonight?
Yes.
Don't let him get away again
Oh..
Hey..drunky.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Dan.
You're here.
There's something I have to tell you
And it's only because I'm drunk
And I'll probably never see you again.
I um....
Oh God.
I have to go.
Done.
What?
Let me do that.
Allright
You're helping out here?
No gentlemen around?
"No, there aren't any."
"Well then, another beer."
Cheers!
Who is Cilly sitting with?
Maybe some truckdriver.
She's into that type.
That's Biberkopf.
I've known him for a while.
Just released from prison. 4 years.
Why?
"Ida, his wife."
He killed her during a binge.
Not too bad.
"Done eating and drinking, she wanders off."
What's he doing here?
Do I owe you something?
You'd better not bother me.
You were in Tegel!
"- Yes, but that's over."
- You're a tough guy.
I'll start my own business:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders"
You're not gonna earn anything with that.
The main thing is that one lives his life decently.
Isn't that right or am i correct?
- What's your name?
Mountain range!
Professor!
I am occupied.
"But, it is urgent."
"Cicchirini, Go to the devil, I am occupied."
The tele...
I do not grant interviews.
"Professor, get away from the tele, they can all see you."
They see that I. I am the greater surgeon of the world.
Professor is tele of closed circuit.
No!
The great surgeon has been deceived.
-All ready ones?
We are going to do a serenade to him.
-I will sing in Do.
-All On guard.
You in Re.
I in Do and you in Re.
"Attention. 1, 2 and 3."
"Mountain range, mountain range."
The Professor wanted the mountain range.
Cicchirini cut the roll to him.
And tomorrow we will see him by tele.
"Eh, beautiful."
Italia.
Viva Italia!
Now they are going away to find out.
"Mountain range, mountain range."
The Professor wanted the mountain range.
Cicchirini cut the roll to him.
And tomorrow we will see him by tele.
-She throws water on Us.
I'm not wearing pants.
Told you!
Nina told me why she dumped me.
She said I was too needy.
Am I too needy?
Tell me!
I need to know!
"Fez, I'm sorry, man."
You're the definition of needy.
"Remember, one time, you called me at 3:00 in the morning... just to make sure we were still friends?"
"Look, if you wanna get Nina back, you gotta act like you don't care."
- But I don't know how to do that.
"- Well, we can help you."
Oh!
We'll rebuild you like the Six Million Dollar Man!
Fez One to Control.
We have liftoff.
All systems are go.
Proceed to eat candy.
- [Klaxon Blaring]
- Uh-oh.
Emergency!
Emergency!
We are breaking up.
"I repeat, Nina and I are breaking up."
"[Kelso's Voice] Fez, a teenager, a boy with needs."
"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him."
We have the technology.
[Hyde's Voice] We can make him more appealing to Nina by making him less needy.
[Grunting]
"We can make him cooler, suaver, aloofer."
"""Aloofer""?"
Ah-ha!
Just the man I'm looking for.
Wow.
"Look, a spot just opened up in the lawn dart game"
- In the park.
"- Oh, that is great news!"
"Is what I would say if I could go, but I can't."
What?
"No, we've been waiting for months for this spot!"
You don't think I know that?
I'm the one that put us on that waiting list.
But I can't go because
I've got to wait here for the police to come and arrest me.
Right...
"Well, good luck with that, Baberella."
"Oh, do you want to be on the visitor's list"
In the unlikely event they allow me one?
"- No, I'll just wait for you on the outside."
- OK.
No.
[ Baber sighs. ]
- Hello!
- Oh!
"Hi, sweetie!"
Hi!
Oh!
Uh-oh!
"Cooking turkey bacon again, the gateway meat."
"Well now, some would call it the gateway to heaven!"
"Not Muslims of course, just people who like bacon."
Are you OK?
You seem a little tense.
"Skipper, I would like to look after my casualties."
Sure.
Come on.
KIRBY:
What's the situation?
COLEMAN:
He's all right.
MEDIC:
"More painful than serious, sir."
"Colonel, I want you to meet the camp commander."
- Oh!
- Dai Uy Nim.
KIRBY:
"Stay where you are, Dai Uy."
Tran Nim.
I've read your name on many reports.
You're very active.
"We try, sir."
"Meet your new counterpart, Captain MacDaniel."
Welcome.
We will have a good post here when it is finished.
MacDANIEL:
"I've no doubt, Dai Uy."
Your outfit looks pretty beat up.
- Eleven days is a long patrol.
- We're short of men.
We've got everything we need except strikers.
What seems to be the trouble?
"The natives have been so exploited, they won't trust anyone with a gun."
Same old story.
How many villages are there in the vicinity?
We've got 7.
Will all the competitors please assemble before the foating platform... for the dotting ofthe dragon's eye.
"It's our pleasure to welcome... the president ofTung Yuan Financial Corp., Mr. Tony Weng... the chairman of Rotary Club, Mr. Peter Chu..."
Cover him up.
Keep everything under control.
Red alert!
red alert!
Tony Weng's been shot on the foating platform.
The shot came from around the fishingjunks.
The killer is probably nearby.
All units!
Prepare to seal offthe area.
Mr. Weng fainted.
Everything's fine.
Please enjoy your day.
Chang!
"Chang, look over there!"
An explosion!
Let's check it out
"Chang, we can't lose him now!"
Freeze!
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.
Don't cry.
- He's down there!
Step on it!
- Okay.
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?
He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
Go down the hall.
What happened?
Turn over the money I only took in this much all day!
How can I?
So what!
?
"Come on, come on"
Turn over the money
Bring it here!
"I've paid the fee everyday, Master"
But business was bad today
Please be patient!
Don't think you can put it off!
Stop!
You bastards
You drink the people's blood!
Let's see how fast you can kill me!
Beat him!
You bully as too much!
"Well, go teach them a lesson!"
Okay!
Use this
Okay
What are you doing?
Let us borrow this for a minute!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Go after you've paid the fees!
Fees?
What fees?
I don't have any money!
"I have a life, though!"
That's enough!
I'll see how hard your bones are!
What are you looking for?
- Death?
- That's funny.
That's all the Death Zone offers your people.
I'm looking for a man.
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!
You know it.
I saw how he buried you alive.
For him you are dead now.
It will not give you more trouble.
I stole something.
Something very special.
What?
My daughter.
Is the child yours?
- Little?
- Yeah.
But I thought she was one of them.
Can you take me with her?
"Dangerous, she is protected."
"Please, Atka."
My life is nothing without it.
"Quannik thought, that the time of red blood soon ends."
Soon comes the time of black blood.
He lives for 143 years.
Many of his visions came true.
He said there will be no cure for black blood.
Ash is nearby.
I can feel his presence.
Its smell is lifeless.
Your path does not make sense.
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle but a dangerous joke.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all dangerous jokes."
Do me a favor and don't write them off just yet.
I said they were dangerous.
Wonder what Vinnie's doing in a place like this?
Wonder what we're doing in a place like this.
- This is it.
- Where's our boy?
- I don't know.
- Think Vinnie had a change of heart?
"If he's a Zapatti, he has no heart."
- Let's go.
- Don't turn around.
"Marybeth, right?"
Who's this?
He's the deputy mayor.
Deputy mayor?
"What do I need you for, then?"

"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.

"I know, right?"
"All right, boys."

- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.

One.
"Two, three."
"You guys are awesome, man!"
That's not even necessary.
- Would you please--
"- Oh, my dick!"
My dick cost a late-night fee

But she's not a student.
It's impossible.
She applied for permission.

She'II play lacrosse.

It's quite an interesting sport.
"Hey, Minmin."

"With me, you don't have to practice martial arts."
Now I want to play!
Who's he?
Does it matter?
How's my lipstick?
Perfect!
Let him apply for the coach post.
The flat's yours.
You are the one who pays the rent.
Anyway I'm going to Manchester tomorrow.
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
This is a success then?
It's success.
I'm glad.
You know the first time I painted you outside the steelworks?
Maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away.
Oh!
I don't know Ellis.
Maybe you shouldn't have made me so bloody small.

See.
He's back to save his brother.
A little longer and... his brother would've been crippled like his father.
Speak up.
What's your answer?
He abused you father.
Satyakant.
Better teach your son... before teaching Dharam kunj.
Start teaching about right and wrong at home.
Look.
Look how cruelly he's been beaten up.
Only a thug or goon can beat someone like this.
You seem to know a lot about goons.
What do you want to say?
Am I a goon?
Your son's action justifies that.
Surya!
Forth first time...
I hit someone.
That too my son.
You will never hit anyone again.
I... apologise...
On behalf of my son.
Let's go!
This boy has humiliated Satyakant's honor.
I'll handle him.
Satyakant!
Satyakant!
Brother.
Shiv.
He abused father.
I can endure anything in life.
"Look, I said I was out."
"I know, I know."
I respect your decision.
This is for Morgan.
He was your patient.
He talk about medieval torture?
In disturbing detail.
Big weirdo.
"Well, see ya."
"Annie, wait."
You just said you respected my decision.
It's not about that.
I have a favor to ask you.
A favor for you is like the kiss of death.
"I need you to go to this address and babysit on this guy for the day, make sure he stays sober."
- Not interested.
- I'll pay you.
"Look, I know I'm an asshole."
And I've been reckless... but everything I've done was to try to protect us.
"And I can fix this, but I need your help."
Who is he?
He's a friend.
$50 an hour.
"You really will be a millionaire one day, Annie."
I know.
"Hey,"
I bet this is one of them self-melting driveways.
Yeah.
I bet you should've been a football player.
Yeah.

Why are you crawling?

--A puddle.
Need to check its depth.
Give me the steering wheel!
Step on it.
We'll cross it by accelerating
"I tell you like an ex-tank driver, step on it hard."
There we are.
I didn't get a chance to buy insurance on it.

Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
"Hey, my son"
"Here you are, sir!"
We are looking for of Bulent Tiryakia!Where do we find him

He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.

"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."

"And i can't live in fear, Lan."

My Higgs radiation simulation.
Matt:
"The ""God"" particle."
Amy:
It's a particle that we're trying to make in the collider.
Amy:
"I'm supposed to be investigating how it acts on living tissue, but my programme just crashes every single time that it starts to look bad."
Connor:
"So what, you think Higgs radiation is dangerous?"
Amy:
I don't know.
I'd know if I could get it to finish!
Connor:
They wouldn't run the LHC if they thought it was a danger.
Connor:
Must be a glitch or something.
Connor:
Have you tried on the central computer system?
James:
Except... she doesn't have access to the mainframe.
Kate:
Are you not allowed to use it?
Connor:
Well... not exactly.
(Typing on keyboard)
Connor:
There we go.
James:
Nice!
(Alarm sounds)
Matt:
Nice one Amy!
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
"And yes, the light switch is at the back."
Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.
They were four.Selim...
"Son of the Yaşarans', Selim."
Shut up.Don't mention their names.
They are very powerful people.They'll get out of jail in two days... ... and come back to do you even more harm.You hear me?
They were all at the engagement party.
I've given their punishment.
I've punished them.I'll tell you everything once we're out of here.
Please Fatmagül.Okay sweetie?
- Who is it?- It's me.
- Where have you been?- I'm back.
Making me wait here for hours.Locked in this room.
Kendin geziyorsun tabi maaşallah.
Do you have to brush me downas soon as I'm back?
I was busy with work and stuff.It's not like I'm late on purpose.
You don't carewhat this woman is doing with no money.
I didn't even eat anything.
"- Okay, okay."
"I'll order something now.- You're very generous, thank you."
"Hey, okayI am sorry."
"I said sorry, girl."
"Okay, I've acted like a jackass.I'm sorry."
"Okay, I won't be late next time."
Mukaddes you're prolonging this.
Look at me.
Look.
Smile.
As if I could smile right now...
"Anyway, I shall go wash my face."
"And then we go and eat, okay?"
"- So, did you go to the doctor?- Tsk."
[No]
"I went to the nursery school, to see my son."
"Gil Dong, the soldiers are coming!"
"Run, quickly!"
I told you not to look for me!
There's no time!
"I'll try to divert the soldiers, so you run that way!"
You!
Are you going to die in my stead?
Why would I die?
Do you know how fast I am? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm faster than you and faster than arrows!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
So run away!
How can you be faster than arrows? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I don't hear anything now.
Do you think they're far from here?
I can't see.
Move your hand...!
Who are you?
Do you know me?
Hey!
Hey!
Chungyi ran away!
I know.
She's safe.
But we have a problem.
Why are you running away?
Hey!
That's... that's Doe Eyes!
We can't be seen by her.
We have to go!
Where did he go?
Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Are you in here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Why did you just leave like that?
Who are you? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why did you help me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- She wasn't that bad.
- What?
Telling the only cool boy in Eastbourne I have flatulence issues is okay?
I don't think he took any notice.
"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much
- when he gave me the onions?
- He didn't!
He is so gorgeous!
They're both beyond the Valley of the Gorgeous.
"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."
- Fabbity fab?
- With knobs on.
And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.
HENRY.

The first thing I wanna do is I wanna hear this class the greatest class to ever graduate the University of Rochester the class of 2012.
Let's hit it!
This is your day to take stock and congratulate yourselves.
"You have successfully completed one of the major steps in life's long journey, and you've done it at one of the outstanding educational institutions in the world."
"Over 50 years ago, I sat before you, the class of 1958."
"Since I've put my 50 years in, it's time for a little bit advice."
Exercise your passion.
Seek out what turns you on.
Find something where you really enjoy what you do every morning.
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
- How much?
10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.
- I am already carrying two bags.
Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!
- What is it?
Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.
"Jamie, let me go."
"Jamie, he needs help."
- Jamie!
- Bonnie!
Bonnie!
What the...
These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
"I beg your pardon, but when is today?"
I don't care about today!
It's boring!
Every day - it is today.
How do we cope with that?
Can it be that one day Time will stop and we will say:
Yesterday is every morning.
Life is awfully boring.
"Life is awfully boring, Yesterday is every morning."
"Let tomorrow come today, It is where we hurry."
"Let the future come our way, - Then we wouldn't worry."
Don't you see that everything around belongs tomorrow?
Don't you feel the future has already come?
"lf the future had come, now it would have been... the New Year!"
The New Year?
The New Year?
Let it be the New Year!
"What, what New Year?"
The New Year doesn't come just like that.
You have to see it in.
Then let's!
"Let's, let's see it in!"
Let's!
"I'd say, why don't we really see it in?"
"It is so pleasant, my friends, to see in the New Year."
Very pleasant.
How?
How?
How shall we see it in?
"To see in the New Year, we need, first of all, a Christmas tree."
"Secondly, Santa Claus."
"And, last but not least, the Snow Maiden."
Some illness it's hard to put your finger on.
It's now every night!
"I know he's not working, I know he's not"
She thinks I'm driving you away.
She's a child!
How do you kill someone with voodoo?
"I put his hair inside the wax coffin, buried it in the graveyard."
That's ridiculous!
You wanna raise the dead?
But you can't kill people with voodoo. sometimes a soldier falls on his own sword.
You speak to my wife again and I will kill you.
Oh my god!
No!
Daddy!
Bad girl
I failed him. no!
"Milk, water, and dates"
"Allah akbar Allah Akbar, I can't hear pass them water"

"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
But you have to keep it a secret and return it at the end of the year.
All right.
So now you know.
Good luck.

[ Chuckles ]
Right.
I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.
"I mean, uh, music is so expressive."
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.

"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
"I don""t know where the gold is! sardar, you don""t know."
But kaka sir surely knows.
"Am I right, kaka sir?"
"Won""t you serve your country?"
"Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! kaka sir.. where is shekhar?"
"- I don""t know! kaka sir, don""t fool us!"
Where is the culprit?
"I think you don""t know that the government will reward.. ..the person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. kaka sir, constable is right."
We give you 10 minutes to think.
You can think.
We are waiting for you outside.
"Let""s go, Mr. Diwan!"
Listen..
Bhuta singh.. the police is right.
- Then?
This is the golden chance to serve our country.
You are so lucky.
- How?
Go with the police and get shekhar arrested.
And get myself killed! - shut up!
I will give the address.
You can serve your country.
Fine. send Ms. kitty in.
Did you call me?
"No, Ms. kitty."
Your good luck has called you.
- What?
The police are waiting for you outside.
- Police?
The police know that you are hiding here.
"Now I can""t hide you here for long."
There is only one way left for your escape.
So thank you for that.
"We can take one or two questions, but remembering we've got the forum."
Any questions?
We'll save it 'til then.
Great.
"- Esra, I've heard you're replacing Luciel  by taking care of Mrs. van de Berg."
- Yeah.
- I know some of you don't think it's such a good idea  but this is what Sander and I decided.
"I promise you, I won't be in your way."
- Hidde is doing well.
"Corien, thank you for acting  so determinedly."
It was hardly a pleasant situation.
"Let's see, to wrap things up..."
"Oemaima, you're off to see Esmee and her baby."
Please don't start any arguments this time.
- I don't start arguments.
- Oh well great.
Then I'm done nagging.
Get to work everybody.
- Wait.
Wait.
No motto for today?
- Yeah of course.
"Take care of other, but mostly of yourself."
- Ah beautiful!

So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life
[dramatic music playing]
-(reporter) The carnage continues today as yet another body was found.
This will be the tenth victim of the mysterious Kool-Aid Killer.
"-(announcer) For years, he's waited in the shadows, forgotten."
-There's a madman loose and he's killing people.
-This is his calling card.
-He feels forgotten and he's sending a message by killing everyone that doesn't drink Kool-Aid.
-So he's basically killing everyone above the age of five.
-I hate my life.
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
-(announcer) This summer... get ready... the rivers are gonna run red.
[crash!]
-Ah!
-Oh yeah!
"[muffled yelling, explosion]"
-Knife to meet ya.
-[muffled noises]
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
Can I axe you a question?
-Ah!
-Go!
"Go, he's gaining on us!"
Step on it!
[crash!]
"-I'll teach you to make fun of me, Dane Cook."
Heads up!
-Ah!
I sure know that.
I would like to ask you something.
But tell the truth.
The whole truth.
What did you use before this performance?
"Rolls with meat pie,... and green tea."
Some meat pies are good dopes.
"All right, where's the talent?"
She has something strange...
"I don't think you had to use something, you're just that kind of type."
"You have no extreme talent, but you enjoy the singing, and I wanted to see it to the end."
A lot of energy comes out of her!
- Certainly!
"- It's strange, Paľo."
Yes for me!
- Strange.
- I felt good.
Something painful.
Mournful.
The singing grobian here just wants some notes...
Galee mein maarey pherey He walks around in the street

Do you want to lose your life?

"lf you spilled out everything, then you will lose your life!"
No!

Patriotism and business are not linked with each other!
Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!
That day will never arrive! shoot him!
"lf you want to save the child""s life.. then drop the revolver."

Leave him!
Leave him!
No!
"I won""t let this happen!"
Did Jamie take care of him?
He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
"Well, you should try again."
What did you do to me?
You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?!
"She'll be fine, too."
"Bonnie, listen to me."
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why?
"Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself."
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
"Bonnie, please."
I've almost got it.
Abby hasn't called yet.
"Jamie, please, just let us go."
No!
"Please, don't do anything."
"Look, I don't know why I shot him."
"I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything,"
I'm going to shoot him again.
"Ok, I won't."
Who gave you that gun?
Quick! we need to make a sign.../get their attention not tath sign/not like that!
"I know, I need to fire the flare gun I was saving here it is"
"-Dad, you hit the plane.  -what? and I didn't even aim!"
"If I aim, I hit. something hit Ludoviquito on the head"
"-is anything wrong?/is anything broken? -no, fortunately (Little Ludovic's) Ludoviquito's head broke its fall"
"- It looks like a radio, no? -well...."
"-ow, ouch. -oh son, not so loud we can't hear a thing. which song can I play for you?"
"-The one by Sepito -No, no."
Ask for help stupid
Do you have the one called 'help stupid'?
"-No, no."
Ask to be rescued!
"No, I don't want to leave."
"Don't get me wrong Federica, but nothing could make me go back to the City Peluche, never ever..."

Hello?
Anyone?
SOS?
"-SOS, or whoever."
-Speaking...
I'll put some clothes on.
So you are the Major?
I was the Major.
I guess to some I still am.
"Now, Terry here was my right-hand man back in the glory days."
"That was a long time ago, mate."
Why'd you get out of it?
I was a crazy bastard back then.
Yes I'm
I just want to be a boxer first
I'm so sorry
"Hey, fella."
I think you can help.
Coem with me
How'd you like to go to a movie premiere?
I'm hurt
[Light music]
Here I go out to sea again.
Sunshine fills my head and dreams hang in the air.
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes you know it feels unfair.
There's magic everywhere.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to hide and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
The sun's in your eyes.
The heat is in your hair.
They seem to hate you because you're there.
"And I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy."
Not stand here on my own.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in the sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
[saxophone]
"I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy, not so alone."
"In case she's changed her name, you can identify her with the red mole."
There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...
Baek Eun Jo.
How could you talk to your life saver like that??
That's alright.
It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
"In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways."
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
"See, I told you."
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.
Again?
You came?
"Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that..."
"Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?"
"Eun Jo, are you okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
How is Eun Jo?
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.
True.
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Oh Ki Dong."
It's a relief that everything is fine.
How is the building of your house coming along?
Is it doing alright?
"You know, it's a major pain."
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
"It'll all go well, I guess."
"What has happened, Kishan?"
What has happened?
"Will he survive, Mr. Shashtri?"
Doctor said the next 24 hours are critical.
No!
"- Child, I'm a manager of this guest house cum temple."
I've witnessed any tough wishes getting fulfilled.
If your love is true... ...Goddess will have to favour you.
This is a true lover's oath to the Goddess... ...until my Kishan regains conscience... ...I'll not wear these bangles.
But my child. how did this happen?
He's a police officer.
Goons killed tow of our men.
And we've no clue about the rest of the four.
Wonder where they would be.
You very well know where Jackie is.
Where's Jackie?
Where's Jackie?
Tell us Jackie's whereabouts and we'll release you.
Tell us.
Tell us where's Jackie?
Radha!
Kishan!
Kishan!
"Goddess heard my prayer, Kishan!"
You are alright.
You are alright.
You are alright.
"At least now drink some water, my child."
"Thank you, Goddess."
"Sir, Jackie's two men are killed."
And four are jailed.
"Still, you couldn't bring my daughter."
Could she have gone there for another reason?
Why do you always think aboutthe worst and ugliest possibilities?
"- Abla, you are being over optimistic.- Come on, please."
Don't we all know Meltem?
What are you talking about Hilmiye...
"Tell me, didn't we know our own kids?"
Nothing surprises me anymore.
- Nothing...- Selim will be devastated if he learns about it.
- Don't tell him anything about it.- Of course we can't say such a thing to him.
Shall we change the music?
"- It's my turn now.- Floor is yours, abi."
"- Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?- She's there."
Thank you.
"Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?"
Give me it.
- From him?- Give me that.
What is it?
"Abla, give it to me."
"""I'll send you my best wishes."
"At exactly 10 p.m."""
"""All together, to many happy years."
"Mustafa."""
"- God damn it, God damn it!- What is it?"
"Hurray, hurray!Dad look!"
It's amazing!
"Kerim Abi, is this your present then?"
Hey stop!Stop!
Fatmagül.
Don't cry.
My birthday has been ruined as well.
Is this how it's gonna be?Will my happiness always be left unfinished?
"Don't let it demoralize you, Fatmagül."
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
I can't control it
"My heart is broken,heart  I can't bring my mind together"
Boy I'm falling  in love with U U

Two three!
We are SlSTAR~
I didn't know we had so much fans
A lot of you came
We are back with our  2nd regular album after a year
You know that we don't have any ballad songs
There is one ballad song  in this album
We have an amazing  song
For that song...
She wrote the lyrics  of that song
We have that song.
Which one is it?
Correct answer
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None
None
You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
- So?
I didn't realise whether it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood for betel leaf today.
"Father, money?"
I gave you 10 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to friend?
On what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the money in 24 hours.. ..then I will recover the money by selling you off?
"But father, who will purchase me?"
Quiet.
Get out.
You fool.
Who are you?
10 rupees.
And 50 paise interest.
But how can I take this?
I can't accept this?
- Keep it.
Everything I own belongs to you as well as me.
"No, no, no, no, no.."
"You shouldn't touch my feet, da.."
Kishen.
I suggest you accompany me to my restaurant.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.
"Well, again, Tilda Swinton."
Thank you so much for doing this.
It's really a treat.
"We'll get into your career in a moment, but first I'd just"
like to ask you about the name Tilda.
It's Pretty unusual.
How did your parents choose that name?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It's a funny story, really."
Most people do think it is short for Mathilda.
"Actually, it is, it is long for Ilda."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, that's counter intuitive."
So your parents just named you Ilda?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"No, no."
I chose it for myself on my second solstice.
Mommy and poppy never gave me a name.
"Not that they didn't love me, but woodland cattle can't speak."
Most people know this.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
"So tell me, Tilda, when did you know that you wanted to be an actress?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I am not an actress.
That's a pretend name for a job that does not exist.
I am a gardener of art.
I grow it.
I pluck it.
I eat it.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Then let's set aside acting for a moment.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
You cannot claim insurance in such cases.
Because these are natural calamities.
But I don't believe in God.
Tell him.
I don't care if you do or don't.
You're signatures are right here.
I am so sorry.
Sorry?
What sorry?
Sir.
"Sir, I've invested my entire earnings in the shop."
Even my house is mortgaged.
And you're saying sorry.
"I know, but your claim cannot be approved."
You may go now.
"No, sir."
I won't leave until my claim isn't approved.
Security.
Sir..
"Sir, why are you calling security?"
I'm talking to you decently.
"- Yes, sir."
"Take him away, please."
- Why call the security..
Come on.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Come on.
You just know how to swindle our money.
Mind your language.
You should be publicly beaten.
Throw him out.
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
This is the improved version of flamingo.
If you insert money here...
-How is it?
Do you want a glass?
-I'm all right.
I got rid of three lions today.
"Wow, I caught a leopard and two hippos."
"Everything you need for safari, from guns to clothes, you can borrow here."
There are different classes; Class A gets a jeep and two assistant robots.
"Class B only gets a jeep, and Class C gets one assistant robot."
This is just beyond my imagination.
"Thank you for inviting, but I'm leaving now."
"Wait, I called you because I wanted to ask you a favor."
Please come here.
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I see.
He thinks I'm his mom.
Watch out!
"One, two, three."
This was a robot as well.
Hey!
Come out now.
It's not scary anymore.
"Look, bad snakes are..."
Hold on!
I can't leave you alone since it's so dangerous around here.
"We robots are also friends with animals, as well as with humans."
All right.
"Since it's hard to call you, I'm going to name you Pura."
Pura.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
You're really smart?
Are all those people with you well?
Of course!
I didn't even get a chance to greet them properly.
"Yes, we were preoccupied too because of Gil Dong...!"
Damn it!
I know Gil Dong is dead.
"Yes, we heard the news too."
- Were you alright when you heard?
- Of course.
The living must keep on living.
"That's good, Doe Eyes."
You've forgotten him already.
What are you doing?
Still peddling medicine?
"No, my grandfather sells the medicine."
I work for Yongmun.
Yongmun?
"I'm really close to the Young Master, and somehow I ended up working for them."
"By Young Master, you mean that fellow that is slightly better-looking than me?"
"That's right, the good-looking Young Master."
He must be really nice to you.
"I'm not that dumb, you know."
But I think the Young Master is in love with me.
He must have bought her another chamber pot.
"The other day, he embraced me!"
- So how did you feel?
- Me?
I...
I just...
Why are you asking me that?
Just drink.
"1128 01:35:51,860 --&amp;gt; 01:35:53,971 I'm not everyone, Ender."
"1129 01:35:54,100 --&amp;gt; 01:35:58,500 I'm your husband."
"1130 01:35:58,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:01,800 You shouldn't hide it from me."
"1131 01:36:03,834 --&amp;gt; 01:36:08,559 Are you aware in which state did you put, to protect Faruk."
"1132 01:36:08,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:12,800 Calm down, please. -..."
You didn't even deign to tell me
"1133 01:36:13,882 --&amp;gt; 01:36:17,550 Please!"
"1134 01:36:18,754 --&amp;gt; 01:36:21,352 My wife and I are talking privately."
"1135 01:36:22,273 --&amp;gt; 01:36:24,230 Of course."
"1136 01:36:41,111 --&amp;gt; 01:36:43,989 - Did you see my mom?"
- Today it's my day.
"1137 01:36:44,054 --&amp;gt; 01:36:46,362 Can you imagine?"
Eylül kissed me.
"1138 01:36:47,300 --&amp;gt; 01:36:50,400 - Mert, where are you?"
- I'm coming.
"1139 01:36:50,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:54,600 I don't care about the name, She wants me."
"1140 01:36:59,755 --&amp;gt; 01:37:01,808 Mom?!"
"1141 01:37:05,400 --&amp;gt; 01:37:10,400 ~Neither the wedding attaches us nor the court separates us ~ 1142 01:37:10,674 --&amp;gt; 01:37:14,995 ~God protects us from the evil enemies ~&amp;gt;"
"1143 01:37:15,384 --&amp;gt; 01:37:19,493 ~They say without wedding, let them say ~"
"1149 01:37:53,154 --&amp;gt; 01:37:55,322 Come on.. 1150 01:37:55,553 --&amp;gt; 01:37:58,936 Where are you bringing your mom, Yaman?"
"1151 01:37:59,300 --&amp;gt; 01:38:02,000 Hold tight."
"- Yaman 1152 01:38:02,400 --&amp;gt; 01:38:04,500 Don't be annoyed with me..."
"1153 01:38:06,956 --&amp;gt; 01:38:08,996 Come on guys..."
Lets continue to have fun.
"1154 01:38:09,600 --&amp;gt; 01:38:13,100 ~...You're the man... ~"
"1155 01:38:16,000 --&amp;gt; 01:38:21,000 ~ Why do we keep fighting all the time~"
"1156 01:38:22,247 --&amp;gt; 01:38:23,715 My bag !... 1157 01:38:24,349 --&amp;gt; 01:38:26,237 ..."
This is your creation!
"1158 01:38:29,251 --&amp;gt; 01:38:36,177 ~ ~ Why can't we break up in a humanly and friendly way ~ ~ 1159 01:38:36,727 --&amp;gt; 01:38:42,347 ~ ~ There's respect to all those years that we lived through ~ ~ 1160 01:38:42,434 --&amp;gt; 01:38:44,433 Mira, enough.. 1161 01:38:44,587 --&amp;gt; 01:38:49,505 ~ ~ If every day is a torture, if every day is this mess~ ~ 1162 01:38:49,869 --&amp;gt; 01:38:52,311 Mira, stop it!"

"1170 01:40:24,730 --&amp;gt; 01:40:27,786 Are you already sleeping ?"
James:
"I thought there was an exit, back at the dead end."
"Next one's about a three hour walk away, it's at point 17."
And that's if we don't get lost.
Connor:
Is there anywhere safe we can stop on the way?
Amy:
We need to let someone know we're down here!
James:
There's a mainframe computer room about half way round.
We can send a message from there.
Amy:
Ok.
(Electrical flickering)
Connor:
Which way now?
James:
We have to go that way.
(Flickering lights)
"(Low machine noises, heartbeats and breathing)"
(Sound of tearing meat and chewing)
(Monster screeches) (Sound of rapid heartbeat)
(Monster screeches)
(James screams)
(James screams in anger)
(Monster gurgles and scratches on floor)
Matt:
Jesus...
What does it take to kill one of these things?!
Amy:
They're people Matt!
Matt:
See?
"It feels like someone else is touching them, not your own hands, right?"
- Wow.
Freakilicious.
"- Oh, I could get used to this."
I don't think we should be doing this.
It's kind of lesbiany.
"Well, you asked me what it was like to be felt up."
"So, what's the best thing about having a boyfriend then?"
It just feels really natural.
"You know, really grown up."
And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.
The Ten Stages of Snogging.
- You're mad.
- No.
It's scientific.
- How would you know anything about it?
- Please.
- Who got 82% in Bio?
- True.
We cut out all the letters about kissing from the problem pages of every girls' magazine.
You?
"- Yes, son."
You are very bold!
You looks so scared as if I'm kidnapping you.
Unmannerly girl!
Just now you said I'm a spring of the garden.
Shut up!
Santo!
Raghu!
Where have they gone?
"Don't worry, Mr. Shreekant."
We've informed all the police forces across the state and Goa.
Yes.
And we're looking for them.
"If possible, connect me to the IGs of Gujarat and Karnataka, too."
"Okay, sir."
I'll talk to them now.
Thank you.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm missing my parents.
I saw a nightmare.
Nightmares are to be forgotten once you open your eyes.
Why to trust them?
Father is so careless about me.
He didn't care to know where I am and in what condition.
But we keep him informed.
Why do you take tension?
All the police officers are same.
You've got no heart but a stone.
How do you know what living means... without parents?
You'd never feel that.
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
-What's happenin' guys?
Yo!
Do people still say yo?
Can I say yo?
"Well, I'm sayin' it."
Yo!
Dawg!
Check out this awesome attempt at this assisted backflip.
"-One, two, three... [groaning]"
-Fayul!
That's my new thing.
Fayul!
That's not my new thing.
But this attempted flip was a fail.
"Now, the original video was relatively hidden, but I guess the guy submitted it to FailBlog and now it has over a million views."
But most of the comedy comes from the poor dude here who gets kicked in the head and then busts his face on the fire extinguisher.
[crash!]
Did you hear that sound?
It sounded like a f--king car wreck.
[laughter]
And then you got the friend over here who literally ROFLs.
"That ROFL would make an amazing GlF, wouldn't it?"
"-Rahahaha, rahahaha..."
"-All right, that's it."
I'm done with that video.
Yo.
"Sometimes, you know, your friend gets herself stuck in the dryer."
"And it's cool, you know, it happens to the best of us."
-Whoo!
"-Come on, get out!"
-I can't!
[laughter]
(laughs)
"I'll get you, Patman!"
Principal Cooper.
"Egbert, stop that horseplay and get to class."
Can I quote you on that?
"Thank you, Mr. Superintendent."
"Elizabeth, you're here late."
Just doing some fact-checking for my audition tape.
"Well, I know you'll do a great job."
"You asked for it, Patman."
(hissing)
"(Manny) Hey, Bruce, wait up."
Want to get something to eat?
(Bruce) Great idea.
"So, why do you want to get involved with this Oracle show, anyway?"
"I want to do the editorials, share my opinions."
I feel like owe it to these simpletons to tell them how to think.
"Hey, you're the man."
Of course.
What about the audition tape?
Done deal.
Made a call.
I'm bringing in the best director money can buy.
(coughs)
"Good morning, Sweet Valley High."
"Today's top story... 3, 2..."
*♪ I've got some news for you*
*♪ I am the one you need...*
Missing school fund discovered.
After a recent probe into the school department's budget...
Go again.
"OK, take 14! *♪ I've got the perfect story* missing $5,000 fund..."
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
Reşat Bey has been waiting for you.
- Hello.
- Hello Turaner Bey.
"Believe me, I am terribly sorry."
We're facing a very ugly slander.
"But, we won't let it go any further."
- We took our precautions.
"- It's too late, Reşat Bey."
It will be front pages of every big newspaper in the early edition.
[Song:
Kimseye Etmem Şikayet Singer:
Şevval Sam]
Oh God!
"Is he OK, Fevzi?"
Is he wounded?
Call an ambulance.
Quick!
"OK, I am on it."
For the love of God.
Don't talk reproachfully to me.
Please.
- Do you know how bad I feel?
"- I can imagine, my dear."
But you didn't call me once today.
"You make me feel lonely, when I need to hear your voice the most."
"Don't talk as if you don't know what I've been doing, and how busy I am."
I'm working to clean up those idiots mess.
"And now we have the girl's fiancé deal with, too."
I weaved between the town and the prosecution office all day.
I didn't have time to blink an eye.
It won't be easy to cover this up.
I am so scared.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
Tell me your name.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Father Moore!
Papa!
Emily!
Emily!
"She feels so hot, Father!"
She's burning up!
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!
Emily!
Doctor!
I need you here now.
Watch her vital signs.
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.
"And the word was the word, and what a wonderful word it was."
Through him all things remain.
"Without him, nothing was made that has been made."
"And the 70 disciples returned again with joy, saying:"
"""Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."""
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.
I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Behold.
I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions... ...and over all the power of the enemy.
"And nothing shall, by any means, hurt you."
Get it off!
- That's more like it.
A shoe?
So you won't listen?
- No.
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.
What will I wear to the function now?
What happened?
"Aunty, see what this crazy girl has done."
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt....
"What happened, aunty?"
- Nothing
Don't worry.
I'll iron them out.
Renu...
Hey fatso!
Your clothes have come.
Get ready soon.
"Tut, tut!"
You shouldn't say that.
"- Yes, you're right."
What is the function about?
They'll distribute awards and deliver lectures.
Sit.
If it isn't too much of a bother could I have a cup of tea?
I'll get it.
"Dear sister Vandana,..."
Suraj has finished his Air Force training... ... and now he is an Indian Air Force pilot.
"The responsibility that you delegated to me,... ... to fulfil Suraj's father's dream,... ... has been fulfilled by me."
"Today on the bases of this truth, I've dared... ...to come and ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."
Do you know the punishment of stepping in this house?
"I've gone through many punishments, father."
And I'm ready to go through any punishment.
Then watch my last punishment.
Brother!
- No!
What are you doing?
"Stop, Jamna!"
Stop there everyone!
"No, uncle!"
Don't do that.
Think of your daughter and your prestige.
He's that goon who has brought shame to my prestige.
He snatched away my daughter from me.
I'll not spare him.
"Yes, he has snatched away your daughter."
He has...
Shoot him.
Kill him...
"But remember, first you'll have to kill your own daughter."
Radha!
Radha!
Radha is Kishan's flute.
No one could separate it.
She'll live and die with him.
What are you doing?
At least think about me.
Lowly!
Your father arrested so many criminals.
And you want him to be a criminal today?
God!
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
"Oh, boy."
If she only knew how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
Parker.
Parker!
"No, no, no, stop!"
Stop!
"Parker, you're late, man."
Always late.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz."
Different.
I think he grew up fast.
"Forcedly.... - He is more mature, but he is a good person."
He tries to look harsh but in order not to be hurt... it's obvious he is the only one who is not aware...
"Yaman is a tender kid, he is merciful, he is a real man.."
"Mira, what happened , Mira, what is wrong my girl?"
"We lost hopes with you- I am not late, take it, there are exactly 1000 TL here, count it!"
Is it OK?
"Kenan's issue will be solved, right?"
Hopefully!
"Brother , what time is it?"
- Half past two.
"Brother, can I use your phone shortly."
I have to make an urgent call.
I will pay for it.
But don't let it be so long!
"- OK, give it."
"Hello?&amp;gt; Hello Mert, it's me ,Yaman."
"Hello Yaman, where are you man?"
Half an hour is left for the exam.
"I am dying from worry.-I am on my way, I am coming, I will catch it, don't worry!"
"OK, were you by Mira's side too?"
What happened to Mira?
- Okay... okay... see you!
Mert i'm saying what happened to Mira?
Yaman! &amp;gt; Where's Mira?
Inside.
Her parents are with her.
"What happened, what does she have?- I don't know, they said they would take her for operation but..."
"Why are you here mom, what's happening?"
"Sude, calm down.- Oh my God!"
Again everything comes from you.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."
You get free sex and now free food!
That's too much.
Sam- gae-tang.
Are you always so quiet?
I like people's voices.
Why are you so attached to talking?
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
"Hey girl, turn the oven off in five minutes."
Let it settle a bit as I am getting ready.
Then let us make a nice package for it.
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ebru Hanım, we've got a mail for you."
I am so excited to see Kuzey.
"But, also nervous that I will see Sami there."
"I mean, I can't go in before or after Sami."
Since we have limited time.
I will have to see his face.
"I know, he will try to talk to me when he sees me alone."
"But, I will not listen to him."
Why would I listen?
"God forbid, I don't want to give him any hopes."
"If he gets some hope and throws his ring away,"
I would feel sorry for the woman.
Ebru Hanım?
"- Who received the mails today, Hasan?"
"- I did, ma'am."
- Who brought the big yellow envelope?
"- A courier, ma'am."
"Barış, get up!"
Barış get up!
"I'm telling you to get up, Barış!"
"What did you do, huh?"
What did you do?
What's going on?
"Calm down, what did I do?"
Celebrated for the end of Ferhat case.
And getting rid of the Burak problem.
Is this how you want to get rid of him?
- What is the matter?
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
Bonnie...
This was a mistake.
"She has no magic, she can't help us."
"Bonnie, wait, please."
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please?
I'll wait outside.
"Hi, Elena."
Nice lake house.
"You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell."
"You're Alaric's friend, right?"
Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here?
Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack."
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
"Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
Why do you even care?
Because Ric likes you.
"And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him."
I have been waiting for this day for so long!
You always wait for bad days.
But not me!
Let me tell you!
"I won""t get seema married to him!"
Listen..
Lajwanti!
You know they are childhood friends!
They like each other!
To hell with that!
I have always been against this relationship!
And I will always be against it!
"More than me, you will regret it."
"Aunt, I have come to talk about my friend Rajesh alliance""s.. ..and not my alliance."
For sP?
"Why didn""t you tell me before?"
We accept this alliance!
Wait!
I will just bring sweets!
ls somebody there? shekhar.. what is all this?
"lt""s all about destiny, Mr. Diwan. congratulations! shekhar! shekhar, what have you done?"
ls this the reward of my love?
"No, seema."
Fate is testing me.
Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love.
"But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"
"What""s my fault?"
"I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."
"Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."
Who are you to take decision of my destiny?
lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!
"But I can""t kill my love like this!"
- Yes.
But I'd still be good at it.
Really?
It's really big!
- Really?
- Yes.
For real.
- Take it out!
- What?
"Your thing, pull it out."
Here?
"Take it out, underneath!"
It's not so big.
"- Yes, it is."
"- No, It's not."
"When it's hard, it's really big."
I don't think so.
"Yes, it is."
It is big.
- Then make it hard.
- Here?
Hey...let's go somewhere else.
Don't make me laugh!
No way...
"That thing, I doubt it can even get hard!"
"No, It gets hard fine."
-What's your major?
- Astrophysics.
You go to a regional college and you think you're going to build spaceships?
"Well, not exactly make spaceships but we study the creation and evolution of the universe."
We also observe and research the cosmic space of the earth's mesosphere and
- planetary movements...
Who will treat me like a human?
"Look, don't behave like this."
Think that your baby feels whatever you feel right now.
"Ok, my baby..."
"Ok, my baby..."
I shut up...
Everything is fine.
Ok...
Narin...
"I didn't have the face to come to you, so I came to your mother."
"But, God wanted you to hear what I said."
You see...
Have you heard?
"Ok, don't forgive me and Mustafa, but..."
Please don't attribute our sins to this innocent baby.
"You have a conscience, Narin..."
Don't leave us in the dark...
Please Narin...
"The things Asiye told, are they true?"
Is Mustafa like a child?
"Yes, that's true."
"He didn't recognize me, either."
He only recognized only you from the pictures.
All of these wouldn't happen if he could forget only me.
You're right.
Don't go alone at this hour.
I will go alone.
I am not afraid.
"My lord, brighten my path and keep my heart pure..."
Please don't see me as one of your cruel servants...
Good morning Yasar...
Could you please take me to Mustafa?
Hello...
I obtained permission for each one of you.
"There is not going to be any restrictions on the number of visitors, despite Mustafa's illness."
What illness?
We all know why he is here!
Okay...
Duriye..
Metin didn't say anything.
"That is, he is just saying it is protocol."
My son!!!
My son...
Son...
Son....
It is time for medication..
"Mustafa, son.. where are you going?"
We came to see you..
"Look, Asiye is here.."
Yasar is here...
Your mother...
Your father...
"You say that, but Mustafa doesn't recognize you."
We are going
My son....
How could they do this to you... how????
We... ... are such a burden to you..
If only Kadir could get out.. ... we won't stay...
"And, you won't even let us do any work."
We just sit around.
You are not a burden to anyone.
I am going to ask you something...
Are you not comfortable here?
Is the place too small?
Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?
"No, I will see my son for as long as I am allowed."
He can wait outside if he wants.
"Okay, we got it."
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."
"Life, a day at a time, my love."
"Life, a day at a time, don't know."
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"I want to reach the greatest mountain, climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."

Law may give bail to Jackie's men.
But I want an order of Jackie's death penalty.
"Don't worry, uncle."
I've prepared such strong case against Jackie... ...that even the supreme court can't save him from the gallows.
Jackie surrendered?
- Yes.
Why?
Why?
- Because Radha told him to do so.
What?
- Because Radha is in love with him.
What?
Radha?
Which Radha?
Our Radha!
Radha takes him as her husband.
Radha has taken a promise from him to be a good citizen.
This enmity has turned into a love story.
Serious!
Serious!
Serious love story!
"And if Jackie is hanged, Radha..."
Radha... what will she do?
"I'll commit suicide, brother."
I can't live without Kishan!
"He isn't a criminal, brother."
He's made a criminal.
I've never hidden anything from you and sister-in-law.
I swear upon you... ...he never looked at me with evil intentions.
Had he wished... he could have done anything with me.
"But for the sake of my love, he embraced death."
"Save him, brother."
- Where should I put my hands?
- The waist is safest.
You're a quick learner.
"Now, tongues."
They're a health and safety issue.
The secret is to strike the right balance between yielding and giving.
"Start slowly, like a turtle, not a lizard."
Avoid washing machine syndrome.
"Sadly, this session's over."
My next client's here.
"- Hi, Georgia."
"- Hi, El."
"Thank you, Georgia."
I'll be in touch.
"You did tongues, didn't you?"
Number six.
"You did a big fat tongue sandwich, didn't you?"
"Oh, my God."
"All I know is, he was from Saliva City."
But who cares?
I'm a snogging sensation.
Wait!
Mum?
Dad?
I just want you both to know how much I really appreciate all you've done for me.
"I mean, it can't be easy since you can hardly remember being my age"
'cause it was so long ago.
Have you been inhaling fumes from the science lab?
I want to talk party details.
"Oh, Georgia."
I told you I needed to talk about something important.
"Oh, this is important!"
"I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach."
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?

It's time to continue my journey.

woman:
I wrote a letter to him.
It's easier then speaking.
I explained everything from the beginning.
I told him you and me were too new.
Then I told him everything I feel.
"My emotion, my concerns, everything."
I poured my heart out to him.
I hope he'll understand me.
How are you?
Are you in the station?
"Yes, I am drown in paper work since I was called back to duty."
I thought that case was closed.
"I mean, the guy is caught."
It is over.
"A second Demet, please hold on a sec."
"Hello, yes Aziz?"
"Deniz Hanım, returned to the country a week after she left it."
- And she didn't leave again.
- So she's in Turkey for two and a half months.
"- Yes, abi."
"- Okay, thanks."
- Hello.
"- Hello, what's up?"
Maybe I should call you later.
There's a connection between Ferhat's daughter and the man who said he killed Ferhat.
"I need to talk to Mirza, please find a way."
"There's no way, Deniz."
If they see you with him... ... it will peril the plausibility of his statement.
Maybe he'll die even before the trial.
The last reports were very bad.
- Wish I could at least say goodbye.
- He doesn't want that.
Why can't we do that?
Speak up
Can't we not hear it?
No， she must tell me why
My mammy said a man getting intimate with a girl before marriage may desert her some day
Did your mammy tell you that?
"I was not in， sister, right?"
My daddy told me I must try it by any means
Otherwise， she may become secondhand like her
Right What?
My mammy told me like that
My daddy told me like that
What now?
Well， your daddy's right， and so's your mammy
But that bloody ghost won't give up so easily
What now?
Go down for the wedding night
Okay
Go now
"Sister, now the 1st thing is to take a bath"
Hurry up
Why are you wearing a hat?
Higher
Open up， Mimi， the groom's here
Take care
Lucky money for opening the door
How much? $99，999.90
So expensive， I give up
Name your pricer
Make it cheape
I'll pay you $9.90.
Give me 10 $ change
And the court wants to punish me for it.
Prince.
Will I be banished?
Will I have to go away again?
Will my mom have to go through that cause of me?
"No, Prince Yuning."
- Crown Prince.
- Prince.
That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.
"You stood up for me, worried about me."
"Some brother I am, watching you take the blame."
"No, I'm to blame."
If I didn't go on the bridge you wouldn't have been arrested or gotten sick...
It's all my fault.
No.
"No, Yuning."
I'm taking pictures right now.
All the passersby's look incredible.
I want to ask so many of them
lf I could take pictures of them.
There are tons of people who look much better than we do
They look very modelesque.
I got this stain from a hotdog I ate earlier.
I guess I'm clumsy sometimes.
Thankfully I dropped it after I finished my scene.
Dae Hyun and Yong Guk are filming at Time Square and Central Park fountain.
It's like a dream.
When else would we come here to film for a MV!
"Right now, we are at Central Park."
We're here because Dae Hyun is filming.
He's filming for the MV right now.
And I'm just going there to watch him.
"At Central Park,"
The trees are all very tall and the air is very fresh.
Look over there.
It's a horse.
I've only seen it in NY I think.
Horses in NY!
You don't see that often elsewhere.
Horses on the streets.
This place sure is humongous.
The trees are enormous and the streets are wide.
It's one thing that stands out about America.
This place is so big I feel like I'm in a giant's forest.
Dae Hyun is a natural at acting.
This place is Central Park.
ln the middle of Central Park
I took a picture over there by the fountain.
I'll see what He does to me.
"Go home, it's going to rain."
You'll get drenched.
It's an earthquake.
Swamiji Rain?
Rain?
- Rain?
My hand's paining.
I won't be able to write my exam tomorrow.
I'll slap you.
I'll make you hold the pen in your mouth and write your paper.
You're scolding him.
But what about you?
- What did I do?
What?
The festivities were left incomplete.
You've to admit that there's God.
You spread the rumour.. ..and immediately there was an earthquake.
- Remember.
- What earthquake?
Even the utensils didn't budge.
Papa.
I think they took your announcement too seriously.
This news just came in from parts of the country.. ..that the idol of Sri Krishna's eating butter.
ls the Lord eating butter?
- No.
"Priest, offer the Lord some buttermilk."
"People are offering cheese, cottage-cheese.. ..butter, buttermilk to the idol of Krishna."
"- Oh, God!"
The rumour has spread so far.
"Please, eat it."
This is low-cholesterol cheese.

ABOUT COLLABORATlNG?
"HOW DO WE DO IT?  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S THE HARD PART. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SAD ANSWER IS,  IT'S A GlFT."
I THlNK THERE ARE SEVERAL THlNGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF.
YOU HAVE TO SURE OF YOUR OWN TALENT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD RECOGNlTION AND FEEL SECURE.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE TALENT OF THE PERSON WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WRlTING.
"AND IF YOU DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE A COLLABORATlNG KlND OF PERSON... (chuckling) IF YOU CAN GET ALONG WlTH PEOPLE,"
IF YOU CAN GlVE UP SOMETHlNG YOU THlNK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
"AND ONLY FlGHT ABOUT THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THlNGS,"
"AND YOU TRUST THE TALENT OF THE OTHER PERSON COLLABORATlNG WORKS,"
"BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE WANT IT THElR WAY."
"WE COLLABORATED WlTH A WOMAN IN CHlCAGO AND IT DlDN'T WORK AT ALL,"
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T WlLLlNG  TO GlVE AN INCH
"ON WHETHER YOU SAY THlS IS A ""TAXl""  OR THlS IS A ""CAB."""
"I MEAN, ON THE LlTTLE THlNGS-- AND IT DlDN'T WORK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WASN'T A COLLABORATlON.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO."
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHlNG TO ADD TO THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH...
NO.
"ONLY THAT, UH, THE WAY WE WORK IS..."
"ONE OF US WlLL WRlTE  SOME STUFF,"
"AND THEN, TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER"
AND THE OTHER  HAS THE OPTlON
OF IMPROVlNG ON  WHATEVER HE OR SHE GOT
AND GOlNG ON FROM THERE.
AND THAT WAY-- ONE OF THE THlNGS WE WERE TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
DEBBlE WAS TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
IS HOW NlCE IT IS  WHEN PLOTS SURPRlSE YOU.
"AND YOU KNOW, WHERE THlNGS, YOU KNOW, COME UP UNEXPECTEDLY."
"WELL, THE NlCE THlNG ABOUT COLLABORATlNG  IS YOU SURPRlSE EACH OTHER,"
"SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY SURPRlSING EACH OTHER,"
YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF SURPRlSING THE AUDlENCE.
"SO, IT'S A LlTTLE LlKE CHEATlNG..."

Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
"But you are still a baby, you are my big baby."
"Okay then, Okay, have some rest,"
Don't ever force your leg okay?
"If you need something, shout to us."
"Okay, I am lying down.- Bravo !"
Lie down!
"Mira, did you talk to Orkun?"
"Yes mom, is the third time you're asking today."
What does he say?
- He doesn't say anything.
"He went together with his dad to the fabric in Luleburgaz, they will be staying there for some days."
"See ?, he is escaping too.&amp;gt; Mom, don't please!"
"The owner of this wants his vehicle in some days, you have to take care of the instruments order right away on morning.Beeren calling"
"OK, no problem, I will solve it tomorrow!- Good bye! &amp;gt;Good night uncle!"
Yes?
Err...
"I called to tell you I am fine, maybe you are worried about me,"
It's me Berren...- Beeren?
Aa Beren...
So good you called me..
I was thinking of you.&amp;gt; Really?
Dad?!...
Daddy... &amp;gt; My sweetheart...
"Where were you ,i was so worried , dad..- I am sorry.."
I am sorry.
I will solve everything.
"I know my dear dad, i know..."
Shall I go and talk with him too?
No.. just let him..
It means he is suffering from love.
My precious boy!
He is growing up dear Ender.
This is Dayton Way in Beverly Hills.
It's actually a very expensive town.
"I don't fit in very well, do l?"
&amp;lt;'Bear' Yong Guk's shoot begins&amp;gt;
The background saved me.
It's like L.A.
It looks fantastic.
Feels like L.A. here.
Pictures come out beautifully here.
Nature is definitely better than creating expensive sets.
No matter how costly a set is it's incomparable to nature.
okay.
Great job.
"Now, it's Zelo's turn."
The first scene is a wrap.
Zelo will now be shooting a skateboarding scene.
Zelo will film something similar to me.
Directors are so good at filming.
They're making us look very attractive.
We look as though we're Korean-Americans living in America.
I'm pretending this iPod is an iPhone.
"Woah there, wind."
None
I'm doomed.
My face is bloated.
I can feel my face all swollen.
I'm screwed.
I think that's a person over there.
Look at him wash the baby like she's laundry.
(Born in Busan) I've been to Gwang-an-ri Beach in Busan.
"Hae-woon-dae, and Song-do beach."
But I've never been to such a huge beach like this before.
- What are you guys doing here?
"- Come on, shoo, get lost!"
"- All right, all right!"
"- All right, time is tight."
Let's begin.
You there.
Read.
- Why me?
- Because I said so.
"- ""How to hold a costume parade."""
- Get to the point.
- The director... advances...
- Advances what?
"- Can't see, it's faded."
- Hand it over.
- That circular looks really old.
"- Old, yes."
"Obsolete, no."
I might add.
You know what I mean?
- The director announces...
Announces!
"""Attention, let the costume parade begin!"""
- Attention!
Let the costume parade begin!
Music!
- You got it!
- Get closer!
"You, out of the way!"
"So there is no chaos tomorrow, we'll divide the square into sectors."
"Children separately over here, and adults over there."
Slogan chanting can be done by the support staff.
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
"Let me see, where were you?"
Mert whispering: is that Mira?
Hello?&amp;gt;Just a second..
I will go so you can talk comfortably.
Your voice sounds interrupted...
Last night was left half.
"In fact we have to complete it. want to talk with you a bit tonight, but alone."
Okay?
Don't take Mert with you.
Only you and me.
"Look, girl!"
"I am telling you the last time clearly, I don't have anything to do with you and will never in this life."
"Did you understand it?-Ah..ah...-Ah or not, this is it!"
You will have nothing from me!
I'm telling you this from the beginning.
Do you understand me?
"Hey, talk properly !"
You're the girl that my friend loves.
"Be wise, be worthy of him!"
I am trying to explain it politely but...
"look Eylul, if you sadden that boy, I will break your heart, know this too!"
OK?
Did you get me?
You're out of your mind!- Whatever it is!
"Don't call me again, ok?"
"Or even say ""Hello"" as a human... or don't even greet me."
That's it!
Mert?!
I forgot my phone.
There is a girl at our place...
Err...
Giray's girlfriend... stupid... she calls me constantly..
"I was good, wasn't I?"
"So, it looks like a tough assignment."
Maybe you could give me a hand.
Or maybe both hands.
"OK, those who didn't get talent positions, there's room on the crew."
Talk to Patty.
I thought my tape was really great.
"Elizabeth, some people like yourself excel at the written word."
Not everyone's meant to be an on-air personality.
There's still room on the crew.
Get it together!
We've got a show to do here.
"Enid, did you get that?"
"(Todd) Man, Patty's really trippingon this director business."
"(Patty) People, please!"
Are you feeling any better?
Not really.
You're still *The Oracle's* star writer.
No one can ever take that away from you.
"I wanted it so bad, Todd, and I thought my work was really great."
"Well, what did Collins say?"
There's nothing he can do.
"If you ask me, they should change the name from *Oracle On-Air* to *Airheads On-Air.*"
Hey...
"Present company excluded, of course."
"Hi, Liz..."
Todd.
Have you met Russ?
"Yes, I have."
"Well, just wanted to say hi."
Don't forget to watch me tomorrow.
Is it wrong to hate your sister with a passion?
"Well, uh, let's see, something wrong with the distributor I think."
Want me to give you a hand?
Thank you.
I sure appreciate it.
"Well, it doesn't look too serious."
Good.
( dramatic theme playing )
( phone rings )
I'll get it.
Hello.
"Uh, let me talk to your mother."
"It's for you, Mom."
Hello.
Hello.
Mrs. Pryor?
Yes.
"Now, you look, I've got your husband."
What?
"If you want to get him back you're gonna have to pay me $100,000."
What are you talking about?
I guess you heard me all right.
Now you better start thinking about that money.
"For your information, my husband is right here at home."
"Believe me, I've got him and I'm not going to give him back until you pay."
"It's the first time I've done this kind of thing and I'm nervous about it, so don't kid around with me because I might hurt the man."
I don't know what kind of a sick mind you've got but I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
( dramatic theme playing )
Cheyney...
did you make the call?
"Cheyney, did you make the call?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, what'd she say, Cheyney?"
There is only one way we can reach the ship.
We have to go underwater!
"But if we do that, we may freeze!"
I'm prepared to die!
"If we make a hole in the ship, they will have to delay!"
You're right.
Here!
They made this for us to help us breathe underwater.
Young Sook!
Mother is going!
God of the Sea!
We are laying down our lives to save our daughter!
Please have mercy!
We... we made a hole in the ship!
It's our turn now!
Let's go!
What?
We can't leave today because of a hole in the ship?!
It will take at least a day to repair it.
"As of today, you owe me forty thousand yang."
"Goodness, awesome!"
Increase security!
"Seize any trespassers and torture them! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yes, sir!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In Soon!
Next!
- Choon Dang!
- Myung Shin!
The front has been fortified.
Go for the back!
Alright!
What do we do?
It's fifty thousand yang already!
Nobody's in it.
"Um, I think there's only one floor with any people on it."
[Anthem playing in background]
"We're in the hotel room and, um, we've been told that they're bugged."
That they're listening to us.
I don't know if whispering is going to help.
That might be where it all stems from.
Hello!
Hello!
"Come in, Come in Tokyo."
"Hello, Hello."
"Hello, Hello."
We're here.
[Woman singing on TV]
"Right after we get there, we were taken for our first meal."
"The first time you eat in North Korea, it's kind of a sign of the very weird things to come."
[Girls laughing]
[Girl speaking Korean]
Is this where we go?
Here?
The table is over here.
We're in a big banquet room.
As you can see it's huge.
There's about 20 women who are getting ready for our dinner.
"First of all, they give you about 3 or 4 courses of absolutely inedible food."
It's just matter.
It's like fried matter.
"And you're kinda going, yeah, yeah."
"But you're waiting for every one to fill in, when's this banquet happening?"
When's the banquet?
There is no banquet.
Where is everyone?
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."""

"You're like a wild animal, aren't you"
"Well, how am i supposed to fight you if you keep running around like a sissy?"
A sissy
Yeah

How good of a friend is he?
"Actually, we're very tight, but I'm totally ok with you beating the crap out of him."
"Come on ,Dorothy"
Is that all you got? here comes one from macy's basement.
"1,2,3,4....."
Don't sweat this.
Only 14 more rounds to go. here we go!
"How are you doing, Stuart, alright."
How many fingers am I holding up?
Say two
He's fine
"Come on, Bring it"
You're not gay
Will it lead Pasha on the gallows?
Yes!
Definitely he will.
Never.
Because you'll withdraw your statement.
"I spent 35 years of my life, listening to the... ...threatening from the boys like you."
"If I wish, I can kill your entire family in just five minute."
But you've a big family.
And it's in your hands to let it prosper.
It was my duty to warn you.
"So, I have."
You are lucky that my gun is under maintenance today.
Your darling daughter Radha.
"Stop, Shreekant."
I've no one in my family.
But you've many.
Think about it.
19 days are left for you to give your statement.
"Santo, let's go."
Hail Lord Krishna!
"- Lord, what a festival!"
Hail Lord Krishna!
"Uncle, we must leave for Mumbai now."
Never!
Shreekant Mathur has never got... ...afraid of anyone's threat nor will he in future.
"Thank God, Damodar isn't here today."
"Otherwise, he'd have started firing."
"Let go off it,"
I know Damodar.
He's just a police officer by profession.
"Otherwise, he's very soft hearted person."
Inspector Damodar!
"Bye, Bye, Seeya!"
Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."
In- cuse?
It could be cuse.
But if this is qua?
Quis?
"Quis, good."
In- quis-a- tive.
Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
We need to stand up in that complaining all the time
If I hear one more person go
Oh my god.
I am so sick of white guys dating all of our women
I will slap you (slap) (slap) (slap) (slap)
And if an Asian girl only dates white guys
Who cares?
There's billions and billions of women
Even if you are not an Asian guy
Let this be a lesson
"You tell yourself, you are the bottom"
You are usually right!
"So,,, Shut up with that negative attitudee"
Yeah...
That's all I have to say.
So..
Byeeeee (Waving)
A Day for an Affair
- Hi.
- Hi.
-What did you do today?
- I went to the school and handed out lunch.
"-On my way home, I bought a couple of fish."
-What are you wearing?
My pajamas!
-Why are you wearing a uniform?
- I have a ceremony today.
I'm buying a cell phone today.
It's been ages since my old one broke.
A cell phone?
Your phone's right there.
You said you didn't need it anymore.
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box
Big fish little fish cardboard box Fill the trolley fill
"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
Millwall!
Millwall!
- What the fuck's he doing here?
"- Martin, sit down, son, sweet."
- That's it.
"Do as you're told, you mug."
- Fuck off.
Bovver.
You know we're gonna have to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna start to talk.
"So, what you doing up so late, anyway, on a fucking school night?"
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals... ...all shitting at the thought of us turning you over?
"What, did you have a lover's tiff?"
"Well, what do you want, Bov?"
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.
He's at our boozer now.
"Tommy, you gotta give him the chop."
He's got them eating out of the palm of his hand.
"What makes you think I'd want to sort that out for you, eh?"
Because the Major's there too.
Stevie Dunham's in there?
"- Oh, thanks, Pete."
- Shut up!
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?
"Look, I'm sorry I lied about being a history major, but that's it."
- I'm not a journalist.
"- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?"
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal.
I've kept that my entire life.
Are you working for the Times?
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
- Yes.
- They told me they'd sent the papers from my father's office to this storage room.
"I have to see a lawyer tomorrow and if I don't take a copy of the birth certificates along, they won't..."
Please!
Whose name was it under?
Doctor Gabriel de Luca.
Come on in.
Hello?
Mr. Kleinman?
"If it's okay, I just wanted to ask you a few questions..."
About an article of yours on Manuel Leonardi.
REMAlNS FOUND ARE THOSE OF MANUEL LEONARDI
It says here they only found the father's body.
What happened to the mother and daughter?
They never found the bodies.
I don't understand.
What were they doing at the hotel?
They didn't have a house?
- They were running away.
- From what?
"LEONARDl'S DEATH COULD BE CONNECTED WlTH THE ""DOCTOR"""
"The ""doctor""."
POLlCE UNABLE TO FlND DOCTOR INVOLVED IN SERlES OF MURDERS
Manuel and Amalia Leonardo went missing.
"They were taken from their home on February 3, 1980."
"What do you mean ""went missing""?"
"""Relatives of more than 30,000 who disappeared during the dictatorship ask for justice."""
"DOCTOR LERHMANN, SANTA CRUZ MlLITARY HOSPlTAL."
FEBRUARY 1978.
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Would you like to come in for some coffee?
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
I'll let go when I count to 3 and you hook him out 1， 2， 3
Get hold of him
Wait.
Why are you still staying here?
I want to get your first time
lf I can't break your virginity before midnight
I'll never get reincarnated
Where's Robert?
I'm Robert.
Robert is me
Lisa， please help me so I may get reincarnated
Never
Let me help you if sister won't do it
Don't! lf you touch me I may be sent down to hell
What?
Sorry， I can't help you
I'll find someone else then.
Bye
Never.
Get hold of him
Get hold of him
Get hold of him.
Don't let him get away
Follow him
Landal， are you all right?
It's all because of you
Had you yielded to me， he wouldn't have got you involved
I....
Shut up!
I may say it now even when I'm not drunk
We've been dating for 7 years.
We kissed and caressed
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It's nothing.
- Are you gonna come pick us up?
Is Fatmagül all right?
- Where are you?
- I don't know...
"It says ""Dolapdere Taksim"" Do we take the turn here?"
I don't know either.
"Hold on, let me ask somebody here."
"Okay, call me right away."
- Let us forward a bit then...
"- Let's not get lost, Mukaddes."
Shut up Rahmi.
I am so tired already.
"- Damn it, what's your hurry?"
- Be careful Mukaddes!
I'll go get your brother and yenge.
Stop being stubborn.
Just eat these.
"You passed out, out of hunger."
Eat them before they get cold.
You'll feel better.
I shouldn't have known...
- How stupid I am...
"- You couldn't have known, something that didn't happen."
I've explained that non sense to you how many times now?
There was something strange that night... ... with the three of you.
"And then, that woman..."
She said she was Fatmagül Ketenci's brother's wife.
What did she come to talk with your dad about?
God...
The woman was looking for her when she was missing.
It's my first time on an elevator in Las Vegas.
You haven't in the hotel?
Did you walk up to the hotel room?
We were on the 20th floor.
- We didn't film then.
- You're right.
That's why this is my first time.
"Wow, elevators in Las Vegas go up too."
Same as Korean ones.
Great work.
It feels just like Las Vegas.
Great work.
We're in Las Vegas.
We just finished shooting for the MV.
I had an all-nighter yesterday and couldn't sleep today.
I just woke up in the middle of my nap to come to the shooting.
The director expected me to look awake.
"So I was jumping around, trying to be hyper."
Thankfully the scenery was great
So I could get in a happy mood.
(Satisfied) I'm feeling pretty good now.
I'm all done filming so I'll be leaving with the photographer.
None
We played like crazy on the bus.
You can only check it out in the MV.
We'll be all done at the desert.
The desert scene is the final one.
"""We're Hurricane, We're Hurricane"""
I've gone insane.
I've been up for almost 24 hours.
We're heading to the desert now it'll take about 20-30 minutes.
"It's where the scorpions live, my favorite."
Why did you send her there?
What was she doing at your mom's house?
"What did you do to my daughter, tell me!- It's okay dear, okay..."
Mira?!...
Yaman did you take the exam?
Yaman did you take the exam?
"No, I came to you..."

"- What is all this about, Reşat Bey?"
- What do you mean sir?
Haven't you seen the local newspaper?
I am...
I am very sorry but I don't know what you're saying.
The party members have just read  your town's local news to me.
Explain to me what this rape scandal is about.
"They mention Selim's name in it, too."
You will tell me everything.
You will tell me what you did to Fatmagül.
Are you alright?
Back off!
They asked me to help the girl.
So I went to the hospital.
And I found out that the girl had an affair with Kerim.
Lies!
Don't give me bullshit!
Tell me the truth!
You just don't want to see the truth.
The real lie is what you see here.
This rape slander.
"- Good job, Christine."
"- Oh, thanks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Monti?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It just shows the inexperience.
- Helene?
- Helene is a disaster.
Helene was shocking.
"According to them, it was, like, way undercooked."
You're not the worst.
She is.
And Tali.
I mean...
Disaster.
I don't know what Tali was up to.
- No.
- Dave?
"The sand, you know, big, big technical error."
"I didn't wash the mushrooms, and I think I started too late."
"Any freakin' dish but risotto, man."
"Like, seriously."
Ryan and Tali are the two people that I want to see go home.
They're just total idiots.
"And, if they don't stay on their toes,"
I'm gonna be the one to take 'em out.
Clearly we have to take him out.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm gonna have to throw someone under the bus.
"Once one of 'em's gone, the other one's..."
"Remember, you're the best."
- How do you feel?
- Good.
"All right, guys. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Back to your stations, please."
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
It's educational.
You'll gain skills Lindsay can only dream of.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you Peter Dyer?
"The man, the myth, the legend."
"- Your parents aren't here, are they?"
- No.
My hours are between 4:30 and 5:30 before they get back from work.
Any musical requests?
The right tune creates the right vibe.
Coldplay?
50 Cent?
Dido?
Inner Relaxation Mix?
Whatever.
You choose.
"Now, what kind of experience do you have?"
"Oh, loads."
You have to be completely honest so I can evaluate you accurately.
"Okay, I guess I practise a lot on the back of my hand."
"On average a person will have over 25,000 snogs in their lifetime."
"So close your eyes, relax, feel the magic."
We're going to do a standard one first.
"Wow, you're a natural."
- Really?
- Not too firm or toothy.
- That's very common with beginners.
- Great.
"Next, movement."
When I move my head in you go the other way.
The boy leads and the girl always fits in.

You need to have a pee.
Tai-Chan.
"If you don't pee, you can't watch TV, can you?"
Hmm?
Hey.
Here we go.
boy:
Why do you have lots of hair growing? man speaking native language:
Because I'm a man. boy speaking native language:
What about women? man:
"Women don't have hair, not as much."
[man speaking native language]
Say good morning to mummy. boy speaking native language:
Good morning. man speaking native language:
Here's the incense. boy speaking native language:
I don't want to. man:
"Daddy will do it alone then, Tai-Chan."
"Tai-Chan, here, sound the bell."
"When daddy has put the incense in, you can sound the bell."
[bell rings]
Not yet.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."
That should be a nice commish.
I bet your father's election had nothing to do with it.
"Fuck you very much, Todd."
"Gentlemen, if you will excuse me... ...I must partake, once again, in this restaurant's fine facilities."
Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would hook you up."
"Jesus, Matt, I--"
I'm in a meeting right now.
Call my office.
Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.
"You gotta be joking me, you spineless shit."
- That you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would--"
- What the fuck is this?
"- Oh, this?"
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.
I wouldn't do that.
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know what my ""most emotionally significant moment"" was ?"
"So when my ""U"" of ""M"" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it."
- Onions ?
- What ?
"You, uh, want onions ?"
"Oh, no, thank you."
So what are you gonna major in ?
"State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team."
"Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh ?"
"I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player ?"
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
"Well, you're not."
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor ?
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stifler ]
What are you talkin' about ?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
"I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me."
Finch.
Shit-brick.
"Oh, gosh."
I-I forgot.
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.
When are you available?
"And now, Hong has a report on today's weather."
"When you go out today, be sure to take an umbrella."
We are expecting showers today.
The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat.
After the showers pass...
It'll rain today.
Soo-jeong
Hwi-chan!
NO ENTRY except Snow White &amp;amp;amp; 7 Dwarfs!
Help me out.
"If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable."
Because it keeps getting more serious!
How can you be so laid back about this?
"He's your son too, isn't he?"
All you do is accuse me of being overbearing.
"Oh, whatever!"
It's because you never seem to care about anything.
Okay.
I have an incoming call.
Let's talk at home.
"Yes, Ms. Kim."
How are you?
This is Hwi-chan's picture diary.
Take a look.
"These days especially,"
He seems to have many complaints about you.
"I'm aware that much of what he writes are lies, but..."
- I need to see my son.
"- But, he's in another class now."
"Maybe later, you should talk in a quieter environment."
Please sit down.
I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
This is how brynza cheese is made.

"- Wait, Georgia."
"- Georgia, don't go."
- Georgia!
"Georgia, what are you doing?"
You'll be late for your first day back at school.
I'm coming.
"- Georgia, Mummy wants you."
- Libby.
"Oh, flip, flipper and flipping hell!"
Excusez-moi.
C'est trés grotesque.
If you don't mind?
Oi!
Cheeky.
"Libby, stop putting Angus in the fridge."
"What do you want for breakfast, munchkin?"
Stuffed olive?
"Just because I did something so beyond the Valley of Sad City last night it doesn't give you the right, as my parents, to humiliate me further."
Today is the first day of my life as the new Georgia.
"And who is she, my little elf?"
"She's not an ""elf""."
Not a munchkin.
"She is a mature, sophisticated woman called Ms Georgia Nicolson."
"So, to celebrate the new me,"
I've decided what I want to do for my birthday party this year.
"I want a proper party in a club, with a D.J."
"You're not old enough to get into a club, never mind hire one out for a party."
"If you haven't noticed, I'm a woman now."
I wear a bra!
Bob.
Are you really trying to damage me permanently?
"There's no way that you are having a party in a club where there's drinking, and it's full of randy men."
Ferhat's daughter.
He wanted to make the guy stay away from his daughter.
- Did the boy harm his daughter or something?
- No.
It's just jealousy.
He wanted to give him a scare.
You know.
- Hello Aziz.
- How can I help you commissary?
"Ferhat's daughter, Dennis Norton."
Check if she entered the country lately.
It can be under either Dennis Norton or Deniz Çoşkun name.
"English passport or Turkish passport, okay?"
- I'll check the last three months.
"- Okay, let me know."
"- Hello, Demet."
- I've just seen your message.
I was suffering in wonder why she didn't reply to my message.
"It said ""call me"" in your message."
What happened?
"What do you mean ""what happened""?"
We didn't see each other in days.
I want to see you.
"Even if it's for only 5 minutes, please."
"Give me some time, please."
I don't feel okay with this.
"I know, I feel uneasy too."
But I miss you.
This can't go on when Kuzey is this much opposed to it.
We can't do it without his consent.
What consent are you talking about?
"Each passing day, his barks are getting thicker."
Just wait.
Woman:
Here father.
(Man:
Is it clean?) Woman:
"Yes, of course."
Man:
Then do as I tell you.
Fold the sari into eight folds.
Woman:
"All right, father."
Man:
"And you, you count that she does it right."
(Boy:
"All right, grand-dad.)"
Man:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
Woman:
"Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari."
Man:
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
(Applause)
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
Please don't freeze me!
Please...
One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.
"My friends, I think we rushed events a bit."
And how!
"Why see in the next New Year, when there's still so much interesting left in this year?"
Sweet bananas and pineapples.
Oh yes.
And my Birthday.
Then the future hasn't come yet?
Not yet.
"In his things we found fishing lines, hooks and lures!"
What do you think he was going to do with all that?
I think we've all had quite enough.
I have therefore decided to expel Inochkin.
I'm done.
"""No exit without permission."""
- Kostya!
Kostya!
- Come back to visit!
- Come back to visit!
- Comrade Dynin?
- That's my name.
- Comrade Dynin.
"- What ""comrade Dynin?"""
- It's not fair.
I think...
- You think too much.
- What's so horrible about what he did?
- How long have you worked here?
"- All right, this is my first year..."
- Want some fruit punch?
- But he's a swimmer!
2:12 on his back!
- Those who don't swim don't drown.
It's the other ones who drown.
You think it was easy for me to tear Inochkin from my heart like that?
"- Then bring him back, comrade Dynin!"
I'll take full responsibility!
"- All right, calm down."
- Then I'll go get him?
- Wait till I'm finished talking!
- You're all flustered about this Inochkin.
"What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack?"
"Pretty swanky, are they not?"
And Twilight!
I made this dress for you... ...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.
"Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it."
"Oh, and it turned out BEAUTlFUL, don't you think?"
"Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy."
It just sings spring!
"And Pinkie Pie, look!"
Pink!
Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
Wow...
-They're...
"-Yeah, they're..."
They sure are...
-...sumth'n.
-Yes!
Something.
I love something!
Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter?
Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"
"The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah, all the lads calling me down... ...to get pissed out of me fucking tree."
When I think of that... ...I think about getting back into it.
"And Shannon and Ben, they remind me."
There's more to life than all this.
"Get all those juicy details, mate?"
- Writing it all down?
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!
Oi!
Oi.
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!
- Don't tell him nothing!
"- I said, are you sure?"
What?
You already knew.
"All I know is he studied journalism, right, at Harvard."
But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.
That's just a fucking diary.
Ned saw you at the Times with a couple of journos.
That was my dad.
He's the journalist.
You knew that.
"His old man's a fucking journo, and you knew about it."
"- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov."
- You what?
"When I was at the war front, he saved my life once  so I brought him back and treat him like my own son."
You've ruined his hunting game.
Let's go.
Now.
I'm so afraid. * sarcastically *
What?
A prince?
He is nothing but a thug!
You are unworthy of being here!
You there!
Take your hands off of him.
What have I done to deserve this?
Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?
Why you still...!
Take him out and lock him in the storage.
Yes sir.
"Is that you, Kwon-yoo?"
Please forgive me.
I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.
Please forgive me.
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.
What?
What are you worried about?
Don't worry.
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?
I was trying to broaden my view like  others by not focusing on study alone...
Was I really asking you that?
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?
Is it because of his daughter?
Only the Shin family...
She is the first one that I like...
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
"Alright, woohoo!"
"Go, Rarity!"
Rarity?
You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
I'm never coming out!
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony.
I used to be respected.
I made dresses.
"Beautiful, beautiful dresses!"
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!
"You're not a laughingstock, Rarity..."
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in... ...whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
"Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!"
I'M SO PATHETlC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
Here it is.
That's right.
"This is the elevator at the Market Parking Garage in Roanoke, Virginia."
This elevator has been made famous right here.
Here we go.
"Here we are at six, which is burned out."
Just your basic Dover elevator.
"For all of those of you at Dover Elevators, a good brand of elevator."
Now we're gonna go back down to one.
All right.
Now it's time to go off to work.
[engine turning]
Wasn't that fun?
Gray:
You know how much strength it takes to rebel?
Ha.
"So this is a night in the life of S. Gray, man."
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the coach... with nobo--
Grinding my ass off every day.
Shorties not enjoying their mother.
Man not enjoying his wife or his woman--his lady.
[baby wailing]
"Just bullshit, man."
Alpha male trapped in and locked in through religion and politics.
"Soon enough, man, my plans will all come into perfection."

Tommorow they're going to visit the school.
Why don't you accompany them?
(Daniela) Of course!
(Roberto) But MOM!
"(Berta) well then, it's all set."
"They are going to the hotel San Diego.IF you are going with them, then you can talk about your plans for tomorrow."
(Julia) I can do that.
And that is how Julio and I met Linda.
"Julio, you're not coming?"
"Now I remember, I can't."
Tommorow I have a soccer game and now I have to go to the gym.
"Excuse me, but I can't accompany you now."
"See you later, eh?"
Julio is a great player in the team.
He's a great athlete.
Benito Juarez Preparatory School
The following day my sister Daniela take Linda and her mom on a tour of our school.
I'm staying here.
I need to talk with the principal.
"(Linda) Oh, ok Mom."
Daniela is going to show me the school.
Perfect!
Then you can tell everything to your classmates at school.
Until I see you later.
You guys study English here right?
"Yes, but also their culture, history, and everything!"
And my school in San Antonio we study Spanish.
"The culture, and history of Mexico."
(also)
Our school have a lot in common!
"Look, there's Julio."
"Hi,"
Thank you.
Good day.
"Oh, I wish I didn't come here."
"Don't say that, I'm glad you are with Sami Amca today."
Sami Amca.
- How is Kuzey?
Is he well?
- He's alright.
- How is his morale?
- Make a guess.
Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?
"- No, thank God."
But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.
"Inshallah, did you give him the letters?"
I left them with the warden they need to control them first.
- Of course.
"- Okay then, let's go."
"""Every soul will taste death"""
"Kazım Beyefendi, in his last trip... ... asks for two things from you, our dear community."
He's dating Carla.
This's not good.
"First of all, I already told her I got a girlfriend."
"Second, you just put your bare lips on my ear."
How is it going?
I'm....
"JD, I know. he won't stop talking about you."
I'm Jennifer.
"Mmm, Jennifer."
Do you really spend everyday saving children lives?
Tell the nice lady.
I do what I can.
I know two things to be true about bars.
"One they are always packed the week of thanksgiving,"
"And two, put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth"
"I was laughing so hard, milk was coming of my nose."
I was tripped over IV and blood shot over everyone
A little got on my nose.
Every damn day saving those children.
Who wants margaritas?
"Dube, less blood, more fruity drinks."
Right.
That's the thing about Turk.
He hasn't changed a bit since college.
He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
"Dude, this girl's pretty hot."
"So try not to blow it,okay?"
Why do you say that?
"Because you're like a 24 convenient store , you never close."
That sounds a Fat Albert like joke
Don't worry about it man.
"I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying."
"""Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."""
(Whistling)
Thank you.
(Applause)

I'm afraid to open any doors around here.
"And five, six, seven, eight."
- And one.
- Liberian Girl
You came and you changed my world
"You know, Whoopie, it'd be a blast if Michael asked me to dance."
Liberian girl
- It's the most stupid thing-- - He went on Oprah's show the next day.
He told everybody I was going to make him into another Michael Jackson.
Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
Two lovers in a scene
Then she says Do you love me
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"
Who's directing this?
Maybe we could have some rolled up with some kind of string... that I could like pull him up.
Liberian girl
"I know this is kind of loose, but do you know what we're supposed to be doing?"
All I know is that Michael called me.
"I guess when he gets here, he'll let me know what we're supposed to do."
- You won.
"- Well, hey-- Is Mike here?"
"No, but I think Bubbles is here."
That's one of the Cosby kids.

"K-kinda busy, K-kinda busy"
"Sorry, I'm ignoring you, I'm kinda busy."
"Just a second,"

"My dudes are at my place and we are kinda busy,"

That was a mistake!

Ticket that!

What's good about it?
Sorry!
It was a long drive.
Ha ha ha!
"Um, we have our registration."
You got room in the trash for Mama?
Unless you want my crust.
"Trust me, you don't want that."
My sister and I are on the list.
"And, um, we have our mom with us today."
Does she have a reservation with us?
I have a reservation about your haircut.
It should be under Turner.
P F-ing U!
Either something died in this...
"Ma, I'll put you back in the car so fast."
Oh G-d!
What did I?
Didn I tell you not to see him anymore?
But who am I talking to?
God...
God damn both of you!
What if someone saw you together?
Huh?
"Call that ****, tell him to come here immediately!"
Right now!
He wants to break up.
"If you let a slander separate you like this, maybe you should break up."
"Really, just end it."
"- He wouldn't do such a thing, mom, would he?"
- Of course he wouldn't.
How can you even think that?
Did I do anything to you?
My memory about that night is so blurry.
I don't remember anything.
- Shut up.
- Believe me that I...
Shut it!
- Fatmagül...
- Don't say my name!
"- I swear, I didn't do anything to you."
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear your voice!
"- I can't do such a thing, I wouldn't."
- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."

"Yes, it is!"
"Great, byyyeeeee"
"No, Jean!"
"Stop, Jean, stop!"

Yeah yeah
"Brings back memories, hmm?"
Yeah yeah
Which memories does it bring back?
Yeah!
Alright well I'm going to hit on every guy here and sleep with the first one I meet
"Jean, go screw yourself!"
Cool
"But, Loulou, can you hear what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, yeah, you told me to go screw myself and that you were gonna sleep with the first guy you meet"
"Alex, just because the music is loud doesn't mean what you're saying suddenly became interesting, you see?"
It's boring
Do you have a mint?
Want one?
"No, that's for you"
Look.
What's he doing?

"Everything's lost, Kanji."
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.
Rolex.
It's a Rolex.

Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that a Rolex watch you're wearing?

It's worth 10.
Mr. Kanji.
I am sure you read the terms and conditions.. ..before reading the policy.
"Not at all, sir."
Your officer asked me to sign at the places marked.. ..and I did so.
How irresponsible you are.
"What happened, sir?"
"Your policy insures you against.. ..accidents like theft, fire, fraud."
Right.
That's what we opted for.
But not against Act of God.
Act of God?
"See, it's written here clearly."
Conditions apply.
My glasses.. - ln the event of loss or damage to the property.. ..the insurance company is not liable to pay.. ..any amount if the damage is caused by act of God.
And here are your signatures.
It's written in such small letters.
And nobody reads that.
What is 'Act of God'?
lncidents that are not caused by humans.
Like?
"- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder."
Hey!
Do something about this bag...
"I packed, but I'm not sure."
"Take a look, hyung-nim."
That's alright.
I will be back real soon.
I will buy the things that I need.
"By the way, what is going on?"
Why suddenly..?
I don't know.
"Get going. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
Her phone is turned off.
Who?
Man Ok.
Stylist Jang.
"Today, she went with Tae Ik for a scheduled radio broadcast."
Radio?
Why does the stylist have to go along for radio?
Today is a live-broadcast radio.
"Last time, Tae Ik went dressed in anything and around fifty thousand malicious comments were posted."
"""A Date in the Middle of the Day""."
"Today's guest is the cool guy from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Lee Tae Ik."
We will shortly come to you with live radio.
Commercial!
"Your style is fabulous today, Tae Ik."
Am I okay?
Good.

Stand by.
"The chic guy who has captured the hearts of women,  he is more charming every time you see him,"
The most popular among the popular!
He's TlNY!
"Even the mythical creature he's based on, the Tsuchinoko, is typically described as around 10 to 30 inches long- tops!"
"But in the official games, little Dunsparse is- er-"
WHAT?!
4 foot 11 inches???
But. . .uh
Why you make him so little?
I-I don't understand.
"Joining Dunsparce in the things-that-are-way-longer than-you'd-think club is Dratini, another serpant like Pokémon."
He's the first pokémon in his line so I've always thought of him to be the little guy.
WRONG!
5 foot 11 inches.
Longer than the average height of humanity.
"Also, this was always weird to me."
Dratini:
6ft long.
Dragonaire:
13ft long.
Dragonite:
7ft long.
Where?
Where does it all go???
Let's check out some spherical pokémon.
"I've always pictured guys like Glalie, Fortess and Gastly to be around a foot long or a little bit bigger than a basketball."
NOPE!
These guys are actually all 4 to 5 ft long.
See this guy?
See that giant ball?
That's a 5ft beach ball! and THAT is what your Glalie is gonna look like in real life.
"And yes, It is terrifying!"
"At last, at almost 48 feet long, Wailord is by far the longest pokémon in existence- over 17 ft longer than the second longest, Steelix."
"But weight-wise, Wailord doesn't make ANY sense."
I do not understand.
What are you talking about?
Ayten did not wantto answer the phone?
Certainly something happened to her.
quick Recovery.
"Thank you, sweetie."
"Ah, that life is strange.Look at him..."

I have the gold. supply the goods to these people.
You all can leave.
"Thanks, shekhar!"
"- Thanks, shekhar!"
"No! shekhar.. till the time I don""t see the gold.. ..l can""t believe you."
You doubt the party.
Forget all this!
We have been exposed.
The police are searching everywhere.
Anything can happen in the future!
Even thieves should be honest! shekhar!
"I don""t tolerate my humiliation!"
"Tiger too can""t tolerate disobedience!"
What do you care?
"I can""t work in this party!"
"I can""t work in this syndicate! settle my account!"
"Account! kaka sir, I have to settle many scores with you! congratulations! syndicate""s message!"
A big deal!
What deal?
"Whose message is this? sheikh.. king of smuggler""s message!"
"What""s the message?"
"Gold worth crores are coming to lndia from Bangkok. very good! chhota sheikh, very good!"
Now you people will have to seize the gold from the ship!
But.. nobody besides Tiger can do this.
"The syndicate is broken, kaka sir! chhota sheikh, where are you going?"
Talk about the deal with me.
- How can l?
"lts syndicate""s rule that the deal.. ..should be discussed only with Tiger."
Goodbye!
"Tell me, sheikh!"
"Tiger singh, kaka sir pleaded a lot with me."
"But I didn""t pay any heed."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
"Cemre, you're back in your old neighborhood."
We'll see each other more often now.
- Don't say words that you will regret.
- Go to hell.
"You're nuts, girl."
I'm telling you.
Bye bye!
What are you doing?
It's so not like you.
Why do you even argue with her?
She does this just to annoy you.
And you swallow her bait.
She says Sami Amca insisted.
It's her who is dying to go there.
"Mom, sometimes I want to jump down her throat."
Let me tell you beforehand.
We can't give you February 14.
We're fully booked that day.
"Oh, what is on 14th of February?"
Valentine's Day.
Everyone wants to marry that day.
That's why.
"Okay then, give us any day that is available."
Not the 5th of the month though.
Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?

"Hey, Beth."
How are we doing?
Beth Seaton:
Good.
I wanted to come over and talk to you a little bit about your new project.
Tell me a little bit about your new USDA project.
It's so exciting!
"It's like a half a million dollars, right?"
Win Phippen:
Yes it is.
It's a quite a coup for the University.
Beth Seaton:
It is.
Win Phippen: ...and my research program.
I'm quite excited about it.
It's very unique.
"It's not a hard core, sort of, science research project."
"It's more plant-breeding education, and with a component of science related to it."
And the real neat thing about it is that is has
Just to feel better about yourselves
Ahmed from the Bank
Hello?
Yes Mr.Ahmed
What?
When did this happen?
Okay Mr.Ahmed
I'll pass by
Thanks
What's wrong?
Dad took all his belongings from the bank
What?
"I don't know, let's go where to?"
To see why dad did this
Mr.Sameh
What's wrong?
I wanted to tell you something before you go
Just say it!
I entered the room and saw him in the bathroom
"His bag was open, I don't know why, and I found a lot of contracts and papers and thought I should tell you"
What contracts?
Donating the car and this house after he dies and he's gonna sell our land
Oh god!
And when did he do that?
The dates took place the same period when he was gone
And where are these contracts?
Upstairs in his bag
What have we ever done to deserve this?
Where is he now?
Upstairs
No...we need to put an end to this
Come on lets go
Tonight I am hanging out with Emily. woman:
Okay. man:
But I was planning on telling her exactly how I feel about her.
And then I don't know.
So I was calling my mother to see-- what should I say to this woman?
[woman laughing]
Okay.
I don't know.
"I just think that, you know-- just concentrate on the fact that, you know, you have very, very high feelings of esteem for her, that she's somebody that you've always admired. man:"
"""Esteem""?"
Is that the word I should use?
Esteem?
You think she'd like that? woman:
Yeah.
Whatever. man:
I just don't know if that's-- woman:
You hold her in very high regard. man:
Ok--I don't know if those-- woman:
She's a special person in your life. man:
Okay.
I'll try all that.
Hey.
I am on the train now.
This is my friend Emily.
[romantic music]
"Uh, hello, ""Life In A Day."""
"I'm still with Emily, and we're still hanging out in Chicago."
"Um, this is..."
"We--we just came out of this place, which was cool."
"But, uh, I'm gonna leave this thing on in case anything gets climactic."
man:
"Theresa, look at me."
"They probably make it up just to make people afraid of it,"
'cause they're mean.
I like it because it's so scary.
It's so fascinating about the whole mythology stuff about it.
"There's mystery behind it,"
"'cause you don't know if it's real or not, kinda like Bigfoot."
It's a whole community.
People can talk about it together and whatever.
I think it's a way for people to connect.
"(Finebros) One of the main things people do with this game is they'll film themselves playing it, and then upload their reaction to the Internet."
"So, we're gonna show you a quick montage of people playing ""Slender."""
(man in video) ...just to get me.
"Oh, dude, it's safe."
Safe.
- Aah!
"Oh, my goodness."
"- God, scared me."
(people in video screaming) (laughs)
"- Destiny, please."
"- Tobuscus, yeah."
- Aah!
What the hell?!
No!
- (laughs) I feel you.
- (groaning) - PewDie-- PewDiePie.
- (screams) - (gasps)
I'm happy these people reacted worse than I did.
"(man in video) Oh, God."
Open the (bleep) door!
- (laughs) - What the (bleep)?
What is this?
- (screaming) - His head.
Anybody want some granite?
"My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house."
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
"I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict."
"And in four years, Ken has done two things."
"He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything."
Good morning.
Ken:
Good morning.
Randy:
Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken:
Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
"Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist."
"And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks."
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Welcome to Tea Time.
(whispering) I have something really important to tell you.
(whispering) So come close.
(whispering) Closer.
(whispering) Closer ... (whispering) Ok!
(whispering) Today.
Is.
My ...
BlRTHDAY!
YAY!
Today is my Birthday!
I am so excited you're here to celebrate with me!
I have a very good idea.
Would you like to do a special birthday dance with me today?
You would?
I would be so excited.
Thank you!
"First, I have to put on my special birthday tiara!"
Great!
"And secondly, I'm going to teach you the birthday dance moves."
"First, we're going to take our hands and we're going to put them on our knees."
And we're all going to bounce like this ...
Bounce ... bounce ... bounce ... bounce
That's good!
"Next, we're going to take our hands and put them right here by our face."
Cheese.
And you're going to wave from side to side like this ...
Good job everybody!
And for our last dance move we're going to turn in a circle.
Can you turn in a circle without getting dizzy and falling down?
I bet you can!
Let's try it.
"Madam Noh, please help me."
Please help me find my daughter quietly.
Do you know who took your daughter?
That...
You should know him as well.
The one who was killed as an insurgent.
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister!
Hong Gil Dong!
Is he still alive?
You must find her quietly for me.
She is the only daughter of the core of all power!
No one must ever know she is with him.
And everyone that is found with her...
Silence them forever.
Do you understand?
So the one who blocked the police was Hong Gil Dong?
Did the prince know this?
He told us that someone would block the police so that we can attack Choi Chul Joo.
I am sure he knew.
So the reason he gave up the explosives and stopped the ship was... ... because of Hong Gil Dong!
He has interfered with our plans yet again.
- Go and find the Councilor's daughter.
"- Yes, Madam!"
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister and the only daughter of the Second State Councilor...?
We may have found a better weapon than the explosives.
- Search the area carefully!
"- Yes, Sir."
- Search the empty houses too!
"- Yes, Sir."
Hurry!
Miss Eun Hye!
"For you, I will lay down my life!"
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
I saw.. and along with that inflation.
It affects each and everyone.
"Don""t cry."
Because of this..
"Because of this, l never got married."
I never got married. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
You are asleep.
And the enemy is alert.
Wake up. otherwise you will be in trouble.
Hey!
That country will be robbed.
"That country will be robbed, where the guards go to sleep."
Where the guards go to sleep.
The green signal has been given.
Jamal Pasha has the goods.
Leave immediately.
31 1 .
3 North.
7.
"lt""s gold worth 5 crores."
- I will leave immediately.
No!
"The goods won""t be delivered through the port."
Already the police are after us. so what?
The police are in our fist!
"Don""t talk nonsense!"
Someone's coming!
So this is where you've been?
Shall I paint you a portrait?
It's for free.
Can't you take that off?
Wait!
"Okay, I'll paint you like that."
"But next time you'll take it off, right?"
Take it off?
This punk...
He's got a weird taste...
You punk... what are you smirking about?
- Aren't you hot?
-Wouldn't you be?
- I'm roasting in here.
"- If I were you, I'd take it off."
I'm dying of curiosity.
Are you a man by any chance?
There are plenty of guys with long hair.
And lots of guys have pretty legs.
Right... men don't wear bras
"All right, stop it."
You little cutie... don't be so shy.
I know...
Your face is really ugly!
I'm joking.
You're so cute.
This is what I like about my job.
Jin-woo...
"If you don't show up, we're through."
We apologizes to customers that the fire alarm has begun.
Please evacuate to the...
Front side of the building Don't move
I'm five seconds away 4 seconds 3... 2...
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Are you okay?
I thought you were going to propose!
I thought you wanted a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant.
And we never play games with fires.
How could you not know that?
What?
"Hey, Lee Jin-woo..."
The movie's starting.
Shhhh.
"Hwi-chan, look at me."
Did you do your homework?
Then you better go home right away and do it.
Don't play on the computer.
"Do the homework first, okay?"
I have to stay here for a few days.
"You'll be fine on your own, right?"
You won't?
When have I ever not been alone?
"Yes, my Hwi-chan can do great on his own."
Your mom will do well too.
And I'll try to do better once I get out of here.
But you need to promise me one thing.
Show me your diary every day.
After school I went to the hospital to see Mom.
"Mom is hurt, so she has to stay there a few days."
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and show Mom my diary as I promised.
It's nice...
"Now Mom doesn't work late, she doesn't drink, and I can see her whenever I want."
"Well, let me say first of all thank you for haveing my mama at the White House [oh, yeah] for the Easter, that was a beautiful event and she was so [applause] and she was so thrilled to be there."
It was great having her [applause] she's terrific
We even got Bo in there.
"Bo's there, Tony's there..."

It was my mother's dying wish.. ..to take the entire 'Bhajan Mandli' group along with their family.. ..on a trip to Badrinath.
Please do come.
Of course.
Please join us on the trip.. ..and pray for my mother's soul.
My mother.
Why do souls become restless after they die?
"I mean, once you're dead it's the end of all problems."
Why become restless?
That's not it.
Suppose the deceased has a unfulfilled wish.
Then his son will fulfil it.
You won't go on the trip.
Get that.
Her mother was in the hospital for two years.
And he didn't even come take a look.
He was making dollars in America.
This charade is for the world.
Not for his mother's soul.
[Laughing]
Ohhh...
"-	Yeah, I just don't know if it can be done."
"ThorZaiN moving forward, eating another Psionic Storm in the hands of a High Templar."
Another High Templar!
"Doing a nice Psi Storm, but ThorZaiN is trying to dance out of that."
He has a lot of Ghosts and EMP here.
"Dropping two EMP's, checking out that Dark Templar actually."
"But MC is coming back with a scary force, that is going to sandwich.."
-	Cloak!
-	And look at this!
"The Ghost goes trying to drop EMP, and they do on the majority of the units."
"This is about as good as it can get for ThorZaiN, doing some drop ship micro actually."
Taking..
Oh My God!
-	Ohhhhhh....
I think we should just have a moment of silence and hold hands at what we just saw here.
What is going on!?
"- Alright, we have Medivacs loading."
- Oh my God.
"Watch this, he is going to drop all over the mech army, this is going to be so sick cool!"
"Oh, I am so excited."
SlayerS BoxeR!
You are the funniest player ever!
- He is moving out.
"He unsieges, he may siege up again, but when he sees that many Vikings, he is going to have to land the Vikings!"
- He is..
Here comes the Medivacs!
- Oh my God!
"- Dropping all over those Siege Tanks, just crushing trough!"
"SlayerS BoxeR has out strategized GanZi, completely!"
-	Marines really want to catch the Corruptors.
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.
"But I pray that... ... you get back your son, Suraj."
From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye
"The easterly brings hope, like the birds soaring in the sky"
"God willing, some day, you will fly with the clouds"
"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.
Soon I'll control everything.

Your potbelly is protruding
Let me take you somewhere to reduce weight
I'm hefty
What's wrong?
"Sister, you've been beaten out of shape."
Go now
Move. . . move!
Can't you hear the horns blaring?
Can't you hear so many horns blaring?
Thief?
Where is the thief?
Who died?
- No one died.
"Not thief, I said blare."
Are you deaf?
"You speak loudly, and very fast."
So I don't understand anything.
Your moustache covers your mouth.
Move your lips slowly.
"When I see your lip movement, I'll understand."
I don't understand easily.
God !
- What did you pick?
Show me your hand.
I didn't pick anything.
"You've met me here, don't meet me in heaven."
You live in that building?
Which floor?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Look!
Why are so many vehicles parked here?
"So many horns are blaring, can't you hear?"
Are you deaf?
The traffic has got jammed.
Are you blind?
Who called me blind?
Looks like a gang who calls me blind is out.
Who are you calling blind?
"That was that then,-"
- No!
It is ... another!
Hahahaha!
I am going absolutely crazy.
People were so excited about Grant's new product that he started getting requests
left and right for his glasses wipers and spray nozzles.
"So, he started to keep a"
list of everyone who would want a pair very soon.
"By the end of 1 day, 36 of his friends had begged him for glasses wipers and 11 of those people each said that they would also like a pair of nozzles to go with their glasses wipers."
"It's... the pop... from, uh, the pizza place?"
It's -- looks like a person.
He matches the color of the restaurant.
That is the coffee logo.
That is a parade elephant.
That is the Disney.
Those are... little... worms.
"That looks like an ""M""."
"But upside down, ""M""s are ""W""s!"
That is the Apple Store logo!
It has a bite of an apple in it.
"Ooh, looks like the 'merican flag."
A bell.
"Uh, outside space."
Looks like a shooting star?
With a planet.
An eye.
"Chili, and it has an ""S"" next to it, and chilis are spicy."
That looks like a beach ball.
Beach balls are very colorful.
The GE logo.
That's where my grandpa works.

Amy:
Oh no!
DG:
Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?
Come out soon !
Did you see?
- Yes sir.
Sexy figures in the pool.
"Not that figure, you fools!"
Look.
"Oh, I get it."
"You wanted this anchor job for yourself, and this is your way of getting back at me."
You'd let your own sister go down in flames just to satisfy your petty jealousy.
All right... but this is the last time I bail you out.
You're the greatest.
"Afterwards, I'll tell Collins you wrote the stories."
"He'll see how good you are, he'll let you write all my stories."
Me in front of the camera and you behind.
We could be a team.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
Jessica.
Have you seen Elizabeth?
Nope.
"Ten minutes, people."
"Jessica, I need to proof your copy."
"Sorry, Mr. C. Liz is still Xeroxing it."
"OK, looks good, Camera One."
"Camera Two, zoom out."
Camera Two?
"Hello, Camera Two?"
"What is that, Manny?"
"Oh, sorry."
"Elizabeth, where have you been?"
I need my stories!
These are blank.
They are?
Silly me.
I must have mixed up the stories I wrote with the ones you wrote.
Is there some kind of irony here?
How can you stand there and pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?
Practice?
"You knew how much I wanted to be anchor, and you switched the tapes just so you could get the job."
There's a place where you throw in coins and make wishes.
I made many wishes.
First wish was 'Please let B.A.P have a hit.'
Second wish was 'Please let our hair designer get married'
And the third wish was 'Please let our make-up artist get married too'
"I wasn't going to say this but, honestly, I wished for many chances"
To see many BABAz.
I think I threw in coins worth about 5 dollars.
"Well most importantly, the MV has to come out well."
We have to finish off the concerts in
Korea and Japan successfully too.
Take this energy from Central Park...
This is awesome.
None
Americans seem to know how to appreciate the small things in life.
We're so used to internet and machines.
We should stop getting used to them
And become appreciative people.
"I will try, too."
We're going to Time Square now.
Yong Guk is filming his scene at Time Square.
I've only seen it on TV.
Like in 'lnfinite Challenge' kind of TV shows. or other entertainment programs.
I've always wanted to visit.
And I get to go today.
I'm excited.
"Yo, New York City."
"We're here, in NY."
There's so much to do.
"Hogwarts kid, move."
We're here in NY.
I said move Hogwart!
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
There is no beyond.
"Now, it is time to see the sun."
We won't give up our hopes.
We will see beautiful days.
"Narin, how are you sweetheart?"
I talked to the man in the Ministry.
You should have seen how he attended to me...
He will take me to the lunch soon.
Hello?
"Narin, do you hear me?"
This is under the shadow...
Let it see some sun...
Come on...
Mmmm!
Smells so good!
Right out from the oven...
"Who eats gets fat, who doesn't eat becomes sorry..."
"Doctor Bey, since you said you would leave early, I packed yours."
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.
No matter what we have done all this time He only showed some reaction to Narin.
Looks like he recognized her from the picture...
Huh!
"Come, come Duriye..."
You don't have any strength anymore.
Take a sit.
"Mom, are you ok?"
"Duriye Hanim, would you like to have a cold cherry syrup?"
Yes...
"Maybe, it will calm us down a little bit."
There is nothing to do Yasar.
"After all this time, if he only recognized Narin from a picture..."

Government is releasing Jackie six months early... ...because of his good conduct.
"Inspector Varma, if government will allow me... ...to commit one murder, I'd kill Jackie first."
That snake can bit us anytime.
Damodar!
Keep an eye on him.
"Yes, I'm eyeing him, uncle."
I'm eyeing him.
But now I'll keep strict watch.
Strict!
Who?
Jackie?
You mean Jaikishan?
He left 2 hours before.
"""My love, my beloved..."""

"""I'm your dream-boy."
"You are my love."""
He's panicked as well.
He'll probably say what I've already told you.
I wasn't going to answer him anyway.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
"Don't go, man."
It's okay.
I got it.
Don't talk to anybody.
"And tell the girl not to, as well."
"Thank you very much, Cemil Bey."
Much appreciated.
We're done here.
Thank God we had a connection here.
We don't have to wait anymore.
Your visa is in your pocket.
Let's go book a flight now.
So that you'll waste no time.
Every day you spend here is against you.
- Hello.
"- Good evening Meryem Hanım, how are you?"
How am I...
I am packing his stuff.
Maybe he'll need them in Istanbul.
I've spoken to a friend of mine who lives in Istanbul.
"You know, the one I mentioned before who might help Kerim out."
"- Oh, thank you."
- I explained to him the situation.
"- Of course, only the bits he must know."
- Thank you.
"Thankfully he said ""I'll help him, make him call me."""
He'll find a place for him to stay.
I'll give you his number.
"Remember, it's all in the presentation!"

And that's the Art of the Dress!
"Oh, Opal."
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!
Wow.
They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
"Thank you, Rarity."
Are you as happy with the as we're?
"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy."
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
"Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him..."
"He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
"Whoa, Nelly!"
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
She'll escape.

Good luck!
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
"On February the 4th, when the trial is over and you are free."
"I will hug you so tight, that... ... no one will be able to untie us."
Take care until that day.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
If you want to be my girlfriend then you won't hold a weapon again.
- Zeynep.
- Let us go.
I said let us go.
Do I stick it in here?
We'll leave a row empty.
Then we'll add 4 rows.
Okay.
- Am I doing alright?
- You're doing wonderful.
"""Don't wait for me tonight."
"It's impossible for me come."""
"Now do the turns, and finish the crossed parts."
- How does it look?
"- It looks beautiful, canım."
The idiot dropped it at the house when he was fighting Kuzey.
I forgot that I kept it so that it wouldn't get lost.
Then I found it again in one of the boxes as I moved to my new place.
So I brought it  thought maybe it's something important.
You did well.
This was my father's.
Atilla Sinaner's.
He had bought this specially to give it as a present to Güney.
That fool couldn't hold onto it.
- One more?
"- No, I will go."
- Where?
Let's hope the best for them.
Amin.
"I told them, they shouldn't come all the way back here."
"So, I'll just have what will be delivered to Kuzey."
And I'll take it to them.
Boot licker.
That's good.
You thought well.
"Actually, Sami Amca wanted me to present at the jail as well."
"He said, it would make Kuzey very happy even if I'm just waiting at the door."
"But, I'll see."
Where did Sami Amca say that to you?
In your dream?
"Cemre, what are you talking about?"
Silly girl.
"I got used to it, Gülten Teyze."
This is just a sample of our dialogues with Cemre.
I bet you took a day off from work for this.
"Dear, why don't you go and put the cookies in the oven?"
I got some other stuff to do as well.
You don't worry about me.
"- So give me what you have, and I'll take it to them."
"- No need, I'll do it myself."
"What, are you going too?"
Come on...
"But mom, it's not ready anyway."
What should I do?
- Rush it while Zeynep is poising over me?
"- Well, I can't wait, if it's not ready."
"Also, she might put it into trash or change my letter."
"I won't take the risk, thanks."
"Okay, Cemre..."
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
So sorry
But
I'll buy tuna sashimi if you come.
The best kind
The best!
I'm dying for fresh tuna
I'm sorry
I'm really sorry
She never went out once with us in over a year
She's a Hikikomori
- She doesn't shut herself at home - Someday she will
"- We're having tuna, right?"
"- No, sausages"
You can't mess with tuna like that!
Come on!
I want tuna!
The best!
"I'll buy tuna, then!"
"A big can, that is"
Roll it around
"Happy birthday, Sweetie I sent a gift"
What Mom?
- A husband - What?
I signed you up at a marriage agency to meet men
You didn't have to do that
How's work?
When will you become a magician?
It's just a part-time job
How's everything there?
Good
Great air and nice people
It's so beautiful here
"I don't think you have any, I don't seen Corel draw ."
"You know, I don't think that we focused."
"In that case , I mean Painter, which is actually used for children's publications."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, we haven't, I don't think that we ."
"Oh, no."
You do have .
I can tell with the others as well.
"Uh, I missed the update, so you do have essential training in teacher twelve, not four, this came out the,"
"February, the fifteenth."

"So I do, I did have not."
All right.

"And we have um, finished shooting, um."
"Uh, course the shooting with the Nikon D800."
So that will come out in November.
"Oh, November."
"Okay, great!"
"Yeah, yeah."
"So you can spend your um, your holidays."
Watching movies.
Okay.
Exactly. .
"Uh, that's good."
That's good.
That's good.
"Um, okay. ,, ."
"Uh, do you have any questions for me or anything that you would like to add that you feel would be particularly helpful for us as we look at 2013?"
Um.
No.
Bye.
Excuse me...
My brother?
- What's the matter?
- Where is he?
Tell me what's wrong.
I talked to the doctor and he told me everything was okay and he was stable in a coma.
Was his condition serious?
I haven't been told anything about a transfer.
"Shit, Malena."
- What's the matter?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch.
What is it?
I feel fucking fine.
What day is it today?
September 10.
"2001, right?"
"I mean I didn't sleep til 2007 or anything, did l?"
You were out for 2 weeks.
You know what?
I have a feeling things are going to get better from now on.
"Shit, this is the 21st century."
We can learn from what we did wrong in the 20th.
"Starting tomorrow, the world will be a better place."
Trust me and you'll see.
"Pablo, there's something I haven't told you that you should know."
THE APPEARED
We are just doing future value of annuities.
"And I'll show you now, why this is such a cool thing."
"And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do two examples, both for future value of an annuity."
And whats the other thing we do?
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
"Second man, out of shot:"
"Look at his face, this filth."
[One man laughs.]
Another man:
They shot us with live ammunition
Cameraman:
One bullet in his leg and one in his stomach.
Another man:
"For God to bless you, put him in the morgue."
Man out of shot:
Pick him up with me.
Several voices:
"Slowly, carefully."
"A soul, a soul."
One man:
"This is a human, in the end this is a soul..."
Another man:
"Arrange his arms properly, arrange his arms."
Cameraman:
Was he shot yesterday?
Or today?
It looks like it was from yesterday.
Another man:
Where are his ID cards and stuff?
Cameraman:
"I don't know, search his pockets...the guys must have taken them."
Another man:
"He's not Libyan, I don't think he's Libyan."
Cameraman:
"He's stiffened, you can't arrange his body properly."
"It must be from yesterday, not today."
[music]
"They say Budyonny thought of that, honest to God!"
Here they come...
"And now, the fair-haired Josie!"
Never shall I forget
That wondrous night -
Our two hearts pledged
To a future bright.
You laughed at the fears
That did harry me...
You promised... that night...
To marry me.
"The night flew by, the night flew by,"
The morning brought a leaden sky.
"Night again, night again,"
"This night, alas, a night of rain."
"That night is gone,"
That night is gone.
I cannot believe
That all is over...
The romance is ended.
Sing some more!
More!
Dance for us!
"What's so funny, you apes?"
So you caught the kid.
"Your pa was quicker than you, wasn't he?"
Didn't hurt yourself?
"Come on, let's have some kvass."
You think that Sidor Lyuty's heart don't ache for you war orphans?
It aches all right.
But in times like these we can't help having orphans.
Know how many of my pals your pa did away with?
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
"Ah yes, yes."
I feel like I'm getting permission from you.
You did well.
Good Job.
"Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work."
So try it at least once.
"Eat it, okay?"
Okay. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I feel sorry towards Joon Gu... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm excited but nervous at the same time. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Will I be able to do a good job?
Oh.
Where did it go?
I know I brought it in.
Is this yours?
Mine.
You took it didn't you?
Dummy.
It was on the ground right here.
Who would steal childish panties like those?
I only wear them once in a while.
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.
Even the A Cup must be too big...
Did you stop growing after elementary school?
What did you say?
Hey.
"Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything..."
Isn't that a big problem?
Is it that fun to make fun of me?
"If you don't like living with me, you can just say it."
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.
I'm grumpy?
Yeah.
Why am I doing that?
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
When I saw Suraj I realised that he was your son.
Arun's son.
But when he mentioned his father's name I kept silent.
He still doesn't know that I am his mother.
Promise me that you will never tell him the truth.
He won't learn from me.
But if there is a God he'll surely learn of his real parents someday.
"Hello, mother!"
- God bless you!
Come in.
Suraj's mother has come.
Hello!
Please have a seat.
"Sit, my dear."
I'm pleased to meet you.
"Renu, fetch some tea."
"No, that won't be necessary."
Sit beside me.
It is customary to offer something to a guest.
I have come to meet you as it is customary to do so.
You are the girl's father and I am the boy's mother.
Both of us should consent to this alliance.
Times have changed.
In these times the girl and the boy decide for themselves.
The parentsjust need to give their blessings.
Our happiness lies in their happiness.
For the sake of their happiness we should set the date immediately.
It is my wish too.
She's feeling shy.
- She's a child.
"Vandana, Suraj's mother has come."
She is my sister.
He wants a lot.
"He has big demands, boss!"
He wants 1500 gm of gold.
"You don""t worry."
I have said yes on your behalf!
Fool!
Will your father bring 1500 gm of gold?
Go and bring breakfast!
Bring breakfast for 2 people!
I have come to meet you!
- I was waiting for you!
But sP is always busy!
I wish I was Tiger singh.
You would have then followed me thinking me to be a culprit.
Under this pretext I would have got.. ..the chance to meet my friend.
What do I tell you?
I had come to arrest Tiger singh!
And I myself have landed into trouble.
What trouble?
- A beautiful trouble.
Where did you find her?
- ln your city.
"I couldn""t stop looking at her when I saw her for the first time."
"When I saw her for the second time, I lost my heart."
"When I saw her for the third time, I lost my senses."
Where does she lives?
- ln my heart.
"When we were in London, you would never take.. ..any decision without consulting your friend."
And here you fell in love without informing your friend.
"Till the time I don""t fix the alliance with her parents.. ..how can I give her name to you?"
"Then give me the girl""s father""s name."
Diwan Dinanath!
"Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head."
That's what I wanted to say. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dad!
What?
"Oh,"
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
"No, what good thing?"
"Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us."
Why? &amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;Did something happen?
"Oh, it's not that..."
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
"Then what should we do, Dad?"
"Ah, don't worry."
"It will be resolved, but it will take some time."
"Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while."
Yes.
"I am sorry, Ha Ni!"
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello!
-Hello!
"Oh, you two came?"
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!
"Just get it out, Elena, please."
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
I've seen many skateboarders since yesterday. our youngest Zelo also likes to skateboard.
"Board shop, board shop!"
"Here, it seems like a routine."
"Just as we go bike riding, people here seem to enjoy skateboarding."
Look at the camera.
None
"Since the U.S. is a really big nation, the roads and buildings are all big"
I can tell why Americans are so relaxed.
"I heard in America, people eat burgers and shakes together."
There aren't many people yet in Korea who eat like that.
"- Yes there is, Yong Guk."
"- Yes, Yong Guk eats like that."
We will give it a try today.
"At Shake Shack, they eat burgers and shakes together."
"Usually, people drink coke."
"Well, that's what they say."
Why don't you all try it too?
I hear strawberry shakes are delicious.
I felt this last time too...
The clouds in America are so beautiful.
I think I can see them more clearly because there aren't too many tall buildings. one two three.
We're in America.
"one more time, one more time."
"Hurry, one more time."
"oK, the red light is on."
I'm at a coffee shop.
"This is a mango smoothie, sold only in this store."
None
I don't know where everybody else went.
oh!
There's Zelo.
"Yo, what's up!"
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
God always supports true lovers.
Let's see how much he supports us.
Now you go.
Listen!
My mother had given this locket to me in my childhood.
Radha!
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."
"You are a hero!"""
"Yes, Damodar!"
"Uncle, Jackie has surrendered!"
- What?
"""You can take away my youth..."""
"""But return me my childhood's innocence."""
"""Ever since she has returned, she's silent."""
"""Wonder what could have happened in these 16 days."""
"""That young boy... and this young girl."""
"Aunt, stop it now."
"Since yesterday, we've cried enough."
Don't make her cry more.
Why would I do that?
Society will make her cry when they'll refuse her alliance.
"Sister-in-law, I'd suggest you to get her married... ...before the matter becomes public."
"""That paper boat..."""
Radha!
- Yes.
It seems you are hiding something from me.
"Yes, sister-in-law."
I'm carrying a burden in my heart.
Sister-in-law.
I can't hide anything from you and brother.
I want to share everything with you.
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.
I don't feel I'm driving.
I can't wait til next family gathering.
"Friday, 5pm., I'm sure  I'll get there on time."
Especially wishes.
"Wow, a good driver..."
I bet it's a woman.
"Damn, we spend so much  money on legal music and software."
If I was a driving examiner  I'd also give him a driving licence.
He's driving really well.
I can't wait til I can use toilet in the train.
30 MPH on the fast lane?
Great!
I can't keep up with those  new faces in politics.
"Easy, elderly lady can go."
I'm not in a hurry.
"Damn, my train is too early again!"
Cart is full but I still have  so much money in my wallet!
Vodka?
Not today.
I have to clean after my dog.
I'm driving.
"You know, I love my boss."
Are you crazy?
I'm working tomorrow.
Good that I finish full-time studies.
At least I have a job guaranteed.
I don't remember when  I last ate pork chops.
I'm sick of this sun!
I've always been interested in  tennis and cross-country.
Even when we weren't successful.
I'm sure that everything I study  will be useful on labor market
Socks and sandals?
My poor daughter!
What am I doing?
"He wants to be the king, but what is he doing?"
You mean the one who's stopping the ship is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
"Yes, he's the one who helped both of us."
He's so cool!
So that's why he couldn't reveal his identity to me!
"This is all secret, so please do not let on that you know."
I'll be on my way now.
Wait!
Take me to him!
I don't think just anyone can meet him.
"In that case, please deliver a message for me."
"She says she respects you, Sir Moonlight Black Hat."
"You told her to not do anything, right?"
"Yes, but she said she wants to meet you."
She can't.
It won't be good to be involved with me.
We can't meet.
I really want to meet him again.
He seems like such a cool person!
"If I knew it'll be like this,"
I should have asked me for a business card!
So such a man existed?
He must be a true Joseon hero!
He disguises himself in the moonlight and rescued civilians in need!
I wish I could be like that too.
Then why don't you disguise yourself and go out in the moonlight?
How could I do that?
Why not?
You're a warrior who knows how to fight.
He's Sir Moonlight Black Hat.
"We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling me to help kill Klaus."
What the hell are you doing?
I needed her to know about the coffin.
"And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie."
"So what are you going to do, Stefan?"
Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone?
"Don't tempt me, Elena."
"I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan."
And I need Elena to help me find her.
Find who?
What are you talking about?
I couldn't place her face at first.
Then I realized...
"Oh, my God, Bonnie."
Who is this?
It's my mom.
Los alamitos?
"Um, too old."
Honolulu?
"Ugh, I wish."
How many of these are there?
A lot.
I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
I know we haven't been able to really...
That things have been weird because of Jeremy.
So thank you for helping me with this.
I know you have a lot to deal with.
"There's nothing more important, Bonnie."
It's surreal.
Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid.
"You know you don't have to, right?"
Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin.
""" ln my body. """
""" Don't look now. """
""" My eyes are spitting fire. """
""" This sight looks so colourful. """
""" You're so talked about, you're so unique. """
""" Even if we've to lay down our lives. """
""" But we promise. """
""" We won't let you go. """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Just one more place left to visit.
Mishra.
You call me from Kashi for a day.. ..and make me travel the entire day.
It's a small area.
Once you give them your blessings.. ..they'll cast their votes for me.
"Glory to.. - Siddeshwar Maharaj. "" What's this fervour? ""   "" What's this obsession? """
""" What's this craze? """
""" What's this fervour? """

"Look, Sonakshi Sinha."
"She is Rowdy, my Rathore's in the next alley."
Let's go.
Come on.
Zuek kasu asko ikusi dituzue kontsultak antolatu zenituztenetik.
Guk ere informazio asko jaso ditugu ikusleetatik.
Emaiozue begiratu bat mapa honi...
Hemen saikatu ditugu jaso ditugun 550 informeak.
"Ikus dezakezunez, síntoma ohikoenak dira eztarriko gorabeherak, zehazkiago, eztarri minbera."
Hirutik batek aipatzen du arazo hau.
"Bigarrena da sudurreko odol jarioa, %20 inguruk daukate."
"Ez bakarrik haurrek, baina 30, 40, 50 edo 60koek ere, edozein adinetakoek."
"Hirugarren síntoma ohikoena, diarrea."
Eta ondoren neke handia.
Kausak ez dira identifikatu oraindik.
Baina kezkatu nintzen ikusi nuenean 500 jendeotatik bakoitzak antzeko sintomak zituela.
Zer uste duzu emaitz horiez?
"Begira, Txernobyl inguruetan leku kutsatuetan bizi diren haurren artean sarri ikusi ditugun sintomak dira."
Horregatik ez nintzen harritu.
"Ez da harritzekoa, zeren eta gure gainean sekulako erradiazio kopurua erori baita."
Japoniako doktoreak ez daude ohituta gorputzean arnastuta edo irentsita sartutako errazioarekin.
"Horregatik, norbait ohartzen denean zerbait ari zaiola gertatzen osasunean eta erradiazioagatik dela... ... ospitalera jotakoan doktoreek esango diote urduriegi dagoela, edo ez diote entzungo."
"Horregatik jo dute jende horiek Internetera, edo gure webgunera."
"Ospitaleko diagnostikoarekin ez bazaituzte konbentzitzen, hobe duzu sospetxatzea zure arazoak erradiazioarekin duela zerikusia."
Batez ere orain.
Ez da harrigarri guri emailak bidali dizkigutenetatik gehienak ospitalera ez joan izana.
"Sudurretik odoletan ari zarelako ez zoaz ospitalea, ala?"
Ezta jarioa handia bada ere.
Ospitalera diarrea larriarekin iritsitako askori diarrea birikoa diagnostikatu zioten.
Baina birusen testak negatibo ematen zuen.
Quite a few people came home with the cause of their problems unidentified.
"As has been the case with ""A-bomb bura bura disease"" and Chernobyl-related health problems, medical tests don't reveal any abnormalities for such symptoms."
"If you take a blood test, nothing abnormal is found."
But the medicine you got won't stop your diarrhea.
"So the doctor, not knowing what to do, keep giving you stronger medicines or antibiotics."
"But if the cause is radiation, medicines are hardly effective and the mdical tests don't reveal any abnormalities."
"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
Look.
Kundan is just a friend.
I never thought about him like that.
"Mom, dad, at least don't fight tonight."
"Bunty, who would you prefer to stay with?"
- Katrina Kaif.
"Bunty, I am talking about the both of us"
I am divorcing your mother.
- That's a lie.
Actually I am divorcing him.
"- Very good, very good."
"You guys have fun, I am leaving."
Bunty.
Bunty.
Friends.
To make this celebration of a 33 year old mistake memorable.. ..I request Mr. Kundan Lal to sing a song in twin voices.
"Come, come."
Ladies and gentlemen.
I made this song for my dear friend.. ..Mala for her marriage with Kishen.
So can we change the mood now?
Clap.
"""Now you can do it like this."""
"""Take it to the left."
"Or you can do it like that."""
"""Shake it to the right all my ladies &amp;amp; my man and my men &amp;amp; my ladies."""
"""All my ladies and my man and my men and my ladies."""
"""You can do it like this."""
When my mom and dad didn't have any love story.. ..then what was the theme of the song?
"""Shake it to the right."""
Which song would suit such an unromantic couple?
How would both of them look singing together?
"""You can do it like this."
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.
Thank you.
Standby.
Just one camera is enough to entertain us.
The outfits for today are very extreme.
"For three members, their outfits match the song."
For the other three...
Like this.
Up and down like this...
I want to do that again.
Cut!
Great work.
The end!
Great job.
"""Coffee Shop"" MV is over."
"""Coffee Shop"" is over and ""Hurricane"" is over too. our PAClFlC ToUR in 4 cities of America is over."
We're heading back to Korea tomorrow. our trip in America is now over.
I have many mixed emotions.
It was a long time in the U.S.
I'm glad everything finished well.
"""Coffee Shop"" and ""Hurricane"" music videos will come out well."
I'm looking forward to them.
Great work.
It's really over.
2 weeks have come to an end.
We're done.
"But really, the last shoot was the grand finale."
We were filming in the rain. on the rooftop.
"Which makes me feel better though, to think"
I tried my hardest up to the very end.
All or our schedules in the states are completed.
My clothes are all wet.
But I'm still very happy we're done with everything in the U.S.
We're in New York. other members have to shoot but I finished my part in D.C. yesterday.
So Jong Up and I went shopping.
The jumbo screens assure me that this really is Times Square!
B.A.P has finally arrived at Times Square.
It's an honor.
It really is an honor.
I still can't believe it.
Times Square.
This is Time Square.
I've only seen it in pictures.
This is my first time here.
All this fanciness.
ls that a celebrity?
Who's that?
one two okay. one two.
The weather is awesome today.
The buildings around here are tall so usually this street gets less sunlight.
But today the sun's shining so much.
"(Very satisfied) Wow, good."
That dog looks happy too.
"Yo, New York City."
We're headed to the set feeling like we're VlP.
"Today, we're filming at MTV in Time Square."
We'll be customizing shoes and painting murals.
Time for some cultural activities.
It feels more like playing rather than working.
You know what I'm saying?
I'll be styling my own shoes.
I'll be making one-of-a-kind shoes.
This looks like a really famous shop. for street artists.
It seems many famous street artists have come through here.
I wanted to make my outfit or shoes with this printing.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
"After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut."
-Baek Eun Jo  -No Ri.
Thank you.
My parents... are coming up on an evening flight.
Uhmm..
They must have been very surprised.
The doctor complimented you.
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.
"If you hadn't told me how,"
I wouldn't have been able to do anything
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.
I had no idea.
I really... had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.
I will call my dad.
He must be worried.
Oh Ha Ni!
"Ah, my cellphone and my wallet... where did I leave it all?"
"I, really..."
How old am I that I'm already...
You know..
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...
He explained everything to me already.
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.
I was afraid... that I might do something wrong.
"So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo."
Everything is alright now. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; It's the first time that I heard.. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;warm words from Baek Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Since my anxious feelings were all relieved... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My eyes and heart... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I cried so much they nearly melted away.
Hello!
Hi Eun Jo.
Omo!
You made it today.
The flowers smells good.
It's Oh Ha Ni again??
There are so many careless drivers in the world.
I have seen many different sizes of fly.
"In North Africa, smaller fly than here."
"And Turkey, smaller fly than here."
But this size is same fly in Korea and in Japan and China.
So I feel very emotional.

You're taking away my girlfriend?
"If you do, I'm going to shoot you."
This is great.
-Look at that.
"-Oh, that's a legion of elephants."
I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!
Cannibal whale this time?
Don't invite me.
Atom!
Dal-rae...
Yes sir?
When did you meet Ji-hwan?
Um...
It was during 2nd grade... over ten years already!
"Dal-rae, Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yes, of course."
Actually...
I thought of a novel seeing you and Ji-hwan
And?
Stories of you two may be helpful.
They're not that interesting.
"So why don't start? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;When he was young Ji-hwan was often ignored.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's now a rascal but then a quiet kid who'd fight a lot&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so other kids avoided him a lot.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As your teacher, I want to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more about my loving students.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

"Keep it, or throw it away."
Thanks.
Got something for you too.

Oh god.
Smells awful.
"Uninteresting, right?"
This is a great topic.
Became friends while removing scribbles.
But... who could that been?
Scribbling high up like that...
Dharamdas!
"Ma""am, not Dharamdas. l told you to call me DDT."
Where is your boss?
Fine!
Fine!
"I didn""t see boss going out."
"Which culprit are you searching for, sP?"
Who will be a bigger culprit than you?
You left me alone for 2 months!
Where did you disappear?
I and sister-in-law were waiting for you since a long time.
You should have peeped in your heart!
I see!
How was your journey?
- It was beautiful! open your suitcase and tell me what have you brought for me? open the suitcase!
And take whatever you like! - ls that so?
There are many things in this too! only saris in this!
I am sure this has something for me! only two suitcases?
"We didn""t get any time for shopping, Rajesh!"
"But since when did you take custom officer""s duty?"
You are searching it thoroughly.
I thought you must have brought many things for me.
"But I didn""t find anything in this. shekhar, I will leave now."
- No!
"Have tea! sorry, shekhar!"
I am on duty!
Nowadays you are so busy with your duty!
"What do I tell you, friend? lt""s all because of Tiger singh!"
"Bye, sister-in-law. see you, shekhar. shekhar.. hadn""t we brought 4 suitcases?"
"Yes, seema!"
I gave two suitcases to kaka.

"Looking at you all, I think it's pretty obvious you've never been this high before."
It is my belief that hunger will soon become a serious concern.
"With your permission, my masters..."
"Yes, a craving I have!"
For taquitos and cheese dip!
I've heard legends of a taco... ...made entirely out of Dorito.
If it exists we will find it.
"Master, sir."
I heard Yoda talking about midichlorians.
I've been wondering... ...what are midichlorians?
It's herion.
"Come on, boy."
We have located the Jedi.
We have them right where we want them.

My dog goes crazy if she misses a meal

"Which way do I go? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you go in that direction, you will die.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You shouldn't go there!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In that case...
What if I go the other way?
"If I go here, will I live?"
I...
Then I would wake up and cry again.
I really couldn't go on.
"I swore to forget about Gil Dong, so that I could live."
What could I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not like he went somewhere I could follow.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I found myself being able to live each day.
Then someday I wouldn't even think about Gil Dong at all.
That's how I lived.
But you know...
I'm so dumb.
I forget sometimes that I'm not supposed to think about him.
"When that happens, my heart hurts really badly."
I can't go on!
I wish I'd just become really stupid.
I can't see you like this anymore.
Do you remember any big event twenty years ago in the fall?
"For example, a rich noblewomen running away with a daughter?"
- Twenty years ago?
"- Yes, the year the late king passed away."
How can we remember something that long ago?
This...!
This is Chunmyungdan.
Try it.
"Doctor Heo, please help us."
He's the son of the Interior Minister.
Please take him home for us.
We're short on staff.
Please?
The son of the Interior Minister?
He must be Gil Dong's older brother.
- I just want one more drink.
- Please be careful.
In Hyung!
"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
(intrigued) Oh.
There's the first one.
- (pulsating echo) - Ah.
- (pulsating echo) - No.
"No, I remember now."
"Oh, now he's gonna come."
"- (pulsating echo) - (gasps) Oh, my God."
It's thundering.
- (pulsating echo) - (whimpering)
- (faint static) - What is that?
Uh-oh.
Please don't be in here when I get out.
Is this it on the wall?
What is that?
- (Finebros) I don't know.
"- Do I go straight? - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, God!"
- (headphones clatter) - (high-pitched static)
- (pulsating echo) - (footsteps crunching)
- (claps) - (Finebros laugh)
My fault.
Messed up the microphone.
- At least I got one.
- (Finebros chuckle)
"I was about to quit, too, man. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!"
What the (bleep)?
(high-pitched static)
"Am I going the wrong way, you guys?"
"I'm, like, shaking right now."
"I don't know if you can see it, but I'm kind of shaking."
I'm not liking Slender Man.
"I haven't even seen him, but I already don't like him."
Why does it have to be so dark?
"Of course, I got carried away a little bit after that."
No harm or nothing done.
It was just innocent.
We thought it was just normal innocent stuff.
"What about the music, speaking of the dance."
Who played music at that time around here?
That would have been
Jule Gillespie and Pat Bonner and
Walter McCauley.
"Maybe Robert Palmer, Edward's brother."
"Russell, one of the [?] guys or something."
There's a lot of people - a lot of them can make music
Family type stuff...
Jules - Mary's mother...
Mary can sing.
Mary Palmer.
If you can ever get her to sing.
"Richie Gillespie is a good singer, if you can ever get him to sing."
"He used to - twenty years ago him and Rich [?] could - you name it, they'd play it."
Richie'd sing as good as anybody you've ever heard.
"But Jules's wife, she could sing too."
She was a real good singer.
What kind of music?
Just the regular stuff that you hear on the tapes.
The country type or whatever you want to call it.
Were anybody left that actually did any step dance?
Mm-hmm.
The Dodie guys would just ... wife here a couple weeks ago...
Uncle Joe [?]
"Gallagher, and Uncle John he lived over where [?] is."
He was a big guy.
"Not quite like me, but big guy."
"Welcome, sir."
You can go to bed.
I will attend to my guest myself.
"Of course, sir."
Good night.
"Wow, this place is super."
You like it?
I can't believe it.
Cemre must be stupid to leave this place.
"Yeah, and she left for another stupid person."
She turned her back on me because of stupid Kuzey.
"""My daughter, Cemre..."""
"""... if you are reading this letter..."""
"""... that means I gave my last breath."""
"""And that I left this world with a great guilt of conscience."""
"""Last time we spoke you said you didn't want to see me again."""
"""You were rightfully angry at me."""
"""I didn't have much to say back then."
"As don't have now either."""
"""After all those years, I know it is too late to--"""
"Okay, I'll read it later."
Thank you for coming here.
- It was my job.
- You did your job successfully.
Kazım Bey...
"I don't know what he told you and in what degree, but... ..."
I have never asked anything from him... ... for neither myself nor my daughter.
- I know.
- As I told him back then as well... ...
I wanted to Cemre for myself.
And that's the best thing I've ever done.
"No money, nothing could match it."
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Yo, LEE Ji-hwan!"
Concentrate!
"If you won, our model will won."
"And with it's victory, the company will win."
"Your house will be made, your dream house."
Wow!
What a horoscope!
Planets are very firm at their positions... ...facing some obstacles too... ...which means the girl is very adamant.
- That's right.
She'll do love marriage.
Boy's name will start with J.
That means Jimmy.
- Yes.
"This year, the boy will take part in some air competition... ...and win the first prize."
And he'll earn fame in the world.
He'll be her husband.
Air competition?
"Yes, I remember."
Motor cycle race.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
And there's going to be a motorcycle race.
I stood first in Singapore for consecutive 3 years.
And I'll definitely take part in this race.
"Yes, son and do come first."
This is a question of our reputation.
Yes.
This race is of 30 miles distance from Mumbai to Panvel.
And 21 motorbikes across the world are taking part.
"Number 9, Mr. Jaikishan from Escort."
"Motorbike, Rajdoot 350."
Number 16.
Mr. Jimmy Thapa from Singapore.
Jimmy!
- Father!
Do an interpretive dance with an accordion.
"And the best of you, the most worthy..."
"Tell me, friends, who do we call the most worthy?"
- Those with a good discipline.
"- Good, who else?"
- Who leave nothing on their plates.
- Who sleep during nap time.
- Who gather grass for rabbits.
- Very good.
"And so, the most worthy ones will be allowed... ...to join the circle of champions wearing masquerade costumes."
- Is showing magic tricks a talent?
- A talent.
"- Okay, I can show the ""flying queen"" card trick."
"- Good stuff, good stuff."
Only no cards.
"Kids, everything goes: magic tricks, art installations, pantomime..."
It's all good.
"Eat, eat."
- Mitrofanova!
"So, are the rumours true?"
- And Comrade Mitrofanov is coming as well!
"- My daddy is coming, too!"
"- You eat, eat."
Don't you know the rule?
No?
"All right, children, let's remind him the rule."
All together now.
- When I'm at my plate  all talks can wait.
- Nap time!
"- For them, but not for us."
"- Come on, come on."
"- Hey, guys."
Don't mind him brother.
He is still a child.
His mind works like a child's mind right now.
"As a matter of fact, his mind doesn't work at all..."
I will take his mind in such a way that...
"And he is like this not because of his mind,  but because of electic shock and drugs..."
"Hey, pal..."
Let it go...
Come on...
My brother!
"Yaw Mustafa, see, you make us happy by splitting his head open..."
"Come on, my ram, don't leave us..."
Why don't you say something?
I am going to burst now.
"We went there, sat with him."
We saw him.
His treatment still continues.
Don't jerk me around...
I see Aslan Bey...
He is worn out...
"Take me there to see him, please..."
For God's Sake...
I swear...
"Ok, Bahar Hanim, we go one day."
"But, please be quite a little bit."
I mean... we don't want people to hear it.
"Just a minute Asil, my brother..."
"When Bahar Hanim visited Mustafa in the hospital,  didn't he have a fever and then went into coma?"
"If we take her there, maybe he will remember something."
Eh?
Isn't that possible?
I am his medicine.
"Let me ask Mrs. Ender, let me see what will she say."
Don't let Mrs. Ender know about it please!
I can't give money to anyone without her knowledge.
How can I give it son?
"Brother, I really need it very much.Look, I will pay it back as soon as I can."
What do you need this money for?
"I family matter. &amp;gt; I'm sorry..&amp;gt; Okay, thanks."
"Yaman, here you are, 300, it's not advance payment, it's from my pocket."
But it's a debt.
"- OK, it's a debt, you will complete the rest somehow. here 50 from me, &amp;gt; Thanks, &amp;gt; and from me, &amp;gt;also from me &amp;amp;gt, me too- Thank you , Thank you all !"
This is from me.&amp;gt; thanks..
Do you have 50 TL now?
"Thanks to all of you, really, as soon as I have money in my hands I will pay it back, I promise"
How will you complete the rest?- I will see.
Thanks- May you use it for the best.
How much money would you give for this? &amp;gt; Let me see.

Rao.

Will you please shut up?
And get out!
Returning today Rajesh!
"If I'm to know my boundaries again, I need to have a last time."
I'm not a fool.
I'll go back behind my boundaries after that.
"Young Master, why are you following me?"
I'm not following you.
I'm just walking.
But Yongmun is all the way over there!
I don't want to go there right now.
Have you run away?
Or are you in trouble with Madam Noh?
"Well, you're higher up than her, so I guess you won't get in trouble."
Did you have an argument with her?
Madam Noh cannot argue with me.
"You know, I was always curious, but how come you're higher than Madam Noh?"
You're younger and don't do much.
Why do you order her around like that?
What is the relationship between you and Madam Noh?
Madam Noh is like a mother to me.
"Who are you anyway, Young Master?"
I've known you for over a year.
But I don't know what you do.
I don't even know your name.
"Like you said, I've run away."
But I have nowhere to go.
"I don't do much, so I won't be missed."
Why don't you teach me how I should spend the day?
"If so, I'll tell you my name."
"First, my surname is Yi."
Young Master Yi?
I'm hungry.
Shall we go eat something?
"Great idea, Young Master Yi!"
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
"I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me."

"Good, thank you very much."
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?"
"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are."
"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?"
"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator."
"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,"
I'm going to run away...
"Are you crazy, Mahir?How will you escape from prison? no"
I'm running away from the hospital!
"Enough talking,Gentlemen!"
"Come on,Get back!"
Come on!
Take it easy.
Feride?Are you crying?
"This is due to Mahir, right?Now you cheer upAfter you've seen it, I know it..."
How can such a big lovefinished in a minute?Is this possible?
"Feride...listen to me,I know you're very angryat Mahir, but trust mewhen I tell youthat Mahir loves you!"
"Everything is explained,he did everythingto save his father..."
He did not intendhurt you... . trust methat he is a very good man.
"Maybe it's becausewe want to bevery good man, Bahar!"
Maybe he deceived usin fact we believe that he is good?How can we be sure?
Maybe he hidits darkness in the same mannerthat he hidhis real name?
He was shot in the street...no one knows who did it... he deals with the gangsters...
And above all he is accused of so manyillegal stuff!
"But, he said,it's all justto rescue his father!"
Feride
"You should have listened to him,certainly there is an explanationfor all."
I do not want to hearhis voice or seehis face ever...
Okay.
"As you wish,All right."
I'm going to bringsome water ..
"Ayten,It ""s me , Neždet!"
Are you okay?
"Ayten, you're very worried about me,are you okay?Why do not you answer?"
Get out!
Ayten
"Go I'm sick,go..."
I'll sleep hereif you do not open.
"- I left it in the hotel room. oh, you left it there?"
This is the point!
None
"I found out from my fan cafe, that they thought these were arm warmers."
"But guys, these aren't arm warmers."
I just put this mask on my wrist.
(Simple-minded)l didn't want to lose it.
I lose things pretty often...
So I try to always hang my belongings on my body.
- My camera - Did you shut the door?
of course you did.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
- What are we filming today?
- We're filming for the MV.
"I want to live in a house like this one day. &amp;lt;""Coffee Shop"" MV First main character Dae Hyun&amp;gt;"
I'll have a wife and kids.
My wife will be cooking breakfast and I'll be playing with the kids.
"We'll eat delicious food together, and take a walk with our two puppies."
I'm glad the background looks nice.
At least I won't look tacky.
The place for my MV is the best.
The weather is fantastic.
How do I look?
It's me over flowers.
I can't really smell well because I'm sick.
But real flowers do smell good.
Do I get to rest now?
I was worried because I didn't get good sleep.
But the weather's so good it's very healing.
I'm done.
I took some pictures since I came to America.
You will die in my hands!
But I swore I wouldn't get involved with you again.
"I said leave me, leave!"
I don't use any opportunity .
I don't look at anyone's wife or girl either.
Put this in your goofball head.
Did you get me man?
EPlSODE 5 - Leave me !
What can you do man alone?
"Come on, do it!"
"Mira is my friend and whenever I want to be with her, i will be ."
Got it?
Now get out!
Don't dare to come here again!
What's going on here?
Nothing...
"I came to thank him for helping in the club, but... alas..."
I forgot that we don't talk the same language with our friend.
"It'm not at fault, but I'm sorry for disturbing you.Good night."
What did we talk with you Yaman?
This man came to my door.
What's his trouble with you?
"It's okay, nothing."
"- If you're right you will tell what happened, why do you keep quiet?"
We've solved it already .
There is nothing to tell.
"Come on Ender, anyway we have more important things to do, let's go and talk with Faruk."
Come dear...
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
Thank you.
"What is it ,dear Ender?"
"As soon as you heard ,did you also come to ask for your money?"
"It's not this, but it's your imagination."
It's a big difference.
[sighs]
Now do this again.
Again.
How do you feel now?
I don't know.
Playing stupid?
I'm not playing stupid!
I don't know the right answer.
"You see, ""I don't know,"" this is playing stupid."
You did something with your heel there.
It's very chance [indiscernible]
-No.
-No.
Okay.
"No, but your hair and your features go along with the feeling I had about you earlier."
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you.
And you're the type of person that seems
"like you demand so much respect, and you're...[sighs]"
Please tell me.
I demand so much respect.
Play this what you just saw.
"Well, you know how smart I am."
"I know more about psychology than you do, Gloria, so anything I say of course is right."
Can you say the same as Gloria?
Something similar as Gloria?
Or like the same as Gloria?
I demand respect because...
I don't know.
You don't know?
"No, I don't."
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Come to the front door.
"Yes, I entered from the chimney, I'll exit from the door."
Let's do it.
Great.
Aleykum selam.
How is it going?
- (?) Kuzey Bey.
- Hands off.
Don't pounce at me like hound.
I'll tell you something though.
There's a security vulnerability on that building.
Looks like some people broke the cameras in the yard.
Especially the walls surrounding the guest mansion.
"Don't be so stingy, man."
Spend some money to get those fixed.
- Kuzey Bey.
"- Telling you, people could walk right into the mansions."
- Salamun aleyküm.
"- Aleykum selam, bro."
Mission accomplished?
"Great, let's go then."
Your people got worried mad about you.
They kept calling me.
"- Nah, they are used to it."
"- Well, I don't know."
"They gave me headaches, asking me where you went off to after the trial."
"Why does everyone who can't reach you, call me?"
I don't know if I am a phone operator or a missing person office.
"You are my accomplice, what else do you want to be?"
"- Always, bro."
Don't worry.
- Thanks.
From here it looks very small.
"But when you're in front of the statue, I hear you only see the body because it's too big."
That building there is where the 911 terror took place.
So they're rebuilding a new structure there.
"Come to think of it, what's that on the very top? on top of that building there's something like a fork-crane."
The person operating that - must be so scared.
- He must be very scared.
He must have more than one life or something.
I'm sad.
We're heading back to Korea the day after tomorrow.
I wanted to tour more before leaving.
None
New photographer.
He takes out his right hand from his pocket.
"Look that way, looks at the sky, hand on the hat..."
"His hand's up, and back down."
He's walking suavely
He puts his hands in his pockets.
Looking this way.
Don't laugh.
He's laughing. oh no.
He couldn't help but laugh.
"Honestly, it's really embarrassing."
"For both the doer and the watcher, it's embarrassing."
Nice.
I'm done.
We're out in NY right now.
How early did we get ready?
It's 11 AM right now.

"Okay, we're coming in..."
"Okay, first of all-- and I'm sure he hears me by now--"
let me explain something to you.
"Everyone, can you hear me loud and clear?"
My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.
Anyone can commit mistake.
"Yes, just like your parents did."
You.
- Mala mind your tongue.
Or else.. - Or else?
- Or else.
- Yes.
Or else.
- Or else what?
"Hey, get back to work all of you."
Get to work.
"Bhikhu, you do your work as well."
Should I do all the work?
I can't even fire him.
People get motorcycle in dowry but what did I get?
This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Didn't the government ignore this fact even though reports were made?
We have suffered great losses in this as well.
We did this under your instructions as well as for the good of the people.
Please overlook our involvement in Choi Chul Joo's death.
Then I will ask you one question.
Some people were blocking the arrival of the police.
Do you know who they were?
- Did such a thing happen?
- Were they involved with Yongmun?
Why would we block the police's arrival?
We sacrificed a great deal because the police arrived too late!
He can't be caught!
He'll be killed!
- I feel like I'm going to die with worry!
- How will we find him on a day like this?
Young Miss!
Young Miss!
Gomi!
It's me.
Let's go!
"Gomi, come to your senses!"
Gomi is acting strange again?
Gomi!
Gomi!
The police are headed this way.
We should get out of here.
I'll head them off.
You take care of Gomi.
- Follow him!
Run!
"- Yes, Sir!"
"First explosives, and now strange fellows."
Please welcome the first lady of the United States of America - Michelle Obama.
[song: ladies night]
[cheering applause]
"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
Absolutely.
"What do you mean by ""work"", Keung?"
You won't understand!
I'm doing it for love!
Tell me.
I've became a different person ever since I met her.
I've do whatever she ask me to.
She wanted me to find a job.
I found a job.
I've ask her to marry me and she promised!
"Unbelievable, isn't it?"
"You just love her big tits, don't you?"
You jealous?
"Hell, I'm jealous!"
"In the past, I would have boasted myself so much... not anymore!"
I've something for you...
Organic Contribute Form
What?
It's out of your mind?
Read it first!
Ms Lee gave it to me the other day.
She looked at me in my eyes and said...
"""Keung, for guys like you who are in this killing business..."""
"""...life may mean nothing."""
"""But by completing this form..."""
"""...you'll be able to do society some good."""
"""You'll be saving someone's life even after you're dead."""
"""By doing this, you'll make your life worth living."""
This Ms Lee whom Keung's talking about is a social worker.
God knows what she sees in Keung that made her love him.
It's just fuckingly incredible!
"Here she is, doing her endless research!"
"I'm afraid that uh... ...that you're going to have such a direct attack that uh, you're going to get me in the corner, and I'm afraid of that."
I want you to be more on my side.
"You said I'll get you in a corner, and you put your hand on your chest."
-Mm-hmm.
-Is this your corner?
"Well, it's like...yeah, it's...like I'm afraid."
You know.
Where would you like to go?
Can you describe the corner you'd like to go to?
Yeah.
Uh...it's back in a corner where...
I'm completely protected.
And you would be safe of me?
From me?
"Well, I know I wouldn't really, but it feels safe."
[overlapping]
But while you're in this corner you're perfectly safe now.
What would you do in that corner?
I'd just sit.
-Just sit?
-Yes.
How long would you sit?
"I don't know, but this is so funny you're saying this."
This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
"Every time I was afraid, I would feel better sitting in a corner."
Not panicky.
Okay.
Are you a little girl?
"Well, no...but it's the same feeling."
Are you a little girl?
This feeling reminds me of it.
Are you a little girl?
"Because well, it's very important!"
Come on...
We're going to Ankara.
"- Perihan, you get prepared, too."
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean you're not coming?
We should be there as a family.
- I am not coming!
"I can't lie, looking in their eyes."
You go.
What are you waiting for!
Go!
And you go find out if it's that journalist who put it on the Internet.
"Go, we're doing all this for you."
It's all in vain...
It's too late.
Everyone will know it by tomorrow.
I don't know how we'll recover from this.
Make a call and sort out the tickets.
So that we depart as soon as we get to the airport.
And tell Perihan not to talk to them.
"If they know we're going, they might refuse us."
"""It's on the news and Internet... ... we've got to talk!"""
They are gone.
They ran away.
"""Münir Telci Law Office."
We can't answer your call right now.
"Please leave your message after the tone."""
"God damn you, Münir Telci."
This is ridiculous.
Throw dirt and hope it sticks.
"You've been doing that to the Yaşarans for years, I know."
The Lord's so lucky.
Look at the things He's getting.
"Earlier, people would keep it in a covered platter.. ..in front of Him."
But now they're feeding Him.
Let Him enjoy.
It's your fault.
"Mumbai just experienced a slight earthquake tremor.. ..of 3.5 Richter scale, which didn't cause.. ..any harm to life or property."
See.
Heard that?
But a shop in the flea market has collapsed.. ..which was closed at that time.
Must be Mohammad's shop.
According to our sources.. ..the shop was registered to Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"It's really surprising, because.. ..there are other old shops in this market which are still intact."
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop has been completely destroyed.
"This is Shweta Tiwari, with cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News."
"Sister, switch on ABP News quickly."
We saw.
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
It's collapsed.
Pravin!
"- Calm down, father."
"No, sister."
Come there with the children.
I'm coming there with father and the others.
- Yes.
"Yes, we're coming."
We're coming.
The idols of Gods have gone underneath.
The shop is completely ruined
Doesn't seem like there was ever a shop here.
What are you saying?
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.
It's insufficient as much as I would thank you.
"869 01:11:20,359 --&amp;gt; 01:11:24,475 That day when police took me, I begged so much to Mr. Selim saying 870 01:11:24,475 --&amp;gt; 01:11:28,437 I entrust you my son."

"879 01:12:03,010 --&amp;gt; 01:12:06,749 But if he isn't involved in trouble again... 880 01:12:07,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:08,800 What do you say?"
"881 01:12:08,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:13,800 What can he say?"
He says God!
Oh I thank you my gracious God!
"882 01:12:13,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:15,300 Yaman."
"883 01:12:15,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:19,508 What can I say, of course it's great, but only if it's 100% scholarship, 884 01:12:19,508 --&amp;gt; 01:12:20,971 if I succeed in exam 885 01:12:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:12:23,758 You will succeed dot com dot tr (.com.tr)."
That's all!
"886 01:12:23,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:27,500 As school is close to here you can continue staying here now 887 01:12:27,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:30,400 No, I will come and go."

Work and win!

"889 01:12:35,500 --&amp;gt; 01:12:37,200 Okay..?"
-Okay.
"890 01:12:37,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:42,100 My God, what kindness did I do for you that you brought these people in front of my son?"
"891 01:12:42,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:45,500 Ah thanks God!"
Thanks God!
"892 01:12:46,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:49,600 God bless you..."
"893 01:13:11,000 --&amp;gt; 01:13:15,100 Everything is ok, right?"
There is nothing to be taken or given.
"894 01:13:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:13:18,400 This time you beat the rap Mr. Faruk 895 01:13:18,422 --&amp;gt; 01:13:23,704 but we won't be so tolerant with you next time."
"896 01:13:25,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:28,200 There won't be a next time."
"897 01:13:40,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:43,485 Wow, did you dress?"
I will get prepared right away.
Admit Rajesh in the hospital.
"Boss, where is Jaggu?"
- I have killed him.
And you saved this enemy?
Have you decided to kill your men? - shut up!
The one who locks horn with Tiger singh.. he will be killed.
Do you know war has started in lndia?
This is the golden chance to become rich.
"Gold""s price is going to increase four times. so we will return to lndia today itself. come on."
"To save lndia, donate generously for defence fund."
"Today lndia needs gold desperately. kaka sir, we too need gold desperately."
"Mr. Anwar, come."
- Greetings. come.
"Have a seat. kaka sir, luckily there is a war."
And war is a good chance to make ourselves rich.
And our country is ready to pay any price for gold.
"That""s the misfortune, Mr. Anwar."
I am telling the truth.
I would have given you the gold.
But what to do?
"I don""t have the gold. kaka sir!"
You will get the gold.
Fix the deal with them.
Mr. Anwar!
We have gold worth 7 crores.
What price do you quote?
I am ready to give double the price! - okay!
"But we need opium, cocaine, marijuana."
Where are the goods to be delivered?
Near Lakhaidi island.
Bring the gold.
And take your goods.
"See you later, L.A."
We're going to San Francisco.
"See you again, L.A."
We just arrived in San Francisco.
"Before MV filming, we're going to San Francisco hamburgers."
"Tigger here, Tigger there."
"Lately, fans have been sending a lot of Tiggers."
We have so many Tiggers at home.
"Tigger staring at me here, Tigger staring at me there."
I'm freaked out.
They look like they're alive.
It looks like they're alive and staring at me.
oh my gosh!
This street is called Union.
The weather's kind of chilly here too.
None
It's a different feeling from L.A.
San Francisco feels a little more antique.
"Very vintage, and each building has its own character."
lf I were to choose between the two cities
I'd pick San Francisco because it's more put-together.
"L.A. is nice too though, it's very casual."
I wish my neighborhood were San Francisco.
This place has a different aura to it.
They're in the same country but they feel different.
"It's a city that goes well with our song ""Coffee Shop"" too."
Just a little bit ago there wasn't this much sunlight.
Thank goodness the sun came out.
Zelo is filming right now.
It's a relief the sun's shining brightly.
I have a feeling today's shoot will be a good one.
I'm done.
- Is that so?
- I'm sorry.
It must have been precious to you.
"No, it's alright."
"It was used to save lives, so I'm sure its owner would have been glad too."
But the frame should still be there.
I should go find it.
At this hour?
You should go when it's light.
That's alright.
I'll be going now.
You're really as impetuous as he said you were.
He?
Do I know that person?
Everyone's gone now.
We should go too.
"Gil Dong, do you want to wear this and go to the brothel for a while?"
- Shall we?
- No one will recognize us if we wear this!
You're right.
I haven't been to the brothel in a long time!
I am filled with past memories!
- Then I'll wear the black.
- Go ahead.
"I look great, don't I?"
"Are you sure you'll be alright, half-balls?"
You may be ready for the brothel yet.
Let's just go back.
How do I look?
Let's just wear this to scare the kids.
- You handsome fellow!
"- Hey, Sir Moonlight Black Hat!"
My legs. . .I cannot climb a mountain.
Can't my legs be cured?
"Ofcourse dear, your legs will get cured."
You have me.
Why do you think I drive the rickshaw?
I'll collect lots of money.
I'll get you treated by the best doctor in the world.
"You will walk, run, walk in step with the world."
Can't you see?
Are you blind?
Who did you call blind?
Me?
"You are blind, your father is blind. . . your whole family is blind."
Why are you looking there and talking?
I am here.
"Wherever you may be, for me, you are here."
I'll thrash you !
"I'm sorry sister, did I hurt you?"
"- That's a pole, not a lady."
"I know it is not a lady, it is a pole."
You mind your own business.
What's wrong with the municipality?
They put up poles everywhere.
It's quite a huge pole - Are you blind?
"I am not a pole, I am a woman."
Woman?
"I'm sorry sister, I made a mistake Forgive me."
I think he is mad too.
Someone help me cross the road.
- Who is this?
I am blind.
Help me cross the road.
We activate the protocol she signed before the marriage.
"Yes, exactly..."
All her obligations will be put in effect.
"If she wants to divorce, she has to pay me all the compensation written in the contract."
Let's see if she can divorce me now.
He will be even more hostile towards you now.
"He should thank God, that he still breathes."
Or I know what I would do to him.
"Okay, come..."
We have a lot to tell each other.
"Wait, wait..."
"Uhm, well..."
... could you turn your back to me?
- Why?
- Just do it will you?
Kuzey.
Don't lose it again.
I won't.

I am very happy.
I have invested 14 crores in the movie.
If you had not brought her I would have been doomed.
Take these 10 lakhs.
I dont need 10 lakhs.
Only three lakhs is enough.
"Oh, you do not seem to belong to this age."
He is saying no to money.
I need to send this money urgently to Vizag.
Can you make any arrangements please?
When he is requesting us why do you stare with an open mouth?
Move now.
I will have it done.
Are you looking for Venkat?
- He is upstairs.
He is taking money from the producer for bringing you back.
He must have taken five or 10.. lakhs not thousands.
This is true.
I swear by my mother.
Dont try to cheat me anymore father.
You told me that he threw the ring down.. ..and I stayed away from him believing you.
Now you are telling me that he took money.
Even if he took money they would be the strong reason for it.
I will believe only Venkat and not you.
Why are you backing him?
Do you know how much trouble I took to make you.. ..a heroine?
Will you now go away with him?
What will happen to the movie?
Come with me.
Wait.
Leave her.
I left her.
SPEAKER 12:
"Take a cab, or drive in a car if I'm by myself."
SPEAKER 11:
Try to park my car close to door openings.
SPEAKER 8:
"And I just try to have a plan in advance, like where I'm going to be parking in relation to walking around campus."
SPEAKER 13:
I know where all the blue lights are on campus.
SPEAKER 2:
Like to try to make a mental note of where all the
little blue light box thingies were.
SPEAKER 14:
I'm just aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 15:
I'm really aware of my surroundings.
SPEAKER 8:
"I'm not talking, I'm not texting."
SPEAKER 15:
Look at who's behind me.
I don't like people walking behind me.
SPEAKER 2:
"Like if I'm walking by a shop window, I'll look in the window to see if there's a reflection of someone behind me."
SPEAKER 15:
"Because I pay attention to who's walking around me and behind me, especially at night."
SPEAKER 16:
Make sure I have my keys all out and ready for me to get into the house.
SPEAKER 17:
Don't talk to strange adults that you normally don't see around campus.
SPEAKER 11:
You never talk to strangers or guys or take rides or certain things like that.
SPEAKER 17:
I lock my doors.
"Ohh there is bazaar today, I forgot!"
If we enter we can't get out.
You go down on the right!
On the right from here!
"You come also, if you want."
"- No, I will wait in the car, you go!"
Don't hurry !
Good afternoon!
I wanted to move my registration
First let me find your registration here.
"You know how devoted I am sister. but really, i can' t endure Kenan's trouble anymore..."
"What can I say, you're right.- I gave him many opportunities, you know it.. but it's a must to break up."
He lost me.
Don't feel yourself guilty.
It's his choice..
I wrote a letter and send it to him.I told him everything was needed...
Did he ask me when he got into trouble?
Yaman was also angry with this.
"""How can you do this when the guy is in jail?"""
Do you talk with Yaman?
He calls sometimes to ask about you.
I wish you stayed with Yaman aunt!
You wouldn't be apart and your life would be better too.
My life can't be better.
My condemnation is until death.
I will be at ease when I close my eyes.
"Sister, who is Turunc Nadir?"
What? &amp;gt; Turunc Nadir
O don't know...
Who is it?
I heard uncle Hasan and Kenan fighting once.
Kenan threatened uncle Hasan with him.
That's the slight catch.
The job's in New Zealand.
- What?
"- Look, I know it's a big deal and I don't have to decide anything yet."
I really want to discuss it with all the family.
It's a bit of a shock for us all but your dad's not going to do anything we're not happy with.
"Oh, Dad, you should totally go."
What an opportunity.
Yes.
One less parent to deal with.
If Dad goes to New Zealand I can easily get around Mum and have my dream party.
"Now, I just need a plan to show Robbie I'm a natural born snogger."
"So, I've figured out what I've got that Slaggy Lindsay doesn't."
Hair on the back of your legs?
- The Angus advantage.
- What?
Get in!
"Inside, now!"
You will wait for the judge to sentence you.
The prison warden is coming now.
Whoever tries to escape will end up in solitary confinement.
"Don't you know that, Nazif Kara?"
"Why did you try to escape, old man?"
Running to your wife &amp;amp; daughter?!
Tsk Tsk Tsk...
Sit down now!
What happened Kibarim?
I don't know.
"I went out, they pointed the gun at me and caught me."
Who is the rat that told them?
Nejdet wasn't waiting for you outside?
That idiot!
"Find out what the favor she asked the official, and make sure it gets done."
I can't have another man have a flower that I can't have.
What's going on?
"The people you asked to help you, they came looking for you."
Really?
Sir!
Sir!
She's nowhere to be found!
She's disappeared!
Disappearing to where?
That doesn't make any sense!
"If she fell to here, she couldn't even manage herself properly."
"Now, are you aware of who you are?"
Who are you?
Don't you remember me?
We have seen each other in the palace grounds.
Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
I'm Seol Hye...
I was a colleague of your brother.
Brother Chun-Soo asked you to take care of me?
"Yes, that's right."
"After these events, he himself came to see me."
I think it will be difficult for Dong-Joo.
I'm sorry for delivering such news.
Forgive me for making such a hard request.
No.
I'm so grateful that you've come to me for help.
"If she's his sister, she's like my sister."
"Now, what can I do to help?"
Everything you need is in here.
"If Dong-Yi doesn't make it outside the city, then help that child stay alive."
Look at those dorms you've got!
Look at all those lawns!
Plumbing!
Television!
Gas cooking!
Greenhouses!
Flower pots!
Activities!
Children.
"You are ""masters of this camp."""
You are!
"What is required of you, my friends?"
- Dis-cip-line!
- I expressly forbade swimming to the island.
But Inochkin ignored the rules and did it anyway.
- They all probably have whooping-cough there!
- No they don't!
"- Quiet, third troop."
"- Try to be more like the second troop, will you?"
Who can guarantee now that Inochkin isn't infected?
Who?
"And it's not the first infraction from him, either!"
On his first day here he started fighting with sticks!
And after him everyone started doing it.
Even girls!
"At night, under his blanket, he lit a flashlight and started reading a book!"
"And everyone else started, too!"
And today he swam to the island!
"What now, is everyone going to swim to the island, too?"
What next?
Do we start jumping across the river?
And that's not all!
Don't tell the kids.
"Nick, who I found yesterday,  kissing a woman passionately in the street..."
He later claimed that woman was his wife!
[laughter]
Here's to the future.
Drugs... sex... divorce...
Death!
Who'd want to live anywhere else?
Here's to us.
[clink]
Try me again and I promise you  it'll be more fun this time.
"- Hey, everybody!"
Welcome to the Atheist Experience.
We're live.
"It is July 15th, 2012."
"Two days after Friday 13th, and one day after Saturday the 14th, and three days after Thursday the 13th, and they're all equally important."
I'm Matt Dillahunty.
Joining me this week is Don Baker.
Welcome.
- Good to be here.
-We're in a good mood.
"This is a live call in television program out of Austin, Texas."
We'll have the number up for you shortly.
"The announcement stuff has kind of been sidelined, and we're going to go ahead and let Don get started on his talk."
"How are you, by the way?"
- I'm doing good.
"I went to a holy place, believe it or not."
"- Holy to you, or holy to somebody else?"
It's as close as atheists have to a holy place.
I went to a great science museum.
"I went to the American Museum of Natural Science in New York City, where the Hayden Planetarium is."
"I didn't see Neil deGrasse Tyson there, but took in a great planetarium show."
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
Is it him?
I thought you guys split.
I sent him a message that I was in the hospital.
"You really like him, don't you?"
I don't know why I'm like this...
Wow this room is warm.
Wait.
I'm sorry about last time.
"Damn, look at your wounds."
"I told myself...that this is the last time so if you have something to say, please say it."
The last time?
Then why don't we do it for the last time before we go on our way?
Don't worry.
I can be careful so you won't get hurt.
Like this....
I went to an inn in the country and the woman next doorways screaming like crazy.
- I cracked the door to listen to her.
- Not interesting.
Not interesting?
Then I'll tell you another story.
Let's just do it once.
"A long time ago, I was going up the mountain..."
A woman...
Don't call me again.
"Fine, we don't have to see each other again."
Let's do it for the last time.

"I don't like the kid, but he's got a point."
"See, even shit-brick knows you should do it."

"Okay, that was good, but I want to thicken-up that solo."
"Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke."
"Yeah, I know, my timing's off."
"No, it's not that."
I think it'll work better as a duet with a tenor part.
I'll do it.

Dick.
- I'll do it.
Great.
See you tomorrow.
Hmph.
- Why are you doing this ?
"İnşallah, inşallah."
"I mean, I'm not getting out of your livesafter the lawsuit ends."
I told Meryem Hanım as well.

We're just leaving the house.
"No, we'll get there in time.Don't worry."
"Okay, will do, my dear."
"Your enişte is saying hello to you.He's already there, waiting at the airport."

Doing as I'm told.What else could I do?

As if I don't have enough to deal with...
"But I am telling you, Münir.When this is done... ..."
I'll be done with this womanno matter how much money you offer me.
"Okay, okay."
I got it.
When is your trial?
"Okay, call me when it's over though."
You too.
"Who are you?Who are you, God damned man!?"
"- Stop yelling at midnight!- That bastard bought you as well, didn't he?"
God damn it!
You are Münir's man.God damn you!
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
"I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone..."
-with your lacrosse stick or something ?
"-Oh, sure."
Sure.
"You know, I know what people think."
"It's like,"
"""Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."""
"You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,"
"- that's not all that I am, you know ?"
"- Of course, I didn't--"
"I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that."
You ?
You think I don't get that ?
"God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, ""Oh, look."
"There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."""
Yeah.
"So, like, what else do you do ?"
"Well, the same things you do,"
Iike hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why ?
What do you think I do ?
"- Oh, l--"
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
"- Oh, well, what do you want to know ?"
"You know, stuff... about you."
All right.
"Mom, I'm home !"
[ Chattering ]
[ Moaning ]
[ Moaning Continues ]
"Oh, yeah."
-That's impossible!
-How come?
That's the surveillance panel.
It can detect even a little bird.
Then how did the elephant enter?
We will investigate it later.
Later isn't enough.
Another similar accident will...
"Anyhow, you should hurry and finish rebuilding Zora."
I can't take it anymore!
"Doctor Hura, so you don't mind getting wild animals killed?"
"If I didn't invent animal robots, more wild animals would have been killed by humans!"
Help!
"Wow, Zora moved."
Help!
Help!
My gosh.
I can't do anything now.
It's beyond curbs.
Atom is the only one who can take care of this situation.
"Pura, not ready yet?"
It's evening already.
"Pura, do you understand?"
"I don't want Doctor Ochanomizu to worry, so I'm going to go tell him what happened and come back."
So please wait here for a moment.
I'll soon be back.
"You are late, Atom."
Sorry?
So Doctor Ochanomizu already went out with Doctor Hura to find me?
This is great.
Where would Doctor Ochanomizu be?
"Ah, that's..."
Please leave this place.
Shailu is mine.
Bhadranna!?
I can die ten times for Shailu.
Can you die once?
"I am ready, what about you?...Are you ready?"
"Uncle, why are you supporting him?"
I called you from vizag to convince him not to support him.
Why are you being hasty?
I will talk to him.
Why do you interact with that rowdy?
What is the necessity that you want the girl he loves?
He wants the girl I love.
Have you seen how arrogantly he is speaking?
Do one thing.
Leave this city and come to Vizag with me.
I will not come.
Dont talk like that.
Why do you want to stay here.. ..and have a dispute with that rowdy.
Why do you try to scare me?
What if he is a rowdy?
What is his specialty?
I am also a rowdy.. .. if anyone tries to interferes in my matter.
Beat me.
I kicked my mother when I was a kid.
She never beat me.
I kicked my father when I have grown up.
He never beat me.
You shouldnt have leaved him brother.
You must have killed him there itself.
What is the need for that?
He only announced that.. ..he can die ten times for her.
"Not to mention, your Jedi friends caused an unspeakable amount of damage!"
The bill must be paid!
"Oo, I have an idea, how about we DON'T pay the bill?"
"Qui Gon, you old piece of shit!"
How are you?
"What's the matter, old buddy?"
You face is crustier than a patch of wookie butt fur!
Gross!
"Whoah, you look terrible"
"Maybe you need a Viagra prescription... ...to turn on your lightsaber, you know what I mean?"
This kid doesn't.
"Seriously though, are you losing your edge or what?"
You're absorbing more abuse than a hutt tampon!
(sorry)
The Qui Gon I knew would have been kicking my teeth in right now.
"Hey, I'm just kidding, it's all in good fun."
Put 'er there!
(laughs)
"Alright now get out of here, you old creep."
Why don't you take this kid with you?
I know you're into that.
"Seriously though, kid, watch out for that guy."
He uh... he has a past.
Look at him.
Such a... bumbling creature.
So foolish.
He's made of so much skin.
I will make him part of us.
Yes!
I will wear his face!
Look how much the others hate him!
Almost as if they wish he was gone.
"And only after that call themselves lndian! very good, dear!"
I am glad to see your patriotism!
Ms. seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. can I expect to have one more meeting with you?
"lf it won""t happen, then it will be my bad luck."
"You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question."
Thanks a lot.
"Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave."
"Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh."
Thank you very much for the nice food.
Yes!
"- Hello! sP Rajesh please! sorry, sir! sP sir is not here!"
There is a gift for him.
You can take it. keep a close watch on all the trucks.. ..passing through Dharampar road.
"What""s your name?"
- A patriot!
Hello!
Today I have nabbed you!
"- What happened, constable?"
You will find out soon! search the truck! okay! - come on!
Why is this truck empty?
"lt""s not a crime to drive empty truck, constable!"
"lt""s a crime!"
This truck is used to deliver goods.
"And it""s a crime to drive empty truck."
"Henceforth I shouldn""t see it empty!"
Got it?
"Let""s go!"
"When I signaled you to stop, why didn""t you stop?"
I am sorry.
"I didn""t see the signal. okay!"
We will find out soon! constables! search the truck and frisk them! sure! sure!
Hey!
All I fucking cared about... ...was my reputation amongst the firms of England.
"I mean, you've heard all the stories about Millwall, yeah?"
"Last match I went to was Millwall, West Ham."
We're talking a good 10 years ago.
"I mean, we'd been waiting for this match all year."
At Millwall.
Yeah.
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.
We were fucking wired from the start.
"Now, Tommy Hatcher... ...he was their main man back then."
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy to the grounds.
Tommy Jr.
"Always banging on how he brought his kid up, you know, to be like a little pit bull."
"Well, we lost that match."
Three-nil.
And those Millwall cunts started laughing at us.
And I just fucking snapped.
"I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?"
"So I assembled all our troops, and we hunted them down."
I saw that little lad go down.
Tommy!
No!
And I saw his skull get crushed under the boots of the GSE.
I never went to another match after that.
And I left the Major behind.
And that's when I met your sister.
She was my angel.
She really saved me.
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.
And she swore... ...she'd leave me if I ever returned to it.
Your bun has so much red bean paste!
Just give me one bite.
At least give me some red bean paste!
"Choose the cup, choose the cup!"
Double your money!
Double your money!
Choose the right cup!
One bet!
It's this one.
- How did you know?
- I have quick eyes.
- Well done!
Good job!
- That's enough.
Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
It says Amy's biosim just finished.

"Now, tell the truth - Alabama!"

"Lord, I'm coming home to you"
Before the test begins we're going to determine hand and leg preferences.
Ready?
Can you kick the ball to me?
Ready?
I'm going to bounce it to you.
Now use one hand and bounce it back.
"Oh, nice job!"
The first thing we're going to do is use this pencil and I want you to take this car and draw a line and stay inside the row all the way down to the house.
Take your time and stay inside the row.
OK for our next activity
For this one we're going to take this paper and you see this line?
Fold it on the line just like this.
Can you do this one?
OK and now a big line right down the middle.
OK.
Do you see this square?
I want you to use this red pencil and draw the same shape in this square down here.
Just like that one.
I'll never meet Radha!
Never!
I just asked for Radha's hand in-marriage.
And not asked for her in alms.
Kishan!
"- See, how he humiliated us."
"At least have some shame, you insolent!"
"No, father!"
Don't do that.
He has given many tests of love.
He's really a noble man.
"If this will not happen, no body will trust love."
We've spent every year in tears.
Only... only for your prestige.
"Father, I'm begging for my love."
Give my love to me.
And you... is this the reward you gave me for my love?
Is this the reward of my love?
Tell me... tell me.
- Father!
Tell me...
Tell her that her father is dead.
He's dead.

"And if you try it out with these points, it should all work."
"OK, next problem."

I think this cutting and pasting works out well.
I think I have time for at least two more.
"OK, let me clear this."
Clear this one right here.
Let me paste it in.
"OK, it says, some ordered pairs for a linear function of x are given in the table below."
It's kind of like the last one.
Which of the following equations was used to generate the table above?
Well we could do the same thing we did the last time.
"We could say OK, this is going to have some relation."
You know y is equal to mx plus b.
It's going to be a line and this is the slope y-intercept form.
And they tell us it's the linear function.
So that's why we can immediately say that's going to be a line.
There's no x squared or anything like that.
So a good place to start is just with the slope.
So slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
So let's see.
"When x goes from 1 to 3, what does y go for."
It goes from 1 to 7.
So change in x is equal to 3 minus 1 or just 2.
And what's change in y?
7 minus 1.
"So that is equal to 6 over-- oh, no."
Sorry.
Change in x was 3 minus 1.
Sorry about that.

Four years later, in 999, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III gave this district to his sister Adelheid, who was an abbess in Quedlinburg."
"In the center of this area, the ""provincia Gera"", a town with the same name was established. Another document, which is from the year 1237, said for the first time that there was a town called Gera. In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the ""Vögte"" of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the counts and princes of Reuß, which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918."
"In the early modern period, Gera was famous for making textiles. There were some fires in which a lot of the town was destroyed, for example in 1686 and in 1780. In 1806, Napoleon was in Gera before the Battle of Jena."
"In the 19th century, Gera became an important city of industry. Before that, Gera was a quite small town, but in the year 1900, it had already about 45,000 inhabitants."
"In 1920, Thuringia was founded as a state of the Weimar Republic. Gera was the biggest city of the state, because Erfurt was not yet a part of Thuringia. At the end of World War II, some parts of Gera were destroyed by bombs, for example the Osterstein Castle."
"After World War II, Gera was in the Soviet Occupation Zone and then in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). From 1952 to 1990, it was the capital of the Gera District (""Bezirk Gera"") of the GDR."
"Since the German Reunification in 1990, Gera belongs to the Free State of Thuringia in the Federal Republic of Germany."

"Since 1959, Gera has had more than 100,000 inhabitants. The highest number of inhabitants of Gera was 134,834 in the year 1988. Since the German Reunification, the number of inhabitants becomes smaller and smaller. Now there are fewer people who live in Gera than in Jena, so Gera is only the third-biggest city in Thuringia. On 31 December 2008, there were only 100,643 people living in Gera."

Dimensional analysis
"Dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences. It is used to convert measurements and to find out something's dimensions. Sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis."
"Any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels. For example, when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used, you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25, you also have to divide ""miles"" by ""gallons"", which gives the unit ""miles/gallon"" or ""miles per gallon"". The final answer is ""25 miles per gallon""."
"Looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers. For example, to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters, use the equation ""1609.34 meters equals one mile"" or 1609.34 meters per mile. Using division, the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile, which ends up as miles2/meter, which is not just the meters. With multiplication, the unit labels will be miles × meters/mile. The miles will cancel, leaving just meters."

Planning for Operation Diadem.
"Both sides realised that no result could be achieved until the spring. The Germans built a new defence line, the Caesar C line. The Allies planned an attack in May. This would include attacking the Gustav Line, which was called Operation ""Diadem""."
"In March, the 2nd Italian SS ""Vendetta"" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Allied forces at the Anzio/Nettuno beach.

"In economics, Jevons paradox is a paradox about resource usage. It is also called Jevons effect, after William Stanley Jevons who first observed it in 1865. Jevons observed that the steam engine James Watt had developed was much more efficient that the earlier model of Thomas Newcomen. Despite this, the use of coal in England increased. The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines."

The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a ""wolf hunt,"" people knew that the ""wolves"" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846."
"The city has a well-preserved downtown with a number of remaining historic businesses. Founded by German immigrants, the Warsaw Brewery opened in 1861 and operated for more than 100 years, ending production in 1971. The facility was renovated and reopened in 2006 as a bar and restaurant."

Grammar.
"The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:"
"Unlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as “the” and “a”)."
"There are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German), but it changes the adjective's ending."
"Like many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers."

And fabled wealth no more doth seem
The idle fancy of a dream — Australia!

"From sunny plain and woodland steep,"
And love and joy bright vigils keep;
Where the glad voice of childish glee
Is mingling with the melody
Of nature's hidden minstrelsy — Australia!
"There is a land where, floating free,"
"From mountain-top to girdling sea,"
A proud flag waves exultingly;
"And FREEDOM'S sons the banner bear,"
"No shackled slave can breathe the air,"
Fairest of Britain's daughters fair — Australia!&lt;/poem&gt;

Simon Blackburn
"These examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define, even for linguists, or people who study languages as their job."
"When a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility. An example of of this is Portuguese and Spanish. While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages."

Farn-Sasan
"Farn-Sasan was the last king in the Indo-Parthian Kingdom who ruled Sakastan from about 210 to 226. There are no books that talk about him. He is only known because of the coins he issued. He was killed in 226 by the ruler Ardashir I. Because of this, the Indo-Parthian rule ended."
Origin of name.
"Then name ""Sasan"" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *""Sāsāna"" (""defeating enemy""). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity."
Biography.
"Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say ""Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings."" Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers."
Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.
"On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan."
"Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule."

Battle of Guam (1944)
"The Second Battle of Guam (July 21 — August 10, 1944) was the capture of Guam by the United States from Japanese control. Guam was a U.S. territory (in the Mariana Islands). The battle was during the Pacific campaign of World War II."
Background.
Guam is the largest island of the Marianas. It is 30 miles (48 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) wide. It had been a United States island since its capture from Spain in 1898.
"It was captured by the Japanese on December 10, 1941. This was after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. It was not as fortified as the other Mariana Islands, such as Saipan."
The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas was for heavy bombing by planes and then bombing by battleships.
"Guam was chosen as a target because it was big enough to be a base for the next attacks on the Philippines, Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. The harbor at Apra could take the largest ships. The two airfields were big enough for B-29 Superfortress bombers."
"The invasion of Saipan was planned for June 15, 1944, with landings on Guam planned for June 18."
A large Japanese carrier attack and heavy fighting in Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being delayed for a month.
Battle.
"Guam is surrounded by reefs, cliffs, and heavy waves. This makes Guam hard to attack."
"On July 21, the Americans landed on both sides on the western side of Guam. The 3rd Marine Division landed at 08:28. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Ships. The Americans had many dead and wounded."
By 09:00 men and tanks were on both beaches. The 77th Infantry Division had to walk through the shallow water. Japanese guns fired at them.
"By nightfall the Americans controlled the beachs about 2,000 meters deep. Japanese attacks were made throughout the first few days."
"Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on July 28, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the defenders."
Supply was very difficult for the Americans in the first days of the battle.
"The attacks against the American beaches, as well as the violent fighting, had tired out the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a few tanks left."
Obata moved to the mountainous central and northern part of the island. He could not get any more supplies or get new troops because of American control of the sea and air around Guam.

When Bradford was 12 years old he went with a friend to hear the pastor Richard Clyfton. Clyfton was a minister who did not believe in the Church of England. Bradford believed in Clyfton’s words. His uncles told him not to go to that church but he went anyway.
During one meeting he became friends with William Brewster. Brewster did not live far away and Bradford borrowed books from him about the new church.
King James I of England started to punish the people who did not follow the Church of England. They were called Separatists. By 1607 many members of the Separatists were arrested. Brewster was made to pay a fine for going to the church. Some members were put into prison and others were watched night and day. The people also learned that other Separatists in London had been put into prison and left to starve to death.

The Memphis Sanitation Strike.
Non-violence.

"King thought that if protesters or the people on strike were violent, other people would only pay attention to the violence. They would not pay attention to how badly the sanitation workers were treated."
Boycotting.

He explains that one black person might be poor, but all together, they spent a lot of money. This gave them power. If they stopped buying things from businesses owned by white people, then those businesses would lose a lot of money. Then they would have to pay attention, or else they could go out of business. Meanwhile, black people could use their money to buy things from businesses owned by other blacks. King says:"

"However, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says:"
"Soon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land."
"King is saying that like Moses, he has ""been to the mountaintop"" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land."

And all above is azure bright — Australia!

"Where laughing corn luxuriant grows,"
Land of the myrtle and the rose;
On hill and plain the clust'ring vine
"Is gushing out with purple wine,"
And cups are quaffed to thee and thine — Australia!
There is a land where treasures shine
Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;

Devil's food cake
"Devil's food cake is an old fashioned chocolate cake made of chocolate or cocoa and baking powder. It is moist, soft, rich, and very good for keeping. It is a light-textured chocolate layer-type cake with a deep reddish brown color. The cake gets this bright red color from the large amount of red food dye used in the preparation. Devil's food cake is usually thought of in terms of dark chocolate, but originally it was red. Today cooks, using modern processed cocoa, sometimes add a touch of red food coloring to bring back the authentic color."
Devil's food cakes can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
Variations.
The Devil's Food Cake may also be called a Red velvet cake.
Partridge
The partridge is a medium sized bird. They are known as game birds because they are hunted and eaten by humans. They are in the Pheasant family (Phasianidae).
"Partridges are in the song ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"". The line ""...and a Partridge in a pear tree"" is sung."
Color and shape.
"Most partridges are brown, gray and white. They are camouflaged and difficult to see. They have short legs and short bills. Partridges are smaller than Pheasants but they are bigger than Quails."
Partridges can not fly very well and they do not migrate. This means they always stay in the same area all year round.
Habitat.
"Partridges live in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. They live in places such as moors, grassland and farmland. They feed mostly on seeds, and nest on the ground. This means their nests are not very safe from predators such as foxes. Partridges use their camouflage to make it difficult for predators to see them and their nests."

Black-legged dart frog
"The black-legged dart frog (""Phyllobates bicolor""), also known as the bicolored dart frog or Neari in Choco, is the second most toxic of the wild poison dart frogs. It lives in Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 1500 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
"The adult male frog is 32.1-39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.7-42.7 mm. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Young frogs have stripes on their sides. In some groups of this frog, the stripes go away when the frog is an adult. In other places, the adult frogs keep their stripes."
Poison.
Human beings who live where the frog lives have used the frog to poison arrows. The human can touch the arrow to the frog's back without killing it. Or the human can kill and heat the frog's body.
The poison in the frog's skin is a chemical called batrachotoxin. The frog gets the poison from the ants and other insects that it eats. So frogs kept as pets do not have poison.
Threats.
There are fewer of these frogs than there were. Scientisis think this could be because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans turn the forests into forms and take the trees for lumber. Human beings also catch these frogs to sell as pets.

History.
"The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was ""Westpalmbeach"", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the ""Calaboose"" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period."
"Originally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead."
"In the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. They led to a short revival for the city, but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown. Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district."

Taxi
"A taxi (taxicab or cab in the United States) is a car, or other vehicle which is used for public transport. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis."
"In most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go."
"Riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport."
History.
"The first taxi-type system started in Paris and London in the early 17th century. These were carts pulled by (carriages) and could be hired. The monarchies that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the 19th century, Hansom cabs were mostly used because of their higher level of safety."

Royal Thai General System of Transcription
"The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart."

"A mince pie, also known as 'minced pie', is a small British fruit-based mince sweet pie. It is usually served during the Christmas season. Originally it was a savoury pie, now it is a sweet pie."
Yeah.
If it could just be spread out a little bit.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It has really been nice here, uh,"
"we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,"
but I don't know if we'll get it or not.
A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.
"The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles."
Uh-huh.
Are you in an agricultural area?
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"We have,"
"Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
We have quite a few farmers.
"We, we live out in the country."
"We are on a farm,"
but we are not a farming person
Uh-huh.
"Uh, we have a garden."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, but we are not farmers."
Huh.
"Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south."
Uh-huh.
"And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I guess you are.
Uh-huh.
That we dress in the jeans
"and then there's kind of the, the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But there's not much,"
middle of the road.
It's nice that there's not a requirement for it.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Sometimes I think there should be.
Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines.
"Oh, yeah,"
right
"Yeah,"
I guess you see those once in a while.
"And you know the, they have the no shorts deal,"
"and some of these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about being."
Sure.
"But, uh, You know, that's, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code."
Yeah.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"I guess they're, the, isn't there a dress code, something about spaghetti straps,"
I'm not even sure what they are.
Supposedly and backless things
"Oh, backless,"
all right.
"but, I've seen those, too,"
"but,"
"Okay,"
"so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation,"
"but, I think we, we did it"
"Uh, yeah."
"Okay,"
"and, and your name was Lisa."
Lisa.
Great.
Are you the Expressway sites?
"I am,"
"yes,"
and I work in the north building.
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, well, thank you."
Thank you.
"All right,"
good day.
"Uh-huh,"
bye-bye.
"Uh, advice on son or daughter going to college."
Right.
"Uh, that's advice that I will need in time future for my children, rather than one that I have, uh, personal experience with"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to, to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet, meet those needs."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"uh, let's see,"
"when I, when I went away to school, I'm trying to think my criteria."
"I guess when you're, when you're eighteen or so, uh, it would be important to know if it was a coed college"
"That was a, a strict requirement for me."
"And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But the system doesn't allow for the corrections
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, that's interesting."
"I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there."
And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
Yes.
"And,"
And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.
Right.
She was in Cobb County.
Right.
"I'm,"
I can't really say much about the schools up here.
I really don't come from here
Uh-huh.
I'm only up here temporarily on an internship
"but  uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually."
Okay.
"And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad."
They're pretty good.
"Well, that's great."
"But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good."
Uh-huh.
"For example, I have a brother in North Carolina"
"and he says the schools there are, are incredibly bad. Uh, just terrible."
"Well, I feel that we're way behind."
and that was almost twenty years ago
Uh-huh.
"It isn't,"
"sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, uh,"
"that would have been about, uh, twenty years too"
"uh, uh, just last year"
"and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case"
"and it seemed it really, trivial."
It involved two bicycles.
We didn't do the sentencing.
The judge did.
Huh.
So
How interesting.
"we, we rendered a verdict"
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh
And that was here in Wisconsin.
"So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,"
"I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California."
"Hi,"
"this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota."
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
"Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it."
Yep.
"Uh, I'm ready whenever you are."
Okay
"So, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there?"
"Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous."
Really.
Yeah.
What have you been to lately?
"Um, let's see."
"Well, uh, this is almost, sort of funny."
"I was just um,"
"friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE which is Steven Segal, because, uh, we're both big karate fans."
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
So we wanted to see what this is like.
"And, uh, impressed with actually."
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
"I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,"
and I just think he's pretty good.
Yeah.
"But, uh, this movie,"
I'm convinced now he can act.
Uh-huh.
How's his karate?
"Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good."
I think in this one it wasn't so good.
"I generally, um,"
"movies like that scare me, though."
"I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up."
"Well, well they do,"
they get
Fighting.
"I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that."
We wanted to jump in the cars and race.
Right.
And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
"and it has not, really. Which is a bit of a disappointment."
"But it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about
"I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?"
"Your, your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours."
"It starts in, uh, March as a rule."
Uh-huh.
"See that is quite a bit,"
we are just beginning.
"People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now."
We could still have a frost.
"Really,"
this late?
Uh-huh.
Could you have snow?
"Uh, probably not."
"But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June."
"Oh, well, we do not have that problem"
Early June.
"So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring."
It is almost like an early Summer for us.
"Oh, that is nice."
Uh-huh.
"We could use a little more rain, I believe."
"Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours"
Uh
"Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then it stops for three months.
Right.
"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
"She, She's an emotional victim"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's terrible, you know"
"and,"
"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
Yeah.
"Oh, that,"
"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
"The, the criminal gets right back out"
"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
"Yes,"
they are.
"It's,"
"Well, that's about five minutes,"
"so unless you've got something else, well,"
Yeah.
No
It's a pleasure talking with you.
"All right,"
"Ron, we'll see you later."
"Okeydoke,"
good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Tell me about your home.
"Well, it's an older home."
It was made back in the early sixties.
It's a pier beam house.
Huh-uh.
Is that right.
Have you heard of it?
"I've, I've seen the ads for it,"
but I'm not real sure what it's about.
"Yeah, um,"
"I actually hadn't heard anything about it,"
"and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,"
"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,"
at first they told me.
Yeah.
"And I thought, what a strange combination,"
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.
That is a strange combination.
"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,"
so it's lot better.
Mel Brooks you probably know.
Yeah.
"I know,"
"so it, it was a strange combination."
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.
"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out"
"and, and they die"
"Oh, yeah."
"and they have to,"
Both of them.
Right.
"Both of them are dead,"
"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up."
"You know, they go"
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.
Oh.
"I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
"I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,"
I'd make some quick arrangements
That's true.
and I've told so many stories about the snakes
Uh-huh.
"you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that"
Yeah.
"I'm just,"
Oh.
"I don't know,"
Yeah.
What's the largest fish you ever caught?
"Uh, gosh,"
"I think it was only like three and a half pounds,"
and for me that's big.
"That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big."
"Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,"
I know they have bigger fish than that
"but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,"
"Oh, on a lake,"
yeah.
"On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read ""lake"" not ""like"""
"yeah,"
that's a good size fish
I would be impressed
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"So, uh, but"
"yeah,"
I'd love to go catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.
I've never done that.
Uh-huh.
"and, and he really,"
"I don't know,"
"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
"I'm like, oh, come on."
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
Yeah.
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
And to make it believable.
Yes.
"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
I don't know about any body else
"but I was, it was great."
"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
He did great.
"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
you take care up there
"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
"Absolutely,"
"I'm ready for it,"
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
"No,"
oh no.
"Oh well, take care."
Take care now.
"Bye, bye."
"Bye, bye."
Where do you get most of your news?
"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
"I, uh, know the name"
but I haven't been there.
"Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant."
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
"Uh, I went to the Naval Academy."
"Oh, the U S ,  Naval Academy?"
"And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty."
Uh-huh.
"And,"
"yeah,"
"we would go over there to, uh,"
"pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders"
"I think it was,"
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
"Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,"
"but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,"
"and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy"
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
"Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?"
"I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has."
"Yes, sir."
"My dad worked there for years, and years."
Uh-huh.
"That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando."
"So,"
Do you have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
"Yes, sir."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I love Mexican food myself."
"Oh, do you?"
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
"Oh, we, we do too."
"We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food."
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
"It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point."
"But the kids,  seem to enjoy it."
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, let's see."
"We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here"
"but it's, uh, not part of a chain"
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
"But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had"
"that was, uh, not just really super."
It's nice to find a place like that.
"Oh, boy that is wonderful."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I agree with you on that."
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
"I, I love crab meat in particular."
Um.
"I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to."
"Oh, boy."
"Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?"
Uh-huh.
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
Uh-huh.
and our shifts overlapped
Uh-huh.
"so I would come in,"
"and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,"
"and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,"
"it's my vitamins,"
"I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,"
"why are they working at my desk,"
and can I have it back.
Yeah.
"Can I have it back soon, maybe."
"Then you start missing stuff,"
and.
"Oh, yeah,"
"no mommy is going to take the vitamins,"
"I'm sorry,"
I have
That's okay.
"See that would, that would make me really mad,"
"because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,"
"just because,"
"I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way"
and you know how it looks and everything.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, you know how you left it the day before."
Uh-huh. child_talking
"That would bother me, definitely."
"Oh, yeah,"
"so, that's, child_talking"
"and I was just like, we've got to quit this."
And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
"Oh, shoot."
"My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything."
Eat this or <laughter>.
That's right.
"So, I can see the concerns on what different people want."
Yeah.
"Because some,"
"I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
"I think,"
"yeah,"
"I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement."
Uh-huh.
"And just have like at the most, like ten kids."
And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
No.
Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
That's true.
"I, I'd love to do it."
But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.
Yeah.
"I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ..."
More than what it's worth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would scare me.
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"
"in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania"
Uh-huh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
Uh-huh
"Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting."
"So it's really up north in the country, really, ."
"Yeah,"
I guess so.
yeah.
"It's,"
"well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far."
Gosh.
I see.
"So,"
It's pretty nice country up there?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Hills, or what?"
"Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops."
Uh-huh
Is it farmland?
"Um, not a lot of farmland there."
"Mostly it's, uh,"
"I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own uh, growing their own food."
"Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle."
"Oh, yes."
"And even that's, you know, small time mostly."
Sure.
"Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry."
Uh-huh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.
the wood may
"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
Oh.
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
"Right,"
"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too."
Uh-huh
Made all the decisions
"but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really."
What other movies have you seen?
"Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week."
"Oh, how was that?"
It was pretty good.
"Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,"
"but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun."
"Lots of little funny spots, huh."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Did they have Thing
"and,"
"Oh, yes,"
"in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series."
"I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day."
Really?
And he runs around a lot.
"How did,"
I've always wondered how he gets around.
"Uh, you know, just finger hopping."
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
"and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir"
"so,"
Do you sing at choir at your church?
"Yes,"
I do.
Yeah.
"Yes,"
I do.
"That's,"
"in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir."
Yeah.
"I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade"
and they wouldn't let me in.
"So, I never tried again."
"Well, I sing in the choir,"
"I do know if they want me to or not,"
but at least I do sing in it
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well,"
I never really learned the music or anything.
"I never learned,"
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
"I was at,"
"I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician."
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
"But after one semester of that, I said no, no,"
this isn't for me.
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
"wait a minute,"
we bought one in ninety.
"We've got three cars, of all things."
Uh-huh.
"So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan."
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
"Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,"
"we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have"
Uh-huh.
"and then, of course, we look into the prices."
Yeah.
"And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted"
"because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time."
"Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"So, uh,"
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,"
"and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they, they, uh,"
"I've been extremely,"
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles."
"I, I've been working,"
"we're going to have a baby this summer,"
and I'm not going to work anymore.
"Oh, how exciting."
Yeah.
"So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day."
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
"and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,"
so.
Yeah.
"Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather."
Yeah.
"Eat at six, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family."
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, yeah,"
I don't like the run in and out part.
Yeah.
"And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened"
"and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home."
"Yeah,"
that's neat.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things"
and I think that's good.
"Yeah,"
that really is.
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
Yeah.
"I think,"
Right now we eat in front of the T V
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
"Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out."
"Yeah,"
good.
That's considered a pretty good program.
"It's nice and small, which means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get,  it again."
Huh
"But, uh, it's worth it once you get it."
"Well, yes,"
that's good.
"And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah
Most the class are pretty small.
Good.
That works out real well.
"Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment"
"or a house somewhere, what would you get?"
"Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy."
Uh-huh.
"I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs."
Uh-huh.
"Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, had a hamster or two,"
"and they, they got,  to be a lot of fun."
A hamster.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, it's amazing how much character,"
Okay.
Your family have reunions on a regular basis?
"Probably, once every five years."
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
"it's,"
the lines in there were just perfect.
"I mean, it was classic TREK."
"Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"No,"
it's just the old guys still.
"Yeah,"
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
"However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time"
"so,"
"You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY"
Uh-huh.
that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
That was it.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
"Yeah,"
"uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,"
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
Huh.
"So,"
"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
I think it's a hundred years.
Huh.
Somewhere in that range.
"Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy."
"Oh, that's right."
Is that right?
He was a doctor still?
"You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with."
"Um, uh-huh."
"You know, they, they see most, uh,"
"they're, they're quite upset about the, uh, the disruptive influence of school."
"Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And in Japan they would be, you know."
Right.
"But, uh, here again, you get back into a political thing, where, uh,"
Yeah
"there's, there's,"
right.
"There's definitely too much leeway as far as,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,"
Uh-huh.
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
"and I, I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,"
"but, I appreciate more what I had."
Uh-huh.
"And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,"
"Yeah,"
were you at Baylor?
and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
"Yeah,"
did you go to Baylor?
"No,"
"I went to U T at Austin,"
uh-huh.
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I'm, uh,"
"I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas"
"I didn't get in debt,"
so.
"Oh, that's good."
"I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can"
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
"Oh, uh-huh."
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that any longer
I know.
"I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,"
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
"My, uh, roommate does sew some"
"and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time"
"but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again."
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, see, some people are, some aren't"
"because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters"
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
"But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that."
"Yeah,"
"and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I know exactly what you mean."
"We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us."
Uh-huh.
"But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that."
"Oh, well, that is fortunate."
Yeah.
It is an old farm house
"and, uh, we really like it here."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, I like it, I like it here."
"Uh, I, I grew up here."
I have lived other places
"and, and, but I, I did grow up here"
Uh-huh.
and this is very much home for me.
Uh-huh.
"And,"
It is nice down there.
"I, I, I liked it when we visited there."
I hope you visited during the winter.
Uh-huh.
"One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter"
"and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway."
Right.
Right.
That is the best time to go.
Yeah.
"and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice."
"It has been hot,"
"but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there."
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah,"
do you?
"Yes,"
that is great.
"Yeah,"
it's fun.
"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
"Oh, really?"
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
It is a real different one.
"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
"But,"
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
"No,"
I haven't watched that.
"Oh, it's, it's really good."
"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
Uh-huh.
and it's set in post World War Two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
It's really interesting.
"Oh, yeah."
It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
Sounds neat.
"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
Yeah.
"Is that on, what what station?"
"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
"Oh, okay."
What other shows do you like?
"Yeah,"
I drink beer.
"have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ..."
"Yeah,"
whiskey is in liters.
Yes.
"And, and the next,"
"yeah,"
"point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,"
yeah.
"It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange."
Yeah.
What's a fifth of whiskey?
Yeah.
"I, I always wondered about that myself."
It was a marketing ploy.
"And, and they had quarts at the same time though."
Yeah.
"But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five"
"and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,"
Yeah.
"it's, uh, I find that interesting."
It's ...
"But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles"
Liters.
"and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational."
Yeah.
"It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop"
"and, uh, everything's still inches."
"Everything's still fractions of inches, or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ..."
Yeah.
"It's, it's hard to think  though."
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
Yeah.
"I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now"
Uh-huh.
"you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
there's not as much slapstick anymore.
"Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,"
so we may see more slapstick.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, that's true,"
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.
"Yeah,"
"it is, it is,"
"and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,"
have you ever seen any of the movies?
Excuse me?
The French movies that .
"No,"
"not really,"
"the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different."
"Um, he's, uh,"
"well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,"
and his wife's all excited
"but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,"
"but, um. O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,"
Um.
"it was a very famous, uh, popular movie."
"Norman Gray,"
Norman Gear.
"No,"
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"
there would be much more of that
Yeah
no doubt.
Are you involved in the legal system at all?
No.
"But I .  I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on."
Okay.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
I've got some friends that are lawyers
so.
"Yeah,"
I do too
so.
One of them just got his law degree.
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now."
No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.
And when he retires I'm retiring.
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,"
Uh-huh.
"that's it,"
Yeah.
"you know, no more"
"Well, but, the,"
"did you, did you go to Florida in a van?"
As though
Uh-huh
"And we wanted to travel,"
"well, that was really nice traveling"
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?"
Yeah.
"And see what they think of them,"
the different kinds
Yeah.
"because I've only ridden in the one,"
"What, what kind was it?"
that's it.
"Uh, shoot"
I can't even think of the name of it now.
"What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,"
"we have two kids,"
and we went to Disney World
Uh-huh.
"uh, actually I grew up in Alabama,"
"and I went to see my mother,"
"and then went on down to Disney World,"
"and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon."
"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,"
Yeah.
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"
"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much."
"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."
Oh.
"All right,"
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"
"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy."
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"
but I just use those little cans of chicken.
Uh-huh.
"And it makes it so much easier,"
"and so you dump the rice,"
you dump the chicken
"and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I don't, I don't think that,"
"well, when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then all of a sudden you look at the bill
"and you go, Oh my gosh,"
I spent this much.
"But now, the fact that you still have two cards,"
"are you, do you use them, more judiciously?"
"Yeah,"
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car
Yeah.
and that paid for a new transmission
Uh-huh.
"um, and, and things like that."
"Um, and we try not to use them for incidental type things, like, you know, gas and stuff like that."
Purchases.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh
"Clothing, sales."
Yeah.
Sales I find are a pain.
Yeah.
"I've, I've gotten, I've gotten a lot more away from, from credit cards,"
and I pay by check a lot more now.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it sounds good, you know."
"Like I said, it sounds like you're, you've really got it under control."
"I, I admire you for having, having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,"
"but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying, uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins,  you girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these choices, you know,"

"In 1924, the Imperial Cotton merged with Cosmos Cotton Mills (formerly Yarmouth Duck & Cotton). The new company, Cosmos-Imperial Mills Limited, owned and operated the complex until 1972, when most of its machinery and workers were sent back to Nova Scotia. A textile museum in Yarmouth houses many of the ""Big Looms"" that may have been used at 270 Sherman."
"The mill building, which housed 1,220 spinning spindles, 3,735 spindles, 98 duck looms and looms for the manufacture of cotton drayer felts, is constructed out of brick and timber with ""slow burning"" wood beams positioned across the 30,000 square feet of space on the second and third floor Mill."
"Next to the Mill Building is a smokestack that was used by three original boiler systems. Adjacent to the smokestack is a storage warehouse that was originally used for sorting, painting, finishing, shipping and waterproofing cotton. Centre of the mill courtyard is the Mills Arts Building, which was a later addition to the 270 Sherman complex and used today for artists to work their private units. Occupants of the building include professional artists that do photography, oil painting, sculpturing and designing to name a few."
The Cotton Factory is also a popular location for film and television productions. Its exteriors have been used for scenes from the mid-1800s to modern day and even future apocalypses.

= = = Henry Clay Sevier = = =
"Henry Clay ""Happy"" Sevier, Sr. (January 24, 1896 – June 1, 1974) was a lawyer and politician from Tallulah, Louisiana. One of a large political family, he served from 1936 to 1952 as a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from Madison Parish."
"Sevier was born in 1896 in Madison Parish, Louisiana, a son of the former Roxie Roberta Allen and James Douglas Sevier, Sr., a native of Port Gibson, in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. His parents moved to Madison Parish in 1880, where his father became a planter. Sevier attended local segregated schools for his lower education. He graduated in 1917 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge."
"His father's family were descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and pioneer and first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. His line became prominent in northeastern Louisiana. One of Henry's cousins was Andrew L. Sevier, who served as a Louisiana State Senator with repeated reelection, from 1932 until his death in office in 1962."
"During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals."
"After the war, in 1918 Sevier married the former Retta Brooks (1899-1992) of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. The couple had three children: Carolyn S. Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish."
"Sevier and his wife went to New York City, where he completed postgraduate work at Columbia University in 1921. He graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center, and they settled in Tallulah."
"There Sevier entered into practice with Jefferson B. Snyder of Tallulah, the political boss of the delta parishes in northeastern Louisiana. Snyder wielded power for more than 40 years as the regional district attorney, from 1904 to 1948."
"Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978)."
"Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested."
"After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.) The senior Sevier was also president of the Tallulah State Bank and Trust Company. Given these additional responsibilities, and having served eight terms in the state house, he chose not to run again after his term ending in 1952."
"Like Snyder, Sevier was active in the Democratic State Central Committee. He was the national committeeman during the first administration of Governor Jimmie Davis. Afterward he was selected as the state Democratic Party chairman under Governor Earl Kemp Long."
"He belonged to the Presbyterian church with his wife. He was affiliated with the 6th Judicial District Bar Association, Rotary International, and the Masonic lodge."
"Sevier died in 1974 in Mercy Hospital in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Along with many Sevier family members, Sevier and his wife are interred at Silver Cross Cemetery in Tallulah."

Smila ( ) is a city located on Dnieper Upland near the Tyasmyn River. It is a district center of Cherkasy Oblast of Ukraine.
Settlements Ploske and Irdynivka are subordinated to Smila city council.
"Smila serves as the administrative center of Smila Raion (district), but is designated as a City of regional significance and does not belong to the raion."
"Climate in the city is moderate continental. Winters are soft with frequent thaws. Summers are warm, sometimes with little rain. Periods of temperatures higher than +10 endure up to 170 days. Annual precipitation level is 450–520 mm. Dnieper tributary Tyasmyn River flows through the city."
"Smila and its neighbourhood have been settled since the ancient times. Archeologists discovered a number of ruins of ancient settlements and numerous mounds located in different parts of Smila and near the city. Two biggest ancient settlements and 44 mounds were first researched during 1879–1883 years by O. O. Bobrynsky, grandson of Smila owner, Count Olexiy Olexiyovich Bobrynsky. These findings belong partly to the Stone Age and partly to the Bronze age."
Official foundation date of Smila is 1542. Grand Duchy of Lithuania documents tell us that settlement Yatzkove-Tyasmyno was founded on a hamlet place in 1542. The modern name of the city has been known since the first half of the 17th century.
"City’s name is connected with a local legend first recorded by Count L. O. Bobrynsky: ""An unknown girl led warriors through a heavy swamp showing a route to the enemy. The battle was very bloody. They killed a lot of enemies there but they couldn’t save the brave girl. They buried her near Tyasmyn and called her Smila. Then warriors honoured her in the city’s name."""
"After the Union of Lublin in July 1569, it was a settlement of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth."
During 1648 — 1667  this squadron town belonged to Chyhyryn Regiment. In 1654 Russian tsar gave Pereyaslav colonel Pavlo Teteria possession of the town. During 1658-1659 Danylo Vyhovsky changed Teterya as the owner.
"Chudniv treaty of 1660 renewed Polish power on this land. Smila became an ownership of Stanislav Koniecpolski as part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Constant wars between Ukrainian Cossacks, Polish owners, Tatars, Turks, Russians and Swedes led to demolition of Smila. (More The Ruin)"
"Further owners of Smila, princes Lubomirski built a wooden castle with arbor and palisade around the whole city in 1742."
"During 1730s-1760s parts of the population of Smila took part in Haidamaka movement. In 1787 prince Xaveriy Lubomirski sold lands around Smila to Russian prince Potyomkin. Six years later Smila became a property of Potyomkin’s nephew, Count Alexander Samoylov. Two years later population of Smila was 1747 people with 50 crafters, 9 shoemakers, 6 weavers, 8 tailors. Others were peasants."
After second Partition of Poland Smela was a township which subordinated to Cherkassy county of Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1838 was built here.

"Margaret Myrtle ""Mitzi"" Hoag (September 25, 1932 – February 26, 2019) was an American actress. Over the course of her career, she appeared in more than 73 different TV shows and movies. Notable among these are recurring roles in ""We'll Get By"", ""Bonanza"", ""Here Come the Brides"", and ""The Partridge Family""."
"Hoag was raised in North Olmsted, Ohio, near Cleveland, where she was born. Her father, John C. Hoag, was a supervisor for the A&P store chain. She graduated from John Marshall High School in 1949. A straight-A student and head majorette of the marching band, she appeared in numerous high school stage productions, already using the nickname ""Mitzi"". After high school, Hoag attended Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois, completing her degree in two years under the radically flexible University of Chicago curriculum of Robert Maynard Hutchins. She chose Shimer for its small classes and the opportunity for horseback riding. Because Shimer was then closely affiliated with the University of Chicago, she is sometimes reported as having graduated from there."
"When Hoag graduated from Shimer at age 19 in 1952, she was one of the first five Shimer students to receive the bachelor's degree. She was the only woman in the graduating class. She earned a bachelor of arts in general education, and became a certified teacher, but her experiences with drama at Shimer turned her towards an acting career. After leaving Shimer, Hoag studied drama at the graduate level at Case Western Reserve University for two years."
"In the mid-1950s, Hoag moved to New York, where she continued her study of acting with Herbert Berghof. She was cast in multiple off-Broadway shows, but these were all cancelled due to funding problems. Finally, she starred in the title role of the 1958 off-Broadway hit ""Heloise"", an adaptation by James Forsyth of the story of Heloise and Abelard. The play, which won considerable critical acclaim, was produced primarily by erstwhile actors and staffers of Case Western's Eldred Theatre."
"Hoag subsequently went to Hollywood, on her mother's advice. There she married Stephen Wolfson, who had a bit part in ""Heloise"", and later became a teacher. They had a daughter together, but subsequently divorced."
"In Hollywood, Hoag at first worked as a stage actress. She parlayed a successful stage performance as Annie Sullivan in ""The Miracle Worker"" into screen roles, starting with a role in the movie ""Tammy and the Doctor"", and continuing with numerous TV appearances."
"In the late 1960s, Hoag had a recurring role in ""Here Come the Brides"" in the late 1960s. In addition, from 1966 to 1972, she appeared frequently in the TV show ""Bonanza"" as Alice Brenner. In 1976, she appeared in the drama ""Family"" as Clara Briault. During this period, she also appeared in several movies, including ""Play It as It Lays"", ""Pieces of Dreams"", and ""Devil's Angels""."
"She also played Natalie Green's adoptive mother on ""The Facts of Life"", a role she played through all 9 seasons."
"Hoag's first and only starring role in a TV series came in 1975, when she appeared as the mother Liz Platt in the CBS sitcom ""We'll Get By"", starring opposite Paul Sorvino. A family sitcom, the show was created by Alan Alda, and modeled after his own domestic life. The show ran to twelve episodes, filmed in front of a live studio audience. Originally scheduled for September 1974, the show did not air until March 1975, in a time slot facing ""Chico and the Man"", one of NBC's most popular programs. It was not renewed."

When dashing forward at full speed, the vessels sprayed water high in the air, earning the nickname ""the fountains"" from Finnish sailors."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Sisu"", together with ""Nuoli"", was patrolling east of Gogland when it came across a large, stationary Soviet minesweeper of the ""Fugas"" class.

"The 8-demicubic honeycomb, or demiocteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets ."
"The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""8-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice. The best known is 240, from the E lattice and the 5 honeycomb."
formula_1 contains formula_2 as a subgroup of index 270. Both formula_1 and formula_2 can be seen as affine extensions of formula_5 from different nodes:
"The D lattice (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8). It is identical to the E8 lattice. At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 2=128 from lower dimension contact progression (2), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1))."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four ""D8 lattices"": It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 16 (""2n"" for n≥5). and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb, , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex Voronoi cell, ."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 256 8-demicube facets around each vertex.

"St. Catharine High School is an all-girls, private, Roman Catholic high school in the Bronx, New York. It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York."
"The Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, opened an academy in the Washington Heights section of New York City in September 1889. The classes included were grades 1 through 12. At that time, the first academy resembled the large estates which surrounded it. Toward the end of the 19th century as registration increased, the Sisters erected a new building across the street at 539 West 152nd Street. In 1900 the University of the State of New York granted a Regents charter to the school."
The rapid growth of the area and the great increase in enrollment showed the inadequacy of the accommodations. The elementary grades in the academy were discontinued and these classrooms were used for high school students.
"Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures."
"In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California."
"Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly."
"In June 1972 a major rebuilding plan was proposed. On January 26, 1983, a ceremony was held signaling the completion of the project."
"In April 1997, the Port of San Diego began a master plan for San Diego International Airport. The goal of the plan is to provide incremental, cost-effective improvements to SDIA to meet the region's near-term demand for air service while a long-term regional air transportation strategy is developed in collaboration with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and other transportation agencies."

He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973."
"His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madarász. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended to the Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation."
"In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934."
"Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won."
"In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938."
"From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses."
"Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punčec and John Bromwich."
"In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia."
In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame.
"He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy."
"Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely ""Lovely as Spring"" and ""What Did You Dream Last Night?"". He also starred in the 1938 musical ""Happy Landing"" and the 1941 war comedy ""Caught in the Draft"", although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio. After his retirement, he designed tennis courts. His wife worked as an interior designer. He was involved in wrestling and was hired as a coach at the California Institute of Technology while also coaching the basketball team. He owned Gene Mako Galleries in Los Angeles, California. He also published a book about his father titled ""Bartholomew Mako: A Hungarian Master, 1890-1970"". In the final decade of his life, he taught art to up-and-coming artists.

The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:
"6, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23."
Every ribbon knot is smoothly slice.
An old question of Fox asks whether every slice knot is actually a ribbon knot.
The signature of a slice knot is zero.
The Alexander polynomial of a slice knot factors as a product formula_24 where formula_25 is some integral Laurent polynomial. This is known as the Fox–Milnor condition.

"On October 17, 2006, ""Broadcast to the World"" was made available for streaming via ""Alternative Press"". It was released in the U.S. on October 24 through Icon."
"Allmusic reviewer Rick Anderson called them a heavy rock band that are ""...owing far more to the old school than the new, but that adds the welcome element of solid melodic hooks to the mix."" He said that the music had elements of The Clash and Rancid. He also praised its range of songs to enable the band's audience to either sing/rap along, mosh along to or yell along to."

= = = Kong Jie = = =
Kong Jie (; born 25 November 1982) is a Chinese professional Go player.
"Kong Jie turned professional in 1994 at the age of 12. He was promoted to 7-dan after eight years in 2001. In 2004 he was sent into the Teda Cup as China's representative against Lee Chang-ho and Yoda Norimoto. Kong Jie is China's 29th professional 9-dan, doing so by being runner-up in the 13th Samsung Cup, and entering the finals of the Asian TV Cup for the first time. In 2009, Kong Jie achieved a major international breakthrough by winning the Asian TV Cup—defeating Korea's top three players of Lee Sedol, Lee Chang-ho and Kang Dongyun respectively. His win marked the end of several years of poor personal international results. Later in the year, Kong Jie followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the 14th Samsung Cup and won the title by defeating his two compatriots Gu Li and Qiu Jun."
"In 2010, Kong Jie passed the preliminary rounds of the 14th LG Cup to face former champion Lee Chang-ho in the finals. Kong won the match 2–0 and also the tournament. Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).
"King's latest record is another solo effort, released independently, and features King on a broad range of instruments, including cello, drums, keyboard, bass, and guitar. In addition to playing all the instruments, King engineered and produced the record. His Myspace page announced the title of the new album as ""Humilitas Occidit Superbiam"", and it was subsequently released digitally in November 2009."
"Justin has admitted to have spent ""more than his means"" on his gear. The following list includes some of his acoustic guitars, as well as the electric guitars he has owned and performed with."
"Justin first approached Mike Doolin, an innovative luthier with an excellent reputation, to build a double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, while at the same time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band acoustic pickups, which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone. This can be seen on the song ""Knock on Wood"" and ""Crown"" (unofficial title)."

"Eaton Chapel is a private chapel to the north of Eaton Hall in Eaton Park, near the village of Eccleston, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"Building of the chapel commenced in 1869, soon after the estate was inherited by Hugh Grosvenor, the 3rd Marquess of Westminster, in conjunction with a major rebuilding of the hall. Grosvenor became the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1874. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse as architect and the building was completed in 1884. When the Waterhouse hall was demolished in 1963, the chapel was retained."
"The chapel is built in buff sandstone with a grey slate roof. Internally the stone is in pink and buff bands. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave that is continuous with a three-bay chancel. The chancel terminates with a three-sided apse containing the altar. The chapel is oriented with the altar at the west end. The last bay at the east end constitutes a narthex (ante-chapel) with a gallery. On the south of the chapel is a tower which is free-standing, but joined to the chapel at the lower two storeys, and by a bridge above. At the southeast corner is a staircase turret. On the south side of the nave and in the apse are two-light windows and at the east end behind the gallery is a four-light window. The tower has six stages and contains tall lancet bell-openings. Above these is the clock stage, corbelled out from the shaft of the tower and surmounted by pinnacles at each corner. On each side is a clock face made from vitreous enamel; each clock face is in diameter. Over this is a spire decorated with gables and pinnacles. The staircase turret is surmounted by a spire."
"The narthex at the east end has a groin vaulted oak roof, and is paved with black marble and with encaustic tiles. A stone screen leads into the nave. This also has a groin vaulted roof, but built in stone. Between the nave and the chancel is a low alabaster screen. A continuation of this screen leads to the pulpit: this is also constructed in alabaster with Devonshire marble columns. The reredos and the font are also made in alabaster. The benches in the nave and chancel are in walnut and have carved ends. In the chancel is a recumbent effigy in alabaster of Constance, 1st Duchess of Westminster, by Joseph Boehm. For the effigy, Boehm worked from plaster casts of the face and hands taken after her death."
"The stained glass in the windows of the south side of the nave and the apse, and the mosaics in the blank on the north side of the nave were designed by Frederic Shields. These were commissioned in 1876 and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The two-manual organ is in an alcove on the south side of the chancel. It was built in 1870–71 by Charles Whitley of Chester and is still in good working order. The clock tower contains a carillon of 28 bells which were cast by Chavalier Severian Van Aerschodt of Louvain; it plays 31 tunes. The clock was manufactured by Gillet's of Croydon."
"The chapel continues to be the private chapel of the Grosvenor family and is used for family christenings, confirmations and memorial services. Each December it is made available for up to eight charities to arrange carol concerts. The chapel is also open to the general public on three annual open days."

"In a painting by Édouard Manet in 1863, Olympia, the artist endeavoured to evoke an odalisque, who receives a bouquet of flowers brought by her maid. According to Phyllis A. Floyd's study, ""The Puzzle of Olympia"", he gave the painting the features of Marguerite Bellanger."
"In June 1863, while on a carriage ride in Saint-Cloud Park, Emperor Napoleon III spotted Bellanger sheltering from the rain beneath a tree. Napoleon was bewitched by his new encounter."
"Marguerite Bellanger become the mistress of the Emperor. Soon, with the knowledge of all including the Empress Eugénie, she followed him on private and official trips."
"Amongst his numerous presents, the Emperor gave her two houses, one at 57 rue des Vignes, Passy, the other at Saint-Cloud, in the park of Montretout, which had a back door to the gardens of the castle."
"In February 1864, Marguerite Bellanger gave birth to a son; whom she named Charles Jules Auguste François Marie Leboeuf."
"After the birth, Bellanger retired for a while to rue de Launay in Villebernier and received a pension. In November 1864, the Emperor offered ""Margot"" the castle of Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin, near Meaux. The Emperor also gave the child a boarding house and the castle of Mouchy, in the Oise, which he had bought very discreetly some time before. Bellanger became usufructuary of the property."
"Always seductive, Bellanger still attracted men when she settled in Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin at the end of 1864. Among her lovers were General de Lignières and, according to some sources, Léon Gambetta."
"She was the subject of caricatures and gossip. Paul Hadol, in his series of caricatures on the ""Imperial Menagerie"", portrayed her as a cat."
"Her affair with the emperor continued during the Franco-Prussian War, and even during his captivity in Westphalia. In 1873, when the emperor died in exile in England, she travelled to England to mourn her 'dear lord'."
"At the fall of the Empire, she again traveled to England and married William Louis Kulbach, a British army officer. The presence of the couple William Kulbach and Marguerite Bellanger is recorded in Monchy-Saint-Éloi (Oise), France in the census of 1872. Bellanger gave her age as 30 years, whereas according to the data in her biography, she was 33 or 34."
"She lived the rest of her life as a member of the upper class, devoting herself to charity and good works."
"Marguerite Bellanger died at the age of 48 on 23 November 1886 after contracting a cold during a walk in the park of the castle at Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin. According to the declaration of death, her husband lived in Pau. The religious ceremony took place on 27 November at the church of Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot and she was interred in Montparnasse Cemetery."
"Her brother Jules, who served as a gardener, benefited from her estate. He built a beautiful house in Brain-sur-Allonnes, which is now the town hall."
"Her only son, Charles Leboeuf, made a career as an officer and died without issue on 11 December 1941. He was buried with his mother."
"Bellanger's character appears in Christian-Jaque's film Nana (1955), in which her character is performed by Nicole Riche."
"Marguerite Bellanger has been associated with a chocolate specialty: a praline was created to honour her. A chocolatier from Saumur designed, with the help of archivists of the city of Saumur, a specialty ""The Marguerite""."
"The coat of arms of Marguerite Bellanger is reproduced on the chocolates: a daisy with a heart of silver and gold petals. The praline ""with four spices"" (cloves, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg) echos the qualities that the second Empire sought to give her: a varnish of heart, a spicy charm and an imperial dress."

"Mestre João Grande was born in the village of Itagi in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. As a child he worked alongside his family in the fields. At the age of 10 he saw ""corta capim"" for the first time. This is a movement performed by crouching down, extending one leg in front and swinging it around in a circle, hopping over it with the other leg. Fascinated, he asked what it was called and was told that it was ""the Dance of the Nagos"" — a dance of the African descendants in the city of Salvador. The Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria had a major cultural influence in Salvador, which was considered the Black Rome of Brazil. But the dance was actually of Central African origin— it was Capoeira. João didn't learn the correct name of the movement until many years later, but it changed his life forever. At the age of ten he left home in search of ""the Dance of the Nagos""."
"Ten years later, he ended up in Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira as we know it, where he saw a proper capoeira roda for the first time. Present were mestres Menino Gordo, João Pequeno, who was there with his first teacher, Mestre Barbosa, and Cobrinha Verde, one of the most skillful players of that era."
"João Grande asked Mestre Barbosa if he could study and Mestre Barbosa sent him to João Pequeno, who later became his closest associate in capoeira. João Pequeno sent him to Mestre Pastinha who had a famous academy in the Cardeal Pequeno neighborhood of Brotas. João Grande requested permission to join his academy, and Pastinha accepted João as a student at the age of twenty, relatively late in capoeira life. While studying, João Grande worked as a longshoreman, playing after work or on his few days off."
"Mestre João Grande eventually became such an acclaimed capoeirista that when Carybé, a painter famous for his documentation of African Culture in Bahia, chose to do studies of capoeira he chose João Grande as a model."
"João Grande and João Pequeno are featured in numerous films of capoeira including one in which they demonstrate the knife techniques of the art. In 1966 João Grande travelled to Senegal with Mestre Pastinha to demonstrate capoeira at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. He was awarded his Diploma of capoeira from Pastinha in 1968 making him a full-fledged master of capoeira Angola. He subsequently toured Europe and the Middle East with Viva Bahia, a pioneering group that performed Afro-Brazilian folk arts such as capoeira, samba, maculelê, candomblé and puxada da rede."
"Eventually Pastinha's academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, was asked by the government to vacate his building for renovations, but the space was never returned to him. Instead it became a restaurant with entertainment, now called SENAC. Pastinha died broke and bitter about his treatment, but never regretted living the life of a capoeirista."
"João Grande returned when Mestre Moraes and Mestre Cobra Mansa persuaded him to come out of retirement in the mid-1980s. He began to teach with their organization Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho. In 1989 he was invited by Jelon Vieira to tour the United States. The tour was a tremendous success. In 1990 he returned to present capoeira at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Schomberg Center for Research for Black Culture in New York City. João Grande decided he liked the US and has been teaching in New York City ever since."
"In 1995 he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Upsala College, East Orange, New Jersey. In 2001 he was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA, which is one of the most prestigious awards given to practitioners of traditional arts in the US. He has also recorded an audio CD and several DVDs featuring himself and his students, as well as other illustrious figures of capoeira Angola."

"Archanes (, Godart & Olivier abbreviation: ARKH) is a former municipality in the Heraklion regional unit, Crete, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Archanes-Asterousia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of . Population 5,042 (2011). It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis."
"In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River."
"Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III–Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite."
"The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds."
"A large paved area, dissected by walkways that form a triangle, is found in Theatre Area"" or ""Aghios Nikolaos"" (Saint Nicholas). Two stepped altars are found here, one on a walkway and one on the pavement. There is a painting of a reconstruction of this area in Sakellarakis' ""Crete Archanes"" guidebook on page 49, which does this area more justice than a written description."
"The economy revolves around grape and olive processing and marketing. Both products account for some 96% of its total agricultural products. The Agricultural Cooperative of Archanes, set up in 1931, is one of the oldest in Greece, and consists of 1119 members. A quarter of the wine production is exported to Germany, France and the Netherlands, and the rest of the production is largely marketed domestically. Since the late 1990s, attempts have been made to convert part of wine making step by step to organic and integrated farming, beginning with the cultivation of table grapes."

"Charles Stanley Albeck (born May 17, 1931) is a former professional basketball coach. Albeck has coached for several teams in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), including the Denver Rockets, the San Diego Conquistadors, (often subbing for an absent Wilt Chamberlain), the Cleveland Cavaliers, the San Antonio Spurs, the New Jersey Nets, and the Chicago Bulls."
"Albeck graduated from Chenoa High School in Chenoa, Illinois and received his bachelor's degree at Bradley University in 1955 and his masters at Michigan State University in 1957. He married Phyllis L. Mann in 1952 and they have five children."
"He began his coaching at Adrian College in Adrian, Michigan."
Albeck's next head coaching job was at Northern Michigan University.
Albeck was head coach at the University of Denver from 1968 to 1970.
"He was the head coach of the Denver Rockets during most of the 1970–1971 season. The Rockets had begun the season under head coach Joe Belmont, but Belmont was fired after the team lost 10 of its first 13 games. Albeck replaced Belmont as the Rockets' head coach. The Rockets went 27–44 under Albeck to finish the season with a record of 30 wins and 54 losses. They tied the Texas Chaparrals for fourth place in the Western Division (28 games behind the Indiana Pacers) and on April 1, 1971 lost a one-game playoff to the Chaparrals, 115–109, to determine who would advance into the ABA Western Division semifinals. During the season Denver's average home attendance dropped to 4,139 fans per game from 6,281 the year before. One week after the playoff loss, on April 8, 1971, Albeck was replaced by Alex Hannum as Denver's head coach. Hannum resigned as coach of the San Diego Rockets to become the Rockets' head coach, general manager and president. Albeck then became player personnel director for the Rockets."
"During the 1972–1973 season Albeck was an assistant coach for the San Diego Conquistadors under head coach K.C. Jones. Albeck also served as director of player personnel for the Conquistadors. During most of the 1973–74 he served under 'Ques' head coach Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain missed a few games, during which Albeck filled in as the Conquistadors' head coach, winning all of them."
Albeck was an assistant coach for the Kentucky Colonels during the 1974–1975 season in which the team won the 1975 ABA Championship. Albeck returned as an assistant coach with the Colonels during their final season in 1975–1976.

"Albeck was head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 1979–1980."
"He was the San Antonio Spurs' head coach for three seasons, from 1980 to 1983."
"After the Spurs job, Albeck was the head coach of the New Jersey Nets from 1983 to 1985."
"Next, Albeck was head coach of the Chicago Bulls, 1985–1986. His exit from Chicago raised eyebrows around the NBA as his replacement, Doug Collins, had been hired by General Manager Jerry Krause just 2 months beforehand as a scout. The hire of Collins was kept a secret from Albeck."
"From 1986 through 1991 Albeck was head coach for Bradley University, his alma mater. He is a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, as well as a Significant Sig and a member of their Significant Sig Hall of Fame."
His all time coaching percentages is .535 for his 7 years as a head coach in the NBA.

= = = Norman Dyhrenfurth = = =
"Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth (Breslau, today Wroclaw, May 7, 1918 – Salzburg, September 24, 2017) was a German-Swiss-American mountaineer and filmmaker. He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit."
"Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy."
"Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again."
"Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team."
"On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a ""commitment to consensus"", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a ""huge asset to the team""."
"On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953."
"On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes."

"Delta is an American sitcom starring Delta Burke that aired on ABC from September 15, 1992 to August 25, 1993. It was a new starring vehicle for Burke, as her return to television following her dismissal from the CBS sitcom ""Designing Women"" in the spring of 1991."
"Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, she became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind, and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice), and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which she believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career."
"Burke, most popular for her role as Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"", reportedly utilized her own singing talents for the role of Bishop, and dyed her familiar brunette hair blonde to play the role. The theme song was ""Climb That Mountain High"" by Reba McEntire which was not a charted single; the tune was featured on Reba's 1990 MCA album ""Rumor Has It""."
"The sitcom premiered September 15, 1992, to healthy ratings following ""Roseanne"". It then moved to Thursday nights opposite FOX's ""The Simpsons"", and ratings began to sink. It was pulled from the schedule in December 1992 and returned to ABC the following spring 1993 for six episodes before finally being canceled. In an attempt to infuse ratings, Burke brought her brunette hair back that spring (even refilming the opening credits to correspond with the change in hair color), in the sake of familiarity, but it did little to save it."

= = = Dusty Fletcher = = =
"Clinton ""Dusty"" Fletcher (July 8, 1900 – March 15, 1954) was an African-American vaudeville performer, who was best known for the comedy routine which became a hit record in 1947, ""Open the Door, Richard""."
He had one daughter Helen Fletcher with original Cotton Club Dancer Sadie Mae Fletcher. He had two granddaughters Jacqueline and Amber.
"Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Fletcher had refined his act over at least twenty years in vaudeville before the 1940s. He would come on stage dressed in rags, acting drunk, muttering and complaining about trying to find his way home. He would then bring out a ladder, and try to set it up so he could get in through a window. Every so often he would crash sprawling on the floor while shouting ""Open the Door, Richard !""."
"In 1946, bandleader Jack McVea fashioned Fletcher's routine into the lyrics of a song, which he recorded with his band. McVea's record became a big hit, and Fletcher, by now semi-retired, was found living in South Carolina by Herb Abramson of National Records. He made his own recording of the song, using McVea's arrangement, which made number 3 on US ""Billboard"" R&B chart. The song was also covered by many others including Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and Pigmeat Markham."
"National Records began a lawsuit to claim Fletcher's royalties as the originator of the routine which led to McVea's hit. However, a blackface vaudeville comedian, John ""Spider Bruce"" Mason then claimed that Fletcher had originally stolen the routine from him in the 1920s. Eventually, McVea, Fletcher and Mason were all co-credited with writing McVea's version."
"Fletcher is credited with originating the ""Here come de Judge"" line used on the television comedy show, ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In""."
"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publicly attacked the song, particularly Fletcher's version, for making light of public drunkenness and playing on the stereotype of black men as shiftless and ignorant."
"Fletcher continued to perform the routine, particularly at the Apollo Theatre in New York, until shortly before his death."

"Colby Buzzell (born July 17, 1976 in California) is an American author, blogger and former United States Army soldier."
"Buzzell grew up in San Ramon, California and enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 26. Prior to joining the U.S. Army he described his life as engaging in a lot of drinking, drug use, dead-end jobs and a minor criminal record. He was very optimistic about his Army service and was determined to follow the Army recruiting slogan of ""Be All That You Can Be"". He joined the service as an infantryman and spent 2003 - 2004 in Iraq, assigned to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team. In his book he expresses a great deal of enthusiasm about the benefits of wheels over traditional treaded armor in urban settings."
"It was in Iraq that Buzzell began publishing a blog under the title ""CBFTW"", ""Colby Buzzel Fuck The War"", as a replacement for his habitual journaling back in the States. The blog gained popularity quickly, because as an anonymous blogger, Buzzell was able to share more lucid experiences than an embedded journalist, and he was also able to share a bit more of the truth than the Army was able to."
"Buzzell's blog gained recognition for its realistic portrayal of gripping first hand accounts of the war in Iraq. This 'milblog' won praise as “an unfiltered, often ferocious expression of his boots-on-the-ground view of the Iraq war"""
"Colby published a book on his experiences entitled, """" combining narrative, blog entries, and emails that evolved from his blog over time. The book received good reviews and has been recommended for public libraries."
"In 2004, Buzzell was profiled in ""Esquire""'s ""Best and Brightest"" issue and has since contributed regularly. In 2007, Buzzell received the 2007 Lulu Blooker Prize for """"."
"In 2008, Buzzell was re-called for active duty. After he arrived at his post, he was examined by the medical staff at Fort Benning, and marked ""not deployable"" due to post-traumatic stress disorder."
"In 2011, Buzzell published the book """", under ""HarperCollins"" about coping with his post traumatic stress disorder by taking a road trip to no where, all the while thinking about his newborn son, wife, and recently deceased mother."

"Husain goes on to say that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion.

In my school, a Jamat-e-Islami activist named Abdul Rabb represented the MET and awarded us trophies and medals for our performance in MET exams. Ostensibly it all seemed harmless, but the personnel all belonged to Jamat-e-Islami front organisations in Britain.

"Norcot is an area of the suburb of Tilehurst in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading."
"Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor."
"The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road."
"The ward of Norcot is west of the town centre and is bordered by Kentwood (the far western ward), Battle (the inner western ward), Southcote and Tilehurst wards."
"As with all wards, apart from smaller Mapledurham, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four."

"The film begins at a village Accha Rao (Rajendra Prasad) an innocent craven leads a rejoicing life. He acquires a constable job, proceeds to take charge where the Station S.I. (Vallabhaneni Janardhan) is malicious. Here, their Head Constable (P. L. Narayana) endears Accha Rao's amiable nature, gives him shelter and his daughter Seeta (Kanaka) loves Accha Rao. Meanwhile, a new scheme commences in the town by a company to sell household goods at the lowest prices. The company agent Peter (Sai Kumar) collects huge amounts as advance from the public. Thereupon, the Company turns fraudulent and the Proprietor's son tries to escape with the money when Peter restricts his way. In that quarrel, accidentally, he dies in the hands of Peter when S.I. takes him into custody and tortures terribly. Just as, Accha Rao shows his solace which Peter exploits and absconds. So to protect Accha Rao, Head Constable takes the guilt. Right now, to redeem himself, Accha Rao moves to nab Peter along with Seeta. At present, the district S.P. (Kota Shankar Rao) instructs S.I. to present Accha Rao & Peter before him. Parallelly, the Company Proprietor (M. S. Gopinath) bids the S.I. to slay them out. In that process, Accha Rao meets his mother (Radha Kumari) and learns that Peter's wife (Sailaja) is terminally ill. Be concerned, Accha Rao looks after them, even finds whereabouts of Peter and unites him with his wife. Thereafter, Peter surrenders himself to Police. Simultaneously, Accha Rao goes into the clutches of the Company Proprietor. Both of them try to slaughter Accha Rao & Peter, but Accha Rao breaks out by eliminating the blackguard and rushes towards Peter. By that time, S.I. encounters Peter and tries to kill Accha Rao too. Fortuitously, the S.P. witnesses it and knocks out the S.I. Finally, Accha Rao is promoted as S.I. and the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Accha Rao & Seeta."

= = = Printer's sample stamp = = =
"A printer's sample stamp is a label produced by a printer resembling a stamp, but with no postal or other validity. Often it will include the name of the printer and demonstrate their printing capabilities. The stamps are not intended for use and are therefore to be distinguished from test stamps, though both test stamps and printer's sample stamps are dummy stamps in the broadest sense of that term."
"The R.M. Phillips Collection at the British Postal Museum and Archive contains a number of sample stamps produced by De La Rue before 1900, bearing their name and demonstrating their printing abilities for the British Post Office."
"Waterlow & Sons produced many small sheetlets of sample stamps in the same design as genuine stamps produced for their customers, but with the colours changed and overprinted diagonally ""Waterlow & Sons Ltd. Specimen"". The stamps in these sheetlets were also punched with a small hole in the corner to prevent their postal or revenue use and the sheetlets were displayed at the 1910 Brussels Exhibition. Clive Akerman comments in ""The Presentation of Revenue Stamps: Taxes and Duties in South America"", that the stamps were produced from obsolete dies."
"The ""Prince Consort Essay"" was a printer's sample stamp created in 1851 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds."
"Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp."
"The concept has been used worldwide with modern sample stamps from printers in Switzerland and the Netherlands, amongst other countries, commonly seen in philatelic circles."

Diddle (better known as the basketball coach). Diddle got Richards into officiating high school basketball. After graduation, Richards was hired as head basketball coach at Auburn High School.

Jurby () is one of the seventeen parishes of the Isle of Man.
"It is located in the north-west of the island (part of the traditional ""North Side"" division) in the sheading of Michael."
"For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners."
The Captain of the Parish (since 1999) is John James Quayle.
"Jurby parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency."
"The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 776, a decrease of 2.7% from the figure of 797 in 2011."
"The parish of Jurby, which lies on the north-western coast of the island, borders those of Andreas to the east, Lezayre to the south-east, and Ballaugh to the south. It is low-lying overall: the highest elevations are some coastal dunes with a height of up to 39 metres."
"There is an industrial park on the old RAF Jurby Airfield, but otherwise the district is almost entirely agricultural. Apart from the Jurby airfield buildings, there are no significant settlements in the parish."
Jurby Airfield was originally used as a Royal Air Force training base in World War II. During the 1950s it was used as a training camp for Officer cadets on short term commissions in the RAF. The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."
The Isle of Man Prison operated by the Isle of Man Prison Service is located at Jurby.

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

Spanish, Irish , German and British visitors are catered for, and the resort has a relaxed atmosphere in contrast to the lively resort of Magaluf on the west coast of the island. Sa Coma is more family oriented, and evening entertainment centres on hotels, rather than in bars or clubs."
"Some of the shops in Sa Coma also cater for tourists, with many products in the supermarkets being imported from tourists' home countries. In addition to the duty-free and sport shops, there are 'Perfumerías' (perfume shops) and a Carrefour hypermarket within Sa Coma town (previously owned by Eroski)."

"Dr. Shrinker was a segment during the first season of the ABC network's ""The Krofft Supershow"" in 1976."
"Dr. Shrinker (Jay Robinson) is a mad scientist who creates a shrink ray that can miniaturise anything. Three young adults — Brad Fulton (Ted Eccles), B.J. Masterson (Susan Lawrence) and her brother Gordie Masterson (Jeff MacKay) — crash land their airplane on an island. As they make their way to the only house on the island, they meet Dr. Shrinker and his assistant, Hugo (Billy Barty). Dr. Shrinker, in an effort to prove that his shrinking ray works, shrinks the three people down to tall. The remainder of the series was different efforts by the 'Shrinkies' to return to normal size, while Dr. Shrinker and Hugo want to catch the trio so that they will have physical proof that the ray works for whatever world power wants to buy it. Dr. Shrinker also implied that he would give the unnamed buyer the Shrinkies as a free bonus. However, in one episode, Dr. Shrinker's plan was to sell the shrink ray to the highest bidder, and the second highest bidder would receive the Shrinkies."
"Each episode was basically the same. As Dr. Shrinker himself said in one episode...""I chase the Shrinkies. I catch the Shrinkies. The Shrinkies escape. It's a vicious cycle, and it's driving me mad!"""
"The concept was very likely inspired by the 1940 film ""Dr. Cyclops"" in which a scientist working in the South American jungle uses his radiation experiments to shrink a group of fellow scientists to prevent them from discovering his secret work."
"""Dr. Shrinker"" lasted only one season on the ""Krofft Supershow"". During the second season, it was dropped (as was the superhero segment ""Electra Woman and Dyna Girl"").

"In the UK, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) (previously known as Pupil Re-integration Unit by some Local Education Authorities) is an alternative education provision which is specifically organised to provide education for children who aren't able to attend school and may not otherwise receive suitable education. This could be because they have a short- or long-term illness, have been excluded, or are a new starter waiting for a mainstream school place."
Each LEA has a duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school. Placing pupils in PRUs is just one of the ways in which local authorities can ensure that they can comply with this duty. PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.
"There are currently over 421 PRUs in England. Between 2002 and 2003, 17,523 pupils attended PRUs at some point. Although PRUs do not have to provide a full National Curriculum, they should offer a basic curriculum which includes English, mathematics, the sciences, PSHE and ICT."
"A PRU is treated the same as any other type of school, subject to the same inspections from Ofsted. Since September 2010, some PRUs are referred to as ""Short Stay Schools"", although the government still broadly refer to them as PRUs or Alternative Provision (APs)."

"Felix Robertson was a charter member of the TMA and president of the ""Medical Society of Tennessee"" (original name) in 1834–1840 and 1853–1855."
"The TMA organizes an annual conference and publishes a journal, ""Tennessee Medicine""."
In May 2013 Christopher E. Young became the 159th president of the TMA.
"After having a training session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and the Turtles celebrate their 15th anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them the story of how they came to be. After the story, the Turtles convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface."
"After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners."
"Back at the lair, Splinter agrees that the Turtles must save April and Kirby, and picks Leonardo as the leader of the team, much to Raphael's irritation."
"While searching for April and Kirby, they meet Snake, a guy who works for the Kraang. Raph threatens to pour mutagen on him if he doesn't tell the Turtles information about the Kraang. Snake confesses, telling them everything he knows, before Michelangelo accidentally lets him escape. At the lair, Splinter tells Leo that failure is a possibility that every leader must face, and tells him the story of how he and Oroku Saki the Shredder were once friends, but became enemies."
"The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs ""Snakeweed"". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him."
"The Turtles made the news, but the Shredder watches the news back at Tokyo, Japan, discovering Splinter's symbol on the ninja star, concluding that he and the Foot Clan must relocate to New York to finish off Splinter."
"Max Nicholson of IGN gave ""Rise of The Turtles"" a rating of 8.5/10, saying ""The action sequences are fluid, fast-paced and exciting, and the dialogue-heavy scenes are usually peppered with entertaining slapstick."" Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped."" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode ""a tad on the bland side"". He cites that while there's plenty for surprises for the show's plot, ""in laying the groundwork, this pilot didn't really do anything new"". Matt Edwards at Den of Geek opined that the episode is ""so polished and ell executed,"" and praised it for its balance of comedy and action, stating ""A very strong start to the series, then, and one I’ve found myself revisiting frequently."""
The episode's original run garnered approximately 3.9 million viewers within the United States.

"McMillan was born in 1904 in New Plymouth, the eldest child of Annie Gertrude Pearce and David McMillan, a dairy farmer near Stratford. He received his secondary education at Stratford Technical High School, where he was dux. With the help of the Taranaki Scholarship, he could afford to study medicine at the University of Otago, from where he graduated MB ChB in 1929. He was a medical practitioner, first practising in Kurow (1929–34) and then at 115 Highgate in Kaikorai, Dunedin (c.1935-36, after which the building was his electorate office to 1943, then again a medical practice after he had left parliament). The building was demolished after 1950 to make way for the Stuart Street extension."
"McMillan became involved with the Labour Party in 1923. In his view, good health extended beyond good medical support, but included educational, economic, and social factors."
"He represented the Dunedin West electorate from to 1943, when he retired. He was Minister of Marine (1940–1941) in the First Labour Government, and was responsible for much of the social security system introduced by Labour."
"In 1940 he ran for the position of Labour Party leader, being nominated by Arnold Nordmeyer, a friend from Kurow and a supporter of John A. Lee. Clyde Carr also ran, but the winner to replace Savage was his deputy, Peter Fraser."
"He was a Dunedin City Councillor for 1935–1938, 1938–1941, 1944–1947 and 1950–1951. He twice unsuccessfully stood for the Dunedin mayoralty; he was beaten by Andrew Henson Allen and Donald Charles Cameron in 1941 and 1944, respectively."

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

"During the Second World War, Sturt combined with the Brighton and Seacliff club from 1942 to 1945, winning two premierships as a combined entity."

"""The Guns of Brixton"" is a song by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was written and sung by bassist Paul Simonon, who grew up in Brixton, South London. The song has a strong reggae influence, reflecting the culture of the area and the reggae gangster film ""The Harder They Come""."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was the Clash's first song to be composed and sung by Paul Simonon. By the time of ""London Calling"", Simonon had learned to play guitar and started contributing more to the songwriting."
"The band, separated from manager Bernard Rhodes, had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location. They began work on ""London Calling"" during the summer of 1979 at the Vanilla Studios in Pimlico. The band quickly wrote and recorded demos, and in August 1979 entered Wessex Studios to begin recording the album. Produced by Guy Stevens, who at the time had alcohol and drug problems and whose production methods were unconventional, it was recorded within a matter of weeks, with many songs, including ""The Guns of Brixton"", recorded in one or two takes. It was also revealed that while recording the lead vocals for the song, Simonon sang while staring directly at a CBS executive who had visited the studio during the sessions, giving Simonon the desired amount of emotion in his voice."
"A section of the song is sung by a very young Maria Gallagher, accompanied by her father Mick Gallagher on the keyboard, as a reprise at the end of the song ""Broadway"" on the 1980 Clash album ""Sandinista!"""
"""The Guns of Brixton"" predates the riots that took place in the 1980s in Brixton, but the lyrics depict the feelings of discontent in the area because of the heavy-handedness of the police, the recession and other problems at the time. The lyrics refer to a Brixton-born son of Jamaican immigrants who ""feel[s] like Ivan...at the end of ""The Harder they Come"""", referring to Ivanhoe Martin's death in the 1972 film ""The Harder They Come"". Simonon was originally doubtful about the song's lyrics, which discuss an individual's paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged to continue working on it by Joe Strummer."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was not initially released as a single, but a version of the song, taken from the remastered version of ""London Calling"" and remixed by Jeremy Healy, was released by CBS as a CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl entitled ""Return to Brixton"" in July 1990 (catalog number 656072-2). It reached #57 on the UK Singles Chart."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was a mainstay in the Clash's live set. When performing the song live, Simonon would switch instruments with Strummer because he was unable to play the bass line whilst singing lead vocals at the same time."
"A somewhat heavier, faster version than the one found on ""London Calling"" appeared on the 1999 live compilation """"."
"Norman Cook (also known as Fatboy Slim) sampled the bass line for Beats International's 1990 song ""Dub Be Good to Me"", which became a #1 hit in the UK. Simonon, interviewed by Scott Rowley in October 1999 for ""Bassist Magazine"", said that he ""was surprised that it became number one that was quite shocking. And the fact that it was my performance that they had lifted. The smart thing would've been to copy it and change it slightly, but they just lifted it straight off. So, really, I have done ""Top of the Pops"", but I met up with Norman [Cook] and we came to an arrangement which was much needed at the time. But I thought it was a really good idea and it was quite reassuring for that to happen to my first song."""
"Cypress Hill sampled the baseline on ""What's Your Number?"" from the 2004 album ""Till Death Do Us Part."" The song also features Tim Armstrong on guitar."
"Jimmy Cliff covered the song on his 2011 ""Sacred Fire EP"", and 2012 album ""Rebirth"", produced by Armstrong. Will Hermes has called the cover ""the sound of history circling in wondrous ways"" because the song references Cliff's character Ivan from ""The Harder They Come""."

Olivia FitzRoy was one of five sisters."
"The family spent their summers in Scotland, the setting of her books. They were there in 1939 when her father, a naval officer, decided that they should remain in Inverewe for the duration of World War II. The area was remote; FitzRoy wrote her first book, ""Orders to Poach"" (which told the story of the Stewart children receiving unusual instructions from their overseas father) to entertain her two younger sisters, Barbara (now Ormrod) and the late Amelia (now Jessel). It was published by Collins, as Billy Collins was a friend of the family. The second, ""Steer by the Stars"" and the third ""The House in the Hills"", were based in the same location."

"Hon. Patrick Perkins, J. P., (10 October 1838 — 17 May 1901), nicknamed Paddy Perkins, was a brewer and politician in colonial Queensland. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and, later, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council."
"Patrick Perkins was born in a humble cottage on a small farm in the village of Clonoulty near Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the second son of Thomas Perkins, a farmer, and his wife Ellen (""née"" Gooley). He attended the local National School."
"Thomas and Ellen Perkins and their eight children (including Patrick) immigrated on the ""Persian"", departing Southampton and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 9 April 1854."
"In 1861, he married Mary Ellen Hickey in Victoria. They had four children born in Victoria:Thomas Hector (born 1864); Mary Eveleen, (1867-1942) m. Charles Seymour-Allan; Edgar Colin Francis (born 1868) and Lilly Eleanor Perkins (born 1875) m. Randall Macdonnell, m. George Wilkie Gray. They had two children born in Queensland: Patrick Harold (born 1878) and Helene Cicilia (born 1880, Toowoomba d 1965 Adelaide), Sr Margaret Mary of the Dominican priory, Adelaide."
"Patrick Perkins was a miner and storekeeper on the diggings in Victoria in districts including Ballarat, Bendigo, Woods Point and Jamieson."
"With his brother Thomas, he started breweries in Victoria and Queensland. In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872."
"In 1876, Patrick Perkins moved to Queensland in order to manage the Brisbane and Toowoomba breweries."
"Perkins also had interests in property and mining, including the Mount Morgan Mine and coal mining in the West Moreton area."
He was considered a shrewd and successful business man.
"On 9 April 1877, Edward Wilmot Pechey, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Aubigny, resigned. On 1 May 1877, in a by-election, Perkins was elected in Aubigny, defeating Angus Mackay (the then editor of ""The Queenslander"") by a large majority. He was elected again in Aubigny in the 1878 election and was appointed as Minister of Lands in the First McIlwraith Ministry from 21 January 1879 to 13 November 1883."
"Perkins was elected again in Aubigny in the 1883 election, However, allegations about electoral fraud (including intimidation, bribery, and ballot stuffing) in the Aubigny election started to surface, resulting in a petition to the Governor of Queensland detailing numerous kind of electoral fraud and asking to declare that the Aubigny election was void and that Patrick Perkins was guilty of bribery and corruption. On 21 February 1884, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications ruled the Aubigny election was null and void and called for a by-election. Perkins had denied any involvement in the alleged electoral fraud and the Committee of Elections and Qualifications did not disqualify him from re-contesting the seat, which provoked outrage in some quarters. However, Patrick Perkins announced he would not re-contest the seat as he would be taking a trip to England."
James Campbell was elected unopposed at the resulting by-election on 4 March 1884.
"At the 1888 election, Perkins was elected in the seat of Cambooya on 10 May 1888, which he held until 6 May 1893."
"On 23 May 1893, Perkins was appointed to Queensland Legislative Council from 23 May 1893. Being a lifetime appointment, he served until his death on 17 May 1901."
"In 1883 used his wealth to buy a palatial home at 273 North Quay, Brisbane, which he called ""Aubigny"" after the electorate that first sent him to parliament. The house was originally built in 1870 by Samuel Davis, a Jewish businessman, and included a separate building used as Brisbane's first synagogue. Patrick Perkins used the former synagogue as a billiards room. In 1899, the Perkins family rented the property to the Criminal Investigation Department which used the house as offices and the synagogue as a photography room. In 1906, the house was sold to the Rev. Mother Patrick of the Sisters of Mercy to create the 20-bed Mater Misericordiae Hospital (now a tertiary hospital located at South Brisbane); the former synagogue being the hospital chapel. Once the hospital outgrew the house and relocated to the South Brisbane area where it still operates, the house was renamed ""Loretto"" and used as a hostel for Catholic girls; the former synagogue being the maids' quarters. In about 1939 the house was demolished to make way for the construction of a church for the Church of Christ, Scientist."
"He attended the opening of the first Federal Parliament at the Royal Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901 and caught a chill which developed into bronchial pneumonia, from which he died on Friday 17 May 1901 at ""Ingleborough"", Berkeley Street, Hawthorn."

"Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to ""get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."" He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001."
"Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie ""How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor"", although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ""Moor of Peter the Great""."
"There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate."
"In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great."

"Au Wai Lun (, born 14 August 1971 in Hong Kong) is a retired Hong Kong professional football player. He announced his retirement after being unable to get a contract renewal with South China in Hong Kong First Division League after the 2006–07 season. He was considered to be one of the best strikers in Hong Kong."
"Au made his debut in Hong Kong First Division League for Tin Tin on 20 December 1988, against Happy Valley. He was 17 years old at the time and the final result of the match 0–2."
"Au was the leading goal scorer of the Hong Kong team, but retired from international football after an exhibition match with Manchester United on 23 July 2005."
"On the pitch, Au was recognised easily by his hairstyle – he sports peroxide-blond streaks in his locks. He wore the number 7 jersey for South China and was the captain of the team."
"He is also remembered by his famous ""cross passing during 1-on-1"" in the final of 2002 Carlsberg Cup against Honduras. In the match, he received a pass from his teammate, and got a goal opportunity. However, he passed the ball back and did not shoot. Further jokes on this were developed after this incident."
"Being a veteran striker, Au is valued for his international experience and his strong aerial ability. The 6' tall striker remains one of the best headers in the League."
"In the 2005–06 season, his good performance throughout the season could not prevent South China from finishing 7th in the league, with 2 points below the relegation line. He scored 8 league goals that season (4th among all players, 1st among Hong Kong players). Two years after retiring, he chose to return and play for Eastern, one of his former clubs."
"In the summer of 2007, after being offered a new contract with a salary cut by South China, he decided to retire. He claimed that the entire squad received new contracts with increments, but he was the only one with a salary cut. He thought the club was being unfair to him, who contributed for many years, even when the team performed so poor for several seasons."
"After his retirement announcement, he was approached by Star Publishing and with the help of a professional writer, published his biography titled, ""Lun . Football Biography"" (倫．球傳)."

It has been historically referred to as both Little Cacapehon and Little Capecaphon. The name is pronounced or ."
"The Little Cacapon is formed at the confluence of two small streams, the North Fork Little Cacapon and the South Fork Little Cacapon, shortly after they both pass north under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Frenchburg. From Frenchburg, the Little Cacapon flows north between Town Hill, high, to its west and Little Cacapon Mountain, high, to its east. Flowing from a hollow in Town Hill, Shawan Run feeds into the Little Cacapon at Barnes Mill. Two miles (3 km) north, Three Churches Run also feeds into the river from Town Hill. At Higginsville on Slanesville Pike (County Route 3) near the old Vinita School, the river is fed by Crooked Run at Queens Ridge ( high). From Higginsville, the Little Cacapon continues northeast along Town Hill with Noland Ridge bounding it to the east. Also in the vicinity of Higginsville, Little Cacapon-Levels Road (County Route 3/3) intersects with Slanesville Pike, and as its name suggests, the road follows the Little Cacapon north until it diverges northwest to Levels via Hoffman Hollow. It is within this stretch of the stream that the Little Cacapon meanders by the community of Creekvale. At the entrance of Neals Run, the Little Cacapon is met to its east by Spring Gap Mountain and then flows beneath the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and empties into the Potomac River."
"The North Fork is a tributary of the Little Cacapon. The North Fork's source lies in a hollow between Piney Mountain and the southwestern end of Stony Mountain. From its source, the North Fork flows northeast along Grassy Lick Road (County Route 10). South Branch Mountain ( high) joins the North Fork to its west, and along with Stony Mountain to its east, the river diverges from Grassy Lick Road and continues its northeastern route to Shanks where it meets US Route 50. From Shanks, the North Fork merges with Camp Run and flows east under US Route 50 at Frenchburg, where it merges with the South Fork to create the Little Cacapon River."
"The South Fork is an tributary of the Little Cacapon. The South Fork is formed at its headwater in a hollow towards the southeastern end of Stony Mountain along South Fork of Little Cacapon Road (County Route 12) between the communities of Kirby and Ruckman. From its source, the South Fork flows northeast toward Bell Hollow, where it meets US Route 50 and turns north through Frye's Flat towards Frenchburg. The South Fork continues north under US Route 50, where it immediately joins with the North Fork to form the Little Cacapon River alongside Little Cacapon River Road (County Route 50/9)."

"The Singaporean government has established some five biosphere reserves in Singapore. There are namely: Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Chek Jawa, Labrador Nature Reserve, and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve."
"One of the first notions of biosphere reserves in Singapore was thought up by the then-Singapore Botanical Gardens Supritendent N. C. Cantley who, in 1882, proposed that select areas of land be preserved. In as early as 1883, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (as it is now known) was established, making it the inaugural biosphere reserve in Singapore. The Singapore Nature Reserves Act officially came into action in 1971. In 1984, biosphere reserves took up some of the country's land. This figure has been increased to , as of 2009."
"The Public Utilities Board-maintained Central Catchment Nature Reserve is Singapore's largest biosphere reserve. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve aids in the conservation of both bird species and mangrove plants. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, albeit small-sized at , hosts myriad plant and animal lifeforms. Chek Jawa is situated in eastern Pulau Ubin. Teeming with various kinds of marine life, Chek Jawa was ""discovered"" (much publicised) in 2001. The Labrador Nature Reserve is located by the sea. Described as ""an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders"", it teems with vast animal life, as well as plant life by the cliff. The large Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve comprises mostly wetland and a few bird species, most notably the shorebird, can be spotted there. It is cited as the ""first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore""."
"Owing to rapid urban development, the country is in need of more land for things such as housing, which is deemed more important than nature reservation. One possible issue faced by the biosphere reserves in Singapore is that they will be turned into nothingness by the government when the need arises. There was an instance when the government had wanted to reclaim part of Chek Jawa, but this was opposed by conservationists and it was ultimately not reclaimed."

Throughout the 1970s, during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, he was part of the anti-Sadat student movement and won in two student union elections. He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest. He was arrested two more times, during the 1980 parliamentary elections and in 1983 for suspicions of being part of an clandestine Nasserist organization. He was severely tortured during his latter stint in prison."

Along with former ADNP cadre Hamdeen Sabahi, Iskander co-founded the Dignity Party (""Al-Karama""). He continued his activism, being instrumental in the establishment of the Egyptian-Palestinian solidarity movement in 2000 after the start of the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against the Israeli occupation. He also helped organize protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ensuing occupation."
"These protests, together with wide disapproval of Hosni Mubarak's policies in Egypt, eventually culminated with the founding of Kefaya, a grassroots opposition movement. Iskander was one of the principal leaders of the movement and became a vocal opponent of the planned, succession of Gamal Mubarak, Hosni's son, to the presidency which Iskander criticized as ""presidential inheritance."""

It is also where Pymmes Brook is joined by Bounds Green Brook. The trail then leaves the brook to pass through Broomfield Park and Palmers Green. It crosses over the New River at Oakthorpe Road, then the North Circular Road, to divert through two new public open spaces - Bowes Meadow and Tile Kiln Lane Open Space - where Pymmes Brook can be followed again. The trail recrosses the North Circular Road onto Silver Street, Edmonton, where the path enters the gardens of Millfield House. From here the trail leads to Pymmes Park and another brookside section, then to Fore Street, where the brook flows underground to merge with Salmons Brook to the south of Angel Road. As of 2018, the trail must temporarily follow public throughfares for a short distance, but will eventually take a new route when access to the brook is opened up in the Meridian Water development. Finally, the trail passes through Tottenham Marshes, beside Pymmes Brook and past Stonebridge Lock on the Lee Navigation, to reach the point where the brook joins the River Lea. The trail connects with the Lea Valley Walk at Tottenham Lock, with a link to Tottenham Hale station."

= = = Whizziwig = = =
Whizziwig is a science fiction children's programme broadcast on CITV between 1998 and 2000 based on the books by award winning children's author Malorie Blackman.
"Whizziwig centres on the adventures of a boy called Ben and his best friend Steve who befriends a small pink alien approximately the size of a rugby ball. Whizziwig has the ability to grant wishes to anyone who uttered the words ""I wish.."", however wishes had to be made for someone else and would last a maximum of 24 hours. A recurring theme is Ben and Steve trying to deceive their friend into granting their intentional wishes only for the alien to become wise to the scheme."
"Ben would keep Whizziwig hidden, often smuggling her into school in his school bag. Many hilarious escapades ensued as the wishes made by unaware students in Whizziwigs earshot would be granted."

= = = Reflective subcategory = = =
"In mathematics, a full subcategory ""A"" of a category ""B"" is said to be reflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor from ""A"" to ""B"" has a left adjoint. This adjoint is sometimes called a ""reflector"", or ""localization"". Dually, ""A"" is said to be coreflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint."
"Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any ""missing"" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect."
"A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B-object ""B"" there exists an A-object formula_1 and a B-morphism formula_2 such that for each B-morphism formula_3 to an A-object formula_4 there exists a unique A-morphism formula_5 with formula_6."
"The pair formula_7 is called the A-reflection of ""B"". The morphism formula_8 is called the A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about formula_1 only as being the A-reflection of ""B"")."
This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor formula_10 is a right adjoint. The left adjoint functor formula_11 is called the reflector. The map formula_8 is the unit of this adjunction.
The reflector assigns to formula_13 the A-object formula_1 and formula_15 for a B-morphism formula_16 is determined by
the commuting diagram
"If all A-reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms, then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective. Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms."
"All these notions are special case of the common generalization—formula_17-reflective subcategory, where formula_17 is a class of morphisms."
"The formula_17-reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest formula_17-reflective subcategory containing A. Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc."
An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A-reflection arrow are those that are already in A.
"Dual notions to the above-mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory."

"Cosmos atrosanguineus, the chocolate cosmos, is a species of ""Cosmos"", native to Mexico. It has often been claimed that it is extinct in the wild; however it is ""quite abundant"" in Mexico. The species was introduced into cultivation in 1885, when the British seed company Thompson & Morgan first listed it in their seed catalogue. Its dark red to brownish red flowers have a scent resembling chocolate, which is one reason for its popularity as a cultivated plant."
"""Cosmos atrosanguineus"" is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with a fleshy tuberous root. The leaves are 7–15 cm long, pinnate, with leaflets 2–5 cm long. The flowers are produced in a capitulum 3-4.5 cm diameter, dark red to maroon-dark brown, with a ring of six to ten (usually eight) broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; they have a light vanillin fragrance (like many chocolates), which becomes more noticeable towards the end of the day."
"The species was first described in 1861 by William Hooker, as ""Cosmos diversifolia"" var. ""atrosanguineus"". Eduard Ortgies later elevated it to a full species, placing it in the genus ""Bidens"". Andreas Voss transferred it back to ""Cosmos"", retaining its status as an independent species. It is one of eight species of ""Cosmos"" placed in section ""Discopoda"". ""Cosmos"" belongs to subtribe Coreopsidinae."
"In 2008, Oku, T.; Takahashi, H.; Yagi, F.; et al. analyzed the Chocolate Cosmos flower using PSID (plastid subtype identity) sequences in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of this plant.

The Signal Company acquired a controlling stake in the company in 1969, and in 1971 renamed it Hayes Trucks. In 1975, Signal sold the company to Paccar, which closed the Hayes plants."
"The British Columbia company was established in 1920 by Douglas Hayes, a parts dealer, and partner W. Anderson from Quadra Island, and was originally the Hayes-Anderson Motor Company Ltd. It was renamed Hayes Manufacturing Company Ltd. in 1928, when the company built a large factory on the False Creek flats in Vancouver. The company eventually had over 600 employees and three plants."
"Along with trucks, Hayes manufactured buses, moving vans, tractors and trailers. Its few bus models included the Hayes ""Teardrop"", a very streamlined design introduced in 1936. Several Teardrop buses were purchased by Pacific Stage Lines, one of which has been preserved by the Transit Museum Society."
"The truck hood ornament was a die-cast, chrome-plated, 5-pound bear or a bronze cast bear. The chrome bear was found on the clippers and the bronze was off the square nose logger with butterfly wings. There was also a small bear ornament on each door."

"Aldegisel, Aldegisl, Aldgillis, Aldgisl, Aldgils or Eadgils (fl. c. 678) was the ruler of Frisia (as king or duke) in the late seventh century contemporarily with Dagobert II and a very obscure figure. All that is known of him is in relation to the famous saint that he harboured and protected, Wilfrid, but he is the first historically verifiable ruler of the Frisians. What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings."
"Wilfrid, deposed from his Archdiocese of York, exiled from Northumbria and on his way to Rome to seek papal support, landed in Frisia in 678. and was warmly received by Aldegisel, who entertained him for several months over the winter, probably at Utrecht. According to Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, Aldegisel encouraged Wilfrid in his effective evangelism and ""[the Frisians] accepted his [Wilfrid's] teaching and with a few exceptions all the chiefs were baptised by him in the name of the Lord, as well as many thousands of common people."" It is possible that Aldegisel was one of the early converts. However, it has been doubted whether Wilfrid was actually successful in Frisia, since there is no other evidence of the success of Christianity there before the work of Willibrord."
"While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, the Frankish mayor of the palace, Ebroin, offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. His successor and possibly son was Radbod, who followed the older pagan ways and was an enemy of Charles Martel."

"The building was built on the site of the Central Recreation Ground, which had originally opened in 1864 and had since remained the main cricket venue in the town. This history is reflected by the statue in Queens Square of a batsman holding a pose having played a shot (""The Spirit of Cricket"" by Allan Sly). The observant shopper will be able to spot the ball that this batsman has hit (it can be seen in the wall above F. Hinds jewellers)."
"The land on which the shopping centre now stands had been underwater before the 13th century, and was the original harbour for Hastings. A series of severe storms, silting and sea erosion forced the town to move to where the current old town is. The Priory Valley eventually silted up completely and the area became known as Priory Meadow and turned into farmland in 1536."
"In 1864 the Priory Marshes were levelled and drained and opened as a Cricket Ground, by 1932 one corner of the ground was leased by the Maidstone and District bus company to use as a coach station, then in 1958 a row of shops was built on one side of the ground with seating above."
"In 1982 Hastings Council voted for a shopping centre to be built on the cricket ground and to move cricket to Summerfields, now Horntye Park.

"The estate is named in honour of Claude Grahame-White, the pioneer of aviation who established the original aerodrome and aviation school on the site."
"The building of the estate was a joint project between the Greater London Council and Barnet Council. The plan was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1964, and the first family moved in on 23 October 1971. Sir Roger Walters was the Chief Architect and Gordon Wigglesworth was the Housing Architect."
"A typical characteristic of the estate was the plain, square, brick terraced houses and long winding low-rise flats, with flat roofs, also known as ""Brick Brutalist"" style. Most building names, walkways and roads on the estate have names linked to the aviation history of the site."
Not all of the old aerodrome was sold off for development; the Royal Air Force Museum is situated immediately to the south-east of the estate (with free entrance).
"A secondary road called Grahame Park Way, a typical 1970s-style collector road, runs along the eastern margin of the estate, parallelling the Midland Main Line (Thameslink) railway, and beyond that, the M1 Motorway."
The estate became the sole site of St. James Catholic High School in 1996.
"London Underground Colindale station, on the Northern line Edgware branch, is within comfortable walking distance of at least the south-east corner of the estate. The next tube station north, Burnt Oak is also accessible. Mill Hill Broadway Thameslink station lies to the north, a bus ride away. Several bus routes run into or near the estate."

= = = Angletarn Pikes = = =
Angletarn Pikes is a fell in the English Lake District near the village of Patterdale. Its most notable feature is the summit tarn from which it derives its name.
"Angletarn Pikes stands on the western arm of the long horseshoe ridge which surrounds the Martindale catchment, a system of valleys draining north into Ullswater. The adjacent fells on this ridge are Place Fell to the north and Brock Crags to the south. Beda Fell, a subsidiary ridge, also juts out into Martindale from Angletarn Pikes. This separates the heads of Boredale and Bannerdale."
"The western side above Goldrill Beck is steep and includes the faces of Dubhow and Fall Crags. The long eastern flank above Bannerdale is also pock-marked with crags, Heck Crag being the principal feature. The narrow north eastern slopes above Boredale, although steep, are less rocky and are cut by the upper ravine of Freeze Beck."
"North from the summit a long ridge drops over Stony Rigg (1,640 ft) to the walkers’ crossroads of Boredale Hause. From here paths run down to Hartsop, Patterdale and Boredale, while a further bridleway cuts across Beda Fell to Bannerdale. Boredale Hause carries the tiny ruin of a building named ‘Chapel in the Hause’ on OS maps. A mountain pass at 1,300 ft seems a curious place to construct a church. From the Hause a good path carries on northwards up Steel Edge to Place Fell."
"The north-east ridge to Beda Fell is also well defined, a fair path traversing a series of rocky knolls before the final rise to the summit, named Beda Head."
"Southward from Angletarn Pikes is Angle Tarn itself. This indented waterbody is about a quarter of a mile long with an island in the middle and forms a picturesque foreground for views of the Pikes. The tarn sits in a hollow on the centre of the ridge, issuing westwards through a break in the parapet via the ravine of Angletarn Beck. The ridge proper runs to the east of the tarn above the Bannerdale face, rising again to the unnamed 1,870 ft top above Satura Crag. This overtops the summit of Brock Crags, but was made subservient to it by Wainwright in his ""Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells""."
"Angletarn Pikes takes its plural from the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by perhaps 200 yards of peaty bog. The northern top is the true summit, the other being some six feet lower. The southern top is compensated by a clear view of Angle Tarn, described by Wainwright as ""among the best of Lakeland tarns"". The wider view stretches from the Helvellyn range to the spine of the Far Eastern Fells across Martindale."
"The fell can be climbed via Boredale Hause, making Patterdale, Bridgend, Hartsop and Boredale Head all possible starting points. An alternative is to climb from Martindale Old Church, ascending via the Beda Fell ridge or Angle Tarn. The route from Patterdale is often undertaken as the first section of the ascent of High Street."

"He was born in Pellio Superiore in the Val d'Intelvi, near Como. At the age of 23, as an already an accomplished plasterer, he moved to Prague. He would build several different Jesuit churches and cloisters there, including some at the Clementinum, in the early baroque style. His first commission was the stucco decoration on the gothic St. Saviour Church in Prague. He also worked on the Saint Eligius Chapel there in 1654, before his work was redone by Domenico Orsi."
"Lurago was also successful outside of Bohemia. He developed the plans for the Passau Cathedral. It is notable because the main altar has a series of flat elliptical domes. This arch design foreshadows many other buildings of the baroque style. Another notable example of his work is the pilgrimage church of Maria Taferl, which had to be completed by Jakob Prandtauer after Lurago died in Passau."

She currently resides in Barnes, South-West London with her husband Ross Allen, a garden designer and their daughter Camille."
"Davies' father, the stage and television actor Geoffrey Davies, influenced her choice of career immensely. He would often let her watch his stage performances from the wings as a child. She says that she ""watched his plays nearly every night"" and ""knew all the lines."""

= = = Commodity value = = =
"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value."
"A commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility."
"Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law."
"Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become token."

"John Francis Dodge (October 25, 1864 – January 14, 1920) was an American automobile manufacturing pioneer and co-founder of Dodge Brothers Company."
"Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands."
"In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit."
"In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan."
"For ten years (1903–1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks."
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
"Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan."
"The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819–1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823–1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863–1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855–1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820–1860)."
John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864–1901) in September 1892. They had three children:
"Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883–1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda:"
"In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate."
His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III.
"John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues."
"Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21."
"After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson."
"In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University."

"Nachman Goldstein of Tcherin (1825 – 1894), also known as the Tcheriner Rav (rabbi of Tcherin, a town in eastern Ukraine), was a leading disciple of Nathan of Breslov (known as ""Reb Noson""), who in turn was the chief disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic dynasty."
"A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, ""Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of ""you""?"" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works."
"Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled ""Tovot Zichronot""."

"Sol Goldman (born Usher Selig Goldman, September 2, 1917 – October 18, 1987) was an American real estate developer. Together with his partner, Alex DiLorenzo, Goldman became the biggest non-institutional real estate investor in New York City in the 1980s, ultimately owning a portfolio of nearly 1900 commercial and residential properties."
"Goldman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Fannie and Charles Goldman. His father owned a grocery store. Goldman briefly attended Brooklyn College, before turning to real estate during the Great Depression. At age 16, he purchased his first of many foreclosed properties by raising money from his neighbors. In the 1950s, he partnered with Alex DiLorenzo Jr. Together they were very active purchasers through the 1950s and 1960s and their portfolio included the Chrysler Building which they bought in 1960. Although the 1970s were difficult—he lost the Chrysler Building to foreclosure and his partner, DiLorenzo, died in 1975—Goldman continued to invest, purchasing more than 600 buildings in the subsequent years via his company Solil Management (named after Sol and his wife, Lil). Goldman was known for holding onto his properties and rarely selling, preferring instead to sign tenants to long-term ground leases (typically 99 years) where the tenants pay an annual rent to Goldman but are responsible for taxes and upkeep of buildings on the properties."
"The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins University is named in his honor, following a gift of $10 million."
"In 1941, he married Lillian Schuman, who was also Jewish. They had four children: Allan H. Goldman, Diane Goldman Kemper, Amy P. Goldman, and Jane Goldman. Upon his death at the age of 70 in 1987, he owned New York's largest private real estate portfolio with more than 600 properties valued at $1 billion. His wife and three daughters engaged in litigation over his assets with his wife eventually receiving 1/3rd of his estate. His nephew, Lloyd Goldman, is also a notable real-estate investor in New York City. His children, Allan Goldman and Jane Goldman manage the remaining real estate assets amounting to $6.0B via the firm Solil Management."

"Within five years of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, replaced by a one-story porch.

Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would look too opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it."
"By 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark."
"The association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970."
Letters and diary entries written by Louise Taft during her time in the home helped preservationists to return the domicile to how it appeared during William's childhood.
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site has two main buildings. The first is the original home owned by William Howard Taft's parents, Alphonso and Louise Taft. It has been restored to look as it did during the time William lived there. All the family portraits and many of the books on display belonged to the Taft family. The first floor has five rooms restored: William's birthplace, and four rooms representative of the period. The furniture is period pieces and did not necessarily belong to the Tafts. The second floor contains exhibits on the accomplishments of William."
"The second building is the National Historic Site's Visitor Center, officially called the Taft Education Center. It has offices, a National Park giftshop, an audio-animatronic exhibit of William's son Charles Phelps Taft II fishing and telling stories about his father and other members of the Taft family, and a short biographical film on William Howard Taft."

"In mathematics, the Golomb–Dickman constant arises in the theory of random permutations and in number theory. Its value is"

"In the language of probability theory, formula_3 is asymptotically the expected length of the longest cycle in a uniformly distributed random permutation of a set of size ""n""."
"In number theory, the Golomb–Dickman constant appears in connection with the average size of the largest prime factor of an integer. More precisely,"
"where formula_5 is the largest prime factor of ""k"". So if ""k"" is a ""d"" digit integer, then formula_6 is the asymptotic average number of digits of the largest prime factor of ""k""."
The Golomb–Dickman constant appears in number theory in a different way. What is the
"probability that second largest prime factor of ""n"" is smaller than the square root of the largest prime factor of ""n""? Asymptotically, this probability is formula_7."
"More precisely,"
"where formula_9 is the second largest prime factor ""n""."
"The Golomb-Dickman constant also arises when we consider the average length of the largest cycle of any function from a finite set to itself. If ""X"" is a finite set, if we repeatedly apply a function ""f"": ""X"" → ""X"" to any element ""x"" of this set, it eventually enters a cycle, meaning that for some ""k"" we have formula_10 for sufficiently large ""n""; the smallest ""k"" with this property is the length of the cycle. Let ""b"" be the average, taken over all functions from a set of size ""n"" to itself, of the length of the largest cycle. Then Purdom and Williams proved that"

He was part of the initial roster for the 2013 World Baseball Classic but did not make the final roster and reportedly sat out the regular season because he was upset at his snub."
"He defected from Cuba in 2013 and obtained residency in Haiti. He began training in the Dominican Republic and on September 9, 2013, it was reported that he had been cleared by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to sign with U.S. teams."
"Guerrero was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with early reports putting his deal in the seven-year, $32 million area. However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years. The deal included a $10 million signing bonus and allows him to become a free agent after his age 30 season. The Dodgers officially announced his signing on October 22."
"Guerrero made his professional debut with the Gigantes del Cibao in the Dominican Winter League. However, he dealt with hamstring issues and was limited to only 12 games, during which he hit .289."
"Guerrero made the Dodgers' 25-man opening day roster for the 2014 season. He made his MLB debut as a pinch hitter on March 22, 2014 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but when Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson countered by putting in a right-handed pitcher, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly sent in a left-hander to pinch hit for Guerrero. Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes."
"During a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital. In 65 games for the Isotopes, he played 51 games at second base, 9 in left field, 4 at shortstop and 1 at third base. He hit .329 with 15 homers and 49 RBI. The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats."
"In spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract that allowed him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on the opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense."
"In his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off of Óliver Pérez of the Arizona Diamondbacks."
"After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games."
"On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers."
"His production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average."
"Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8."
"On November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi record for most consecutive games with a homerun after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a homerun set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2."

"The first teaching done on the islands was by a fisherman, John Feltham, who was asked by William Tiller to stay ashore rather than fish to teach his boys. Feltham agreed to this, and sometime later, in 1829, he was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G.), to be a teacher. In 1830 there were about 25 students, but this school was discontinued in 1834. The next record of school was by the teacher Edward Churnside Bishop under the Newfoundland School Society from 1843 to 1883. In 1869 a new school house was built; and the last teacher to teach at Swain's Island was Annie Alice Hall in 1901."
"Swain's Island was settled because of its prime location and advantages in the various fisheries. Its entire economy, like so many other communities in Newfoundland at this time, depended upon the fisheries. In 1874 there was a peak number of fishing rooms on Swain's Island, totalling 19 altogether, in 1884 there were still 10 fishing rooms in use."

It was surrounded in the Courland Pocket at the end of the war where it surrendered to the Red Army."
"The division was formed in January 1944, from 2 SS Infantry Brigade with the addition of a newly raised third regiment, Waffen Grenadier Regiment 46 (Latvian No. 6). Simultaneously, the designations of the two other grenadier regiments were changed from 39 and 40 to 42 and 43 respectively. The commander of the SS brigade, SS-Oberführer Hinrich Schuldt became the first commander of the division.

By the late 1890s they were having financial problems and were bought by James William Bayliss, part owner of the Bayliss-Thomas car making company."
"Their first car, a three-wheeler, was made in 1899 followed by a forecar in 1903. Cecil Bayliss, the son of the new owner, built a cyclecar in 1911 with 800 cc engine, and this was developed into the first Perry car to reach production."
"The Perry cyclecar was described as 'just placed on the market' when exhibited at the November 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia. It was described as 'an exact replica of a full-sized model, but is of exceptionally light weight - less than 7cwt'."
"The engine for the car was built in-house and was a twin-cylinder vertical water cooled unit, with 72mm bore and 108mm stroke, unusual in that both pistons rose and fell at the same time. Drive was to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox with reverse and worm-driven axle and spur differential. The rear springing was unusual in that the long semi-elliptic leaf springs were supplemented by coil springs. It was fitted with Sankey detachable wheels and Dunlop tyres."
"The basic body was an open two-seater, but a long-wheelbase version allowing a dickey seat was also available."
About 800 were made.
A full-sized car was introduced in 1914 with four-cylinder 1795 cc engine. The larger car allowed four seat bodies to be offered as well as two seaters and these were mainly made by Mulliners of Birmingham.
"About 300 were made before World War I curtailed car-building activities. A very few were made in 1919 when the design, jigs, patterns and tools were sold to Bean Cars for £15,000, who reintroduced it as the Bean 11.9."

"Barsukova began figure skating at age five in the Izmaylovo District of Moscow where she lived. When she was eight years old, she passed a sports club and saw girls practicing rhythmic gymnastics through the window. Her father soon enrolled her in the sport. After three years, she moved to Tagansky District high school's rhythmic gymnastics department."
"Barsukova was coached by Vera Silaeva until she was sixteen, when Silaeva took her student to Russia's head coach, Irina Viner. Viner was unimpressed initially but accepted her at the urging of Russia's national team choreographer, Veronica Shatkova."
"Barsukova began competing at international competitions following the coaching change. For six years she competed under the shadow of other Russian gymnasts, Yanina Batyrchina, Amina Zaripova, Natalia Lipkovskaya and then Alina Kabaeva. Barsukova considered quitting rhythmic gymnastics until Viner persuaded her to stay and be patient. She had her breakthrough in 1998. During an event dedicated to the 15th anniversary of Ballet Magazine, Barsukova performed along with the stars of the theater. She performed her ""Dying Swan"" ball routine and received the unofficial title of ""Miss Bolshoi Theater""."

She won gold in hoop at the 2000 World Cup Final in Glasgow and then gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics after a hoop fumble by then-World champion, Alina Kabaeva. She was the 2000 European All-around bronze medalist and won the rope final at the 2000 European Championships (9.983). She was the oldest Olympic champion in rhythmic gymnastics—21 years, 8 months and 27 days—until fellow Russian Evgenia Kanaeva won her second gold medal at London 2012 being aged 22 years, 4 months and 7 days."
"After the Olympics, Barsukova won the all-around title at the Grand Prix Final in Deventer where she also won gold in ball, rope and ribbon final. She retired from competition following the 2000 Aeon Cup. She has participated in Russia's Channel One project ""Stars on Ice""."

"Highway 105 in Nova Scotia represents the Cape Breton Island leg of the Trans-Canada Highway. It runs from the Port Hastings Rotary just east of the Canso Causeway in Port Hastings to the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in North Sydney, representing a distance of ."
"In 2010, the provincial government named the entire highway Mabel and Alexander Graham Bell Way in honour of Mabel Gardiner Hubbard and her husband Alexander Graham Bell, who resided and are buried at Beinn Bhreagh near Baddeck."
"The highway travels northeast from Port Hastings along the base of a group of mountains known as ""The Big Ridge"" to Whycocomagh. It then follows the north shore of Bras d'Or Lake, bypassing Baddeck on a short Super two controlled access segment. Still running in a general northeast direction, at St. Anns the highway begins ascending the west slope of Kelly's Mountain on the Cape Dauphin Peninsula. Highway 105 descends the east slope of Kelly's Mountain using a series of sharp turns including a 180° hairpin turn at New Harris Forks before crossing the Great Bras d'Or Channel of Bras d'Or Lake on the Seal Island Bridge. The road crosses Boularderie Island using another short Super two controlled access segment and then runs southeast as an uncontrolled access road through the villages of Bras d'Or and Florence. Highway 105 regains controlled access for the final to its eastern terminus at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in North Sydney where travellers can continue to Newfoundland."
"With some minor exceptions noted above, the highway is two lanes and uncontrolled access. In addition, there are two intersections controlled by traffic lights in Florence."
"The Cabot Trail, which is usually used to describe a different road, is signed along a portion of Highway 105 between Nyanza and St. Anns so that the signed route forms a loop."
"Highway 105 is descended from the former Trunk 5, which no longer exists; Highway 105 follows the old Trunk 5 alignment, using present Routes 205, 305 and roads named after it to serve areas bypassed by Highway 105. The 105 name was applied in 1964<br>"
"Trunk 5 was a provincial trunk road in Victoria County and the Cape Breton Regional Municipality between Boularderie East and Millville Boularderie on Boularderie Island in Nova Scotia. The route, known as Millville Highway, was the main highway before Nova Scotia Highway 105 opened. It originally extended from Sydney River to Port Hawkesbury. It is now commonly known as Old Route 5."

"Eminsang travelled back to the Gold Coast on the same ship that carried Nagtglas there. Upon arrival, Nagtglas appointed Eminsang as a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast. When it became apparent that the Dutch were negotiating a treaty to transfer their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom, Eminsang led the attempts by the Elminese to stop the transfer, and together with other Dutch loyalists paid for a visit to The Hague by David Mill Graves, in an ultimate attempt to stop the ratification of the treaty. Eminsang wrote a letter to the German ambassador in The Hague asking German Emperor William I for mediation and protection, to be handed over by Mill Graves."
"After it became clear that Mill Graves's mission could not prevent the handing over of Elmina to the British, Eminsang withdrew his protest, keen on keeping his influential positions in the colonial government. Apart from being a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast, Eminsang had also become a substitute judge on the Court of Justice, a sworn attorney, and a justice of the Small Causes Court. Eminsang's ""volte face"" proved very worthwhile for him, as he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Regularisation of the Affairs of the Netherlands on the Coast of Guinea headed by J. M. C. W. Joost, as well as notary and public registrar."
"When Elmina was finally transferred to the British on 6 April, the British Governor of the Gold Coast John Pope Hennessy appointed Eminsang Civil Commandant, Collector of Customs, Postmaster and Deputy Superintendent of Police. As it appeared that Eminsang was rewarded for his sudden change of opinion, many Elminese grew angry with the situation. On 26 April, people from various ""asafo"" wards, mainly numbers 6, 7 and 8, marched with muskets, knives and Dutch flags to Eminsang's house, where a meeting was held between the Regularisation Committee and colonel De Haes, the Dutch military officer who had been entrusted with effecting the transfer of sovereignty. An altercation followed on the streets and eventually shots were fired, which hit J. M. C. W. Joost, who died of his wounds the next day."
"Eminsang could no longer remain in Elmina and fled to Cape Coast. He was released of his duties to the Regularisation Committee by colonel De Haes on 30 April. Eminsang later returned to Elmina, however, and served as acting consul general of the Netherlands in Elmina in 1878 and 1879 during the absence of Pieter Simon Hamel, and as consul to the Congo and the United States in Cape Coast in 1890."
"In the preface of his book ""Fanti Customary Laws"", John Mensah Sarbah wrote:"
"Eminsang had at least three children with Anna Abraba Smith. One of them, Marianne Eminsang (about 1859–1915), was grandmother to Robert Patrick Baffour. Anna Abraba Smith previously had a child with Cornelis Nagtglas."
"Eminsang married Mary Ellen De Lyons on 14 April 1860 at the American Episcopal Church in Harper, Liberia. She however abandoned him for the British colonial administrator Herbert Taylor Ussher. Eminsang then tried to indict Ussher for fornication and adultery at the Cape Coast court of justice, but after this attempt failed he decided to divorce De Lyons. The divorce was finalised on 11 September 1867."
Eminsang also had a child with Sarah Rühle and a son with a woman named Adayesa.

"Pemberton is an unincorporated community in Goochland County, Virginia, United States. Virginia State Route 45 passes by Pemberton, located about west of Goochland, the county seat. It was named for the family that owned Clover Forest Plantation. Nearby is Howard's Neck Plantation, listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"This hamlet was named for the owners of Clover Forest Plantation. The settlement overlooks the James River and was once a hub of rural trading activity. A dam and canal lock were built on the James at Pemberton to enable passage by boats. The lock lowered boats from the Kanawha Canal into the James River just below Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia and connected with Tamworth, Virginia and its mill. Trade moved from the Cartersville port and Willis River downriver on the James."
"Pemberton became connected to other markets via the Cartersville-Fredericksburg State Road, that began in Cartersville, crossed the James, and continued northward. The Cartersville Bridge, built across the James River in 1824, connected Cartersville and Pemberton; it was the first James River bridge built in Goochland County. At the time, all other river crossings were by ferry."
"In the late 1800s the Richmond-Allegheny Railroad (later the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, and currently CSX) was built through the area along the tow path of the abandoned Kanawha Canal. Pemberton was one of the railroad stops. Trains arrived in the village daily, carrying passengers and mail."
"By the early 1920s the rural village of Pemberton consisted of a large combined general store and post office, a lumber mill and pulp yards. Prominent Goochland County residents living in Pemberton included William Henry (Bill) Hall, a veteran of the American Civil War; and Bland Selden Hobson, the only Goochland woman known to have served overseas in World War I."
