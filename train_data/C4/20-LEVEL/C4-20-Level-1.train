So I did it  and bowls are full of water!

Good
"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"""No! only just look,"" they said; ""there the fool sits still."""
"The next day when they went out to battle, they saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange champion it could be that had helped them, but no one got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one guessed it could be the lad; that's easy to understand."
"So when they went home at night, and saw the lad still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail; 'twas enough to break one's heart; and so the King threw his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound."
"When they went out to battle the third day, the lad still sat there."
"""Gee up! gee up!"" he said to his hack."
"""Nay, nay,"" said the King's men; ""if he won't stick there till he's starved to death."""
"And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. When they were gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew the enemy's king, and then the war was over at once."
"When the battle was over, the King caught sight of his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound round his leg, and so it wasn't hard to find him out. So they took him with great joy between them to the palace, and the Princess, who saw him from her window, got so glad, no one can believe it."
"""Here comes my own true love,"" she said."
"Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded, and so they all got well again in a moment."
"So he got the Princess to wife; but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy, and hung its ears down, and wouldn't eat its corn. So when the young King for he was now a king, and had got half the kingdom spoke to him, and asked what ailed him, the Horse said:"
"""Now I have helped you on, and now I won't live any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head off."""
"""No, I'll do nothing of the kind,"" said the young King; ""but you shall have all you want, and rest all your life."""
"""Well,"" said the Horse, ""if you don't do as I tell you, see if I don't take your life somehow."""
"So the King had to do what he asked; but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the head, there stood the loveliest Prince on the spot where the horse had stood."
"""Why, where in all the world did you come from?"" asked the King."
"""It was I who was a horse,"" said the Prince; ""for I was king of that land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who threw this Troll's shape over me, and sold me to the Troll. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never make on one another."""
"And they didn't either; for they were friends as long as they lived, and each paid the other very many visits."
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF
"Once on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was ""Gruff."""
"On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker."
So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""Trip, trap! trip, trap!"" went the bridge."
"""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, with such a small voice."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy-goat; ""wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge."
"""WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! It's the second billy-goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, who hadn't such a small voice."

"[1474] Psellus (_Quaenam sunt Graecorum opiniones de daemonibus_, 3,"

I cannot agree with Miss J. Harrison (_Prolegomena to the Study of
"Greek Religion_, p. 569) as to the importance of Psellus’ testimony"
in any respect. He appears to me to give no more than a _résumé_ of
"information derived from Clement’s _Protreptica_, misunderstood and"
even more confused.

CLARE.  [Smiling-in a clear voice with the faintest possible lisp]
"Yes, we met on the door-mat.  [Pause.]"
SIR CHARLES.  Deuce you did!  [An awkward pause.]
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Acidly]  Mr. Malise doesn't play Bridge, it appears."
Afraid we shall be rather in the way of music.
SIR CHARLES.  What!  Aren't we goin' to get a game?  [PAYNTER has
entered with a tray.]
GEORGE.  Paynter!  Take that table into the dining room.
"PAYNTER.  [Putting down the tray on a table behind the door]  Yes,"
sir.
MALISE.  Let me give you a hand.

"in which Creon bids Ismene speak no more of Antigone as ἥδε, and an"
ironical stress might well be laid by Creon on the word τούσδε as he
"uses it, which would suggest to his audience its antithesis τοὺς ἐκεὶ"

LADY DEDMOND.  Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be
"supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone.  Go"
quietly into the dining-room and wait for her.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!  Leave your mother to make up something.  She'll
do it!
LADY DEDMOND.  That may be he.  Quick!
[A bell sounds.]
"GEORGE goes out into the hall, leaving the door open in his"
"haste.  LADY DEDMOND, following, calls ""Paynter!""  PAYNTER"
enters.
LADY DEDMOND.  Don't say anything about your master and mistress
being out.  I'll explain.
"PAYNTER.  The master, my lady?"
"LADY DEDMOND.  Yes, I know.  But you needn't say so.  Do you"
understand?
"PAYNTER.  [In polite dudgeon]  Just so, my lady."
[He goes out.]
SIR CHARLES.  By Jove!  That fellow smells a rat!
"LADY DEDMOND.  Be careful, Charles!"

CHAPTER I
HIS LORDSHIP
Madame Gilbert's war service ended when Austria fell out. She had been
in Italy busied with those obscure intrigues for the confounding of an
"enemy which are excused, and dignified, as patriotic propaganda. She is"
"satisfied that on the Italian Front she, and those who worked with her,"
really won the war.
"The war satisfactorily won, Madame Gilbert sped home to revel in the"
[Footnote 1: I have obtained a copy and give it here as it had an
almost historical importance in the events of the German occupation.
But the reader must interpret its meaning for himself.
LA GUERRE
"Ma soeur, vous souvient-il qu'aux jours de notre enfance,"
"En lisant les hauts fails de l'histoire de France,"
"Remplis d'admiration pour nos frères Gaulois,"
Des généraux fameux nous vantions les exploits?
"En nos âmes d'enfants, les seuls noms des victoires"
Prenaient un sens mystique evocateur de gloires;
On ne rêvait qu'assauts et combats; a nos yeux
Un général vainqueur etait l'égal des dieux.
Rien ne semblait ternir l'éclat de ces conquétes.
Les batailles prenaient des allures de fêtes
Et nous ne songions pas qu'aux hurrahs triomphants
"Se mêlaient les sanglots des mères, des enfants."
"Ah! nous la connaissons, hélas, l'horrible guerre:"
"Le fléau qui punit les crimes de la terre,"
Le mot qui fait trembler les mères à genoux
Et qui seme le deuil et la mort parmi nous!
Mais ou sqnt les lauriers que réserve l'Histoire
A celui qui demain forcera la Victoire?
Nul ne les cueillira: les lauriers sont flétris
Seul un cypres s'élève aux torubes de nos fils.]

adequate knowledge of both Croce's and Gentile's work.

"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."

"I should be rather careful about him, I think."
SIR CHARLES.  Who's that?
LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.
SIR CHARLES.  Oh!  That chap!
GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?
GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.

PAYNTER.  Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine;
"and Captain Huntingdon, too--Mr. and Mrs.  Fullarton might be a bit"
"late, sir."
GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?
"PAYNTER.  Not to me, sir."

INTRODUCTION
Mr. Oliphant Smeaton has asked me to write a few words of preface to
"this little book. If I try, it is only because I am old enough to have"
had the privilege of knowing some of those who were most closely
associated with Ferrier.

DR. J. C. BOSE ENTERTAINED
PARTY AT RAM MOHAN LIBRARY
"On Saturday, 24th July, 1915, the members of the Ram Mohan Library and"
"Reading room received Dr. J. C. Bose, the President of the Library in a"
"right royal fashion, on his return to India from his Scientific"
Deputation to the West.
"There was a large and influential gathering, and the spacious hall was"
tastefully decorated.
Dr. J. C. Bose arrived at 6:15 p.m. and was received at the gate by Mr.
"D. N. Pal, Secretary. Dr. Bose then went round the hall accompanied by"
the members of the Executive Committee while the Bharati Musical
Association played excellent Jaltaranga Orchestra.
"Babu Bhupendra Nath Bose, Vice-President of the Library, made a"
brilliant speech welcoming Dr. Bose and detailing the great services
done to the country by him.
DR. BOSE'S REPLY
Dr. Bose in reply expressed his thanks for the great interest shown in

"CLARE.  You mean your name, don't you?"
GEORGE.  Look here.  Did that fellow Malise put all this into your
head?
CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.
CLARE.  [With a touch of rapture]  Ah-h!
GEORGE.  Why do you let him come?  What d'you find interesting in
him?
CLARE.  A mind.
GEORGE.  Deuced funny one!  To have a mind--as you call it--it's not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
CLARE.  We don't.
GEORGE.  Then what do you talk about--your minds?  [CLARE looks at
him]  Will you answer a straight question?  Is he falling in love
with you?
CLARE.  You had better ask him.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.
[She follows the GENERAL out]
"[CLARE stands perfectly still, with her eyes closed.]"
MALISE.  Delicious!
"CLARE.  [In her level, clipped voice]  Perfectly beastly of me!  I'm"
so sorry.  I simply can't help running amok to-night.
MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]
MALISE.  Don't spoil it!
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.

GEORGE.  Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir."
GEORGE.  Well?
"BURNEY.  I don't think she meant it, sir."
"GEORGE.  I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact."
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir.  The mistress said: ""I hope it'll be a pleasant"
"evening, Burney!"""
GEORGE.  Oh!--Thanks.
"BURNEY.  I've put out the mistress's things, sir."
GEORGE.  Ah!
"BURNEY.  Thank you, sir.  [She withdraws.]"
GEORGE.  Damn!

Gone to her room.  What a blessing that man isn't here yet!  [The

"BECAUSE you cried, I kissed you, and,"
Ah me! how should I understand
That piteous little you were fain
To cry and to be kissed again?
"Because you smiled at last, I thought"
That I had found what I had sought.
"But soon I found, without a doubt,"
No man can find a woman out.
"I kissed your tears, and did not stay"
Till I had kissed them all away.
"Ah, hapless me! ah, heartless child!"
She would not kiss me when she smiled.

_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.

He's doing it on purpose.
Where's Riley?
He's dead.
"Okay, listen."
He needs help.
Tell Ollie I don't wanna be the leader anymore.
"He can be the leader, okay, 'cause I just..."

Hello?
What's happening?
"Blair, what's happening?"
What's going on?
"Somebody's in here, Blair."
"Oh, God, Connor."

No sign of pain.

Come visit me in Korea.

My sister's a por...
It was my girlfriend.
The phone.
Front desk speaking.
What?
No hot water in the bath?
"I'm sorry, we'll send someone right away."
Excuse me?
"Oh, sure, we'll bring one."
Sorry about that.
Room 311 has no hot water in the bath.
Room 311?
"Hurry, go."
You go instead.
"It's your job to deal with customer complaints, no?"
"Please, go for me."
And you call yourself a man?
"Wait, take a condom."
The room was missing one.
No hot water?
Asshole.
"Ow, what the hell?"
Why aren't you angry?
Right.

Bon appetit!
Where's Iwai?

Me neither.
I see.
What's going on?
"You gave up ShaoIin Kung Fu, and for what?"
To cook Chinese food.
I didn't come back even when Grandpa died.
I trained hard.
Was it all in vain?
What's so great about ShaoIin Kung Fu?
What can you do?
I don't...
You can break logs?
You're strong.
It's just more violence.
Found it.
Good.
Who's there?
Rin.
What are you doing?
"You'II teach me Shaolin Kung Fu, right?"
But the Teacher said I shouldn't.
( chatter continues )
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.
Is your mom back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Will your mom be OK with this?
"- Yes, I'm sure she will."
She always gives that much.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize that...
We usually don't accept money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we're allowed."
"Well, it is a nice house."
Just look.
I guess they can afford it.

Is this a garden?
What a place!

"Golly, what's that?"
"That's Mrs. W., a very good friend of mine."
Kind of unusual.

And each one deserves a closer look.

I feel pretty clear actually.
Things are the way they are.
Don't fight it.
Just go with it.

Not a good one.
Thank you for the tea.

A CONVlCTlON APPEARED IMMlNENT... (Ruby) AAH!
Japonian martxotik aurrera iristen hasi zitzaizkigu heien antzeko sintomen kontakizunak.
Hasi nintzen susmatzen menturaz osasun kalteak handiagoak zirela telebistetan kontatuak baino.
"Ikerketan hasita, amak galdezkatu nituen, eta ohartu nintzne egoera zinez arriskutsua zela."
Hau martxo bukaera aldean gertatu zen.
Apirila bukatutakoan Japonia osotik hasi nintzen jasotzen hitz egiteko gonbiteak.
"Noan leku guztietan, Txernobylen gertatutakoen antzekoak entzuten ditut."
Haurretan oso antzeko sintomak aurkitzen ditugu.
Zu eta zure taldeak antolatu zenuten Japonian haurrentzako lehenbiziko kontsulta.
Esango diguzu zein izan zen gurasoen erantzuna?
Nola esango nizuke...
"Gure lehen asmoa zen besterik gabe gurasoei aukera ematea Txernobylgo haurrak ikusiak zituzten medikuekin hitz egiteko, lasaitu zitezen."
Baina teléfono deiak ez zitzaizkigun gutxitu.
Ohartu ginen konbidatu genituen medikuak ez zirela aski.
Berehala dei egin behar izan genien mediku boluntarioei.
"Hala ere sekulako jendetzak deitzen zuen, askori esan behar izan genien ez etortzeko."
Ikusten ari garen osasun arazoak ez dituzte erakutsi komunikabide nagusietan.
Baina SOS dei asko jaso dituzue.
Egia da.
Geuk ere begiratu dugu ea zer ari den gertatzen oraintxe.
"Fukushimako osasun kontsultaz eta osasun arazoen zainketa independienteaz egin dugu erreportajea; mesedez, ikusi ondoko bideoa."
"Fukushima hiria, Fukushima probintzian [zentral nuklearretik 60 kilometrora]."
Ekainean ekin zitzaion haurren osasun kontsultari.
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Fukushimako Sarea""ren ekipoak antolatu zuen."
Hasieran 150 haurrentzako behar zuen.
Baina eskariz gainezka zeuden.
"Azkenerako, 500 ume etorri ziren."
"""Haurrak Erradiaziotik Babesteko Pediatren Sare Nazional""eko kideek aztertzen zituzten."
Nola dago hau?...
OK?
Ikus'tagun hemen...
OK.

Yeah.
Our good vibes are out for her.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, it doesn't."

You're both correct.

BETH HOYT:
You can drink anyway.
"Cheers, yeah."
Cheers because you got it correct.

"And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know,"
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.

Yes.
Which ones?
"I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW."
Oh.
Those are the two I like the best.

I know.
"It's going to be history, I know."
I don't know what's going to
"yeah,"

Uh-huh.
"We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,"

My husband and I are grandparents.
"Oh, well. Well ..."

"""I Give You My Heart"" (sometimes called ""Lord, I Give You My Heart"" or ""This is My Desire"") is a 1995 song by Reuben Morgan, who wrote both the music and the lyrics.

""I Give You My Heart"" is a devotional song , part of the contemporary worship music genre, and also a slow ballad."
"In the liner notes of ""God is in the House"", Morgan said of this song: ""The heart of GOD is for us to be completely sold out to HIM. Our thoughts, passions and dreams (everything that makes us who we are) only have true life as they become HIS to shape and to mould. As we give our heart and our soul to GOD we then walk in the endless riches that are found in intimacy with HIM."""
"Among Christian songs, ""I Give You My Heart"" is one of the most frequently recorded. The song appeared on Hillsong Music Australia's compilation album ""Ultimate Worship"".

= = = Thomas Shorts = = =
"Thomas Dolman Shorts was a Canadian sailor, and one of the early captains on the Okanagan Lake. Shorts started the lakeboat service on Okanagan Lake in the Penticton area."
"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."
Torres Amat died in Madrid on 29 December 1847.
