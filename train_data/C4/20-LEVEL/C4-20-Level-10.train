Mm.
But he did give me somebody to ring about caravans
Mm.
but then later on in the day he rung back and said he had found some  bilingual signs but all he's got were about four foot square  er with census point ahead.
He hasn't got things like stop  census.
Stop if required  or  slow census point which is the ones we use.
It might be worth asking erm  Mel
Yeah.
about that.
You see for a start we need to decide to we need it.
Two point nine nine would be one of them.
Just after three would be?
Three point nought one.
Right.
Right?
And in between would be three.
Between would be three.
"Up one  that, we'll just take ."
What will Y be when X is that?
Erm two point nine nine squared minus one.
Okay.
"So you'd just write it as, I mean as it's minus one, you can take it off as you go along, but it's, sometimes it'll be a minus six or something, so write it as two point nine nine squared minus one."
Erm  three  squared minus one.
Okay.
Now subtract
when you have to
that Y from that one.
Okay.
It's two point nine nine plus three point
Mm.
"Oh  Oh, yeah, don't, don't do it all in your head."
Okay.
Do the first stage first.
"Take that expression away from that, and once you're left, what happens to the minus ones?"
They cancel.
Right.
So what are you left with?
In terms of the squares.
Two point nine nine and three point
Which one's first?
Two point nine nine..
Now we'll just take the
"It's  they're all doing erm,I've got you , right and there's a really daffy bloke he   I've got you  ."
That's how he's singing it?
"Yeah, he had to sing it like that and then, then there's, there's only two of them, you know  and erm, the, er, other, the other one, he's a black man yeah, and he goes who's that big gorilla in the back and he's pointing to me ."
"Oh was he ha, ha ."
"And then erm, then they had this thing called Niff, which was water, and they came round spraying all of us."
"So where do they come, is Vicky in the actual group?"
"Why is she, what, does she watch?"
"Not her, not just her, all her mates."
"Ooh, feeling a bit tired."

But it's it's the degree
"How can that how can that man as a socialist  justify earning  well I don't know what he gets, but we'll say he doesn't"
Well
"get as much as Thatcher, say he gets  forty thousand"
"Well no, I didn't know  no you don't"
"Oh, now wait a, wait a minute!"
"Now I, I have said to, I have said to you"
He's a rich man
that everybody
and he shouldn't be!
everybody should earn the same.
Mm.
But you all said  that it depends on his skill or his what's his name
Or how many kids he's got.
"If I've got twenty five kids and you've only got one yo , I need more than you!"
So how can you possibly all earn the same?
Why not?
"Well you wouldn't have enough would you, to su sustain all those"
Yeah.
kids?
Why?
You'd have to get enough to live on.
I can't see that!
I mean er

"So I said what do you want me to do then, leave this mattress on the bed?"
And you'll be taking it?

Little blue and white wooden hut.

"Well  old Harry  shared with my uncle  he had his house and he bought a piece of land on the bottom of his garden  and he built wall on  his  or this piece along the bottom of his garden, but er  I couldn't tell you, it wasn't very far up the road."
But er  yeah I know.
But I haven't been up to cla Clarendon Road for some time now.
Er  ha!
"There used to be a  a house on the end of the common up at Clarendon Road, the opposite side  oh!"
"Er  old Mrs   I dunno, but th , anyway there was  only this one old house up in the common and er  I went up there one time with  horse and   take a couple of pigs from there down to Wimborne market."
But I suppose the old house has pulled down under pressure and built on now but  that was the only house going up through there in them days.
That was a very old house!
Wimborne market's supposed to be old.
Mm?
Wimborne market must be very old!
"Oh Lord, yes!"
"Course  we , Wimborne cattle market is finished now isn't it?"
I went to a cattle market in

It hurts!
Oh go on Jonathan!
But it hurts!
Why does it hurt your belly?
Well cos I have to lean over!
On my belly!
"Well how do you think mum does, she isn't half  much taller than you anyway!"

Wouldn't you?
Not if it was life or death?
Wouldn't you ever do it if it was life or death?
Pardon?

Well I suppose I would have to.
I certainly wouldn't like it.
Nor would I!
It's got a load of rat holes in!
Can't smell  in that.
I can get to the  .
Hurry up!
"me, but it's five pound eighty for a two hour session."
Well you've got to think about going to Northampton.
Yeah.
You're talking about half hour there and back drive.
So that
Yeah.
two hours is now three.
Yeah.
Plus your petrol money to get there.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's right.
Do you want me to fetch a pillow?
"No, you're alright love."
There's plenty of cushions
"No, you're alright."
"And erm  so you see you're, you're throwing money to get money which is, which is a bit stupid."
That's right.
pointless .
But then I erm  she phoned me yesterday and she said to me have you had any  professional  lifting erm  lessons at all.
I said no.
None whatsoever.
"So she said oh, that's alright, I've got it all in me head what, what I've got with you."
So I do believe in me soul that she's working for me.
Mm.
Mm.
"But she's offered me a relief post as I say, where I go round and help but she don't know how many hours it will be."
Mm.
"But I think I've got to get in and I've got to think well this next six months  erm I've gotta work hard to get in  regardless of whether I go  voluntary or whether I go to a hospital and learn it at me own you know, expense."
Yeah.
I think I've got to put something in to get something out.
I've never been a person that gets something for nothing.
For nothing.
So I did that both sides so that
Like he's sort of saying that he's the boss!
Li like the leader of the .

they'd have to.
keep your fingers crossed and not
Oh I don't know I had a subjugated  about that.
They do .
So
Fair does like  rather than
"Mm,tha , that's why I didn't say like"
paying out for a
feet aren't they sometimes ?
And the brake pads had gone
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Oh yes, you've gotta replace them"
They're sort of saying  that you are really testing your
"I mean, I replace mine"
To see that
but but the brakes

But the brakes  literally bleed them
Said it to loads of people!
"Go on, get off!"
Get out the way!

Mm.
"I mean, he's nearly as  as overdrawn as Sophie and she's, she's nearly completed her course!"
I know!
He just hasn't got a clue though!
He doesn't care yo hasn't got a clue!
He must be worried about it though?
Surely he must be worried?
"Well I was talking to him about it, I said I reckon you've spent the  you've spent quite a bit now so you might as well just go another  get final ."
Three years!
Three year course!
I know !
"And he  can't   he usually works in the Bistro in Padsdown, he couldn't work in there to repay it!"
Because when he's in there his wage packets are like minus fifteen pounds when he's in there!
Why?
Because he spends it all!
So really he's got to get a job which is gonna  pay the majority of it off.
But I'll be down at dad's till ti till September.

Yeah?
"I might be there or I might be  with Roy, I don't know."

If you need a larger one that that
That's what it says.
I've got a
No but
template.
on a bridge bit
Why not?
"It's, it's  that's really linked to do we need to do the Caernarvon link if we're doing the bypass?"

Well to be but er
And er

I mean it's turned into a bit of a joke now really
Yes it has.
hasn't it?
"You know, our policies are working, I mean after thirteen years"
Well they've had long enough to do it!
And this recession that we've been coming out of for so many years now it's  I mean it's just turned into a bit of a joke!
They're all making money for themselves aren't they?
That's why I'm suspicious
Well
of the Labour party!
Well
The Labour party?
"No, I don't"
The big shots you know!
Money in the bank
No I don't
Well
gas and electric's expensive now isn't it?
I know.
"And I keep thinking to myself well something will come along, something'll happen, but  I I think what it is  there is no jobs round here at the moment."
I think what it is is that I feel  if I go into something for the sake of going into it to earn money  I shall be absolutely bored with me life.
I f I shall feel as if we've been from here  cos when I was first married we lived up round the next road.
"And I shall feel as if I've got up, been round the world"
Yeah.
"and come back to, to where I were twenty six year ago and"
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't want that.
I've got to
No.
have a purpose to go out to work.
Mm.
I mean most people go out to work to earn money.
Mm.
Yeah.
I mean I went out because I mean
The house does get boring.
I I got really  really fed up.
Erm I mean I were working
at library.
I mean that were no problem.
But then when I left library  I just got fed up and  I went and  went down to help Sue didn't I?
And I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Yeah.
Mm.
It's meeting the people.
"But now she's left and she's had a baby  and I carried on  because he wanted it, the the new landlord wanted me to  to stop on and help out."
Oh my giddy aunt.
And I would go in and I  I never said nothing to him at first did I?but I just couldn't take it any more.
"You're gonna buy, you're gonna buy some?"
I'll send off for some stuff.
I'll just do it.
Okay.

"I think ours is only eleven, that's what we was told."
Mine are twelve.
"I thought it was thirteen, was it?"

after a bit.
"But you've got to watch them when they're, when you're in the wet."
"I was I was, I was slightly banked at the time."
Mm.
Just very slightly.
You w if your d wheel does move it won't move far.
"You get used to that, the wheel  moving over a bit."
I suppose er it's a trick not to over correct?
Yeah.
"Where I mean our, invariably our in involvement is much greater than the Q S."
Naturally.
"And many of my staff in s in not just  but one or two others, see this as the tail wagging the dog if you like where somebody says, you will do so and so, or you know, I'm telling you you'll do this."
Now it's how you read that into that procedure.
That's the problem with it.
There's no problem I
I understand that.
"mean that, you know, why?"
Why should the Q S estimate all our work?
Mm.
The there is no real good reason
Why he shouldn't.

In fact there's a
up to date.
There's a very good reason why he
Could he do that?

Ah!
"There's something very, very important that you forgot to say."

What?
You've got to get one  very special  on your side .
I said that!
"Make arrangements, and get people on your side."
Well you said that.
Oh yeah!

"He said that  he said it doesn't happen in York, but it has happened in some places  you know."
"I could understand them refusing you if they'd asked for  say, a B in english and C in something else"
Yes.
"and you got D in English and D in so , although it may not be the point, or C."
Yes.
"Because  then you  you wouldn't  certainly up, be up to the standard would you?"

According to that  about hundred and fifty quid in all.
What?
According to what?
In that.
No.
Hundred and forty three.
How else ?
See the  this  th the there's got to be summat wrong.
"But if you, if you add all them up, and then add up all what there is in there  there's summat wrong."
Mm.
"What, what balance is it in, on that bit of paper Dave?"
"Most disquieting reflection of all , was it not bad form to think about good form ?"
His vitals were tortured by this problem .
"It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one ; and as it tore him , the perspiration dripped down his tallow -LSB- waxy -RSB- countenance and streaked his doublet ."
"Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face , but there was no damming that trickle ."
"Ah , envy not Hook ."
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution -LSB- death -RSB- .
It was as if Peter 's terrible oath had boarded the ship .
"Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech , lest presently there should be no time for it ."
"`` Better for Hook , '' he cried , `` if he had had less ambition ! ''"
It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person .
`` No little children to love me ! ''
"Strange that he should think of this , which had never troubled him before ; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind ."
"For long he muttered to himself , staring at Smee , who was hemming placidly , under the conviction that all children feared him ."
Feared him !
Feared Smee !
There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him .
"He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand , because he could not hit with his fist , but they had only clung to him the more ."
Michael had tried on his spectacles .
To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable !
"Hook itched to do it , but it seemed too brutal ."
"Instead , he revolved this mystery in his mind : why do they find Smee lovable ?"
He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was .
"If Smee was lovable , what was it that made him so ?"
A terrible answer suddenly presented itself -- `` Good form ? ''
"Had the bo ` sun good form without knowing it , which is the best form of all ?"
He remembered that you have to prove you do n't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop -LSB- an elite social club at Eton -RSB- .
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee 's head ; but he did not tear .
"What arrested him was this reflection : `` To claw a man because he is good form , what would that be ? ''"
`` Bad form ! ''
"The unhappy Hook was as impotent -LSB- powerless -RSB- as he was damp , and he fell forward like a cut flower ."
"His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time , discipline instantly relaxed ; and they broke into a bacchanalian -LSB- drunken -RSB- dance , which brought him to his feet at once , all traces of human weakness gone , as if a bucket of water had passed over him ."
"`` Quiet , you scugs , '' he cried , `` or I 'll cast anchor in you ; '' and at once the din was hushed ."
"And we could hear him adding to himself , `` Cap'n , is it ?"
"My heart , and here 's promotion ! ''"
Long John answered for himself .
"`` Me , sir ."
"These poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sir '' -- laying a particular emphasis upon the word `` desertion . ''"
"`` We 're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it ."
"All I ask is your word , Cap'n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ' shot before a gun is fired . ''"
"`` My man , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I have not the slightest desire to talk to you ."
"If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that 's all ."
"If there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and the Lord help you . ''"
"`` That 's enough , cap'n , '' shouted Long John cheerily ."
`` A word from you 's enough .
"I know a gentleman , and you may lay to that . ''"
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back .
"Nor was that wonderful , seeing how cavalier had been the captain 's answer ."
But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd .
"Then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side ."
"I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand ."
"He was whistling `` Come , Lasses and Lads . ''"
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll .
"What with the steepness of the incline , the thick tree stumps , and the soft sand , he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays ."
"But he stuck to it like a man in silence , and at last arrived before the captain , whom he saluted in the handsomest style ."
"He was tricked out in his best ; an immense blue coat , thick with brass buttons , hung as low as to his knees , and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head ."
"`` Here you are , my man , '' said the captain , raising his head ."
`` You had better sit down . ''
"`` You ai n't a-going to let me inside , cap'n ? ''"
complained Long John .
"`` It 's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand . ''"
"`` Why , Silver , '' said the captain , `` if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley ."
It 's your own doing .
"You 're either my ship 's cook -- and then you were treated handsome -- or Cap'n Silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang ! ''"
"`` Well , well , cap'n , '' returned the sea-cook , sitting down as he was bidden on the sand , `` you 'll have to give me a hand up again , that 's all ."
Susan wandered by with a hoe in her hand and her second best bonnet on her head .
`` I have just finished reading a piece in the Enterprise which told of a couple being married in an aeroplane .
"Do you think it would be legal , doctor dear ? ''"
she inquired anxiously .
"`` I think so , '' said the doctor gravely ."
"`` Well , '' said Susan dubiously , `` it seems to me that a wedding is too solemn for anything so giddy as an aeroplane ."
But nothing is the same as it used to be .
"Well , it is half an hour yet before prayer-meeting time , so I am going around to the kitchen garden to have a little evening hate with the weeds ."
But all the time I am strafing them I will be thinking about this new worry in the Trentino .
"I do not like this Austrian caper , Mrs. Dr. dear . ''"
"`` Nor I , '' said Mrs. Blythe ruefully ."
`` All the forenoon I preserved rhubarb with my hands and waited for the war news with my soul .
When it came I shrivelled .
"Well , I suppose I must go and get ready for the prayer-meeting , too . ''"
"Every village has its own little unwritten history , handed down from lip to lip through the generations , of tragic , comic , and dramatic events ."
"They are told at weddings and festivals , and rehearsed around winter firesides ."
And in these oral annals of Glen St. Mary the tale of the union prayer-meeting held that night in the Methodist Church was destined to fill an imperishable place .
The union prayer-meeting was Mr. Arnold 's idea .
"The county battalion , which had been training all winter in Charlottetown , was to leave shortly for overseas ."
"The Four Winds Harbour boys belonging to it from the Glen and over-harbour and Harbour Head and Upper Glen were all home on their last leave , and Mr. Arnold thought , properly enough , that it would be a fitting thing to hold a union prayer-meeting for them before they went away ."
"Mr. Meredith having agreed , the meeting was announced to be held in the Methodist Church ."
"Glen prayer-meetings were not apt to be too well attended , but on this particular evening the Methodist Church was crowded ."
Everybody who could go was there .
Even Miss Cornelia came -- and it was the first time in her life that Miss Cornelia had ever set foot inside a Methodist Church .
It took no less than a world conflict to bring that about .
"`` I used to hate Methodists , '' said Miss Cornelia calmly , when her husband expressed surprise over her going , `` but I do n't hate them now ."
There is no sense in hating Methodists when there is a Kaiser or a Hindenburg in the world . ''
So Miss Cornelia went .
Norman Douglas and his wife went too .
"And Whiskers-on-the-moon strutted up the aisle to a front pew , as if he fully realized what a distinction he conferred upon the building ."
"People were somewhat surprised that he should be there , since he usually avoided all assemblages connected in any way with the war ."
"But Mr. Meredith had said that he hoped his session would be well represented , and Mr. Pryor had evidently taken the request to heart ."
"And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road , the horse galloped on ."
"By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains , and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter 's net ."
"` Get down and cut the meshes of the net , and set the poor bird free , ' said the horse ."
"` But it will take so long , ' objected Jose , ` and we may miss the princess . '"
"` Never mind that ; do not lose a chance of helping others , ' answered the horse ."
"And when the meshes were cut , and the eagle was free , the horse galloped on ."
"The had ridden many miles , and at last they came to a river , where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand , and the horse said : ` Do you see that little fish ?"
It will die if you do not put it back in the water . '
"` But , really , we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this ! '"
cried Jose .
"` We never waste time when we are helping others , ' answered the horse ."
And soon the little fish was swimming happily away .
"A little while after they reached a castle , which was built in the middle of a very thick wood , and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens ."
"` Now listen , ' said the horse . '"
"I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips , which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor ."
"Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way , and you must help her to mount ."
"When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick , and you must say that I have never carried a woman before , and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me ."
Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king 's palace . '
"Jose did exactly as the horse told him , and everything fell out as the animal prophesied ; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive ."
"She said nothing , however , but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens , and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground ."
"` Oh , I have let fall my bran ! '"
cried she ; ` please get down and pick it up for me . '
But Jose only answered : ` We shall find plenty of bran where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"They were now passing through a forest , and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards , so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree ."
` Dear me ; how stupid !
"I have let my handkerchief blow away , ' said she ."
` Will you climb up and get it for me ? '
But Jose answered : ` We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"After the wood they reached a river , and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water ."
"` How careless of me , ' gasped she , beginning to sob . '"
But you look more like your great grandfather West than the MacAllisters .
He died of a paralytic stroke quite early in life . ''
`` Did you see anybody at the store ? ''
"asked Rilla desperately , in the faint hope of directing Susan 's conversation into more agreeable channels ."
"`` Nobody except Mary Vance , '' said Susan , `` and she was stepping round as brisk as the Irishman 's flea . ''"
What terrible similes Susan used !
Would Kenneth think she acquired them from the family !
"`` To hear Mary talk about Miller Douglas you would think he was the only Glen boy who had enlisted , '' Susan went on ."
"`` But of course she always did brag and she has some good qualities I am willing to admit , though I did not think so that time she chased Rilla here through the village with a dried codfish till the poor child fell , heels over head , into the puddle before Carter Flagg 's store . ''"
Rilla went cold all over with wrath and shame .
Were there any more disgraceful scenes in her past that Susan could rake up ?
"As for Ken , he could have howled over Susan 's speeches , but he would not so insult the duenna of his lady , so he sat with a preternaturally solemn face which seemed to poor Rilla a haughty and offended one ."
"`` I paid eleven cents for a bottle of ink tonight , '' complained Susan ."
`` Ink is twice as high as it was last year .
Perhaps it is because Woodrow Wilson has been writing so many notes .
It must cost him considerable .
My cousin Sophia says Woodrow Wilson is not the man she expected him to be -- but then no man ever was .
"Being an old maid , I do not know much about men and have never pretended to , but my cousin Sophia is very hard on them , although she married two of them , which you might think was a fair share ."
"Albert Crawford 's chimney blew down in that big gale we had last week , and when Sophia heard the bricks clattering on the roof she thought it was a Zeppelin raid and went into hysterics ."
And Mrs. Albert Crawford says that of the two things she would have preferred the Zeppelin raid . ''
Rilla sat limply in her chair like one hypnotized .
She knew Susan would stop talking when she was ready to stop and that no earthly power could make her stop any sooner .
"As a rule , she was very fond of Susan but just now she hated her with a deadly hatred ."
It was ten o'clock .
Ken would soon have to go -- the others would soon be home -- and she had not even had a chance to explain to Ken that Fred Arnold filled no blank in her life nor ever could .
Her rainbow castle lay in ruins round her .
Kenneth got up at last .
"He realized that Susan was there to stay as long as he did , and it was a three mile walk to Martin West 's over-harbour ."
"He wondered if Rilla had put Susan up to this , not wanting to be left alone with him , lest he say something Fred Arnold 's sweetheart did not want to hear ."
"Rilla got up , too , and walked silently the length of the veranda with him ."
"They stood there for a moment , Ken on the lower step ."
The step was half sunk into the earth and mint grew thickly about and over its edge .
"` It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her , and if he returns without finding her , his head will be the forfeit ."
"Either way , he will be out of MY path . '"
"So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king , to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance ."
"The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay , and bade him state what he had to say , and to be quick about it ."
"` Oh , sire !"
"the Princess Bella-Flor -- ' answered the man , and then stopped as if afraid ."
` What of the Princess Bella-Flor ? '
asked the king impatiently . '
I have heard -- it is whispered at court -- that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding . ' '
"I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me , ' cried the king , eagerly ."
"` Speak on , knave ; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret ? '"
"` It is not I , but my brother , who knows , ' replied the traitor ; ` if your majesty would ask him -- ' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall ."
"` Order Jose to appear before me instantly , ' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders , so great was the noise his majesty had made ; and when Jose entered the hall , wondering what in the world could be the matter , the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement ."
"` Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment , ' stammered he , ` for if you return without her I will have you drowned ! '"
"And without another word he left the hall , leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror ."
` How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her ? '
thought he .
"` But it is no use staying here , for I shall only be put to death . '"
And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse .
"There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls , and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other , wondering which he should choose , when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach ."
"` Take me , ' it said in a gentle whisper , ` and all will go well . '"
Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk .
Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable .
"He was about to mount on his back , when the animal spoke again : ` Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there , and put them in your pocket . '"
"Jose did as he was told , and being in a great hurry to get away , asked no questions , but swung himself into the saddle ."
"They rode far without meeting any adventures , but at length they came to an ant-hill , and the horse stopped ."
"` Crumble those three loaves for the ants , ' he said ."
But Jose hesitated .
"` Why , we may want them ourselves ! '"
answered he .
` Never mind that ; give them to the ants all the same .
Do not lose a chance of helping others . '
"So they both shouted till they were hoarse , yet nothing answered but the frogs in full chorus ."
"`` There is another tall tree over there , perhaps that 's the one , '' said Nan , whose heart sunk within her , though she still spoke bravely ."
`` I do n't think I can go any more ; my boots are so heavy I ca n't pull 'em ; '' and Robby sat down on a stone quite worn out .
`` Then we must stay here all night .
"I do n't care much , if snakes do n't come . ''"
`` I 'm frightened of snakes .
I ca n't stay all night .
"Oh , dear !"
"I do n't like to be lost , '' and Rob puckered up his face to cry , when suddenly a thought occurred to him , and he said , in a tone of perfect confidence , `` Marmar will come and find me she always does ; I ai n't afraid now . ''"
`` She wo n't know where we are . ''
"`` She did n't know I was shut up in the ice-house , but she found me ."
"I know she 'll come , '' returned Robby , so trustfully , that Nan felt relieved , and sat down by him , saying , with a remorseful sigh , `` I wish we had n't run away . ''"
"`` You made me ; but I do n't mind much Marmar will love me just the same , '' answered Rob , clinging to his sheet-anchor when all other hope was gone ."
`` I 'm so hungry .
"Let 's eat our berries , '' proposed Nan , after a pause , during which Rob began to nod ."
"`` So am I , but I ca n't eat mine , 'cause I told Marmar I 'd keep them all for her . ''"
"`` You 'll have to eat them if no one comes for us , '' said Nan , who felt like contradicting every thing just then ."
"`` If we stay here a great many days , we shall eat up all the berries in the field , and then we shall starve , '' she added grimly ."
`` I shall eat sassafras .
"I know a big tree of it , and Dan told me how squirrels dig up the roots and eat them , and I love to dig , '' returned Rob , undaunted by the prospect of starvation ."
"`` Yes ; and we can catch frogs , and cook them ."
"My father ate some once , and he said they were nice , '' put in Nan , beginning to find a spice of romance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture ."
`` How could we cook frogs ?
we have n't got any fire . ''
"`` I do n't know ; next time I 'll have matches in my pocket , '' said Nan , rather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frog-cookery ."
`` Could n't we light a fire with a fire-fly ? ''
"asked Rob , hopefully , as he watched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks ."
"`` Let 's try ; '' and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the flies , and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two ."
"`` It 's a lie to call them fire-flies when there is n't a fire in them , '' Nan said , throwing one unhappy insect away with scorn , though it shone its best , and obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent little experimenters ."
"`` Marmar 's a good while coming , '' said Rob , after another pause , during which they watched the stars overhead , smelt the sweet fern crushed under foot , and listened to the crickets ' serenade ."
"`` I do n't see why God made any night ; day is so much pleasanter , '' said Nan , thoughtfully ."
"`` It 's to sleep in , '' answered Rob , with a yawn ."
He would have elected to bear any suffering if by so doing he could have freed her from the nightmare dread of Harmon 's returning to claim her .
That dread had always hung over her and now it must be intensified to agony by her love for another man .
And he could do nothing -- nothing .
He groaned aloud in his helplessness .
One evening in late November Alan flung aside his pen and yielded to the impulse that urged him to the lake shore .
He did not mean to seek Lynde -- he would go to a part of the shore where there would be no likelihood of meeting her .
But get away by himself he must .
A November storm was raging and there would be a certain satisfaction in breasting its buffets and fighting his way through it .
"Besides , he knew that Isabel King was in the house and he dreaded meeting her ."
"Since his conviction that she had written that letter to Lynde , he could not tolerate the girl and it tasked his self-control to keep from showing his contempt openly ."
Perhaps Isabel felt it beneath all his outward courtesy .
At least she did not seek his society as she had formerly done .
It was the second day of the storm ; a wild northeast gale was blowing and cold rain and freezing sleet fell in frequent showers .
Alan shivered as he came out into its full fury on the lake shore .
At first he could not see the water through the driving mist .
"Then it cleared away for a moment and he stopped short , aghast at the sight which met his eyes ."
"Opposite him was a long low island known as Philip 's Point , dwindling down at its northeastern side to two long narrow bars of quicksand ."
Alan 's horrified eyes saw a small schooner sunk between the bars ; her hull was entirely under water and in the rigging clung one solitary figure .
So much he saw before the Point was blotted out in a renewed downpour of sleet .
"Without a moment 's hesitation Alan turned and ran for Four Winds , which was only about a quarter of a mile away around a headland ."
"With the Captain 's assistance , something might be done ."
Other help could not be obtained before darkness would fall and then it would be impossible to do anything .
"He dashed up the steps of Four Winds and met Emily , who had flung the door open ."
Behind her was Lynde 's pale face with its alarmed questioning eyes .
`` Where is the Captain ? ''
gasped Alan .
`` There 's a vessel on Philip 's Point and one man at least on her . ''
"`` The Captain 's away on a cruise , '' said Emily blankly ."
`` He went three days ago . ''
"`` Then nothing can be done , '' said Alan despairingly ."
`` It will be dark long before I can get to the village . ''
"Lynde stepped out , tying a shawl around her head ."
"Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle ; the rest rode in pursuit ; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground , and it was plain their quarry would escape them ."
"Hatch , roaring an oath , put his horse at the hedge , to head him off ; but the beast refused , and sent his rider sprawling in the dust ."
"And though he was up again in a moment , and had caught the bridle , the time had gone by , and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture ."
The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton .
"Instead of starting in a vain pursuit , he had whipped his crossbow from his back , bent it , and set a quarrel to the string ; and now , when the others had desisted , he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot ."
`` Shoot !
shoot ! ''
"cried the priest , with sanguinary violence ."
"`` Cover him , Master Dick , '' said Bennet ."
`` Bring me him down like a ripe apple . ''
The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety ; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill ; and the man ran slower in proportion .
"What with the greyness of the falling night , and the uneven movements of the runner , it was no easy aim ; and as Dick levelled his bow , he felt a kind of pity , and a half desire that he might miss ."
The quarrel sped .
"The man stumbled and fell , and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers ."
But they were counting their corn before the harvest .
"The man fell lightly ; he was lightly afoot again , turned and waved his cap in a bravado , and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood ."
`` And the plague go with him ! ''
cried Bennet .
"`` He has thieves ' heels ; he can run , by St Banbury !"
"But you touched him , Master Shelton ; he has stolen your quarrel , may he never have good I grudge him less ! ''"
"`` Nay , but what made he by the church ? ''"
asked Sir Oliver .
`` I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here .
"Clipsby , good fellow , get ye down from your horse , and search thoroughly among the yews . ''"
Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper .
"`` This writing was pinned to the church door , '' he said , handing it to the parson ."
"`` I found naught else , sir parson . ''"
"`` Now , by the power of Mother Church , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` but this runs hard on sacrilege !"
"For the king 's good pleasure , or the lord of the manor -- well !"
"But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door -- nay , it runs hard on sacrilege , hard ; and men have burned for matters of less weight ."
But what have we here ?
The light falls apace .
"`` Then I shall send him right home , '' said Daisy , with decision ."
"`` People do n't do so at parties , it is n't proper . ''"
`` I shall never ask him any more . ''
`` That would do .
"He 'd be sorry not to come to the dinner-ball , would n't he ? ''"
`` I guess he would !
"we 'll have the splendidest things ever seen , wo n't we ?"
"Real soup with a ladle and a tureem -LSB- she meant tureen -RSB- and a little bird for turkey , and gravy , and all kinds of nice vegytubbles . ''"
"Daisy never could say vegetables properly , and had given up trying ."
"`` It is ` most three , and we ought to dress , '' said Nan , who had arranged a fine costume for the occasion , and was anxious to wear it ."
"`` I am the mother , so I sha n't dress up much , '' said Daisy , putting on a night-cap ornamented with a red bow , one of her aunt 's long skirts , and a shawl ; a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed her toilette , making a plump , rosy little matron of her ."
"Nan had a wreath of artificial flowers , a pair of old pink slippers , a yellow scarf , a green muslin skirt , and a fan made of feathers from the duster ; also , as a last touch of elegance , a smelling-bottle without any smell in it ."
"`` I am the daughter , so I rig up a good deal , and I must sing and dance , and talk more than you do ."
"The mothers only get the tea and be proper , you know . ''"
"A sudden very loud knock caused Miss Smith to fly into a chair , and fan herself violently , while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa , and tried to look quite calm and `` proper . ''"
"Little Bess , who was on a visit , acted the part of maid , and opened the door , saying with a smile , `` Wart in , gemplemun ; it 's all weady . ''"
"In honor of the occasion , the boys wore high paper collars , tall black hats , and gloves of every color and material , for they were an afterthought , and not a boy among them had a perfect pair ."
"`` Good day , mum , '' said Demi , in a deep voice , which was so hard to keep up that his remarks had to be extremely brief ."
"Every one shook hands and then sat down , looking so funny , yet so sober , that the gentlemen forgot their manners , and rolled in their chairs with laughter ."
"`` Oh , do n't ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Smith , much distressed ."
"`` You ca n't ever come again if you act so , '' added Miss Smith , rapping Mr. Bangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest ."
"`` I ca n't help it , you look so like fury , '' gasped Mr. Bangs , with most uncourteous candor ."
"`` So do you , but I should n't be so rude as to say so ."
"He sha n't come to the dinner-ball , shall he , Daisy ? ''"
"cried Nan , indignantly ."
`` I think we had better dance now .
"Did you bring your fiddle , sir ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Smith , trying to preserve her polite composure ."
"`` It is outside the door , '' and Nat went to get it ."
"`` Better have tea first , '' proposed the unabashed Tommy , winking openly at Demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured , the sooner they could escape ."
"`` No , we never have supper first ; and if you do n't dance well you wo n't have any supper at all , not one bit , sir , '' said Mrs. Smith , so sternly that her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with , and grew overwhelmingly civil all at once ."
"There 's nothing to do , child , except go and see Mr. Harrison about it ."
We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he does n't want to take the money .
She is just as good as his . ''
"`` I 'm sure he 'll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it , though , '' moaned Anne ."
`` I daresay he will .
He seems to be an irritable sort of a man .
I 'll go and explain to him if you like . ''
"`` No , indeed , I 'm not as mean as that , '' exclaimed Anne ."
`` This is all my fault and I 'm certainly not going to let you take my punishment .
I 'll go myself and I 'll go at once .
"The sooner it 's over the better , for it will be terribly humiliating . ''"
Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door .
On the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning ... a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts .
"Anne had intended it for Friday evening , when the youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society ."
But what were they compared to the justly offended Mr. Harrison ?
"Anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man , especially one who had to do his own cooking , and she promptly popped it into a box ."
She would take it to Mr. Harrison as a peace offering .
"`` That is , if he gives me a chance to say anything at all , '' she thought ruefully , as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields , golden in the light of the dreamy August evening ."
`` I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution . ''
"III Mr. Harrison at Home Mr. Harrison 's house was an old-fashioned , low-eaved , whitewashed structure , set against a thick spruce grove ."
"Mr. Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda , in his shirt sleeves , enjoying his evening pipe ."
"When he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet , bolted into the house , and shut the door ."
"This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise , mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before ."
But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne 's heart .
"`` If he 's so cross now what will he be when he hears what I 've done , '' she reflected miserably , as she rapped at the door ."
"But Mr. Harrison opened it , smiling sheepishly , and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly , if somewhat nervous ."
"He had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat ; he offered Anne a very dusty chair very politely , and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes ."
"No sooner had Anne seated herself than Ginger exclaimed , `` Bless my soul , what 's that redheaded snippet coming here for ? ''"
"It would be hard to say whose face was the redder , Mr. Harrison 's or Anne 's ."
"`` Do n't you mind that parrot , '' said Mr. Harrison , casting a furious glance at Ginger ."
`` He 's ... he 's always talking nonsense .
I got him from my brother who was a sailor .
"`` Oh , dear !"
"you said you 'd take good care of me , '' he sighed , as the sun seemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden ."
`` Well I am taking good care of you as hard as I can .
"Do n't be cross , child ; I 'll go in a minute , '' said Nan , who considered five-year-old Robby a mere infant compared to herself ."
"So little Rob sat looking anxiously about him , and waiting patiently , for , spite of some misgivings , he felt great confidence in Nan ."
"`` I guess it 's going to be night pretty soon , '' he observed , as if to himself , as a mosquito bit him , and the frogs in a neighboring marsh began to pipe up for the evening concert ."
`` My goodness me !
so it is .
"Come right away this minute , or they will be gone , '' cried Nan , looking up from her work , and suddenly perceiving that the sun was down ."
"`` I heard a horn about an hour ago ; may be they were blowing for us , '' said Rob , trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill ."
`` Where was it ? ''
"asked Nan , stopping short ."
`` Over that way ; '' he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely wrong direction .
"`` Let 's go that way and meet them ; '' and Nan wheeled about , and began to trot through the bushes , feeling a trifle anxious , for there were so many cow-paths all about she could not remember which way they came ."
"On they went over stock and stone again , pausing now and then to listen for the horn , which did not blow any more , for it was only the moo of a cow on her way home ."
`` I do n't remember seeing that pile of stones do you ? ''
"asked Nan , as she sat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation ."
"`` I do n't remember any thing , but I want to go home , '' and Rob 's voice had a little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him gently down , saying , in her most capable way , `` I 'm going just as fast as I can , dear ."
"Do n't cry , and when we come to the road , I 'll carry you . ''"
`` Where is the road ? ''
and Robby wiped his eyes to look for it .
`` Over by that big tree .
Do n't you know that 's the one Ned tumbled out of ? ''
`` So it is .
May be they waited for us ; I 'd like to ride home would n't you ? ''
and Robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the great pasture .
"`` No , I 'd rather walk , '' answered Nan , feeling quite sure that she would be obliged to do so , and preparing her mind for it ."
"Another long trudge through the fast-deepening twilight and another disappointment , for when they reached the tree , they found to their dismay that it was not the one Ned climbed , and no road anywhere appeared ."
`` Are we lost ? ''
"quavered Rob , clasping his pail in despair ."
`` Not much .
"I do n't just see which way to go , and I guess we 'd better call . ''"
Do not let yourself slump like poor Cousin Sophia .
"She said , when the word came , ` Ah , it is nothing but a rift in the clouds ."
We are up this week but we will be down the next . '
"` Well , Sophia Crawford , ' said I , -- for I will never give in to her , Mrs. Dr. dear -- ` God himself can not make two hills without a hollow between them , as I have heard it said , but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them . '"
But Cousin Sophia moaned on .
"` Here is the Gallipolly expedition a failure and the Grand Duke Nicholas sent off , and everyone knows the Czar of Rooshia is a pro-German and the Allies have no ammunition and Bulgaria is going against us ."
"And the end is not yet , for England and France must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes . ' '"
"I think myself , ' I said , ` that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud , and it seems to me that the Huns should have a few sins to repent of also . '"
"` They are instruments in the hands of the Almighty , to purge the garner , ' said Sophia ."
"And then I got mad , Mrs. Dr. dear , and told her I did not and never would believe that the Almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever , and that I did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of Holy Writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation ."
"She was not , I told her , a minister or even an elder ."
"And for the time being I squelched her , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
Cousin Sophia has no spirit .
"She is very different from her niece , Mrs. Dean Crawford over-harbour ."
You know the Dean Crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy .
"All the connection and especially Dean Crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl ; but Mrs. Dean just laughed and said , ` Everywhere I went this summer I saw the sign `` MEN WANTED '' staring me in the face ."
Do you think I could go and have a girl under such circumstances ? '
"There is spirit for you , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
But Cousin Sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder . ''
"Cousin Sophia had full range for her pessimism that gloomy autumn , and even Susan , incorrigible old optimist as she was , was hard put to it for cheer ."
"When Bulgaria lined up with Germany Susan only remarked scornfully , `` One more nation anxious for a licking , '' but the Greek tangle worried her beyond her powers of philosophy to endure calmly ."
"`` Constantine of Greece has a German wife , Mrs. Dr. dear , and that fact squelches hope ."
To think that I should have lived to care what kind of a wife Constantine of Greece had !
The miserable creature is under his wife 's thumb and that is a bad place for any man to be .
I am an old maid and an old maid has to be independent or she will be squashed out .
"But if I had been a married woman , Mrs. Dr. dear , I would have been meek and humble ."
It is my opinion that this Sophia of Greece is a minx . ''
Susan was furious when the news came that Venizelos had met with defeat .
"`` I could spank Constantine and skin him alive afterwards , that I could , '' she exclaimed bitterly ."
"`` Oh , Susan , I 'm surprised at you , '' said the doctor , pulling a long face ."
`` Have you no regard for the proprieties ?
Skin him alive by all means but omit the spanking . ''
Jem and Walter were yours but Shirley is mine .
And I can not bear to think of him flying -- his machine crashing down -- the life crushed out of his body -- the dear little body I nursed and cuddled when he was a wee baby . ''
"`` Susan -- do n't , '' cried Anne ."
"`` Oh , Mrs. Dr. dear , I beg your pardon ."
I ought not to have said anything like that out loud .
I sometimes forget that I resolved to be a heroine .
This -- this has shaken me a little .
But I will not forget myself again .
Only if things do not go as smoothly in the kitchen for a few days I hope you will make due allowance for me .
"At least , '' said poor Susan , forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing , `` at least flying is a clean job ."
"He will not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches , and that is well , for he has always been a tidy child . ''"
"So Shirley went -- not radiantly , as to a high adventure , like Jem , not in a white flame of sacrifice , like Walter , but in a cool , business-like mood , as of one doing something , rather dirty and disagreeable , that had just got to be done ."
"He kissed Susan for the first time since he was five years old , and said , `` Good-bye , Susan -- mother Susan . ''"
"`` My little brown boy -- my little brown boy , '' said Susan ."
"`` I wonder , '' she thought bitterly , as she looked at the doctor 's sorrowful face , `` if you remember how you spanked him once when he was a baby ."
I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now . ''
The doctor did not remember the old discipline .
But before he put on his hat to go out on his round of calls he stood for a moment in the great silent living-room that had once been full of children 's laughter .
"`` Our last son -- our last son , '' he said aloud ."
"`` A good , sturdy , sensible lad , too ."
Always reminded me of my father .
I suppose I ought to be proud that he wanted to go -- I was proud when Jem went -- even when Walter went -- but ` our house is left us desolate . ' ''
"`` I have been thinking , doctor , '' old Sandy of the Upper Glen said to him that afternoon , `` that your house will be seeming very big the day . ''"
Highland Sandy 's quaint phrase struck the doctor as perfectly expressive .
Ingleside did seem very big and empty that night .
"Yet Shirley had been away all winter except for week-ends , and had always been a quiet fellow even when home ."
Was it because he had been the only one left that his going seemed to leave such a huge blank -- that every room seemed vacant and deserted -- that the very trees on the lawn seemed to be trying to comfort each other with caresses of freshly-budding boughs for the loss of the last of the little lads who had romped under them in childhood ?
Susan worked very hard all day and late into the night .
"When she had wound the kitchen clock and put Dr. Jekyll out , none too gently , she stood for a little while on the doorstep , looking down the Glen , which lay tranced in faint , silvery light from a sinking young moon ."
But Susan did not see the familiar hills and harbour .
She was looking at the aviation camp in Kingsport where Shirley was that night .
"`` He called me ` Mother Susan , ' '' she was thinking ."
`` And I wish I did n't have to go to sleep .
"It is hideous to go to sleep and forget it for a little while , and wake up and have it all rush over me anew the next morning ."
"Do people ever get used to things like this , Susan ?"
"And oh , Susan , I ca n't get away from what Mrs. Reese said ."
Did Walter suffer much -- he was always so sensitive to pain .
"Oh , Susan , if I knew that he did n't I think I could gather up a little courage and strength . ''"
This merciful knowledge was given to Rilla .
"A letter came from Walter 's commanding officer , telling them that he had been killed instantly by a bullet during a charge at Courcelette ."
The same day there was a letter for Rilla from Walter himself .
"Rilla carried it unopened to Rainbow Valley and read it there , in the spot where she had had her last talk with him ."
"It is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is dead -- a bitter-sweet thing , in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled ."
"For the first time since the blow had fallen Rilla felt -- a different thing from tremulous hope and faith -- that Walter , of the glorious gift and the splendid ideals , still lived , with just the same gift and just the same ideals ."
That could not be destroyed -- these could suffer no eclipse .
"The personality that had expressed itself in that last letter , written on the eve of Courcelette , could not be snuffed out by a German bullet ."
"It must carry on , though the earthly link with things of earth were broken ."
"`` We 're going over the top tomorrow , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' wrote Walter ."
"`` I wrote mother and Di yesterday , but somehow I feel as if I must write you tonight ."
I had n't intended to do any writing tonight -- but I 've got to .
"Do you remember old Mrs. Tom Crawford over-harbour , who was always saying that it was ` laid on her ' to do such and such a thing ?"
"Well , that is just how I feel ."
"It 's ` laid on me ' to write you tonight -- you , sister and chum of mine ."
"There are some things I want to say before -- well , before tomorrow ."
`` You and Ingleside seem strangely near me tonight .
It 's the first time I 've felt this since I came .
Always home has seemed so far away -- so hopelessly far away from this hideous welter of filth and blood .
But tonight it is quite close to me -- it seems to me I can almost see you -- hear you speak .
And I can see the moonlight shining white and still on the old hills of home .
It has seemed to me ever since I came here that it was impossible that there could be calm gentle nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world .
"But tonight somehow , all the beautiful things I have always loved seem to have become possible again -- and this is good , and makes me feel a deep , certain , exquisite happiness ."
"It must be autumn at home now -- the harbour is a-dream and the old Glen hills blue with haze , and Rainbow Valley a haunt of delight with wild asters blowing all over it -- our old `` farewell-summers . ''"
I always liked that name better than ` aster ' -- it was a poem in itself .
"`` Rilla , you know I 've always had premonitions ."
"They liked this , and played hard till bedtime , when most of them turned in and slept like dormice ."
"Dan , however , had a plan in his head , and when he and Nat were alone , he unfolded it ."
`` Look here ! ''
"he said , taking from under his bed a bottle , a cigar , and a pack of cards , `` I 'm going to have some fun , and do as I used to with the fellows in town ."
"Here 's some beer , I got if of the old man at the station , and this cigar ; you can pay for 'em or Tommy will , he 's got heaps of money and I have n't a cent ."
"I 'm going to ask him in ; no , you go , they wo n't mind you . ''"
"`` The folks wo n't like it , '' began Nat ."
`` They wo n't know .
"Daddy Bhaer is away , and Mrs. Bhaer 's busy with Ted ; he 's got croup or something , and she ca n't leave him ."
"We sha n't sit up late or make any noise , so where 's the harm ? ''"
"`` Asia will know if we burn the lamp long , she always does . ''"
"`` No , she wo n't , I 've got a dark lantern on purpose ; it do n't give much light , and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming , '' said Dan ."
"This idea struck Nat as a fine one , and lent an air of romance to the thing ."
"He started off to tell Tommy , but put his head in again to say , `` You want Demi , too , do n't you ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ; the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him ."
"He will be asleep , so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again . ''"
"Nat obeyed , and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed , rather tousled about the head and very sleepy , but quite ready for fun as usual ."
"`` Now , keep quiet , and I 'll show you how to play a first-rate game called ` Poker , ' '' said Dan , as the three revellers gathered round the table , on which were set forth the bottle , the cigar , and the cards ."
"`` First we 'll all have a drink , then we 'll take a go at the ` weed , ' and then we 'll play ."
"That 's the way men do , and it 's jolly fun . ''"
"The beer circulated in a mug , and all three smacked their lips over it , though Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff ."
"The cigar was worse still , but they dared not say so , and each puffed away till he was dizzy or choked , when he passed the `` weed '' on to his neighbor ."
"Dan liked it , for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance to imitate the low men who surrounded him ."
"He drank , and smoked , and swaggered as much like them as he could , and , getting into the spirit of the part he assumed , he soon began to swear under his breath for fear some one should hear him ."
`` You must n't ; it 's wicked to say ` Damn ! ' ''
"cried Tommy , who had followed his leader so far ."
"`` Oh , hang !"
"do n't you preach , but play away ; it 's part of the fun to swear . ''"
"`` I 'd rather say ` thunder turtles , ' '' said Tommy , who had composed this interesting exclamation and was very proud of it ."
"`` And I 'll say ` The Devil ; ' that sounds well , '' added Nat , much impressed by Dan 's manly ways ."
"Dan scoffed at their `` nonsense , '' and swore stoutly as he tried to teach them the new game ."
"But Tommy was very sleepy , and Nat 's head began to ache with the beer and the smoke , so neither of them was very quick to learn , and the game dragged ."
"I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it ; and for my part , gossip Arblaster , methinks there is some sense in this young man ."
"Shall we go hear him , indeed ?"
"Say , shall we go hear him ? ''"
"`` I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale , good Master Pirret , '' returned Arblaster ."
"`` How say ye , Tom ?"
But then the wallet is empty . ''
"`` I will pay , '' said the other -- `` I will pay ."
"I would fain see this matter out ; I do believe , upon my conscience , there is gold in it . ''"
"`` Nay , if ye get again to drinking , all is lost ! ''"
cried Tom .
"`` Gossip Arblaster , ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty , '' returned Master Pirret ."
`` Would ye be led by a hired man ?
"Fy , fy ! ''"
"`` Peace , fellow ! ''"
"said Arblaster , addressing Tom ."
`` Will ye put your oar in ?
"Truly a fine pass , when the crew is to correct the skipper ! ''"
"`` Well , then , go your way , '' said Tom ; `` I wash my hands of you . ''"
"`` Set him , then , upon his feet , '' said Master Pirret ."
`` I know a privy place where we may drink and discourse . ''
"`` If I am to walk , my friends , ye must set my feet at liberty , '' said Dick , when he had been once more planted upright like a post ."
"`` He saith true , '' laughed Pirret ."
"`` Truly , he could not walk accoutred as he is ."
"Give it a slit -- out with your knife and slit it , gossip . ''"
"Even Arblaster paused at this proposal ; but as his companion continued to insist , and Dick had the sense to keep the merest wooden indifference of expression , and only shrugged his shoulders over the delay , the skipper consented at last , and cut the cords which tied his prisoner 's feet and legs ."
"Not only did this enable Dick to walk ; but the whole network of his bonds being proportionately loosened , he felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely , and could hope , with time and trouble , to entirely disengage it ."
So much he owed already to the owlish silliness and greed of Master Pirret .
"That worthy now assumed the lead , and conducted them to the very same rude alehouse where Lawless had taken Arblaster on the day of the gale ."
"It was now quite deserted ; the fire was a pile of red embers , radiating the most ardent heat ; and when they had chosen their places , and the landlord had set before them a measure of mulled ale , both Pirret and Arblaster stretched forth their legs and squared their elbows like men bent upon a pleasant hour ."
"The table at which they sat , like all the others in the alehouse , consisted of a heavy , square board , set on a pair of barrels ; and each of the four curiously-assorted cronies sat at one side of the square , Pirret facing Arblaster , and Dick opposite to the common sailor ."
"`` And now , young man , '' said Pirret , `` to your tale ."
"It doth appear , indeed , that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster ; but what then ?"
`` Mostly .
"Rather a neat job , I flatter myself . ''"
`` I should say so .
What a clever fellow you are !
Any new inventions lately ? ''
"asked Frank , coming up to examine and admire ."
"`` Only an anti-snoring machine and an elbow-pad , '' answered Ralph , with a twinkle in his eye , as if reminded of something funny ."
"`` Go on , and tell about them ."
I never heard of an anti-snorer .
"Jack better have one , '' said Frank , interested at once ."
"`` Well , a rich old lady kept her family awake with that lively music , so she sent to Shirtman and Codleff for something to stop it ."
"They thought it was a good joke , and told me to see what I could do ."
"I thought it over , and got up the nicest little affair you ever saw ."
"It went over the mouth , and had a tube to fit the ear , so when the lady snored she woke herself up and stopped it ."
It suited exactly .
"I think of taking out a patent , '' concluded Ralph , joining in the boys ' laugh at the droll idea ."
`` What was the pad ? ''
"asked Frank , returning to the small model of an engine he was making ."
"`` Oh , that was a mere trifle for a man who had a tender elbow-joint and wanted something to protect it ."
"I made a little pad to fit on , and his crazy-bone was safe . ''"
"`` I planned to have you make me a new leg if this one was spoilt , '' said Jack , sure that his friend could invent anything under the sun ."
`` I 'd do my best for you .
"I made a hand for a fellow once , and that got me my place , you know , '' answered Ralph , who thought little of such mechanical trifles , and longed to be painting portraits or modelling busts , being an artist as well as an inventor ."
"Here Gus , Ed , and several other boys came in , and the conversation became general ."
"Grif , Chick , and Brickbat were three young gentlemen whose own respectable names were usually ignored , and they cheerfully answered to these nicknames ."
"As the clock struck seven , Frank , who ruled the club with a rod of iron when Chairman , took his place behind the study table ."
"Seats stood about it , and a large , shabby book lay before Gus , who was Secretary , and kept the records with a lavish expenditure of ink , to judge by the blots ."
"The members took their seats , and nearly all tilted back their chairs and put their hands in their pockets , to keep them out of mischief ; for , as every one knows , it is impossible for two lads to be near each other and refrain from tickling or pinching ."
"Frank gave three raps with an old croquet-mallet set on a short handle , and with much dignity opened the meeting ."
"`` Gentlemen , the business of the club will be attended to , and then we will discuss the question , ` Shall girls go to our colleges ? '"
The Secretary will now read the report of the last meeting . ''
"Clearing his throat , Gus read the following brief and elegant report : -- `` Club met , December 18th , at the house of G. Burton , Esq. ."
In a month it had carried Walter 's name to every corner of the globe .
"Everywhere it was copied -- in metropolitan dailies and little village weeklies -- in profound reviews and `` agony columns , '' in Red Cross appeals and Government recruiting propaganda ."
"Mothers and sisters wept over it , young lads thrilled to it , the whole great heart of humanity caught it up as an epitome of all the pain and hope and pity and purpose of the mighty conflict , crystallized in three brief immortal verses ."
A Canadian lad in the Flanders trenches had written the one great poem of the war .
"`` The Piper , '' by Pte. ."
"Walter Blythe , was a classic from its first printing ."
Rilla copied it in her diary at the beginning of an entry in which she poured out the story of the hard week that had just passed .
"`` It has been such a dreadful week , '' she wrote , `` and even though it is over and we know that it was all a mistake that does not seem to do away with the bruises left by it ."
And yet it has in some ways been a very wonderful week and I have had some glimpses of things I never realized before -- of how fine and brave people can be even in the midst of horrible suffering .
I am sure I could never be as splendid as Miss Oliver was .
`` Just a week ago today she had a letter from Mr. Grant 's mother in Charlottetown .
And it told her that a cable had just come saying that Major Robert Grant had been killed in action a few days before .
"`` Oh , poor Gertrude !"
At first she was crushed .
Then after just a day she pulled herself together and went back to her school .
"She did not cry -- I never saw her shed a tear -- but oh , her face and her eyes ! '' '"
"I must go on with my work , ' she said ."
` That is my duty just now . '
`` I could never have risen to such a height .
"`` She never spoke bitterly except once , when Susan said something about spring being here at last , and Gertrude said , '' ` Can the spring really come this year ? '"
"`` Then she laughed -- such a dreadful little laugh , just as one might laugh in the face of death , I think , and said , '' ` Observe my egotism ."
"Because I , Gertrude Oliver , have lost a friend , it is incredible that the spring can come as usual ."
"The spring does not fail because of the million agonies of others -- but for mine -- oh , can the universe go on ? ' ''"
"` Do n't feel bitter with yourself , dear , ' mother said gently ."
` It is a very natural thing to feel as if things could n't go on just the same when some great blow has changed the world for us .
We all feel like that . '
`` Then that horrid old Cousin Sophia of Susan 's piped up .
"She was sitting there , knitting and croaking like an old ` raven of bode and woe ' as Walter used to call her . ''"
"` You ai n't as bad off as some , Miss Oliver , ' she said , ` and you should n't take it so hard ."
There 's some as has lost their husbands ; that 's a hard blow ; and there 's some as has lost their sons .
You have n't lost either husband or son . ' ''
"` No , ' said Gertrude , more bitterly still ."
"And how terrible it would be to be doing something you did n't like every day for ... well , say forty years ."
"Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there , or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home ."
"Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor , and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison 's on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store ."
`` She looked like a head-on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare . ''
"The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk , puffed , frilled , and shirred wherever puff , frill , or shirring could possibly be placed ."
"Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat , bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers ."
"A veil of pink chiffon , lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots , hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her ."
"She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman , and a very strong odor of perfume attended her ."
"`` I am Mrs. DonNELL ... Mrs. H. B. DonNELL , '' announced this vision , `` and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when she came home to dinner today ."
It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY . ''
"`` I 'm sorry , '' faltered Anne , vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the Donnell children ."
`` Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell .
"Now , Miss Shirley , the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL ... accent on the last syllable ."
I hope you 'll remember this in future . ''
"`` I 'll try to , '' gasped Anne , choking back a wild desire to laugh ."
`` I know by experience that it 's very unpleasant to have one 's name SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong . ''
`` Certainly it is .
And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my son Jacob . ''
"`` He told me his name was Jacob , '' protested Anne ."
"`` I might well have expected that , '' said Mrs. H. B. Donnell , in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age ."
"`` That boy has such plebeian tastes , Miss Shirley ."
"When he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair ... it sounds SO aristocratic , does n't it ?"
But his father insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle .
"I yielded , because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor ."
"And what do you think , Miss Shirley ?"
When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own .
Did you ever hear of such ingratitude ?
"The moment the invitation to the wedding ... for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation , Miss Shirley ... came to the house I said , ` No more Jacobs for me , thank you . '"
From that day I called my son St. Clair and St. Clair I am determined he shall be called .
"His father obstinately continues to call him Jacob , and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name ."
But St. Clair he is and St. Clair he shall remain .
"You will kindly remember this , Miss Shirley , will you not ?"
"When the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away , and then everybody adjourns to the dance , the Queen walking in front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her , carrying two little pots , one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the other the juice of Solomon 's Seal ."
"Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit , and Solomon 's Seal juice is for bruises ."
"They bruise very easily , and when Peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits ."
"For , as you know without my telling you , Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra ."
"He sits in the middle of the ring , and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him ."
` P. P. ' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families .
"They are grateful little people , too , and at the princess 's coming-of-age ball -LRB- they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month -RRB- they gave him the wish of his heart ."
-LSB- Illustration : When her Majesty wants to know the time -RSB- The way it was done was this .
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"` If I chose to go back to mother , ' he asked at last , ` could you give me that wish ? '"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , ` Pooh !"
ask for a much bigger wish than that . '
` Is that quite a little wish ? '
he inquired .
"` As little as this , ' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
` What size is a big wish ? '
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , ` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . '"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way . '"
"I can give you the power to fly to her house , ' the Queen said , ` but I ca n't open the door for you . '"
"` The window I flew out at will be open , ' Peter said confidently ."
` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back . '
` How do you know ? '
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew . '"
"I just do know , ' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part , and then up he rose higher and higher , and flew away out of the Gardens and over the housetops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
We could n't make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them .
"I ca n't believe that of Mr. Blair , for he is always so quiet and meek ; but at least he had great provocation , for Marilla , when that poor man came to the door , red as a beet , with perspiration streaming down his face , he had on one of his wife 's big gingham aprons . '"
"I ca n't get this durned thing off , ' he said , ` for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I ca n't bust 'em , so you 'll have to excuse me , ladies . '"
We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down .
"Mr. Blair sat down too ; he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up , but he did look so ashamed and worried that I felt sorry for him , and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time ."
"` Oh , not at all , ' said Mr. Blair , trying to smile ... you know he is always very polite ... ` I 'm a little busy ... getting ready to bake a cake as it were ."
My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she 's gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea .
She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I 've clean forgot half the directions already .
"And it says , ` flavor according to taste . '"
What does that mean ?
How can you tell ?
And what if my taste does n't happen to be other people 's taste ?
Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake ? ''
`` I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man .
He did n't seem to be in his proper sphere at all .
I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one .
"It was on my lips to say , ` Mr. Blair , if you 'll give us a subscription for the hall I 'll mix up your cake for you . '"
But I suddenly thought it would n't be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress .
So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all .
He just jumped at my offer .
"He said he 'd been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him , and yet he hated to disappoint his wife ."
"He got me another apron , and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake ."
Mr. Blair ran about and got us the materials .
He had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought she would die to see it .
He said he could bake the cake all right ... he was used to that ... and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars .
So you see we were rewarded .
But even if he had n't given a cent I 'd always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him . ''
Theodore White 's was the next stopping place .
"Neither Anne nor Diana had ever been there before , and they had only a very slight acquaintance with Mrs. Theodore , who was not given to hospitality ."
Should they go to the back or front door ?
While they held a whispered consultation Mrs. Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers .
"Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps , and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers ."
These terrible moods come on without any cause that we know of .
Even Mother could not do anything with him when he was like that .
You must go away now -- and do not come back until his dark mood has passed .
"He will be just as glad to see you as ever then , and this will not make any difference with him ."
Do n't come back for a week at least . ''
"`` I do not like to leave you in such trouble , Miss Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , it does n't matter about me -- I have Emily ."
And there is nothing you could do .
Please go at once .
Father knows I am talking to you and that will vex him still more . ''
"Alan , realizing that he could not help her and that his presence only made matters worse , went away perplexedly ."
The following week was a miserable one for him .
His duties were distasteful to him and meeting his people a positive torture .
Sometimes Mrs. Danby looked dubiously at him and seemed on the point of saying something -- but never said it .
"Isabel King watched him when they met , with bold probing eyes ."
In his abstraction he did not notice this any more than he noticed a certain subtle change which had come over the members of his congregation -- as if a breath of suspicion had blown across them and troubled their confidence and trust .
Once Alan would have been keenly and instantly conscious of this slight chill ; now he was not even aware of it .
When he ventured to go back to Four Winds he found the Captain on the point of starting off for a cruise in his yacht .
"He was urbane and friendly , utterly ignoring the incident of Alan 's last visit and regretting that business compelled him to go down the lake ."
"Alan saw him off with small regret and turned joyfully to Lynde , who was walking under the pines with her dogs ."
"She looked pale and tired and her eyes were still troubled , but she smiled proudly and made no reference to what had happened ."
"`` I 'm going to put these flowers on Mother 's grave , '' she said , lifting her slender hands filled with late white roses ."
`` Mother loved flowers and I always keep them near her when I can .
You may come with me if you like . ''
Alan had known Lynde 's mother was buried under the pines but he had never visited the spot before .
"The grave was at the westernmost end of the pine wood , where it gave out on the lake , a beautiful spot , given over to silence and shadow ."
"`` Mother wished to be buried here , '' Lynde said , kneeling to arrange her flowers ."
`` Father would have taken her anywhere but she said she wanted to be near us and near the lake she had loved so well .
Father buried her himself .
He would n't have anyone else do anything for her .
I am so glad she is here .
It would have been terrible to have seen her taken far away -- my sweet little mother . ''
"As for me , I had n't any real objection to marrying him , after all , for if he was short of romance he was good-natured and has a fat bank account ; but I hated to be driven into it that way ."
"`` You 'd better take him , Melissa , '' I said entreatingly ."
`` I 've had one husband and that is enough . ''
"`` More than enough for me , thank you , '' said Melissa sarcastically ."
"`` Isaac is a fine man and has a lovely house ; and you are n't sure the Kingsbridge man really means anything , '' I went on ."
"`` I would rather , '' said Melissa , with the same awful calmness , `` jump down from this roof and break my neck , or be devoured piecemeal by that fiend down there than marry Isaac Appleby . ''"
It did n't seem worth while to say anything more after that .
We sat there in stony silence and the time dragged by .
"I was hot , hungry , thirsty , cross ; and besides , I felt that I was in a ridiculous position , which was worse than all the rest ."
We could see Isaac sitting in the shade of one of his apple trees in the front orchard comfortably reading a newspaper .
I think if he had n't aggravated me by doing that I 'd have given in sooner .
"But as it was , I was determined to be as stubborn as everybody else ."
We were four obstinate creatures -- Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I .
At four o'clock Isaac got up and went into the house ; in a few minutes he came out again with a basket in one hand and a ball of cord in the other .
"`` I do n't intend to starve you , of course , ladies , '' he said politely , `` I will throw this ball up to you and you can then draw up the basket . ''"
"I caught the ball , for Melissa never turned her head ."
"I would have preferred to be scornful , too , and reject the food altogether ; but I was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride in my pocket and hauled the basket up ."
"Besides , I thought it might enable us to hold out until some loophole of escape presented itself ."
Isaac went back into the house and I unpacked the basket .
"There was a bottle of milk , some bread and butter , and a pie ."
"Melissa would n't take a morsel of the food , but she was so thirsty she had to take a drink of milk ."
"She tried to lift her veil -- and something caught ; Melissa gave it a savage twitch , and off came veil and hat -- and all her front hair !"
You never saw such a sight .
"I 'd always suspected Melissa wore a false front , but I 'd never had any proof before ."
"Melissa pinned on her hair again and put on her hat and drank the milk , all without a word ; but she was purple ."
I felt sorry for her .
And I felt sorry for Isaac when I tried to eat that bread .
It was sour and dreadful .
"As for the pie , it was hopeless ."
"I tasted it , and then threw it down to Julius Caesar ."
"Julius Caesar , not being over particular , ate it up ."
"I thought perhaps it would kill him , for anything might come of eating such a concoction ."
"If we ca n't get ashore , all 's up . ''"
"`` Only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , '' I added ; `` the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off . ''"
"`` They 'll have a hot run , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Jack ashore , you know ."
It 's not them I mind ; it 's the round-shot .
Carpet bowls !
My lady 's maid could n't miss .
"Tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we 'll hold water . ''"
"In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded , and we had shipped but little water in the process ."
"We were now close in ; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her , for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees ."
The gig was no longer to be feared ; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes .
"The ebb-tide , which had so cruelly delayed us , was now making reparation and delaying our assailants ."
The one source of danger was the gun .
"`` If I durst , '' said the captain , `` I 'd stop and pick off another man . ''"
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot .
"They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade , though he was not dead , and I could see him trying to crawl away ."
`` Ready ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Hold ! ''
"cried the captain , quick as an echo ."
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water .
The report fell in at the same instant of time .
"This was the first that Jim heard , the sound of the squire 's shot not having reached him ."
"Where the ball passed , not one of us precisely knew , but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster ."
"At any rate , the boat sank by the stern , quite gently , in three feet of water , leaving the captain and myself , facing each other , on our feet ."
"The other three took complete headers , and came up again drenched and bubbling ."
So far there was no great harm .
"No lives were lost , and we could wade ashore in safety ."
"But there were all our stores at the bottom , and to make things worse , only two guns out of five remained in a state for service ."
"Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head , by a sort of instinct ."
"As for the captain , he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer , and like a wise man , lock uppermost ."
The other three had gone down with the boat .
"No captain , sir , would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that ."
"As for Mr. Arrow , I believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men are the same ; all may be for what I know ."
But I am responsible for the ship 's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her .
"I see things going , as I think , not quite right ."
And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth .
And that 's all . ''
"`` Captain Smollett , '' began the doctor with a smile , `` did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ?"
"You 'll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable ."
"When you came in here , I 'll stake my wig , you meant more than this . ''"
"`` Doctor , '' said the captain , `` you are smart ."
When I came in here I meant to get discharged .
I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word . ''
"`` No more I would , '' cried the squire ."
`` Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce .
"As it is , I have heard you ."
"I will do as you desire , but I think the worse of you . ''"
"`` That 's as you please , sir , '' said the captain ."
`` You 'll find I do my duty . ''
And with that he took his leave .
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` contrary to all my notions , I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you -- that man and John Silver . ''"
"`` Silver , if you like , '' cried the squire ; `` but as for that intolerable humbug , I declare I think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright un-English . ''"
"`` Well , '' says the doctor , `` we shall see . ''"
"When we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yo-ho-ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending ."
The new arrangement was quite to my liking .
The whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side .
"It had been originally meant that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths ."
"Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house ."
"Very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement ."
"Even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion ."
"We were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , came off in a shore-boat ."
"The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , `` So ho , mates ! ''"
says he .
Make it up to him -- show him but this chance to become wealthy -- and I will go pledge he will forgive you . ''
"So far Dick had spoken pretty much at random ; but it was now necessary , under the supervision of six eyes , to invent and tell some marvellous story , and , if it were possible , get back into his hands the all-important signet ."
To squander time was the first necessity .
"The longer his stay lasted , the more would his captors drink , and the surer should he be when he attempted his escape ."
"Well , Dick was not much of an inventor , and what he told was pretty much the tale of Ali Baba , with Shoreby and Tunstall Forest substituted for the East , and the treasures of the cavern rather exaggerated than diminished ."
"As the reader is aware , it is an excellent story , and has but one drawback -- that it is not true ; and so , as these three simple shipmen now heard it for the first time , their eyes stood out of their faces , and their mouths gaped like codfish at a fishmonger 's ."
Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale was called for ; and while Dick was still artfully spinning out the incidents a third followed the second .
"Here was the position of the parties towards the end : Arblaster , three-parts drunk and one-half asleep , hung helpless on his stool ."
"Even Tom had been much delighted with the tale , and his vigilance had abated in proportion ."
"Meanwhile , Dick had gradually wormed his right arm clear of its bonds , and was ready to risk all ."
"`` And so , '' said Pirret , `` y ' are one of these ? ''"
"`` I was made so , '' replied Dick , `` against my will ; but an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share , I should be a fool indeed to continue dwelling in a filthy cave , and standing shot and buffet like a soldier ."
Here be we four ; good !
"Let us , then , go forth into the forest to-morrow ere the sun be up ."
"Could we come honestly by a donkey , it were better ; but an we can not , we have our four strong backs , and I warrant me we shall come home staggering . ''"
Pirret licked his lips .
"`` And this magic , '' he said -- `` this password , whereby the cave is opened -- how call ye it , friend ? ''"
"`` Nay , none know the word but the three chiefs , '' returned Dick ; `` but here is your great good fortune , that , on this very evening , I should be the bearer of a spell to open it ."
It is a thing not trusted twice a year beyond the captain 's wallet . ''
`` A spell ! ''
"said Arblaster , half awakening , and squinting upon Dick with one eye ."
`` Aroint thee !
no spells !
I be a good Christian .
"Ask my man Tom , else . ''"
"`` Nay , but this is white magic , '' said Dick ."
"`` It doth naught with the devil ; only the powers of numbers , herbs , and planets . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Pirret ; '' 't is but white magic , gossip ."
"There is no sin therein , I do assure you ."
"But proceed , good youth ."
This spell -- in what should it consist ? ''
"`` Nay , that I will incontinently show you , '' answered Dick ."
"Mr. Trelawney , I 'm surprised at you , sir ."
"Doctor , I thought you had worn the king 's coat !"
"If that was how you served at Fontenoy , sir , you 'd have been better in your berth . ''"
"The doctor 's watch were all back at their loopholes , the rest were busy loading the spare muskets , and everyone with a red face , you may be certain , and a flea in his ear , as the saying is ."
The captain looked on for a while in silence .
Then he spoke .
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` I 've given Silver a broadside ."
"I pitched it in red-hot on purpose ; and before the hour 's out , as he said , we shall be boarded ."
"We 're outnumbered , I need n't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline ."
"I 've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose . ''"
"Then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear ."
"On the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five ."
"There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four piles -- tables , you might say -- one about the middle of each side , and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders ."
"In the middle , the cutlasses lay ranged ."
"`` Toss out the fire , '' said the captain ; `` the chill is past , and we must n't have smoke in our eyes . ''"
"The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney , and the embers smothered among sand ."
`` Hawkins has n't had his breakfast .
"Hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , '' continued Captain Smollett ."
"`` Lively , now , my lad ; you 'll want it before you 've done ."
"Hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands . ''"
"And while this was going on , the captain completed , in his own mind , the plan of the defence ."
"`` Doctor , you will take the door , '' he resumed ."
"`` See , and do n't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch ."
"Hunter , take the east side , there ."
"Joyce , you stand by the west , my man ."
"Mr. Trelawney , you are the best shot -- you and Gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it 's there the danger is ."
"If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty ."
"Hawkins , neither you nor I are much account at the shooting ; we 'll stand by to load and bear a hand . ''"
"As the captain had said , the chill was past ."
"As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees , it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught ."
Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house .
"Jackets and coats were flung aside , shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders ; and we stood there , each at his post , in a fever of heat and anxiety ."
"Presently Wendy took the hat , because John said it struck against his knee as he flew ; and this , as we shall see , led to mischief , for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy ."
"In the black topper the light was completely hidden , and they flew on in silence ."
"It was the stillest silence they had ever known , broken once by a distant lapping , which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford , and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together , but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives ."
Even these noises ceased .
To Michael the loneliness was dreadful .
` If only something would make a sound ! '
he cried .
"As if in answer to his request , the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard ."
The pirates had fired Long Tom at them .
"The roar of it echoed through the mountains , and the echoes seemed to cry savagely , ` Where are they , where are they , where are they ? '"
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true .
"When at last the heavens were steady again , John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness ."
"John was treading the air mechanically , and Michael without knowing how to float was floating ."
` Are you shot ? '
John whispered tremulously . '
"I have n't tried yet , ' Michael whispered back ."
We know now that no one had been hit .
"Peter , however , had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea , while Wendy was blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell ."
It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat .
"I do n't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink , or whether she had planned it on the way , but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction ."
"Tink was not all bad : or , rather , she was all bad just now , but , on the other hand , sometimes she was all good ."
"Fairies have to be one thing or the other , because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time ."
"They are , however , allowed to change , only it must be a complete change ."
At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy .
"What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand , and I believe some of it was bad words , but it sounded kind , and she flew back and forward , plainly meaning ` Follow me , and all will be well . '"
What else could poor Wendy do ?
"She called to Peter and John and Michael , and got only mocking echoes in reply ."
She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman .
"And so , bewildered , and now staggering in her flight , she followed Tink to her doom ."
"CHAPTER V THE ISLAND COME TRUE Feeling that Peter was on his way back , the Neverland had again woke into life ."
"We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened , but woke is better and was always used by Peter ."
In his absence things are usually quiet on the island .
"`` God bless you , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' he said softly and tenderly ."
After all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this .
He stood on the rear platform and waved to them as the train pulled out .
"Rilla was standing by herself , but Una Meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and held each other 's cold hands as the train rounded the curve of the wooded hill ."
Rilla spent an hour in Rainbow Valley that morning about which she never said a word to anyone ; she did not even write in her diary about it ; when it was over she went home and made rompers for Jims .
In the evening she went to a Junior Red Cross committee meeting and was severely businesslike .
"`` You would never suppose , '' said Irene Howard to Olive Kirk afterwards , `` that Walter had left for the front only this morning ."
But some people really have no depth of feeling .
I often wish I could take things as lightly as Rilla Blythe . ''
"CHAPTER XVI REALISM AND ROMANCE `` Warsaw has fallen , '' said Dr. Blythe with a resigned air , as he brought the mail in one warm August day ."
"Gertrude and Mrs. Blythe looked dismally at each other , and Rilla , who was feeding Jims a Morganized diet from a carefully sterilized spoon , laid the said spoon down on his tray , utterly regardless of germs , and said , `` Oh , dear me , '' in as tragic a tone as if the news had come as a thunderbolt instead of being a foregone conclusion from the preceding week 's dispatches ."
"They had thought they were quite resigned to Warsaw 's fall but now they knew they had , as always , hoped against hope ."
"`` Now , let us take a brace , '' said Susan ."
`` It is not the terrible thing we have been thinking .
I read a dispatch three columns long in the Montreal Herald yesterday that proved that Warsaw was not important from a military point of view at all .
"So let us take the military point of view , doctor dear . ''"
"`` I read that dispatch , too , and it has encouraged me immensely , '' said Gertrude ."
`` I knew then and I know now that it was a lie from beginning to end .
"But I am in that state of mind where even a lie is a comfort , providing it is a cheerful lie . ''"
"`` In that case , Miss Oliver dear , the German official reports ought to be all you need , '' said Susan sarcastically ."
`` I never read them now because they make me so mad I can not put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them .
Even this news about Warsaw has taken the edge off my afternoon 's plans .
Misfortunes never come singly .
I spoiled my baking of bread today -- and now Warsaw has fallen -- and here is little Kitchener bent on choking himself to death . ''
"Jims was evidently trying to swallow his spoon , germs and all ."
Rilla rescued him mechanically and was about to resume the operation of feeding him when a casual remark of her father 's sent such a shock and thrill over her that for the second time she dropped that doomed spoon .
"`` Kenneth Ford is down at Martin West 's over-harbour , '' the doctor was saying ."
"`` His regiment was on its way to the front but was held up in Kingsport for some reason , and Ken got leave of absence to come over to the Island . ''"
"`` I hope he will come up to see us , '' exclaimed Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` He only has a day or two off , I believe , '' said the doctor absently ."
Nobody noticed Rilla 's flushed face and trembling hands .
Even the most thoughtful and watchful of parents do not see everything that goes on under their very noses .
"cried Alan , `` if I make a boat , I 'll make a body to take it back again !"
"So deave me with no more of your nonsense , but walk -LRB- for that 's what you 've got to do -RRB- -- and let Alan think for ye . ''"
"All night , then , we walked through the north side of the Carse under the high line of the Ochil mountains ; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and Culross , all of which we avoided : and about ten in the morning , mighty hungry and tired , came to the little clachan of Limekilns ."
"This is a place that sits near in by the water-side , and looks across the Hope to the town of the Queensferry ."
"Smoke went up from both of these , and from other villages and farms upon all hands ."
"The fields were being reaped ; two ships lay anchored , and boats were coming and going on the Hope ."
"It was altogether a right pleasant sight to me ; and I could not take my fill of gazing at these comfortable , green , cultivated hills and the busy people both of the field and sea ."
"For all that , there was Mr. Rankeillor 's house on the south shore , where I had no doubt wealth awaited me ; and here was I upon the north , clad in poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion , with three silver shillings left to me of all my fortune , a price set upon my head , and an outlawed man for my sole company ."
"`` O , Alan ! ''"
"said I , `` to think of it !"
"Over there , there 's all that heart could want waiting me ; and the birds go over , and the boats go over -- all that please can go , but just me only !"
"O , man , but it 's a heart-break ! ''"
"In Limekilns we entered a small change-house , which we only knew to be a public by the wand over the door , and bought some bread and cheese from a good-looking lass that was the servant ."
"This we carried with us in a bundle , meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore , that we saw some third part of a mile in front ."
"As we went , I kept looking across the water and sighing to myself ; and though I took no heed of it , Alan had fallen into a muse ."
At last he stopped in the way .
`` Did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of ? ''
"says he , tapping on the bread and cheese ."
"`` To be sure , '' said I , `` and a bonny lass she was . ''"
`` Ye thought that ? ''
cries he .
"`` Man , David , that 's good news . ''"
"`` In the name of all that 's wonderful , why so ? ''"
says I. `` What good can that do ? ''
"`` Well , '' said Alan , with one of his droll looks , `` I was rather in hopes it would maybe get us that boat . ''"
"`` If it were the other way about , it would be liker it , '' said I. `` That 's all that you ken , ye see , '' said Alan ."
"`` I do n't want the lass to fall in love with ye , I want her to be sorry for ye , David ; to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty ."
Let me see '' -LRB- looking me curiously over -RRB- .
"`` I wish ye were a wee thing paler ; but apart from that ye 'll do fine for my purpose -- ye have a fine , hang-dog , rag-and-tatter , clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye , as if ye had stolen the coat from a potato-bogle ."
"Come ; right about , and back to the change-house for that boat of ours . ''"
"I followed him , laughing ."
"`` David Balfour , '' said he , `` ye 're a very funny gentleman by your way of it , and this is a very funny employ for ye , no doubt ."
"`` He 's the only boy we ever failed with , and I am so grieved , for I thought there was the making of a fine man in him , spite of his faults . ''"
"Dan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh , and he wanted to ask for one more trial himself , but his pride would not let him , and he came out with the hard look on his face , shook hands without a word , and drove away with Mr. Bhaer , leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their eyes ."
"A few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr. Page , saying that Dan was doing well , whereat they all rejoiced ."
"But three weeks later came another letter , saying that Dan had run away , and nothing had been heard of him , whereat they all looked sober , and Mr. Bhaer said , `` Perhaps I ought to have given him another chance . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer , however , nodded wisely and answered , `` Do n't be troubled , Fritz ; the boy will come back to us , I 'm sure of it . ''"
But time went on and no Dan came .
CHAPTER VII .
"NAUGHTY NAN `` Fritz , I 've got a new idea , '' cried Mrs. Bhaer , as she met her husband one day after school ."
"`` Well , my dear , what is it ? ''"
"and he waited willingly to hear the new plan , for some of Mrs. Jo 's ideas were so droll , it was impossible to help laughing at them , though usually they were quite sensible , and he was glad to carry them out ."
"`` Daisy needs a companion , and the boys would be all the better for another girl among them ; you know we believe in bringing up little men and women together , and it is high time we acted up to our belief ."
"They pet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns , and she is getting spoilt ."
"Then they must learn gentle ways , and improve their manners , and having girls about will do it better than any thing else . ''"
"`` You are right , as usual ."
"Now , who shall we have ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , seeing by the look in her eye that Mrs. Jo had some one all ready to propose ."
`` Little Annie Harding . ''
`` What !
"Naughty Nan , as the lads call her ? ''"
"cried Mr. Bhaer , looking very much amused ."
"`` Yes , she is running wild at home since her mother died , and is too bright a child to be spoilt by servants ."
"I have had my eye on her for some time , and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him why he did not send her to school ."
He said he would gladly if he could find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys .
I know he would rejoice to have her come ; so suppose we drive over this afternoon and see about it . ''
"`` Have not you cares enough now , my Jo , without this little gypsy to torment you ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , patting the hand that lay on his arm ."
"`` Oh dear , no , '' said Mother Bhaer , briskly ."
"`` I like it , and never was happier than since I had my wilderness of boys ."
"You see , Fritz , I feel a great sympathy for Nan , because I was such a naughty child myself that I know all about it ."
"She is full of spirits , and only needs to be taught what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy ."
"Those quick wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed , and what is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy , happy child ."
"I know how to manage her , for I remember how my blessed mother managed me , and -- '' `` And if you succeed half as well as she did , you will have done a magnificent work , '' interrupted Mr. Bhaer , who labored under the delusion that Mrs. B. was the best and most charming woman alive ."
"Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- , and she accepted them with a disturbing smile ."
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by and by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying ` Hsh !
what was that ? '
"Tony beseeches her , ` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! '"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
` It is coming nearer ! '
she cries .
"` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , O Tony , oh ! '"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly -- not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed . '"
"O Tony , ' she would say with awful respect , ` but the fairies will be so angry ! ' '"
"I dare say , ' replied Tony carelessly ."
"` Perhaps , ' she said , thrilling , ` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ' '"
"I shall make him , ' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They all tickled him on the shoulder -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace , and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , ` Just some day ' ; he was quite vague about which day except when she asked , ` Will it be to-day ? '"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond ; not thick enough to skate on , but at least you could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
`` No snow . ''
"`` Lawn to rake , then ? ''"
`` Not time for that yet . ''
`` Catalogue of books ? ''
`` Frank got that job . ''
`` Copy those letters for your mother ? ''
`` Take me too long .
"Must have my money Friday , if possible . ''"
"`` I do n't see what we can do , then ."
"It is too early or too late for everything , and you wo n't borrow . ''"
`` Not of you .
"No , nor of any one else , if I can possibly help it ."
"I 've promised to do this myself , and I will ; '' and Jack wagged his head resolutely ."
`` Could n't you do something with the printing-press ?
"Do me some cards , and then , perhaps , the other girls will want some , '' said Jill , as a forlorn hope ."
`` Just the thing !
What a goose I was not to think of it .
I 'll rig the old machine up at once . ''
"And , starting from his seat , Jack dived into the big closet , dragged out the little press , and fell to oiling , dusting , and putting it in order , like one relieved of a great anxiety ."
"`` Give me the types ; I 'll sort them and set up my name , so you can begin as soon as you are ready ."
You know what a help I was when we did the programmes .
"I 'm almost sure the girls will want cards , and I know your mother would like some more tags , '' said Jill , briskly rattling the letters into the different compartments , while Jack inked the rollers and hunted up his big apron , whistling the while with recovered spirits ."
"A dozen neat cards were soon printed , and Jill insisted on paying six cents for them , as earning was not borrowing ."
"A few odd tags were found and done for Mamma , who immediately ordered four dozen at six cents a dozen , though she was not told why there was such a pressing call for money ."
"Jack 's monthly half-dollar had been spent the first week , -- twenty-five cents for a concert , ten paid a fine for keeping a book too long from the library , ten more to have his knife ground , and five in candy , for he dearly loved sweeties , and was under bonds to Mamma not to spend more than five cents a month on these unwholesome temptations ."
"She never asked the boys what they did with their money , but expected them to keep account in the little books she gave them ; and , now and then , they showed the neat pages with pardonable pride , though she often laughed at the queer items ."
"All that evening Jack & Co. worked busily , for when Frank came in he good-naturedly ordered some pale-pink cards for Annette , and ran to the store to choose the right shade , and buy some packages for the young printer also ."
`` What do you suppose he is in such a pucker for ? ''
"whispered Jill , as she set up the new name , to Frank , who sat close by , with one eye on his book and one on her ."
"`` Oh , some notion ."
"He 's a queer chap ; but I guess it is n't much of a scrape , or I should know it ."
"He 's so good-natured he 's always promising to do things for people , and has too much pluck to give up when he finds he ca n't ."
"`` I do n't reckon there 'd be much amusement in it ... more worry and bother than anything else , I should say ."
It would n't be so risky if they were even as old as you were when I took you .
I would n't mind Dora so much ... she seems good and quiet .
But that Davy is a limb . ''
Anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins .
The remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still .
"She knew that Marilla 's only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty , and Anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line ."
"`` If Davy is naughty it 's all the more reason why he should have good training , is n't it , Marilla ?"
"If we do n't take them we do n't know who will , nor what kind of influences may surround them ."
"Suppose Mrs. Keith 's next door neighbors , the Sprotts , were to take them ."
Mrs. Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you ca n't believe a word his children say .
Would n't it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that ?
Or suppose they went to the Wiggins ' .
Mrs. Lynde says that Mr. Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk .
"You would n't like your relations to be starved , even if they were only third cousins , would you ?"
"It seems to me , Marilla , that it is our duty to take them . ''"
"`` I suppose it is , '' assented Marilla gloomily ."
`` I daresay I 'll tell Mary I 'll take them .
"You need n't look so delighted , Anne ."
It will mean a good deal of extra work for you .
"I ca n't sew a stitch on account of my eyes , so you 'll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes ."
And you do n't like sewing . ''
"`` I hate it , '' said Anne calmly , `` but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty ."
It does people good to have to do things they do n't like ... in moderation . ''
"VIII Marilla Adopts Twins Mrs. Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window , knitting a quilt , just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when Matthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what Mrs. Rachel called `` his imported orphan . ''"
"But that had been in springtime ; and this was late autumn , and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown ."
The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill .
Mrs. Rachel peered at it eagerly .
"`` There 's Marilla getting home from the funeral , '' she said to her husband , who was lying on the kitchen lounge ."
"Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do , but Mrs. Rachel , who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household , had not as yet noticed this ."
"`` And she 's got the twins with her , ... yes , there 's Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony 's tail and Marilla jerking him back ."
Dora 's sitting up on the seat as prim as you please .
"`` A much larger share than mine , '' said Alan , smiling ."
"`` If Pat had not come for me , I would not have known of your danger ."
What a magnificent fellow he is ! ''
`` Is n't he ? ''
she agreed proudly .
"`` And so is Laddie , my other dog ."
He went with Father today .
I love my dogs more than people . ''
She looked at him with a little defiance in her eyes .
`` I suppose you think that terrible . ''
"`` I think many dogs are much more lovable -- and worthy of love -- than many people , '' said Alan , laughing ."
How childlike she was in some ways !
That trace of defiance -- it was so like a child who expected to be scolded for some wrong attitude of mind .
And yet there were moments when she looked the tall proud queen .
"Sometimes , when the path grew narrow , she walked before him , her hand on the dog 's head ."
"Alan liked this , since it left him free to watch admiringly the swinging grace of her step and the white curves of her neck beneath the thick braid of hair , which today was wound about her head ."
"When she dropped back beside him in the wider spaces , he could only have stolen glances at her profile , delicately , strongly cut , virginal in its soft curves , childlike in its purity ."
"Once she looked around and caught his glance ; again she flushed , and something strange and exultant stirred in Alan 's heart ."
"It was as if that maiden blush were the involuntary , unconscious admission of some power he had over her -- a power which her hitherto unfettered spirit had never before felt ."
"The cold indifference he had seen in her face at their first meeting was gone , and something told him it was gone forever ."
When they came in sight of Four Winds they saw two people walking up the road from the harbour and a few further steps brought them face to face with Captain Anthony Oliver and his old housekeeper .
The Captain 's appearance was a fresh surprise to Alan .
"He had expected to meet a rough , burly sailor , loud of voice and forbidding of manner ."
"Instead , Captain Anthony was a tall , well-built man of perhaps fifty ."
"His face , beneath its shock of iron-grey hair , was handsome but wore a somewhat forbidding expression , and there was something in it , apart from line or feature , which did not please Alan ."
"He had no time to analyze this impression , for Lynde said hurriedly , `` Father , this is Mr. Douglas ."
He has just done me a great service . ''
"She briefly explained her accident ; when she had finished , the Captain turned to Alan and held out his hand , a frank smile replacing the rather suspicious and contemptuous scowl which had previously overshadowed it ."
"`` I am much obliged to you , Mr. Douglas , '' he said cordially ."
`` You must come up to the house and let me thank you at leisure .
"As a rule I 'm not very partial to the cloth , as you may have heard ."
"In this case it is the man , not the minister , I invite . ''"
"`` Oh , dear no !"
"I 'm the first boy Mrs. Jo ever had to take care of , and I was such a bad one that she is n't done with me yet , though she has been working at me for years and years . ''"
`` How old she must be ! ''
"said Nat , innocently ."
"`` She began early , you see ."
Poor thing !
"she was only fifteen when she took me , and I led her such a life , it 's a wonder she is n't wrinkled and gray , and quite worn out , '' and Mr. Laurie looked up at her laughing ."
"`` Do n't Teddy ; I wo n't have you abuse yourself so ; '' and Mrs. Jo stroked the curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever , for , in spite of every thing Teddy was her boy still ."
"`` If it had n't been for you , there never would have been a Plumfield ."
"It was my success with you , sir , that gave me courage to try my pet plan ."
"So the boys may thank you for it , and name the new institution ` The Laurence Museum , ' in honor of its founder , wo n't we , boys ? ''"
"she added , looking very like the lively Jo of old times ."
`` We will !
we will ! ''
"shouted the boys , throwing up their hats , for though they had taken them off on entering the house , according to rule , they had been in too much of a hurry to hang them up ."
"`` I 'm as hungry as a bear , ca n't I have a cookie ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , when the shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow ."
"`` Trot out and ask Asia for the gingerbread-box , Demi ."
"It is n't in order to eat between meals , but , on this joyful occasion , we wo n't mind , and have a cookie all round , '' said Mrs. Jo ; and when the box came she dealt them out with a liberal hand , every one munching away in a social circle ."
"Suddenly , in the midst of a bite , Mr. Laurie cried out , `` Bless my heart , I forgot grandma 's bundle ! ''"
"and running out to the carriage , returned with an interesting white parcel , which , being opened , disclosed a choice collection of beasts , birds , and pretty things cut out of crisp sugary cake , and baked a lovely brown ."
"`` There 's one for each , and a letter to tell which is whose ."
"Grandma and Hannah made them , and I tremble to think what would have happened to me if I had forgotten to leave them . ''"
"Then , amid much laughing and fun , the cakes were distributed ."
"A fish for Dan , a fiddle for Nat , a book for Demi , a money for Tommy , a flower for Daisy , a hoop for Nan , who had driven twice round the triangle without stopping , a star for Emil , who put on airs because he studied astronomy , and , best of all , an omnibus for Franz , whose great delight was to drive the family bus ."
"Stuffy got a fat pig , and the little folks had birds , and cats , and rabbits , with black currant eyes ."
`` Now I must go .
Where is my Goldilocks ?
"Mamma will come flying out to get her if I 'm not back early , '' said Uncle Teddy , when the last crumb had vanished , which it speedily did , you may be sure ."
"The young ladies had gone into the garden , and while they waited till Franz looked them up , Jo and Laurie stood at the door talking together ."
`` How does little Giddy-gaddy come on ? ''
"he asked , for Nan 's pranks amused him very much , and he was never tired of teasing Jo about her ."
"I never shall forget it , and I 'll do anything for you ."
Yes !
I 'll write and ask Mrs. Piper to lend us her ermine cloak for the king .
See if I do n't ! ''
"Shrieks of delight hailed this noble offer , for no one had dared to borrow the much-coveted mantle , but all agreed that the old lady would not refuse Jill ."
"It was astonishing how smoothly everything went after this , for each was eager to help , admire , and suggest , in the friendliest way ; and when all were dressed , the boys found a party of very gay ladies waiting for them round the couch , where lay the brightest little Princess ever seen ."
"`` Oh , Jack , I 'm to act !"
Was n't it dear of the girls to choose me ?
Do n't they look lovely ?
Are n't you glad ? ''
"cried Jill , as the lads stared and the lasses blushed and smiled , well pleased at the frank admiration the boyish faces showed ."
`` I guess I am !
"You are a set of trumps , and we 'll give you a first-class spread after the play to pay for it ."
"Wo n't we , fellows ? ''"
"answered Jack , much gratified , and feeling that now he could act his own part capitally ."
`` We will .
"It was a handsome thing to do , and we think well of you for it ."
"Hey , Gus ? ''"
"and Frank nodded approvingly at all , though he looked only at Annette ."
"`` As king of this crowd , I call it to order , '' said Gus , retiring to the throne , where Juliet sat laughing in her red table-cloth ."
"`` We 'll have ` The Fair One with Golden Locks ' next time ; I promise you that , '' whispered Ed to Mabel , whose shining hair streamed over her blue dress like a mantle of gold-colored silk ."
"`` Girls are pretty nice things , are n't they ?"
Kind of 'em to take Jill in .
"Do n't Molly look fine , though ? ''"
and Grif 's black eyes twinkled as he planned to pin her skirts to Merry 's at the first opportunity .
`` Susy looks as gay as a feather-duster .
I like her .
"She never snubs a fellow , '' said Joe , much impressed with the splendor of the court ladies ."
"The boys ' costumes were not yet ready , but they posed well , and all had a merry time , ending with a game of blind-man 's - buff , in which every one caught the right person in the most singular way , and all agreed as they went home in the moonlight that it had been an unusually jolly meeting ."
"So the fairy play woke the sleeping beauty that lies in all of us , and makes us lovely when we rouse it with a kiss of unselfish good-will , for , though the girls did not know it then , they had adorned themselves with pearls more precious than the waxen ones they decked their Princess in ."
Chapter XI .
"`` Down Brakes '' The greatest people have their weak points , and the best-behaved boys now and then yield to temptation and get into trouble , as everybody knows ."
"`` Oh , thank God , '' murmured Mrs. Blythe , in a half-whisper ."
Bruce looked at her curiously .
`` That is what father said when mother told him .
"But when l said it the other day when I found out Mr. Mead 's dog had n't hurt my kitten -- I thought he had shooken it to death , you know -- father looked awful solemn and said I must never say that again about a kitten ."
"But I could n't understand why , Mrs. Blythe ."
"I felt awful thankful , and it must have been God that saved Stripey , because that Mead dog had ` normous jaws , and oh , how it shook poor Stripey ."
And so why could n't I thank Him ?
"` Course , '' added Bruce reminiscently , `` maybe I said it too loud -- 'cause I was awful glad and excited when I found Stripey was all right ."
"I ` most shouted it , Mrs. Blythe ."
Maybe if I 'd said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right .
"Do you know , Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce dropped to a `` whispery '' tone , edging a little nearer to Anne -- `` what I would like to do to the Kaiser if I could ? ''"
"`` What would you like to do , laddie ? ''"
"`` Norman Reese said in school to-day that he would like to tie the Kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to worrying him , '' said Bruce gravely ."
`` And Emily Flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him .
And they all said things like that .
But Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on Anne 's knee -- `` I would like to turn the Kaiser into a good man -- a very good man -- all at once if I could .
That is what I would do .
"Do n't you think , Mrs. Blythe , that would be the very worstest punishment of all ? ''"
"`` Bless the child , '' said Susan , `` how do you make out that would be any kind of a punishment for that wicked fiend ? ''"
"`` Do n't you see , '' said Bruce , looking levelly at Susan , out of his blackly blue eyes , `` if he was turned into a good man he would understand how dreadful the things he has done are , and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way ."
He would feel just awful -- and he would go on feeling like that forever .
"Yes '' -- Bruce clenched his hands and nodded his head emphatically , `` yes , I would make the Kaiser a good man -- that is what I would do -- it would serve him ` zackly right . ''"
"CHAPTER XXVI SUSAN HAS A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE An aeroplane was flying over Glen St. Mary , like a great bird poised against the western sky -- a sky so clear and of such a pale , silvery yellow , that it gave an impression of a vast , wind-freshened space of freedom ."
"The little group on the Ingleside lawn looked up at it with fascinated eyes , although it was by no means an unusual thing to see an occasional hovering plane that summer ."
Susan was always intensely excited .
"Who knew but that it might be Shirley away up there in the clouds , flying over to the Island from Kingsport ?"
"But Shirley had gone overseas now , so Susan was not so keenly interested in this particular aeroplane and its pilot ."
"Nevertheless , she looked at it with awe ."
"`` I wonder , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she said solemnly , `` what the old folks down there in the graveyard would think if they could rise out of their graves for one moment and behold that sight ."
"I am sure my father would disapprove of it , for he was a man who did not believe in new-fangled ideas of any sort ."
He always cut his grain with a reaping hook to the day of his death .
A mower he would not have .
"Cousin Sophia wanted them to elect Roosevelt , and is much disgruntled because they would not give him a chance ."
"I had a hankering for him myself , but we must believe that Providence over-rules these matters and be satisfied -- though what the Almighty means in this affair of Rumania I can not fathom -- saying it with all reverence . ''"
Susan fathomed it -- or thought she did -- when the Asquith ministry went down and Lloyd George became Premier .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , Lloyd George is at the helm at last ."
I have been praying for this for many a day .
Now we shall soon see a blessed change .
"It took the Rumanian disaster to bring it about , no less , and that is the meaning of it , though I could not see it before ."
There will be no more shilly-shallying .
"I consider that the war is as good as won , and that I shall tie to , whether Bucharest falls or not . ''"
Bucharest did fall -- and Germany proposed peace negotiations .
Whereat Susan scornfully turned a deaf ear and absolutely refused to listen to such proposals .
When President Wilson sent his famous December peace note Susan waxed violently sarcastic .
"`` Woodrow Wilson is going to make peace , I understand ."
First Henry Ford had a try at it and now comes Wilson .
"But peace is not made with ink , Woodrow , and that you may tie to , '' said Susan , apostrophizing the unlucky President out of the kitchen window nearest the United States ."
"`` Lloyd George 's speech will tell the Kaiser what is what , and you may keep your peace screeds at home and save postage . ''"
"`` What a pity President Wilson ca n't hear you , Susan , '' said Rilla slyly ."
"`` Indeed , Rilla dear , it is a pity that he has no one near him to give him good advice , as it is clear he has not , in all those Democrats and Republicans , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` I do not know the difference between them , for the politics of the Yankees is a puzzle I can not solve , study it as I may ."
"But as far as seeing through a grindstone goes , I am afraid -- '' Susan shook her head dubiously , `` that they are all tarred with the same brush . ''"
"`` I am thankful Christmas is over , '' Rilla wrote in her diary during the last week of a stormy December ."
`` We had dreaded it so -- the first Christmas since Courcelette .
But we had all the Merediths down for dinner and nobody tried to be gay or cheerful .
"We were all just quiet and friendly , and that helped ."
"Then , too , I was so thankful that Jims had got better -- so thankful that I almost felt glad -- almost but not quite ."
I wonder if I shall ever feel really glad over anything again .
It seems as if gladness were killed in me -- shot down by the same bullet that pierced Walter 's heart .
Perhaps some day a new kind of gladness will be born in my soul -- but the old kind will never live again .
`` Winter set in awfully early this year .
Ten days before Christmas we had a big snowstorm -- at least we thought it big at the time .
"As it happened , it was only a prelude to the real performance ."
"It was fine the next day , and Ingleside and Rainbow Valley were wonderful , with the trees all covered with snow , and big drifts everywhere , carved into the most fantastic shapes by the chisel of the northeast wind ."
"One night, after they had both been flying through forest and over field, he came back to the hollow tree to rest. He expected to find Mrs."
"Owl, for she had started home before he did. She was not there and he grew quite impatient. ""I should like to know what keeps her so long,"" he said, fretfully. After a while he looked into the nest and saw the two big white eggs. ""It is a shame,"" he said. ""Our beautiful eggs will be chilled, and it will be all her fault if we have no Owlets this summer."""
"You see, even then he did not seem to think that he could do anything to keep them warm. But the next time he looked in, he put one feathered foot on the round eggs and was surprised to find how cool they were."
"It fairly made his head feathers stand on end to think of it, and he was so frightened that he forgot to be cross, and stepped right in and covered them with his own breast. What if they had already been left too long, and the Owlets within would never hatch? Would Mrs. Owl ever forgive him for being so stupid? He began to wonder if any of the other fellows would see him. He thought it so absurd for the king of the forest to be hatching out a couple of eggs, instead of swooping around in the dark and frightening the smaller birds."
"The night seemed so long, too. It had always been short enough before, and he had often disliked to have daylight come, for then he had to go to bed. He was very much upset, and it is no wonder that when he heard a doleful wail from a neighboring tree, and knew that his cousin, the Screech Owl, was near, he raised his head and called loudly, ""Hoo-hoo-oooo! Waugh-hoo!"""
"The Screech Owl heard him and flew at once to a branch beside the nest hollow. He was a jolly little fellow in spite of his doleful call, and before he could talk at all he had to bend his body, look behind him, nod his head, and shake himself, as Screech Owls always do when they alight. Then he looked into the tree and saw his big cousin, the Great Horned Owl, the night king of the forest, sitting on the eggs and looking very, very grumpy. How he did laugh! ""What is the matter?"" said he. ""Didn't you like your wife's way of brooding over the eggs? Or did she get tired of staying at home and make you help tend the nest?"""
"""Matter enough,"" grumbled the Great Horned Owl. ""We went hunting together at twilight and she hasn't come home yet. I didn't get into the nest until I had to, but it was growing very cold and I wouldn't miss having our eggs hatch for anything. Ugh-whoo! How my legs do ache!"""
"""Well,"" said his cousin, ""you are having a hard time. Are you hungry?"""
"The Great Horned Owl said that he was, so the Screech Owl went hunting and brought him food. ""I will look in every night,"" he said, ""and bring you a lunch. I'm afraid something has happened to your wife and that she will not be back."""
"As he flew away he called out, ""It is too bad. I am very sorry for you. But then, I suppose you would never have the Owlets if you didn't stick to the nest."""
"This last remark made the Great Horned Owl quite angry. ""Much he knows about it,"" he said. ""I guess if he had ever tried it he would be a little more sorry for me."" And then he began to think, ""Who have I heard say those very words before? Who? Who? Who?"""
"All at once the Great Horned Owl remembered how many times he had said just that to his patient wife, and he began to feel very uncomfortable."
"His ears tingled and he felt a queer hot feeling under his face feathers. Perhaps he hadn't been acting very well after all! He knew that even when he told her he was sorry, he had been thinking she made a great fuss. Well, if she would only come back now, that should all be changed, and he shifted his weight and wriggled around into a more comfortable position."
"Now, if this were just a story, one could say that Mrs. Owl came back and that they were all happy together; but the truth is she never did come, and nobody ever knew what became of her. So her husband, the night king of the forest, had to keep the eggs warm and rear his own Owlets."
"You can imagine how glad he was on the night when he first heard them tapping on the inside of their shells, for then he knew that he would soon be free to hunt."
"A finer pair of children were never hatched, and their father thought them far ahead of all his other broods. ""If only Mrs. Owl were here to see them, how lovely it would be!"" he said. Yet if she had been there he would never have had the pleasure of hearing their first faint cheeps, and of covering them with his soft breast feathers as he did each day. He forgot now all the weary time when he sat with aching legs, wishing that his cousin would happen along with something to eat. For that is always the way, when we work for those we love, the weariness is soon forgotten and only happiness remains."
"It is said that the Screech Owl was more thoughtful of his wife after his cousin had to hatch the eggs, and it is too bad that some of the other forest people could not have learned the same lesson; but the Great Horned Owl never told, and the Screech Owl kept his secret, and to this day there are many people in the forest who know nothing whatever about it."
THE SWAGGERING CROW
"When the Crows who have been away for the winter return to the forest, all their relatives gather on the tree-tops to welcome them and tell the news. Those who have been away have also much to say, and it sometimes seems as though they were all talking at once. They spend many days in visiting before they begin nest-building. Perhaps if they would take turns and not interrupt each other, they would get the news more quickly, for when people are interrupted they can never talk well."
"Sometimes, too, one hungry fellow will fly off for a few mouthfuls of grain, and get back just in time to hear the end of a story. Then he will want to hear the first part of it, and make such a fuss that they have to tell it all over again just for him."
"At this time in the spring, you can hear their chatter and laughter, even when you are far away; and the song-birds of the forest look at each other and say, ""Dear me! The Crows are back."" They have very good reasons for disliking the Crows, as any Robin will tell you."
"There was one great shining black Crow who had the loudest voice of all, and who was not at all afraid to use it. This spring he looked very lean and lank, for it had been a long, cold winter, and he had found but little to eat, acorns, the seeds of the wild plants, and once in a great while a frozen apple that hung from its branch in some lonely orchard."
"He said that he felt as though he could reach around his body with one claw, and when a Crow says that he feels exceedingly thin. But now spring was here, and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, yes, and his brothers and his uncles, too, had returned to the forest to live. He had found two good dinners already, all that he could eat and more too, and he began to feel happy and bold. The purple gloss on his feathers grew brighter every day, and he was glad to see this. He wanted to look so handsome that a certain Miss Crow, a sister of one of his friends, would like him better than she did any of the others."
"That was all very well, if he had been at all polite about it. But one day he saw her visiting with another Crow, and he lost his temper, and flew at him, and pecked him about the head and shoulders, and tore the long fourth feather from one of his wings, besides rumpling the rest of his coat. Then he went away. He had beaten him by coming upon him from behind, like the sneak that he was, and he was afraid that if he waited he might yet get the drubbing he deserved. So he flew off to the top of a hemlock-tree where the other Crows were, and told them how he had fought and beaten. You should have seen him swagger around when he told it. Each time it was a bigger story, until at last he made them think that the other Crow hadn't a tail feather left."
"The next day, a number of Crows went to a farm not far from the forest."
Miss Crow was in the party. On their way they stopped in a field where there stood a figure of a man with a dreadful stick in his hand.
"Everybody was frightened except Mr. Crow. He wanted to show how much courage he had, so he flew right up to it. They all thought him very brave. They didn't know that down in his heart he was a great coward. He wasn't afraid of this figure because he knew all about it. He had seen it put up the day before, and he knew that there was no man under the big straw hat and the flapping coat. He knew that, instead of a thinking, breathing person, there was only a stick nailed to a pole. He knew that, instead of having two good legs with which to run, this figure had only the end of a pole stuck into the ground."
"Of course, he might have told them all, and then they could have gathered corn from the broken ground around, but he didn't want to do that. Instead, he said, ""Do you see that terrible great creature with a stick in his hand? He is here just to drive us away, but he dares not touch me. He knows I would beat him if he did."" Then he flew down, and ate corn close beside the figure, while the other Crows stood back and cawed with wonder."
"When he went back to them, he said to Miss Crow, ""You see how brave I am. If I were taking care of anybody, nothing could ever harm her."" And he looked tenderly at her with his little round eyes. But she pretended not to understand what he meant, for she did not wish to give up her pleasant life with the flock and begin nest-building just yet."
"When they reached the barn-yard, there was rich picking, and Mr. Crow made such a clatter that you would have thought he owned it all and that the others were only his guests. He flew down on the fence beside a couple of harmless Hens, and he flapped his wings and swaggered around until they began to sidle away. Then he grew bolder (you know bullies always do if they find that people are scared), and edged up to them until they fluttered off, squawking with alarm."
"Next he walked into the Hen-house, saying to the other Crows, ""You might have a good time, too, if you were not such cowards."" He had no more than gotten the words out of his bill, when the door of the Hen-house blew shut and caught there. It was a grated door and he scrambled wildly to get through the openings. While he was trying, he heard the hoarse voice of the Crow whom he had beaten the day before, saying, ""Thank you, we are having a fairly good time as it is""; and he saw Miss Crow picking daintily at some corn which the speaker had scratched up for her."
"""Perhaps,"" was the answer. ""But until you do feel it you can never understand it, for it is not like any other feeling that there is."""
"Then they all started for a low clump of bushes to find shelter from the storm. Once they were frightened by seeing a great creature come tramping through the woods towards them. ""A man!"" said Mr. Grouse."
"""Hide!"" said Mrs. Grouse, and each little Grouse hid under the leaves so quickly that nobody could see how it was done. One might almost think that a strong wind had blown them away. The mother pretended that she had a broken wing, and hopped away, making such pitiful sounds that the man followed to pick her up. When she had led him far from her children, she, too, made a quick run and hid herself; and although the man hunted everywhere, he could not find a single bird."
"You know that is always the way in Grouse families, and even if the man's foot had stirred the leaves under which a little one was hiding, the Grouse would not have moved or made a sound. The children are brought up to mind without asking any questions. When their mother says, ""Hide!"" they do it, and never once ask ""Why?"" or answer, ""As soon as I have swallowed this berry."" It is no wonder that the older ones are proud of their children. Any mother would be made happy by having one child obey like that, and think of having twelve!"
"At last, the whole family reached the bushes where they were to stay, and then they began to feed near by. ""Eat all you can,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""before the snow gets deep. You may not have another such good chance for many days."" So they ate until their little stomachs would not hold one more seed or evergreen bud."
"All this time the snowflakes were falling, but the Grouse children were no longer afraid of them. Sometimes they even chased and snapped at them as they would at a fly in summer-time. It was then, too, that they learned to use snow-shoes. The oldest child had made a great fuss when he found a fringe of hard points growing around his toes in the fall, and had run peeping to his mother to ask her what was the matter. She had shown him her own feet, and had told him how all the Ruffed Grouse have snow-shoes of that kind grow on their feet every winter."
"""We do not have to bother about them at all,"" she said. ""They put themselves on when the weather gets cold in the fall, and they take themselves off when spring comes. We each have a new pair every year, and when they are grown we can walk easily over the soft snow. Without them we should sink through and flounder."""
"When night came they all huddled under the bushes, lying close together to keep each other warm. The next day they burrowed into a snow-drift and made a snug place there which was even better than the one they left; the soft white coverlet kept the wind out so well. It was hard for the little ones to keep quiet long, and to amuse them Mr. Grouse told how he first met their mother in the spring."
"""It was a fine, sunshiny day,"" he said, ""and everybody was happy. I had for some time been learning to drum, and now I felt that I was as good a drummer as there was in the forest. So I found a log (every Ruffed Grouse has to have his own place, you know) and I jumped up on it and strutted back and forth with my head high in the air. It was a dusky part of the forest and I could not see far, yet I knew that a beautiful young Grouse was somewhere near, and I hoped that if I drummed very well she might come to me."""
"""I know!"" interrupted one of the little Grouse. ""It was our mother."""
"""Well, it wasn't your mother then, my chick,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""for that was long, long before you were hatched."""
"""She was our mother afterwards, anyway,"" cried the young Grouse. ""I just know she was!"""
"Mr. Grouse's eyes twinkled, but he went gravely on. ""At last I flapped my wing's hard and fast, and the soft drumming sound could be heard far and near. 'Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump; thump-thump-rup-rup-rup-rup-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.' I waited, but nobody came. Then I drummed again, and after that I was sure that I heard a rustling in the leaves. I drummed a third time, and then, children, there came the beautiful young Grouse, breaking her way through the thicket and trying to look as though she didn't know that I was there."""
"""Did she know?"" cried the little Grouse."
"""You must ask your mother that,"" he answered, ""for it was she who came."
"Ah, what happy days we had together all spring! We wandered all through this great Forest and even made some journeys into the edge of the Meadow. Still, there was no place we loved as we did the dusky hollow by the old log where we first met. One day your mother told me that she must begin housekeeping and that I must keep out of the way while she was busy. So I had to go off with a crowd of other Ruffed Grouse while she fixed her nest, laid her eggs, and hatched out you youngsters. It was rather hard to be driven off in that way, but you know it is the custom among Grouse. We poor fellows had to amuse ourselves and each other until our wives called us home to help take care of the children."
"We've been at that work ever since."""
"""Oh!"" said one of the young Grouse. ""Oh, I am so glad that you drummed, and that she came when she heard you. Who would we have had to take care of us if it hadn't happened just so?"""
"That made them all feel very solemn and Mr. Grouse couldn't answer, and Mrs. Grouse couldn't answer, and none of the little Grouse could answer because, you see, it is one of the questions that hasn't any answer."
"Still, they were all there and happy, so they didn't bother their crested heads about it very long."
A MILD DAY IN WINTER
"It had been a cold and windy winter. Day after day the storm-clouds had piled up in the northwest and spread slowly over the sky, dropping great ragged flakes of snow down to the shivering earth. Then the forest trees were clothed in fleecy white garments, and the branches of the evergreens drooped under their heavy cloak."
"Then there had been other days, when a strong wind stripped the trees of their covering, and brought with it thousands of small, hard flakes."
"These flakes were drier than the ragged ones had been, and did not cling so lovingly to everything they touched. They would rather frolic on the ground, rising again and again from their resting-places to dance around with the wind, and help make great drifts and overhanging ledges of snow in the edge of the Forest, where there was more open ground."
"It is true that not all the winter had been cold and stormy. There were times when the drifts melted slowly into the earth, and the grass, which last summer had been so tender and green, showed brown and matted on the ground. Still the Great Horned Owl and his wife could not find enough to eat. ""We do not mean to complain,"" said he with dignity, as he scratched one ear with his feathered right foot, ""but neither of us has had a meal hearty enough for a healthy Robin, since the first heavy snow came."""
"This was when he was talking to his cousin, the Screech Owl. ""Hearty enough for a Robin!"" exclaimed Mrs. Great Horned Owl. ""I should say we hadn't. I don't think I have had enough for a Goldfinch, and that is pretty hard for a bird of my size. I am so thin that my feathers feel loose."""
"""Have you been so hungry that you dreamed about food?"" asked the Screech Owl."
"""N-no, I can't say that I have,"" said the Great Horned Owl, while his wife shook her head solemnly."
"""Ah, that is dreadful,"" said the Screech Owl. ""I have done that several times. Only yesterday, while I lay in my nest-hollow, I dreamed that I was hunting. There was food everywhere, but just as I flew down to eat, it turned into pieces of ice. When I awakened I was almost starved and so cold that my beak chattered."""
"It was only a few days after the Screech Owl's call upon his cousins that he awakened one night to find the weather milder, and the ground covered with only a thin coating of soft snow. The beautiful round moon was shining down upon him, and in the western sky the clouds were still red from the rays of the setting sun."
"Somewhere, far beyond the fields and forests of this part of the world, day-birds were beginning to stir, and thousands of downy heads were drawn from under sheltering wings, while in the barnyards the Cocks were calling their welcome to the sun. But the Screech Owl did not think of this. He aroused his wife and they went hunting. When they came back they did not dream about food. They had eaten all that they could, and the Great Horned Owl and his wife had made a meal hearty enough for a dozen Robins, and a whole flock of Goldfinches. It was a good thing for the day-birds that this was so, for it is said that sometimes, when food is very scarce, Owls have been known to hunt by daylight."
"When the morning came the old dame was so poorly that she couldn't utter a word but groans and sighs. She was sure she should never be well again, unless she had some of those apples that grew in the orchard near the castle where the man's brothers lived; only she had no one to send for them."
"Oh! the lad was ready to go that instant; but the eleven lions went with him. So when he came to the orchard, he climbed up into the apple tree and ate as many apples as he could, and he had scarce got down before he fell into a deep sleep; but the lions all lay round him in a ring. The third day came the Troll's brothers, but they did not come in man's shape. They came snorting like man-eating steeds, and wondered who it was that dared to be there, and said they would tear him to pieces, so small that there should not be a bit of him left."
"But up rose the lions and tore the Trolls into small pieces, so that the place looked as if a dung heap had been tossed about it; and when they had finished the Trolls they lay down again. The lad did not wake till late in the afternoon, and when he got on his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he began to wonder what had been going on, when he saw the marks of hoofs. But when he went towards the castle, a maiden looked out of a window who had seen all that had happened, and she said:"
"""You may thank your stars you weren't in that tussle, else you must have lost your life."""
"""What! I lose my life! No fear of that, I think,"" said the lad."
"So she begged him to come in, that she might talk with him, for she hadn't seen a Christian soul ever since she came there. But when she opened the door the lions wanted to go in too, but she got so frightened that she began to scream, and so the lad let them lie outside. Then the two talked and talked, and the lad asked how it came that she, who was so lovely, could put up with those ugly Trolls. She never wished it, she said; 'twas quite against her will."
"They had seized her by force, and she was the King of Arabia's daughter. So they talked on, and at last she asked him what he would do; whether she should go back home, or whether he would have her to wife. Of course he would have her, and she shouldn't go home."
"After that they went round the castle, and at last they came to a great hall, where the Trolls' two great swords hung high up on the wall."
"""I wonder if you are man enough to wield one of these,"" said the Princess."
"""Who? I?"" said the lad. ""'Twould be a pretty thing if I couldn't wield one of these."""
"With that he put two or three chairs one a-top of the other, jumped up, and touched the biggest sword with his finger tips, tossed it up in the air, and caught it again by the hilt; leapt down, and at the same time dealt such a blow with it on the floor that the whole hall shook. After he had thus got down, he thrust the sword under his arm and carried it about with him."
"So, when they had lived a little while in the castle, the Princess thought she ought to go home to her parents, and let them know what had become of her; so they loaded a ship, and she set sail from the castle."
"After she had gone, and the lad had wandered about a little, he called to mind that he had been sent out on an errand thither, and had come to fetch something for his mother's health; and though he said to himself, ""After all the old dame was not so bad but she's all right by this time"" still he thought he ought to go and just see how she was."
So he went and found both the man and his mother quite fresh and hearty.
"""What wretches you are to live in this beggarly hut,"" said the lad."
"""Come with me up to my castle, and you shall see what a fine fellow I am."""
"Well! they were both ready to go, and on the way his mother talked to him, and asked how it was he had got so strong."
"""If you must know it came of that blue belt which lay on the hill-side that time when you and I were out begging,"" said the lad."
"""Have you got it still?"" asked she."
"""Yes"" he had. It was tied round his waist."
"""Might she see it?"""
"""Yes"" she might; and with that he pulled open his waistcoat and shirt to show it to her."
"Then she seized it with both hands, tore it off, and twisted it round her fist."
"""Now,"" she cried, ""what shall I do with such a wretch as you? I'll just give you one blow, and dash your brains out!"""
"""Far too good a death for such a scamp,"" said the Troll. ""No! let's first burn out his eyes, and then turn him adrift in a little boat."""
"So they burned out his eyes and turned him adrift, in spite of his prayers and tears; but, as the boat drifted, the lions swam after, and at last they laid hold of it and dragged it ashore on an island, and placed the lad under a fir tree. They caught game for him, and they plucked the birds and made him a bed of down; but he was forced to eat his meat raw and he was blind. At last, one day the biggest lion was chasing a hare which was blind, for it ran straight over stock and stone, and the end was, it ran right up against a fir-stump and tumbled head over heels across the field right into a spring; but lo!"
"when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain, and so saved its life."
"""So, so!"" thought the lion, and went and dragged the lad to the spring, and dipped him over head and ears in it. So, when he had got his sight again, he went down to the shore and made signs to the lions that they should all lie close together like a raft; then he stood upon their backs while they swam with him to the mainland. When he had reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse, and made the lions lie quiet. Then he stole up to the castle, like a thief, to see if he couldn't lay hands on his belt; and when he got to the door, he peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door in the kitchen. So he crept softly in across the floor, for there was no one there; but as soon as he had got hold of the belt, he began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad. Just then his mother came rushing out:"
"""Dear heart, my darling little boy! do give me the belt again,"" she said."
"""Thank you kindly,"" said he. ""Now you shall have the doom you passed on me,"" and he fulfilled it on the spot. When the old Troll heard that, he came in and begged and prayed so prettily that he might not be smitten to death."
"""Well, you may live,"" said the lad, ""but you shall undergo the same punishment you gave me;"" and so he burned out the Troll's eyes, and turned him adrift on the sea in a little boat, but he had no lions to follow him."
"Now the lad was all alone, and he went about longing and longing for the Princess; at last he could bear it no longer; he must set out to seek her, his heart was so bent on having her. So he loaded four ships and set sail for Arabia."
"Listen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his wife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure it for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then your prince dies under my feet."""
"""Very well, we agree,"" said they all. ""Nay, if we do not get the ring for you, devour us all."""
"This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At midnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her bedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat; whereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and rolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing and ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to the cat and released its son."
"As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to go and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They had only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the house and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything would go on as happily as before. ""How glad master will be!"" they thought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the way they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its back. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and threatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up; whereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once dropped it, and a fish swallowed it."
"""Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?"" said the dog."
"""What is done is done,"" replied the cat. ""We must try to recover it, and if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream."
"I have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me."""
"""All right,"" said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with a dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and lay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet."
"Not long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of a fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on it to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the bird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring."
"This was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off to the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to restore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found and carried back to the cat."
"""Come along now; I have got the ring,"" said the cat to the dog."
"""No, I will not,"" said the dog, ""unless you let me have the ring. I can carry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you."" So the cat was obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it again. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite."
"""See, see, there it goes away to that big tree,"" the cat exclaimed."
"""Oh! oh! what have I done?"" cried the dog."
"""You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,"" said the cat. ""But stop your barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we shall not be able to trace it."""
"The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree, killed the kite, and recovered the ring. ""Come along,"" it said to the dog when it reached the ground. ""We must make haste now. We have been delayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on."""
"The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat's pardon for all the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the third time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and gave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into joy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared, and he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be."
The Talkative Tortoise
"The future Buddha was once born in a minister's family, when Brahma-datta was reigning in Benares; and when he grew up, he became the king's adviser in things temporal and spiritual."
"Now this king was very talkative; while he was speaking, others had no opportunity for a word. And the future Buddha, wanting to cure this talkativeness of his, was constantly seeking for some means of doing so."
"At that time there was living, in a pond in the Himalaya mountains, a tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild ducks, who came to feed there, made friends with him. And one day, when they had become very intimate with him, they said to the tortoise:"
"""Friend tortoise! the place where we live, at the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful in the Himalaya country, is a delightful spot. Will you come there with us?"""
"""But how can I get there?"""
"""We can take you, if you can only hold your tongue, and will say nothing to anybody."""
"""Oh! that I can do. Take me with you."""
"""That's right,"" said they. And making the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they themselves took the two ends in their teeth, and flew up into the air."
"Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas, some villagers called out, ""Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a stick!"" Whereupon the tortoise wanted to say, ""If my friends choose to carry me, what is that to you, you wretched slaves!"" So just as the swift flight of the wild ducks had brought him over the king's palace in the city of Benares, he let go of the stick he was biting, and falling in the open courtyard, split in two! And there arose a universal cry, ""A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard, and has split in two!"""
"The king, taking the future Buddha, went to the place, surrounded by his courtiers; and looking at the tortoise, he asked the Bodisat, ""Teacher! how comes he to be fallen here?"""
"The future Buddha thought to himself, ""Long expecting, wishing to admonish the king, have I sought for some means of doing so. This tortoise must have made friends with the wild ducks; and they must have made him bite hold of the stick, and have flown up into the air to take him to the hills. But he, being unable to hold his tongue when he hears any one else talk, must have wanted to say something, and let go the stick; and so must have fallen down from the sky, and thus lost his life."" And saying, ""Truly, O king! those who are called chatter-boxes people whose words have no end come to grief like this,"" he uttered these Verses:"
"""Verily the tortoise killed himself     Whilst uttering his voice;     Though he was holding tight the stick,     By a word himself he slew."
"""Ugh, ugh!"" he said as soon as he got his noses inside the door. ""I smell Christian blood and bone in my house."""
"""Yes, just think! A raven came flying past here with a thigh-bone, which he dropped down the chimney,"" said the Princess. ""I threw it out, but the raven brought it back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to clean the room, but I suppose the smell is not quite gone,"" she said."
"""No, I can smell it well,"" said the troll; but he was tired and put his heads in the Princess's lap, and she went on scratching them till they all fell a-snoring. Then she called the hens, and the soldier came and cut off all the six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks."
"She was no less glad than her elder sister, as you may imagine, and danced and sang; but in the midst of their joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went with the soldier across a large courtyard, and, after walking through many, many rooms, he came to the hall of gold where the third sister was."
"She sat at a golden spinning-wheel spinning gold yarn, and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered till it hurt one's eyes."
"""Heaven preserve both you and me, what do you want here?"" said the Princess. ""Go, go, else the troll will kill us both."""
"""Just as well two as one,"" answered the soldier. The Princess cried and wept; but it was all of no use, he must and would remain. Since there was no help for it he would have to try if he could use the troll's sword on the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to move it; it was still larger and heavier than the other two swords."
"He then had to take the horn down from the wall and take three draughts from it, but was only just able to stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts he could lift it, and when he had taken another three he swung it as easily as if it had been a feather."
"The Princess then settled with the soldier to do the same as her sisters had done. As soon as the troll was well asleep she would call the hens, and he must then make haste and come in and put an end to the troll."
"All of a sudden they heard such a thundering, rambling noise, as if the walls and roof were tumbling in."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell Christian blood and bone in my house,"" said the troll, sniffing with all his nine noses."
"""Yes, you never saw the like! Just now a raven flew past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney. I threw it out, but the raven brought it back, and this went on for some time,"" said the Princess; but she got it buried at last, she said, and she had both swept and cleaned the place, but she supposed it still smelt."
"""Yes, I can smell it well,"" said the troll."
"""Come here and lie down in my lap and I will scratch your heads,"" said the Princess. ""The smell will be all gone when you awake."""
"He did so, and when he was snoring at his best she put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could get away to call the hens."
"The soldier then came in in his stockinged feet and struck at the troll, so that eight of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was too short and did not reach far enough; the ninth head woke up and began to roar."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell a Christian."""
"""Yes, here he is,"" answered the soldier, and before the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier struck him another blow and the last head rolled along the floor."
You can well imagine how glad the Princesses became now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls' heads; they did not know how they could do enough for him who had saved them. The youngest Princess took off her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took with them as much gold and silver as they thought they could carry and set off on their way home.
"As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the lieutenant pulled up the Princesses, the one after the other. But when they were safely up, the soldier thought it was foolish of him not to have gone up before the Princesses, for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He thought he would first try them, so he put a heavy lump of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the basket was half-way up they cut the rope and the lump of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces flew about his ears."
"""Now we are rid of him,"" they said, and threatened the Princesses with their life if they did not say that it was they who had saved them from the trolls. They were forced to agree to this, much against their will, and especially the youngest Princess; but life was precious, and so the two who were strongest had their way."
"When the captain and lieutenant got home with the Princesses you may be sure there were great rejoicings at the palace. The King was so glad he didn't know which leg to stand on; he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they had never been honoured before they were honoured now in full measure, and no mistake. They walked and strutted about the whole of the day, as if they were the cocks of the walk, since they were now going to have the King for father-in-law. For it was understood they should each have whichever of the Princesses they liked and half the kingdom between them. They both wanted the youngest Princess, but for all they prayed and threatened her it was of no use; she would not hear or listen to either."
They then asked the King if they might have twelve men to watch over her; she was so sad and melancholy since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid she might do something to herself.
"Yes, that they might have, and the King himself told the watch they must look well after her and follow her wherever she went and stood."
"They then began to prepare for the wedding of the two eldest sisters; it should be such a wedding as never was heard or spoken of before, and there was no end to the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering."
"In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about down in the other world. He thought it was hard that he should see neither people nor daylight any more; but he would have to do something, he thought, and so for many days he went about from room to room and opened all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there. At last he came to a drawer in a table, in which there lay a golden key; he tried this key to all the locks he could find, but there was none it fitted till he came to a little cupboard over the bed, and in that he found an old rusty whistle. ""I wonder if there is any sound in it,"" he thought, and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down, that they blackened all the field in which they settled."
"""What does our master want to-day?"" they asked."
"If he were their master, the soldier said, he would like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the earth again. No, none of them knew anything about that; ""But our mother has not yet arrived,"" they said; ""if she can't help you, no one can."""
"So he whistled once more, and shortly heard something flapping its wings far away, and then it began to blow so hard that he was carried away between the houses like a wisp of hay across the courtyard, and if he had not caught hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown away altogether."
A big eagle bigger than you can imagine then swooped down in front of him.
"When the feast was over, the bridegroom and bride were conducted to their apartment, with music, and torches, and a great procession. As soon as the door was shut, the Lindworm turned to her and said, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift!"" The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin!"" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before!"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now!"" said she."
"Then he began to moan and wriggle: and in a few minutes a long snake-skin lay upon the floor beside him. The girl drew off her first shift, and spread it on top of the skin."
"The Lindworm said again to her, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."""
"""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now,"" said she. Then with groans and moans he cast off the second skin: and she covered it with her second shift."
"The Lindworm said for the third time, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him again, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he, and his little eyes rolled furiously. But the girl was not afraid, and once more she commanded him to do as she bade."
"And so this went on until nine Lindworm skins were lying on the floor, each of them covered with a snow-white shift. And there was nothing left of the Lindworm but a huge thick mass, most horrible to see. Then the girl seized the whips, dipped them in the lye, and whipped him as hard as ever she could. Next, she bathed him all over in the fresh milk. Lastly, she dragged him on to the bed and put her arms round him. And she fell fast asleep that very moment."
"Next morning very early, the King and the courtiers came and peeped in through the keyhole. They wanted to know what had become of the girl, but none of them dared enter the room. However, in the end, growing bolder, they opened the door a tiny bit. And there they saw the girl, all fresh and rosy, and beside her lay no Lindworm, but the handsomest prince that any one could wish to see."
"The King ran out and fetched the Queen: and after that, there were such rejoicings in the castle as never were known before or since. The wedding took place all over again, much finer than the first, with festivals and banquets and merrymakings for days and weeks. No bride was ever so beloved by a King and Queen as this peasant maid from the shepherd's cottage. There was no end to their love and their kindness towards her: because, by her sense and her calmness and her courage, she had saved their son, Prince Lindworm."
THE LASSIE AND HER GODMOTHER
"Once on a time a poor couple lived far, far away in a great wood. The wife was brought to bed, and had a pretty girl, but they were so poor they did not know how to get the babe christened, for they had no money to pay the parson's fees. So one day the father went out to see if he could find any one who was willing to stand for the child and pay the fees; but though he walked about the whole day from one house to another, and though all said they were willing enough to stand, no one thought himself bound to pay the fees. Now, when he was going home again, a lovely lady met him, dressed so fine, and she looked so thoroughly good and kind; she offered to get the babe christened, but after that, she said, she must keep it for her own. The husband answered, he must first ask his wife what she wished to do; but when he got home and told his story, the wife said, right out, ""No!"""
"Next day the man went out again, but no one would stand if they had to pay the fees; and though he begged and prayed, he could get no help."
"And again as he went home, towards evening the same lovely lady met him, who looked so sweet and good, and she made him the same offer. So he told his wife again how he had fared, and this time she said, if he couldn't get any one to stand for his babe next day, they must just let the lady have her way, since she seemed so kind and good."
"The third day, the man went about, but he couldn't get any one to stand; and so when, towards evening, he met the kind lady again, he gave his word she should have the babe if she would only get it christened at the font. So next morning she came to the place where the man lived, followed by two men to stand godfathers, took the babe and carried it to church, and there it was christened. After that she took it to her own house, and there the little girl lived with her several years, and her Foster-mother was always kind and friendly to her."
"Now, when the Lassie had grown to be big enough to know right and wrong, her Foster-mother got ready to go on a journey."
"""You have my leave,"" she said, ""to go all over the house, except those rooms which I shew you;"" and when she had said that, away she went."
"But the Lassie could not forbear just to open one of the doors a little bit, when POP! out flew a Star."
"When her Foster-mother came back, she was very vexed to find that the star had flown out, and she got very angry with her Foster-daughter, and threatened to send her away; but the child cried and begged so hard that she got leave to stay."
"Now, after a while, the Foster-mother had to go on another journey; and, before she went, she forbade the Lassie to go into those two rooms into which she had never been. She promised to beware; but when she was left alone, she began to think and to wonder what there could be in the second room, and at last she could not help setting the door a little ajar, just to peep in, when POP! out flew the Moon."
"When her Foster-mother came home and found the moon let out, she was very downcast, and said to the Lassie she must go away, she could not stay with her any longer. But the Lassie wept so bitterly, and prayed so heartily for forgiveness, that this time, too, she got leave to stay."
"Some time after, the Foster-mother had to go away again, and she charged the Lassie, who by this time was half grown up, most earnestly that she mustn't try to go into, or to peep into, the third room. But when her Foster-mother had been gone some time, and the Lassie was weary of walking about alone, all at once she thought, ""Dear me, what fun it would be just to peep a little into that third room."" Then she thought she mustn't do it for her Foster-mother's sake; but when the bad thought came the second time she could hold out no longer; come what might, she must and would look into the room; so she just opened the door a tiny bit, when POP! out flew the Sun."
"But when her Foster-mother came back and saw that the sun had flown away, she was cut to the heart, and said, ""Now, there was no help for it, the Lassie must and should go away; she couldn't hear of her staying any longer."" Now the Lassie cried her eyes out, and begged and prayed so prettily; but it was all no good."
"""Nay! but I must punish you!"" said her Foster-mother; ""but you may have your choice, either to be the loveliest woman in the world, and not to be able to speak, or to keep your speech, and to be the ugliest of all women; but away from me you must go."""
"And the Lassie said, ""I would sooner be lovely."" So she became all at once wondrous fair; but from that day forth she was dumb."
"So, when she went away from her Foster-mother, she walked and wandered through a great, great wood; but the farther she went, the farther off the end seemed to be. So, when the evening came on, she clomb up into a tall tree, which grew over a spring, and there she made herself up to sleep that night. Close by lay a castle, and from that castle came early every morning a maid to draw water to make the Prince's tea, from the spring over which the Lassie was sitting. So the maid looked down into the spring, saw the lovely face in the water, and thought it was her own; then she flung away the pitcher, and ran home; and, when she got there, she tossed up her head and said, ""If I'm so pretty, I'm far too good to go and fetch water."""
"So another maid had to go for the water, but the same thing happened to her; she went back and said she was far too pretty and too good to fetch water from the spring for the Prince. Then the Prince went himself, for he had a mind to see what all this could mean. So, when he reached the spring, he too saw the image in the water; but he looked up at once, and became aware of the lovely Lassie who sate there up in the tree. Then he coaxed her down and took her home; and at last made up his mind to have her for his queen, because she was so lovely; but his mother, who was still alive, was against it."
"""She can't speak,"" she said, ""and maybe she's a wicked witch."""
"But the Prince could not be content till he got her. So after they had lived together a while, the Lassie was to have a child, and when the child came to be born, the Prince set a strong watch about her; but at the birth one and all fell into a deep sleep, and her Foster-mother came, cut the babe on its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood; and said:"
"President Lincoln was not admired by a class of people in the North and South who heard with horror that he had at one time worked for ten dollars a month. They thought the President's salary too much for him, and feared that he would buy watermelons with it. They also feared that some day he might tell a funny story in the presence of Queen Victoria."
The snobocracy could hardly sleep nights for fear that Lincoln at a state dinner might put sugar and cream in his cold consommé.
"Jefferson Davis, it was said, knew more of etiquette in a minute than Lincoln knew all his life."
"The capture of Sumter united the North and unified the South. It made ""war Democrats"" i.e., Democrats who had voted against Lincoln join him in the prosecution of the war. More United States property was cheerfully appropriated by the Confederacy, which showed that it was alive and kicking from the very first minute it was born."
"Confederate troops were sent into Virginia and threatened the Capitol at Washington, and would have taken it if the city had not, in summer, been regarded as unhealthful."
"The Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, hurrying to the capital, was attacked in Baltimore and several men were killed. This was the first actual bloodshed in the civil war which caused rivers and lakes and torrents of the best blood of North and South to cover the fair, sweet clover fields and blue-grass meadows made alone for peace."
"The general opinion of the author, thirty-five years afterwards, is that the war was as unavoidable as the deluge, and as idiotic in its incipiency as Adam's justly celebrated defence in the great ""Apple Sass Case."""
"Men will fight until it is educated out of them, just as they will no doubt retain rudimentary tails and live in trees till they know better."
It's all owing to how a man was brought up.
"Of course after we have been drawn into the fight and been fined and sent home, we like to maintain that we were fighting for our home, or liberty, or the flag, or something of the kind. We hate to admit that, as a nation, we fought and paid for it afterwards with our family's bread-money just because we were irritated. That's natural; but most great wars are arranged by people who stay at home and sell groceries to the widow and orphan and old maids at one hundred per cent. advance."
"Arlington Heights and Alexandria were now seized and occupied by the Union troops for the protection of Washington, and mosquito-wires were put up in the Capitol windows to keep the largest of the rebels from coming in and biting Congress."
"Fort Monroe was garrisoned by a force under General Benjamin F. Butler, and an expedition was sent out against Big Bethel. On the way the Federal troops fired into each other, which pleased the Confederates very much indeed. The Union troops were repulsed with loss, and went back to the fort, where they stated that they were disappointed in the war."
"West Virginia was strongly for the Union in sentiment, and was set off from the original State of Virginia, and, after some fighting the first year of the war over its territory, came into line with the Northern States. The fighting here was not severe. Generals McClellan and Rosecrans (Union) and Lee (Confederate) were the principal commanders."
"The first year of the war was largely spent in sparring for wind, as one very able authority has it."
"In the next chapter reference will be made to the battle of Bull Run, and the odium will be placed where it belongs. The author reluctantly closes this chapter in order to go out and get some odium for that purpose."
CHAPTER XXV.
BULL RUN AND OTHER BATTLES.
"On the 21st of July, 1861, occurred the battle of Bull Run, under the joint management of General Irwin McDowell and General P. G. T."
"Beauregard. After a sharp conflict, the Confederates were repulsed, but rallied again under General T. J. Jackson, called thereafter Stonewall Jackson. While the Federals were striving to beat Jackson back, troops under Generals Early and Kirby Smith from Manassas Junction were hurled against their flank.[5] McDowell's men retreated, and as they reached the bridge a shell burst among their crowded and chaotic numbers. A caisson was upset, and a panic ensued, many of the troops continuing at a swift canter till they reached the Capitol, where they could call on the sergeant-at-arms to preserve order."
"As a result of this run on the banks of the Potomac, the North suddenly decided that the war might last a week or two longer than at first stated, that the foe could not be killed with cornstalks, and that a mistake had been made in judging that the rebellion wasn't loaded.[6]"
Half a million men were called for and five hundred million dollars voted. General George B. McClellan took command of the Army of the Potomac.
"The battle of Ball's Bluff resulted disastrously to the Union forces, and two thousand men were mostly driven into the Potomac, some drowned and others shot. Colonel Baker, United States Senator from Oregon, was killed."
"The war in Missouri now opened. Captain Lyon reserved the United States arsenal at St. Louis, and defeated Colonel Marmaduke at Booneville."
"General Sigel was defeated at Carthage, July 5, by the Confederates: so Lyon, with five thousand men, decided to attack more than twice that number of the enemy under Price and McCulloch, which he did, August 10, at Wilson's Creek. He was killed while making a charge, and his men were defeated."
"General Frémont then took command, and drove Price to Springfield, but he was in a short time replaced by General Hunter, because his war policy was offensive to the enemy. Hunter was soon afterwards removed, and Major-General Halleck took his place. Halleck gave general satisfaction to the enemy, and even his red messages from Washington, where he boarded during the war, were filled with nothing but kindness for the misguided foe."
"Davis early in the war commissioned privateers, and Lincoln blockaded the Southern ports. The North had but one good vessel at the time, and those who have tried to blockade four or five thousand miles of hostile coast with one vessel know full well what it is to be busy. The entire navy consisted of forty-two ships, and some of these were not seaworthy."
Some of them were so pervious that their guns had to be tied on to keep them from leaking through the cracks of the vessel.
"Hatteras Inlet was captured, and Commodore Dupont, aided by General Thomas W. Sherman, captured Port Royal Entrance and Tybee Island. Port Royal became the dépôt for the fleet."
"It was now decided at the South to send Messrs. Mason and Slidell to England, partly for change of scene and rest, and partly to make a friendly call on Queen Victoria and invite her to come and spend the season at Asheville, North Carolina. It was also hoped that she would give a few readings from her own works at the South, while her retinue could go to the front and have fun with the Yankees, if so disposed."
"These gentlemen, wearing their nice new broadcloth clothes, and with a court suit and suitable night-wear to use in case they should be pressed to stop a week or two at the castle, got to Havana safely, and took passage on the British ship Trent; but Captain Wilkes, of the United States steamer San Jacinto, took them off the Trent, just as Mr. Mason had drawn and fortunately filled a hand with which he hoped to pay a part of the war-debt of the South and get a new overcoat in London."
"Later, however, the United States disavowed this act of Captain Wilkes, and said it was only a bit of pleasantry on his part."
"The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he should get any hotter."
"It was then that he saw The Book of Beasts lying on the pebbles, open at the page with ""Dragon"" written at the bottom. He looked and he hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage, the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in."
"As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang."
"""Oh, hurrah!"" he cried. ""Now we really have done it."""
And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.
"""Oh, my precious Hippogriff,"" he cried. ""You are the bravest, dearest, most beautiful """
"""Hush,"" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. ""Don't you see that we are not alone?"""
"And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the Dragon to take them into the book with him it was a tight fit even for one Dragon so, of course, he had to leave them outside."
"They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after."
"When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged to be allowed to go back into the book. ""I do not care for public life,"""
he said.
"Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:"
"That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because there was no room for them in the book and the milk cans too."
"Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the Hippogriff's page of the book. ""I should like,"" he said, ""to live somewhere where Dragons can't get at me."""
"So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with."
"As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own Rocking Horse a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day."
"II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger"
The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.
"""What will you do when you grow up, Princess?"" asked the gardener's boy."
"""I should like to marry you, Tom,"" said the Princess. ""Would you mind?"""
"""No,"" said the gardener's boy. ""I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if you like if I have time."""
"For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography class."
"As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really are done. Then the Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across her throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear."
"When the Princess had been good all through the week for, like all real, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never bad Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on Wednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end of the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would say: ""Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?"" just as if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:"
"""Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep."""
"So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological Gardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig, and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some grown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose."
"There always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was kind except one."
"Now that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a thoughtful child as of course you are you will not need me to tell you what was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a thoughtful child and it is just possible of course that you are not I will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. All the animals were the wrong sizes! And this was how it happened."
"In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their proper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away by itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth flew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy mixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other side of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big spinning top."
"I am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography is never quite lively, and after all, I must give you a little information even in a fairy tale like the powder in jam."
"Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the shock was so great that it set them spinning together through the air which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of the things only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around they had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently Center of Gravity a great giant who was managing the whole business woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble."
"""Oh, I'm so fond of you, I couldn't help doing it when I knew that your heart lay there,"" said the Princess."
"""How can you be so silly as to believe any such thing?"" said the Giant."
"""Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when you say it?"" said the Princess."
"""You're a goose,"" said the Giant; ""where my heart is, you will never come."""
"""Well,"" said the Princess; ""but for all that, 'twould be such a pleasure to know where it really lies."""
"Then the poor Giant could hold out no longer, but was forced to say:"
"""Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on that island stands a church; in that church is a well; in that well swims a duck; in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart, you darling!"""
"In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the Giant strode off to the wood."
"""Yes! now I must set off too,"" said Boots; ""if I only knew how to find the way."" He took a long, long farewell of the Princess, and when he got out of the Giant's door, there stood the Wolf waiting for him. So Boots told him all that had happened inside the house, and said now he wished to ride to the well in the church, if he only knew the way. So the Wolf bade him jump on his back, he'd soon find the way; and away they went, till the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and dale. After they had travelled many, many days, they came at last to the lake. Then the Prince did not know how to get over it, but the Wolf bade him only not be afraid, but stick on, and so he jumped into the lake with the Prince on his back, and swam over to the island. So they came to the church; but the church keys hung high, high up on the top of the tower, and at first the Prince did not know how to get them down."
"""You must call on the raven,"" said the Wolf."
"So the Prince called on the raven, and in a trice the raven came, and flew up and fetched the keys, and so the Prince got into the church. But when he came to the well, there lay the duck, and swam about backwards and forwards, just as the Giant had said. So the Prince stood and coaxed it, till it came to him, and he grasped it in his hand; but just as he lifted it up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well, and then Boots was beside himself to know how to get it out again."
"""Well, now you must call on the salmon to be sure,"" said the Wolf; and the king's son called on the salmon, and the salmon came and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the well."
"Then the Wolf told him to squeeze the egg, and as soon as ever he squeezed it the Giant screamed out."
"""Squeeze it again,"" said the Wolf; and when the Prince did so, the Giant screamed still more piteously, and begged and prayed so prettily to be spared, saying he would do all that the Prince wished if he would only not squeeze his heart in two."
"""Tell him, if he will restore to life again your six brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone, you will spare his life,"""
"said the Wolf. Yes, the Giant was ready to do that, and he turned the six brothers into king's sons again, and their brides into king's daughters."
"""Now, squeeze the egg in two,"" said the Wolf. So Boots squeezed the egg to pieces, and the Giant burst at once."
"Now, when he had made an end of the Giant, Boots rode back again on the Wolf to the Giant's house, and there stood all his six brothers alive and merry, with their brides. Then Boots went into the hill-side after his bride, and so they all set off home again to their father's house. And you may fancy how glad the old king was when he saw all his seven sons come back, each with his bride ""But the loveliest bride of all is the bride of Boots, after all,"" said the king, ""and he shall sit uppermost at the table, with her by his side."""
"So he sent out, and called a great wedding-feast, and the mirth was both loud and long, and if they have not done feasting, why, they are still at it."
THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL
"Once on a time there was a man who had a meadow, which lay high up on the hill-side, and in the meadow was a barn, which he had built to keep his hay in. Now, I must tell you, there hadn't been much in the barn for the last year or two, for every St. John's night, when the grass stood greenest and deepest, the meadow was eaten down to the very ground the next morning, just as if a whole drove of sheep had been there feeding on it over night. This happened once, and it happened twice; so at last the man grew weary of losing his crop of hay, and said to his sons for he had three of them, and the youngest was nicknamed Boots, of course that now one of them must go and sleep in the barn in the outlying field when St. John's night came, for it was too good a joke that his grass should be eaten, root and blade, this year, as it had been the last two years. So whichever of them went must keep a sharp look-out; that was what their father said."
"Well, the eldest son was ready to go and watch the meadow; trust him for looking after the grass! It shouldn't be his fault if man or beast, or the fiend himself, got a blade of grass. So, when evening came, he set off to the barn, and lay down to sleep; but a little on in the night came such a clatter, and such an earthquake, that walls and roof shook, and groaned, and creaked; then up jumped the lad, and took to his heels as fast as ever he could; nor dared he once look round till he reached home; and as for the hay, why it was eaten up this year just as it had been twice before."
"The next St. John's night, the man said again, it would never do to lose all the grass in the outlying field year after year in this way, so one of his sons must just trudge off to watch it, and watch it well too. Well, the next oldest son was ready to try his luck, so he set off, and lay down to sleep in the barn as his brother had done before him; but as the night wore on, there came on a rumbling and quaking of the earth, worse even than on the last St. John's night, and when the lad heard it, he got frightened, and took to his heels as though he were running a race."
"Next year the turn came to Boots; but when he made ready to go, the other two began to laugh and to make game of him, saying:"
"""You're just the man to watch the hay, that you are; you, who have done nothing all your life but sit in the ashes and toast yourself by the fire."""
"But Boots did not care a pin for their chattering, and stumped away as evening grew on, up the hill-side to the outlying field. There he went inside the barn and lay down; but in about an hour's time the barn began to groan and creak, so that it was dreadful to hear."
"""Well,"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I can stand it well enough."""
"A little while after came another creak and an earthquake, so that the litter in the barn flew about the lad's ears. ""Oh!"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I daresay I can stand it out."""
"But just then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake, so that the lad thought walls and roof were coming down on his head; but it passed off, and all was still as death about him."
"years. What then would be said if I----"""
"""Nay, then,"" cried Maria Cristina, ""stay where you are, Susana. For me,"
"I am none so nice. I will go myself. Do not follow me, Fernando!"" And"
"with that she ran to the door, and her feet were heard flitting up the"
stairway which led to the servants' wing of the palace. Muñoz made as if
"to accompany her, but remembering his wife's prohibition, he did not"
"proceed farther than the door, where, with a curious smile upon his"
"face, he stood listening to the voice of the Queen-Regent upraised in"
alternate appeal and rebuke.
"During the interval, while the Sergeant and El Sarria were looking to"
"their stores and munitions, Rollo approached the waiting-maid, Susana,"
"and inquired of her the way to the armoury, where he expected to find"
store of arms and powder.
"""If this young maid will go also, I will conduct you thither, young"
"man!"" said Susana, primly."
"And holding Concha firmly by the hand, she took up a candle and led the"
way.
But to Rollo's surprise they found the armoury wholly sacked. All the
valuable guns had been removed by the deserting guards. The gun racks
were torn down. The floor of beaten earth was strewed with flints of
ancient pieces of last century's manufacture. The barrels of
"bell-mouthed blunderbusses leaned against the wall, the stocks, knocked"
"off in mere wantonness, were piled in corners; and in all the chests and"
wall-presses there was not an ounce of powder to be found.
"While Rollo was searching, Señor Muñoz appeared at the door, languid and"
careless as ever. He watched the young Scot opening chests and rummaging
"slow degrees. In the reign of Henry VIII, again, nothing came of"
"the English expeditions of discovery fitted out by him (Schanz,"
"_Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 321), but private voyages were"
"successfully made by traders (_id._ pp. 321, 327)."
"In the seventeenth century, however, and until far on in the"
"eighteenth, all Dutch shipping was more economically managed than"
the English. In all likelihood the Dutch traders knew and improved
upon the systematic control of ship-construction which the
"Venetians and Genoese had first copied from the Byzantines, and in"
"turn developed. (Above, p. 197.) Raleigh was one of the first to"
point out that the broad Dutch boats carried more cargo with fewer
hands than those of any other nation (_Observations touching
"Trade_, in _Works_, ed. 1829, viii, 356). Later in the century"
Petty noted that the Dutch practised freight-economies and
"adaptations of every kind, having different sorts of vessels for"
different kinds of traffic (_Essays in Political Arithmetic_
"[1690], ed. 1699, pp. 179, 180, 182, 183). This again gave them the"
primacy in shipbuilding for the whole of Europe (_Mémoires de Jean
"De Witt_, ptie. i, ch. vi), though they imported all the materials"
"for the purpose. When Colbert began navy-building, his first care"
"was to bring in Dutch shipwrights (Dussieux, _Étude biographique"
"sur Colbert_, 1886, p. 101). Compare, as to the quick sailing of"
"the Dutch, Motley, _United Netherlands_, ed. 1867, iv, 556. In the"
next century the English marine had similar economic advantages
"over the French, which was burdened by royal schemes for"
"multiplying seamen (see Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 37)."
"The frugality which pervaded the whole of Dutch life may, however,"
have had one directly disastrous effect. Sir William Temple noted
that the common people were poorly fed (_Observations upon the
"United Provinces_, ch. iv: Works, ed. 1814, i, 133, 147); and"
"temporal, but the things which are unseen are spiritual.” To those who"
"wish to try the effect of such stories on children, I present for their"
encouragement the following lines from Whitcomb Riley:
THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN.[39]
"Oh, the night was dark and the night was late,"
When the robbers came to rob him;
"And they picked the lock of his palace-gate,"
The robbers who came to rob him--
"They picked the lock of the palace-gate,"
Seized his jewels and gems of State
"His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--"
The robbers that came to rob him.
But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
For of what had the robbers robbed him?
"Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,"
"When the robbers came to rob him,--"
They robbed him not of a golden shred
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
"“And they're welcome to all things else,” he said,"
When the robbers came to rob him.
"There is a great deal of this romantic spirit, combined with a"
"delightful sense of irresponsibility, which I claim above all things"
"for small children, to be found in our old Nursery Rhymes. I quote from"
the following article written by the Rev. R. L. Gales for the _Nation_.
After speaking on the subject of Fairy Stories being eliminated from
"the school curriculum, the writer adds:"
"Jay T. Stocking, 1870-1936, “O Master Workman” (93)"
"Wm. M. Vories, 1880—, “Let there be light, Lord God” (353)"
"Harry Webb Farrington, 1880-1931, “I know not how that” (99)"
"W. Russel Bowie, 1882—, “Lord, through changing days” (402)"
"Howard Arnold Walter, 1884-1918, “I would be true” (207)"
"Earl Marlatt, 1892—, “‘Are ye able,’ said the Master” (392)"
11. Gospel Songs.
"During the latter part of the 19th century there came into use, both in"
"the United States and in England, a type of religious song known as the"
"Gospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales or the English hymns,"
these songs made a popular appeal and were widely used in prayer
meetings and revivals.
The words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily
remembered and concern themselves largely with the individual’s
salvation. The personal pronouns “I” and “my” predominate. The tunes are
rhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies are
"largely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords. The"
masses of the people readily learned to sing these tunes and experienced
a thrill in singing them which the use of the more stately and solid
hymns failed to effect.
The great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the latter
half of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large mass
"meetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the 1870’s,"
"1880’s, and 1890’s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence and"
the Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every country in the
world. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions of copies and
"every denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by this"
[17] It was a bad day for the cause of truth when Foxe's _Book of
Martyrs_ was allowed to go out of general circulation. When I was a boy
it was no uncommon thing to see copies of it in American homes. Now it
is rarely seen. A new and corrected edition of it ought to be brought
out and given wide circulation. There have been not a few indications
this year that our people are forgetting some of the most instructive
"history of all the past, and those who seem to be most oblivious of it"
are the editors of some of the secular newspapers.
"[18] There are other indications of some improvement in this matter,"
"but an Anglican resident in Italy, quoted by the _Review of Reviews_ as"
"""a painstaking and fair-minded"" witness, says, ""People are not shocked"
"by clerical immorality, but regard it as natural and inevitable."" To an"
Anglican friend a Roman prelate lamented that a certain cardinal was
"not elected at the late conclave. But the Anglican replied, ""He is a"
"man of conspicuous immorality."" ""No doubt,"" was the answer, ""but you"
Americans seem to think there is no virtue but chastity. The Cardinal
"has not that, but he is an honest man."""
CHAPTER XXXII.
THE OLD FORCES AND THE NEW IN THE ETERNAL CITY.
[Sidenote: An Audience with the Pope.]
"Well, we have seen the Pope. Hearing that a body of Italian pilgrims"
"were to be received by the pontiff at the Vatican, and having assured"
"He turned to the landlady. ""What's the address here, sister?"""
"And later, with the landlady back in her lair, Brent Taber sat down on"
the stairs to wait; sat there with surprise at the feeling of relief
that filled his mind. He had no feeling of triumph about it; no sense of
"a job well done. But there was no great guilt at having failed, either."
"Mostly, he thought, it was the simplification that had come about. There"
had been so many confusing and bewildering complications in the affair;
improbability piled on the impossible; the ridiculous coupled with the
incredible.
"But now, with one stroke of a knife, it had been simplified and brought"
into terms everyone could understand; into terms Captain Abrams of the
New York Police Department would grasp in an instant.
A killer was on the loose.

One of Senator Crane's priceless gifts was a sense of timing. Much of
his success had sprung from the instinctive knowledge of when to act. He
"had a sense of the dramatic which never deserted him. As a result, he"
had been known to turn in an instant from one subject to another--to
dodge defeats and score triumphs with bewildering agility.
His preoccupation on this particular day was with a home-state
"issue--the location of a government plant. After he obtained the floor,"
he counted the house and noted that only a bare quorum was present.
"Gradually, the members of the Senate of the United States would drift to"
their seats. So Crane began reading letters which tended to support his

27. An appeal may be had from any decision of a Court of Admiralty under
this Act to the same tribunal and in the same manner to and in which an

as a Court of Admiralty.

28. Subject to the provisions of this Act providing for the award of
damages in certain cases in respect of the seizure or detention of a
"ship by the Court of Admiralty no damages shall be payable, and no"

"criminally, in respect of the seizure or detention of any ship in"
pursuance of this Act.

Authority.]
"29. The Secretary of State shall not, nor shall the chief executive"
"authority, be responsible in any action or other legal proceedings"
"whatsoever for any warrant issued by him in pursuance of this Act, or be"
"examinable as a witness, except at his own request, in any court of"
justice in respect of the circumstances which led to the issue of the
warrant.
_Interpretation Clause._
[Sidenote: Interpretation of Terms.]
"30. In this Act, if not inconsistent with the context, the following"
"""Immortal Jehoshaphat!"" said Captain Prowse; ""here's a go!  What, we"
"with passengers?  Oh, get out!"""
"""You've got to take 'em,"" said the agent philosophically; ""maybe"
"they'll teach you something, and it'll be a good advertisement."""
"""Gah'n!"" said Prowse; ""carryin' scientific jossers won't bring better"
freight next season.  I wish you'd get me chock up with cattle.  I
can't stand scientists; my sister married one that was an 'erbalist
in the Old Kent Road--and since he went to chokey I've lost conceit
"with science.  However, if it must be--why, send 'em along!"""
Captain Prowse was not a popular skipper with sailors.  They said
"that he was a ""hard nut"" and a ""sailor-robber,"" and that his American"
experience had made him nearly as deadly as any American captain with
a belaying-pin.  But sailors' experience only works backward: they
"are good at reminiscence only, and the _Nemagosenda_ got a crew in"
spite of the captain's reputation.  It is possible they would not
have shipped if they had known that men of European light and leading
were to come with them.  Those who follow the sea have a great
"respect for knowledge, but they despise men in soft hats and"
spectacles.  And it cannot be denied that scientific men are as a
rule too simple and gentle to look as if they could take care of
"themselves.  According to Jack, that is the first duty of man, though"

"JAVANESE DANCERS,"
"TWITCHED strings, the clang of metal, beaten drums."
"Dull, shrill, continuous, disquieting;"
And now the stealthy dancer comes
Undulantly with cat-like steps that cling;
"Smiling between her painted lids a smile,"
"Motionless, unintelligible, she twines"
"Her fingers into mazy lines,"
Twining her scarves across them all the while.
"One, two, three, four step forth, and, to and fro,"
"Delicately and imperceptibly,"
"Now swaying gently in a row,"
"Now interthreading slow and rhythmically,"
"Still with fixed eyes, monotonously still,"
"Mysteriously, with smiles inanimate,"
"With lingering feet that undulate,"
"With sinuous fingers, spectral hands that thrill,"
"The little amber-coloured dancers move,"
"Like little painted figures on a screen,"
Or phantom-dancers haply seen
Among the shadows of a magic grove.
The Captain in such cases put on a serious face and began speaking with
"killing irony on the theme of weakness of character, of the animal"
"delight of intoxication, and on such subjects as suited the occasion."
One must do him justice: he was captivated by his role of mentor and
"moralist, but the lodgers dogged him, and, listening sceptically to his"
"exhortations to repentance, would whisper aside to each other:"
"""Cunning, skilful, shifty rogue!  I told you so, but you would not"
"listen.  It's your own fault!"""
"""His honour is really a good soldier.  He goes first and examines the"
"road behind him!"""
The teacher then hunted here and there till he found his friend again
"in some corner, and grasping his dirty coat, trembling and licking his"
"dry lips, looked into his face with a deep, tragic glance, without"
articulate words.
"""Can't you?"" asked the Captain sullenly."
The teacher answered by bowing his head and letting it fall on his
"breast, his tall, thin body trembling the while."
"""Wait another day ... perhaps you will be all right then,"" proposed"
"Kuvalda.  The teacher sighed, and shook his head hopelessly."
The Captain saw that his friend's thin body trembled with the thirst
"for the poison, and took some money from his pocket."
"""In the majority of cases it is impossible to fight against fate,"" said"
"he, as if trying to justify himself before someone. But if the teacher"
"shove in a dash of what he would prescribe, night and morning.  Perfect"
"quiet.  No stimulant.  A little cup of strong coffee without milk, if he"
seemed low.  Keep him in bed at present.  No worry; no excitement. Young
"man still.  Plenty of vitality.  As to herself, no undue anxiety."
To-morrow they would see whether a night nurse would be necessary.  Above
"all, no violin for a month, no alcohol--in every way the strictest"
"moderation!  And with a last and friendliest wink, leaning heavily on"
"that word ""moderation,"" he took out a stylographic pen, scratched on a"
"leaf of his note-book, shook Gyp's hand, smiled whimsically, buttoned his"
"upper waistcoat, and departed."
Gyp went back to her seat by the bed.  Irony!  She whose only desire was
"to be let go free, was mainly responsible for his breakdown!  But for"
"her, there would be nothing on his mind, for he would not be married!"
"Brooding morbidly, she asked herself--his drinking, debts, even the"
"girl--had she caused them, too?  And when she tried to free him and"
herself--this was the result!  Was there something fatal about her that
must destroy the men she had to do with?  She had made her father
"unhappy, Monsieur Harmost--Rosek, and her husband!  Even before she"
"married, how many had tried for her love, and gone away unhappy!  And,"
"getting up, she went to a mirror and looked at herself long and sadly."
XX
"Three days after her abortive attempt to break away, Gyp, with much"
"heart-searching, wrote to Daphne Wing, telling her of Fiorsen's illness,"
"and mentioning a cottage near Mildenham, where--if she liked to go--she"
"would be quite comfortable and safe from all curiosity, and finally"
begging to be allowed to make good the losses from any broken
"There was a train back to Cagliari that night, said the conductor, at"
which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting
seed-pod. He bounced on his seat. What good was that? What good was a
"train back to Cagliari, when their home was in Snelli! Making matters"
worse--
"So they bounced and jerked and argued at one another, to their hearts'"
"content. Then the conductor retired, smiling subtly, in a way they have."
"Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and"
"said it was a shame. Yes, we chimed, it _was_ a shame. Whereupon a"
self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari
advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert
"sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded"
"face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed."
"It had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed, even"
while the q-b shed a few tears.
*       *       *       *       *
"Well, the journey lasted hours. We came to a station, and the conductor"
said we must get out: these coaches went no further. Only two coaches
"would proceed to Mandas. So we climbed out with our traps, and our fat"
"friend with his saddle-bag, the picture of misery."
The one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded. The only other
coach was most of it first-class. And the rest of the train was freight.
We were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string
of freight-vans and trucks.
"There was an empty seat, so we sat on it: only to realize after about"
"five minutes, that a thin old woman with two children--her"
We all tried in vain to stand with heels and back to the inside of the
north wall on the ground floor--it cannot be done; one falls forward
at once. From the top there is a magnificent view of the city and the
"surrounding plain, of the mountains on the east and the sea on the"
"west, of the city of Leghorn and the island of Elba."
From the windows of our hotel at Pisa we saw for the first time the
red gold of ripe oranges shining amid their dark green leaves in the
"gardens, and rejoiced to think that at last we had reached a somewhat"
"milder climate, and were now leaving rigorous winter behind us."
"The journey from Pisa to Rome is a long one, and the schedule was such"
that we did not arrive till late at night. From the car windows we had
"some impressive views of the Mediterranean by moonlight, and of the"
"solemn campagna, and, thus prepared, we crossed the Tiber at midnight,"
and passed through the breach in the walls which has been made for the
"railway, feeling, perhaps even more deeply than is usual, the thrill"
with which all travellers except those who are utterly devoid of
imagination first enter the Eternal City.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
SOME LITTLE ADVENTURES BY THE WAY.
"_December 21, 1902._"
[Sidenote: Conditions Unfavorable to Letter-writing Abroad.]
"... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did"
"her hair, soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just"
to one side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies.
"Those pansies made a picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them."
"I thought to-night, when I looked at my lady, “Now, if only the pansies"
was there no one could tell the difference.”
"... Only the last year, madam. Only after she’d got a"
"little—well—feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never"
dangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was—she
"thought she’d lost something. She couldn’t keep still, she couldn’t"
"settle. All day long she’d be up and down, up and down; you’d meet her"
"everywhere,—on the stairs, in the porch, making for the kitchen. And"
"she’d look up at you, and she’d say—just like a child, “I’ve lost it,"
"I’ve lost it.” “Come along,” I’d say, “come along, and I’ll lay out"
your patience for you.” But she’d catch me by the hand—I was a
"favourite of hers—and whisper, “Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for me.”"
"Sad, wasn’t it?"
"... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last"
"words she ever said was—very slow, “Look in—the—Look—in—” And then she"
was gone.
"... No, madam, I can’t say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you"
"see, it’s like this, I’ve got nobody but my lady. My mother died of"
"consumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept"
a hair-dresser’s shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a
"table dressing my doll’s hair—copying the assistants, I suppose. They"
"were ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the"
"latest fashions and all. And there I’d sit all day, quiet as quiet—the"
customers never knew. Only now and again I’d take my peep from under
"""So it is, after all, a bargain that you offer me!"" he said. ""You are"
"trying to save them. You offer a high price, but I am not a merchant."
"I can not buy you, Beatrice."""
"""It is not a bargain!"" For the first time she faltered, taken aback by"
"the pitiless logic of his words. ""Can't you see that? Can't you see"
"that, however much I loved you, I could not act otherwise than implore"
you to turn back from a step that means destruction for those bound to
"me by blood and country? Could I do less?"""
"""No,"" he said slowly."
She held out her hands to him.
"""Oh, Nehal, turn back while there is yet time! For my sake, for yours,"
"for us all, turn back from a bloody, cruel revenge. The power is"
"yours. Be generous. If we have wronged you, we have suffered and are"
"ready to atone. _I_ am ready to atone. I _can_ atone, because I love"
you. I have spoken the truth to you. I have laid my soul bare to you
"as I have done to no other being. Won't you trust me?"""
"His eyes met hers with a somber, hopeless significance which cut her"
to the heart.
"""I can't,"" he said. ""I can't. That is what you have taught me--to"
"distrust you--and every one."""
"She stood silent now, paralyzed by the finality of his words and"
gesture. It was as though the shadow of her heartless folly had risen
"before her and become an iron wall of unrelenting, measured"
retribution against which she beat herself in vain. He lifted his head
"higher, seeming to gather together his shaken powers of self-control."
"In less than a week Cæsar remained alone, knowing nobody in the hotel,"
and despite his believing that he was going to be perfectly indifferent
"about this, he felt deserted and sad. The influence of the springtime"
"also affected him. The deep blue sky, cloudless, dense, dark, made him"
"languish. Instead of entertaining himself with something or other, he"
did scarcely anything all day long but walk.
_TWO ABSURD MEN_
"“I have continually near me in the hotel,” wrote Cæsar to Alzugaray,"
“two absurd fellows: one is one of those stout red Germans with a square
"head; the other a fine slim Norwegian. The German, who is a captain in"
"some service or other, is a restless man, always busy about what the"
"devil I don’t know. He is constantly carrying about trunks and boxes,"
"with the aid of a sorrowful valet, dressed in black, who appears to"
detest his position. The captain must devote the morning to doing
"gymnastics, for I hear him from my room, which is next to his, jumping"
"and dropping weights on the floor, each of which must weigh half a ton,"
to judge by the noise they make.
"“He does all this to vocal commands, and when some feat doesn’t go right"
he reprimands himself.
"“This German isn’t still a moment; he opens the salon door, crosses the"
"room, stands at the window, takes up a paper, puts it down. He is a type"
that makes me nervous.
"“The Norwegian at first appeared to be a reasonable man, somewhat"
"The police launch sheered off, and the sound of her exhaust grew"
rapidly fainter and fainter. But not until it had wholly ceased did Big
George give over his post at the wheel. Even then he went down the
"ladder reluctantly, and without a word of thanks, of explanation, or of"
apology. With him this had been but a part of the day's work. He saw
neither sentiment nor humor in the episode. The clang of the
"deep-throated ship's bell spoke the hour, and, taking Cherry's arm,"
Boyd helped her to the deck.
"""Now let's eat something,"" said she."
"""Yes,"" he agreed, relief and triumph in his tone, ""and drink something,"
"too."""
"""We'll drink to the health of 'Fingerless' Fraser."""
"""To the health of 'Fingerless' Fraser,"" he echoed. ""We will drink that"
"standing."""
"A week later, after an uneventful voyage across a sea of glass, _The"
Bedford Castle_ made up through a swirling tide-rip and into the

them from Flattery had dropped astern at first sight of the volcanic
"headlands, and now countless thousands of sea-parrots fled from the"

bodies across the sea as a boy skips a flat rock. It had been Captain
"Peasley's hope, here at the gateway of the Misty Sea, to learn"
"something about the lay of the big ice-floes to the northward, but he"
"was disappointed, for the season was yet too young for the"
"revenue-cutters, and the local hunters knew nothing. Forced to rely on"
"luck and his own skill, he steamed out again the next day, this time"

"Martyanoff would have broken his bones, had not Kuvalda interrupted"
with:
"""Leave him alone....  Is this a home to you or even to us? You have no"

"reason than he for living with us."""
"""Well, then, Devil take him! ...  We all live in the world without"
"sufficient reason....  We live, and why?  Because!  He also because ..."
"let him alone...."""
"""But it is better for you, young man, to go away from us,"" the teacher"
"advised him, looking him up and down with his sad eyes. He made no"
"answer, but remained.  And they soon became accustomed to his presence,"
"and ceased to take any notice of him.  But he lived among them, and"
observed everything.
"The above were the chief members of the Captain's company, and he"
"called them with kind-hearted sarcasm ""Creatures that once were men."""
For though there were men who had experienced as much of the bitter
"irony of fate as these men, yet they were not fallen so low.  Not"
"infrequently, respectable men belonging to the cultured classes are"
"inferior to those belonging to the peasantry, and it is always a fact"
that the depraved man from the city is immeasurably worse than the
depraved man from the village.  This fact was strikingly illustrated by
the contrast between the formerly well-educated men and the mujiks who
were living in Kuvalda's shelter.
The representative of the latter class was an old mujik called Tyapa.

"“Jack wants to know can you spare him a few minutes, sir,” he explained."
“There’s a bit of trouble down below.”
"“What kind of trouble?” Bob asked swiftly, turning downstream without an"
instant’s delay; and walking by the side of the dynamite man.
"Calker scratched his head slowly. “I ain’t quite certain sure, Mr."
"Bainbridge,” he drawled, “but I got a idea there’s a fellow with a mill"
who’s run out a sortin’ boom that’s goin’ to hang up our drive if we
ain’t mighty keerful.”
"“A mill!” exclaimed Bob incredulously. “Why, there isn’t such a thing"
"within twenty miles--at least, there wasn’t three months ago.”"
Calker grinned. “Thought it looked kinda new. I couldn’t rightly say
"that it’s finished, but there ain’t no manner of a doubt about the boom."
"The jam had started before I come away, an’ I left Jack havin’ it hot"
an’ heavy with a red-headed son of a gun who sure looked as if scrap was
his middle name.”
"Bainbridge frowned, but asked no further questions. He scarcely spoke,"
"in fact, during all of the four miles, but it was evident to his"
observing companion that he was doing a lot of thinking.
Long before reaching the point of obstruction it became evident that
"another jam had formed. The current grew more and more sluggish, and the"
"progress of the logs downstream became slower and slower, until at"
length the entire surface of the water was covered with floating timber.
These in turn crowded upon one another with a rapidity which threatened
to equal that first jam unless something was swiftly done.
"all the world to see,"" returned Betty, arching her eyebrows."
"""To whom would it be directed, Betty?"" I asked, to tease her."
"A faint expression of reproach came to her eyes, but after a moment of"
"pretty hesitancy, she answered boldly:--"
"""Since you are so unwise as to ask, I'll answer in like folly. The letter"
"could be directed to but one person in the world--you."""
"I had received more than I had expected, and though I longed to make a"
"suitable return, I dared not for the sake of my vows, so we all remained"

"Turning to Frances, I said: ""If you don't want me to read your letter,"
"I'll give you the key, and you may make it into cipher."" But after"
"examining the key, she declared that she could never learn to use it, and"
I suggested that she write a shorter letter in terms fit for a modest man
to read.
"The next day she handed me a shorter letter, saying that she had cut and"
"pruned it till there was nothing left worth sending, but I assured her"
that George would think otherwise.
"When I read the letter, my eyes were opened to the fact that there was"
more fire in Frances's heart than I had supposed any woman capable of
holding in subjection. But that is a mistake often made by men.
"This was my cousin's ""cut and pruned"" letter:--"
"""DEAR ONE:"
“Of course it is--a delightful one--to see dear Yvonne and yourself.
Where are you staying?”
"“At the Océan,” said the Canon, “and you must all come and dine with us"
this evening.”
“And will you come to the _bal_ here afterward?” asked Sophia. “Evan has
run across some college friends--or won’t you think it proper?”
"“I am going to wear the whole suit of motley while I am here,” replied"
the Canon gaily.
"He kept his word, not being a man of half measures. No check should be"
"placed on Yvonne’s enjoyment. She had been moping, as far as Yvonne could"
"mope, during the latter dullness of Fulminster; now she expanded like a"
flower to the gaiety around her. The Canon found an aesthetic pleasure
in watching her happiness. Her expressions of thanks too were charmingly
"conveyed. Since that unfortunate attempt on his part, over a twelvemonth"
"back, to instruct her in the responsibilities of her position, she had"
never exhibited toward him such spontaneous feeling. He let her smile
"upon whom she would, without a twinge of jealousy."
Yvonne enjoyed herself hugely. She danced and jested with the young men;
"she chattered in French to her table d’hôte neighbours, delighted to"
speak her mother’s tongue again; she staked two-franc pieces on the
"public table, and one afternoon came out of the gaming-room into the"
"great hall where the Canon was sitting with Mrs. Winstanley, and poured"
a great mass of silver on to the table--as much as her two small hands
joined could carry.
"“I thought gambling was against your principles, Everard,” said Mrs."
"gone in."""
"I stand there waiting to be at hand, to rush in to the rescue, for after"
"all I am a human being, not a brute. Several minutes pass. He has not even"
"bothered to be very quiet, for I hear him clicking the key in the lock."
"Surely I ought to hear a cry now? I hear nothing, nothing; a chair"
"scraping across the floor, that is all."
"""But good heavens, he may do her some harm! He may injure her; he may"
overpower her with rape! Ought I not to tap on the window? I--what for?
"But at the very first cry, I shall be on the spot, take my word for it."""
Not a single cry.
The hours pass; I have settled down to wait. Of course I cannot go my way
and desert a helpless woman. But the hours wear on. A very thorough
"business in there, nothing niggardly about this; it is almost dawn. It"
"occurs to me that he may be killing her, perhaps has killed her already; I"
am alarmed and about to get up--when the key clicks in the lock again and
"Solem emerges. He does not run, but walks back the way he came, down to"
the veranda of my own house. There he hangs the actor's raincoat where it
"hung before, and emerges again. But this time he is naked. He has been"
naked under the coat all this time. Is it possible? Why not? No
"inhibitions, no restraint, no covering; Solem has thought it all out. Now,"
"stark naked, he stalks to his room."
What a man!
I sit thinking and collecting myself and regaining my wits. What has
"happened? The south wing is still wrapped in silence, but the lady is not"
"dead; I can see that from Solem's fearless manner as he goes to his room,"
"lights the lamp, and goes to bed."
"The English author had met a colleague, with whom he stayed behind"
"talking, and Marchmont remained in the “hall,” as if it did not seem to"
him proper for him to go to his wife’s rooms.
"Susanna’s rooms were very high, had balconies on the Via Veneto, and"
were almost opposite Queen Margherita’s palace. One overlooked the
"garden and could see the Queen Mother taking her walks, which is not"
without its importance for persons who live in a republic.
Susanna was most amiable to Laura; repeated to all of them her
invitation to come and see her again; and after they had all promised
"to see one another frequently, Cæsar and Laura went down to their"
"carriage, and took a turn on the Corso by twilight."
XIII. ESTHETICS AND DEMAGOGY
_SUSANNA AND THE YOUNGSTERS_
"From this meeting on, Cæsar noticed that Marchmont paid court to Laura"
"with much persistence. A light-hearted, coquettish woman, it pleased"
"Laura to be pursued by a person like this Englishman, young,"
"distinguished, and rich; but she was not prepared to yield. Her"
"bringing-up, her class-feelings impelled her to consider adultery a"
"heinous thing. Nor was divorce a solution for her, since accepting it"
would oblige her to cease being a Catholic and to quarrel irrevocably
with the Cardinal. Marchmont showed no discretion in the way he paid
"court to Laura; he cared nothing about his wife, and talked of her with"
profound contempt....
In practical agriculture my father was among Indians one of the first to
"start a tea industry in Assam, now regarded as one of the most"
flourishing. He gave practically everything in the starting of some
Weaving Mills. He stood by this and many other efforts in industrial
developments. The success of which I spoke did not come till long
after--too late for him to see it. He had come before the country was
"ready, and it happened to him as it must happen to all pioneers. Every"
one of his efforts failed and the crash came. And a great burden fell on
us which was only lifted by our united effects just before his work here
was over.
A failure? Yes but not ignoble or altogether futile. Since it was
through the witnessing of this struggle that the son learned to look on
"success or failure as one, to realise that some defeat was greater than"
"victory. And if my life in any way proved to be fruitful, then that came"
through the realisation of this lesson.
To me his life had been one of blessing and daily thanksgiving.
Nevertheless every one had said that he wrecked his life which was meant
for far greater things. Few realise that out of the skeletons of myriad
lives have been built vast continents. And it is on the wreck of a life
like his and of many such lives there will be built the Greater India
"yet to be. We do not know why it should be so, but we do know that the"
Earth Mother is hungry for sacrifice.
QUEST OF TRUTH AND DUTY
"Sir Jagadis Chandra Bose delivered the following Address, on the 25th"
"school and partly on the Continent during leave. Dawson, who was"
"evidently very proud of his young pupil and assistant, paraded his"
"accomplishments before us rather to Trehayne's embarrassment. ""Try him"
"with French and German,"" urged Dawson. ""He can chatter them as well as"
English. But he is as close as wax in all three languages. Some men
"can't keep their tongues still in one."""
"I turned to Trehayne and spoke in French: ""German I can't abide, but"
"French I love. My vocabulary is extensive, but my accent"
abominable--incurably British. You can hear it for yourself how it
"gives me away."""
"""It is not quite of Paris,"" replied Trehayne. ""Mais vous parlez"
"francais tres bien, tres correctement. Beaucoup mieux que moi."""
"""Non, non, monsieur,"" I protested, and then reverted to English."
"""Now,"" said Dawson, when Trehayne had left us, ""I must get along, see"
"the Commander of the _Malplaquet_, and draw a uniform and rifle out of"
the marine stores. It will be quite like old times. You won't see me
"until Saturday, when I shall be either a triumphant or a broken man."
"What is the betting, Mr. Copplestone?"""
"I could not understand the quizzical little smile that Dawson gave me,"
nor the humorous twitch of his lips. He had contemptuously disclaimed
"all use of theories, yet there was more moving behind that big"
forehead of his than he chose to give away. Did his ideas run on
parallel lines with mine; did he even suspect that I had formed any
"idea at all? I could not inquire, for I dislike being laughed at,"
"especially by this man Dawson. I had nothing to go upon, at least so"
little that was palpable that anything which I might say would be
"dismissed as the merest guesswork, for which, as Dawson proclaimed, he"
sleep. Good-night.”
"“Good-night,” she said miserably."
"And so, without touch of hand, they parted."
"The hours of the evening wore on, and night came. At last she cried"
herself to sleep. It had been a day of tears.
They left Ostend quietly the following morning by the Dover boat. During
the whole journey the Canon treated Yvonne with the deferential courtesy
"he could always assume to women, seeing to her comforts, anticipating"
"her wants, even exchanging now and then casual remarks on passing"
objects of interest. But of the subject next his heart he said not a
word. The crossing was smooth. The sea air revived Yvonne’s strength.
"His silence half comforted, half frightened her. Had he relented? She"
"glanced often at his impassive face, in cruel anxiety to pierce to the"
thoughts that lay behind. Yet a little hope came to her; for fear of
losing it she dared not speak. To her simple mind it seemed impossible
that merely conscientious scruples could make him cast her off. If he
"loved her, his love would triumph. If he persisted in his resolve, he"
cared for her no longer. In this case her future was very simple. She
would go back to London and sing.
She seemed to have cried her feeling away during the night--such as he
had left unbruised and untorn. For the quivering flesh is only sensitive
up to a certain point of maceration. He had trodden upon her pitilessly;
"but she felt no resentment. In fact, she would have been quite happy if"
"he had put his arms round her and said, “Let us forget, Yvonne.” By the"
end of the journey she had cajoled herself into the idea that he would
do so.

The work of exploring the planets that swung with Earth around the sun
"was still a new branch of the service. Less than ten years ago, it had"
"been, when Ansen devised his first crude atomic motor."
"At once, with the introduction of this tremendous new motive power,"
"men had begun to build space ships and explore the sky. And, as so"
"often happens with a new invention, the thing had grown rather beyond"
itself.
Everywhere amateur space flyers launched forth into the heavens to try
their new celestial wings. Everywhere young and old enthusiasts set
Ansen motors into clumsily insulated shells and started for Mars or
the moon or Venus.
"The resultant loss of life, as might have been foreseen, was"
appalling. Eager but inexperienced explorers edged over onto the wrong
side of Mercury and were burned to cinders. They set forth in ships
"that were badly insulated, and froze in the absolute zero of space."
"They learned the atomic motor controls too hastily, ran out of"
"supplies or lost their courses, and wandered far out into space--stiff"
corpses in coffins that were to be buried only in time's infinity.
"To stop the foolish waste of life, the Earth Government stepped in. It"
was decreed that no space ship might be owned or built privately. It
was further decreed that those who felt an urge to explore must join
The gross rapacity of the Flemings in Spain under Philip I is
"admitted by Motley (_Rise_, as cited, pp. 31, 75); but on the same"
score feeling was passionately strong in Spain in the earlier years
"of the reign of Charles. Cp. Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. i (Works,"
"ed. 1821, iv, 37, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52, 53, 55, 77 78); and van"
"Kampen, _Geschichte der Niederlande_, i, 277, 278. It took more"
than ten years to bring Charles in good relations with the
Spaniards. See Mr. E. Armstrong's _Introduction_ to Major Martin
"Hume's _Spain_, 1898, pp. 31-37, 57, 76. Even in his latter years"
"they are found protesting against his customary absence from Spain,"
"and his perpetual wars. Robertson, bk. vi, p. 494. Cp. bk. xii,"
"vol. v, p. 417, as to the disregard shown him after his abdication."
"While it lasted, the Flemish exploitation of Spain was as shameless"
as the Spanish exploitation of Italy. The Italian Peter Martyr
"Angleria, residing at the court of Spain, reckoned that in ten"
months the Flemings there remitted home over a million ducats
"(Robertson, bk. i, p. 53). A lad, nephew of Charles's Flemish"
"minister Chievres, was appointed to the archbishopric of Toledo, in"
defiance of general indignation. The result was a clerico-popular
insurrection. Everything goes to show that but for the Emperor's
"prudence his Flemings would have ruined him in Spain, by getting"
"him to tyrannise for their gain, as Philip II later did for the"
Church's sake in the Netherlands.
It is not unwarrantable to say that had not Charles had the sagacity to
"adapt himself to the Spanish situation, learning to speak the language"
and even to tolerate the pride of the nobles[764] to a degree to which
"he never yielded before the claims of the burghers of the Netherlands,"
and had he not in the end identified himself chiefly with his Spanish
"interests, the history of Spain and the Netherlands might have been"
"entirely reversed. Had he, that is, kept his seat of rule in the"

the five thousand tons vessel literally cut the luckless submarine in

"after-portion of the ""U"" boat, as, rendered buoyant by the trapped"
"air, it drifted past. Then amidst a smother of foam and oil the"
wreckage vanished.

coolly as if he were reckoning up the score at an athletic meeting.

"The accountant officer eyed his tormentor reproachfully, as if that"
officer were responsible for his former discomfiture.

far more than money--it cost her the loss of all the leading nations

It goes without saying that the popes would not allow the chief church
"of Roman Catholicism to go begging in the matter of relics. And, sure"
"enough, we have no sooner pushed aside the heavy padded screen and"
"stepped within than we find on our right the Chapel of the Holy Column,"

Before long the novelty of the Tore Peak resort wore off again. The
"newspapermen wrote and sent telegrams about other gratifying misfortunes,"
the death on the Blue Peak having lost its news value. It had been an
intoxication; now came the morning after.
The Danish mountaineer quite simply deserted. He strapped on his knapsack
"and walked across the field like one of the villagers, caring no more for"
the Blue Peak. The commotion he had witnessed in the last week had taught
him a lesson.
And the tourists swarmed on to other places.
"""What harm have I done them,"" Paul probably"
"thought, ""that they should be going again? Have I been"
too much in the fields and too little with them? But I
greeted them humbly and took my man out of the

"Then two young men arrived, sprouts off the Norwegian tree, sportsmen to"
"their finger tips, who talked of nothing but sailing, cycling, and"
"football; they were going to be civil engineers--the young Norway. They,"
"too, wanted to see the Blue Peak to the best of their ability; after all,"
one must keep pace with modern life. But they were so young that when they
"looked up at the peak, they were afraid. Solem had learned more than one"
"trick in tourist company; craftily he led them on, and then extorted money"
from them in return for a promise not to expose their foolishness. So all
"was well; the young sprouts came down the mountain again, bragging and"
showing off their sportsmanship. One of them brought down a bloodstained
"rag which he flung on the ground, saying,"
"""There's what's left of your lawyer that fell off."""
"third, also in French, and bearing no signature, made an appointment to"
meet her in the English tea-shop in the Rue Royale on the following day
at five o'clock.
"That note, written upon plain paper of business appearance, had"
"apparently been left by hand.  Who, I wondered, was the person who had"
"made that appointment?  To me the writing seemed disguised, and"
"probably, owing to the thickness of the up-strokes, had been penned by a"
"male hand.  There was a mistake in the orthography, too, the word"
"""plaisir"" being written ""plasir.""  This showed plainly that no Frenchman"
had written it.
"I placed the letter in my pocket, and, encouraged by it, continued my"
investigations.
In the tiny letter-rack was a note which the unfortunate girl had
written immediately before being struck down.  It was addressed to
"""Baronne Maillac, Chateau des Grands Sablons, Seine et Marne.""  The"
little escritoire contained four small drawers; the contents of each I
"carefully scrutinised.  They were, however, mostly private letters of a"
social character--some from persons whom I knew well in Society.
"Suddenly, from the bottom of one of the smaller drawers, I drew forth"
several sheets of plain octavo paper of a pale yellow shade.  There
"were, perhaps, half-a-dozen sheets, carefully wrapped in a sheet of"
"plain blue foolscap.  I opened them, and, holding one up to the light,"
examined the water-mark.
Next instant the truth was plain.  That paper was the official paper
used in French Government offices for written reports.  How came it in
"her possession, if the accusation against her were untrue?"
"I held it in my hand, glaring at it in bewilderment.  Sheet by sheet I"

and Mrs. Allan in particular. Now Pola was simply crazy over a Jack
"Sicard who was playing the lead in ""Hearts Aquiver."" But not even"
"Jack's manly beauty, as described by Pola, failed to draw from Sidney"
"more than a mild: ""He must be cute."" Pola gave way to vexation."
"""You're scarcely listening to me, Sidney Romley, when I'm telling you"
things I haven't told a _soul_! I believe you're still thinking of that
"ridiculous girl we met."""
"""She isn't ridiculous!"" Sidney was prompt enough now in Mart's defense."
"""She looks funny, but you see I've gotten well acquainted with her and"
"she's awfully nice."""
"""Oh, _nice_, of course! But _anyone_ can be nice! You know perfectly"
"well, Sidney, that there's as much class in this country as there is in"
"Europe and being _nice_ does not break down social barriers."""
Sidney had no answer ready for this. Curiously into her mind flashed
what Mr. Dugald had said about the solid aristocracy. But somehow she
knew Pola would not understand this. Pola went on:
"""I'm a dreadful little snob, anyway. But I suppose that is the result"
of my education. It would be funny to go to the most expensive schools
"and have all the culture that Europe can offer and _not_ be a snob."""
"Still Sidney stared into her teacup. She thought Pola was all wrong,"
but she did not know how to say it. Pola herself had told her that she
had gone to Grace Hall because it had no examinations and graduated a

man that could be got.
"I must here explain that I possessed an English chauffeur, Allan"
"by name, and that General Kitson employed his brother in the same"
"capacity. Now, without any disparagement of _my_ Allan, I knew his"
brother to be a more practical and experienced man. General Kitson
generously gave his consent to an exchange of chauffeurs.
"I may as well say, at once, that it was a lucky day for me that saw"
"Allan of the 9th Middlesex Regiment enter my service, for, during"
"the months to come, he was as cheery and full of resource as he was"
"ready for any event, however untoward. His appetite stood forth as"
"the only thing that ever caused me uneasiness, and I must admit that"
I have never met a man with one of such colossal proportion. As an
"instance--on one occasion, when camped out in the desert, between"
"Nushki and Robat, and supplies were none too plentiful, we cooked"
twelve sausages for breakfast.
"I had one, and then was persuaded by Allan to attempt a second. I"
only succeeded in disposing of half of it. I then got up and left
"Allan to have his own breakfast. Allah-dad, being a Mahommedan, of"
course refused to touch sausage.
"At lunch-time Allah-dad asked what I would have to eat, and got the"
"answer, ""Oh, some of the cold sausages left from breakfast."""
"Allah-dad replied, ""But there are no sausages, Sahib. Allan has eaten"
"them all."""
"I expostulated, maintaining that it was impossible. No normal man"
could have eaten ten and a half large sausages. But Allah-dad was

tumult died away. No one rose. The Speaker looked round once and again.
Could it be that no one----? Slowly he began to rise. The movement
"caught Sir Robert's attention: he signed to Puttock, who sprang heavily"
"to his feet. Puttock was no favourite as a speaker, and generally his"
rising was a signal for the House to thin. He began his speech with his
stolid deliberation. Not a man stirred. They waited for something still.
"""And now,"" whispered Medland to the Treasurer, who sat by him, ""let's"
"see what it was in that infernal paper."""
The Treasurer handed him what he asked.
"""You ought to see it,"" he whispered back."
"Mr. Puttock's voice droned on, and his sheaf of notes rustled in his"
hand. No one looked at him or listened to him. Their eyes were still on

"her candour, above all her passivity cut in across his fear.  No, not"
Gyp!
"He went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus, tumblers, and a"
"syphon, and pouring out some brandy, drank.  It steadied him.  And he"
began to practise.  He took a passage from Brahms' violin concerto and
"began to play it over and over.  Suddenly, he found he was repeating the"
same flaws each time; he was not attending.  The fingering of that thing
was ghastly!  Music-lessons!  Why did she take them?  Waste of time and
"money--she would never be anything but an amateur!  Ugh!  Unconsciously,"
he had stopped playing.  Had she gone there to-day?  It was past
lunch-time.  Perhaps she had come in.
He put down his violin and went back to the house.  No sign of her! The
maid came to ask if he would lunch.  No!  Was the mistress to be in?  She
"had not said.  He went into the dining-room, ate a biscuit, and drank a"
"brandy and soda.  It steadied him.  Lighting a cigarette, he came back to"
the drawing-room and sat down at Gyp's bureau.  How tidy!  On the little
"calendar, a pencil-cross was set against to-day--Wednesday, another"
"against Friday.  What for? Music-lessons!  He reached to a pigeon-hole,"
"and took out her address-book.  ""H--Harmost, 305A, Marylebone Road,"" and"
"against it the words in pencil, ""3 P.M."""
Three o'clock.  So that was her hour!  His eyes rested idly on a little
"old coloured print of a Bacchante, with flowing green scarf, shaking a"
"tambourine at a naked Cupid, who with a baby bow and arrow in his hands,"
was gazing up at her.  He turned it over; on the back was written in a
"""Gyroscopes!"""

"The second assistant was galvanized into activity, and upon a screen"
before him there appeared a view as though he were looking directly
upward from the prow of the great vessel. The air above them was full of
"aircraft of all shapes and sizes, and occasionally the image of one of"
that flying horde flared into violet splendor upon the screen as it was
"caught in the mighty, roving beam of one of the twelve ultra-light"
projectors under test.
"""Upper lights and lookout plates--all x,"" the second assistant reported,"
and other assistants came to attention as the check-out went on.
"""Lower lights and lookout plates!"""
"""All x,"" was the report, after each of the twelve ultra-lights of the"

recess of the dark depths of the bottom well of the berth and throwing
the picture upon another screen in lurid violet relief.

and the framed photographs on the walls and the array of grease paints
on the dressing-table. John walked up and down the narrow space in great
perplexity of mind. Herold was right. He could not introduce Unity Blake
"into lodgings, saying that he had adopted her. Landladies would not"
"stand it. Even if they would, what in the world could he do with her?"
Could he move into a house or a flat and persuade a registry-office
to provide him with a paragon of a housekeeper? That would be more
"practicable. But, even then, what did he know of the training, moral and"
"spiritual, necessary for a girl of fifteen? He was not going to employ"
her as a servant. On that he was decided. What sort of a position she
"should have he did not know; but her floor-scrubbing, dish-scraping days"
were over. She should have ease of life and loving care--his own phrase
stuck in his head--especially loving care; and he was the only person in
the world who could see that she got it. She must live under his roof.
That was indisputable. But how? In lodgings or a flat? He went angrily
round and round the vicious circle.
"When Herold returned, he dragged him round and round, too, until Perkins"
appeared to help him to change for the third act. Then John had to stop.
He clapped on his hat. He must go and work.
“And you have n't a single suggestion to make?” he asked.
"“I have one,” said Herold, fastening his shirt-studs while Perkins was"
buttoning his boots. “But it's so commonplace and unromantic that you 'd
wreck the dressing-room if I made it.”
"“Well, what is it?” He stood, his hand on the door-knob."
"“You 've got a maiden aunt somewhere, have n't you?”"
"“Oh, don't talk rot!” said John. “I'm dead serious.”"
"""Aren't you?"" she repeated, more sweetly imperious."
"""You bet,"" I stammered."
"""Then do hurry! It's almost ten, and I've been waiting such a long"
"time!"""
"Whereupon I heard her moving off, pressing her hands against the panels"
"for steadiness, and there struck me as having been an endearing pathos"
"in the way she said: ""such a long time!"""
"This was, no doubt, some of Tommy's doing. He had invited friends aboard"
"for luncheon, and was now daring one of them to play this joke. But my"
"glance turned to the room, to its equipment and toilette articles which"
"were large and curiously shaped, and the numbing truth crept into my"
brain that the stupid boatman had put me on the wrong yacht.
"I had known some tight places in France, but this one simply squeezed me"
"all over. There was nothing for it, of course, but go out and"
explain--yet how could a chap appear at noon draped in a sheet! The
"situation confused me, but I decided to search the wardrobe, of my"
"unknown host, to borrow his razor, appropriate a new toothbrush that"
"should be found in a box somewhere, and select flannels and linens in"
keeping with the hour. Still balanced between confusion and panic I must
"have done these things because, fittingly attired though with no very"
"good fit, I opened my door, stepped softly along the passageway, and"
entered the cabin.
On a wide couch built in at one side a girl lay reading. Her head was
"toward me, but as I advanced she arose with a low cry of gladness,"
saying:
doing as she asked.
"But because his heart was not of iron, and there are few men that can"
"resist when a woman comes and woos them, he at last gave way; and they"
"fled away one night, the girl and the slave, taking with them her jewels"
"and some money. They travelled rapidly and in great fear, and did not"
"rest till they came to a city far away where the merchant would never,"
"they thought, think of searching for them."
"Here, in this city where no one knew of their history, they lived in"
"great happiness, husband and wife, trading with the money they had with"
them.
And in time a little child was born to them.
About two or three years after this it became necessary for the husband
"to take a journey, and he started forth with his wife and child. The"
"journey was a very long one, and they were unduly delayed; and so it"
"happened that while still in the forest the wife fell ill, and could not"
"go on any further. So the husband built a hut of branches and leaves,"
"and there, in the solitude of the forest, was born to them another"
little son.
"The mother recovered rapidly, and in a little time she was well enough"
to go on. They were to start next morning on their way again; and in the
"evening the husband went out, as was his custom, to cut firewood, for"
the nights were cold and damp.
"Ma Pa Da waited and waited for him, but he never came back."
"The sun set and the dark rose out of the ground, and the forest became"
"full of whispers, but he never came. All night she watched and waited,"
At Bruges they were told that the train would not leave for Ghent
and Brussels for another two hours--some mobilization delay; so Hawk
proposed they should go and see the Memlings and then have some
dinner.
"""Don't you think they're perfectly wonderful?""--_àpropos_ of the"
pictures in the Hospital of St. Jean.
"_Vivie_: ""It depends on what you mean by 'wonderful.' If you admire"
the fidelity of the reproduction in colour and texture of the
"Flemish costumes of the fifteenth century, I agree with you. It is"
also interesting to see the revelations of their domestic
"architecture and furniture of that time, and the types of domestic"
"dog, cow and horse. But if you admire them as being true pictures of"
"life in Palestine in the time of Christ, or in the Rhineland of the"
"fifth century, then I think they--like most Old Masters--are"
perfectly rotten. And have you ever remarked another thing about all
"paintings prior to the seventeenth century: how _plain_, how _ugly_"
all the people are? You never see a single good-looking man or
woman. Do let's go and have that dinner you spoke of. I've got a
"prison appetite."""
At Ghent another delay and a few uneasy rumours. The Court was said
to be removing from Brussels and establishing itself at Antwerp. The
train at last drew into the main station at Brussels half an hour
after midnight. Vivie's mother was nowhere to be seen. She had
evidently gone back to the Villa Beau-séjour while she could. It was
too late for any tram in the direction of Tervueren. There were no
taxis owing to the drivers being called up. Leaving most of her
luggage at the cloak-room--it took her about three-quarters of an
"I manage to reach the trading center at midday, when everyone is up and"
"about, and the post office open. They give me a large sheet of wrapping"
paper and string and sealing wax; I wrap the parcel and seal it and write
on the outside. There!
"Oh--I forgot the slip of paper with the address--to put it inside, I mean."
"Stupid! But otherwise I have done what I should. As I continue on my way,"
I feel strangely void and deserted; no doubt because the knapsack was
"quite heavy after all, and now I am well rid of it. ""The last pleasure!"" I"
"think suddenly. And as I walk on I think irrelevantly: ""The last country,"
"the last island, the last pleasure...."""
XXXI
What now?
"I didn't know at first. The winter stood before me, my summer behind"
"me--no task, no yearning, no ambition. As it made no difference where I"
"stayed, I remembered a town I knew, and thought I might as well go"
"there--why not? A man cannot forever sit by the sea, and it is not"
necessary to misunderstand him if he decides to leave it. So he leaves
his solitude--others have done so before him--and a mild curiosity drives
him to see the ships and the horses and the tiny frostbitten gardens of a
"certain town. When he arrives there, he begins to wonder in his idleness"
"if he does not know someone in this town, in this terrifyingly large town."
"The moonlight is bright now, and it amuses him to give himself a certain"
"address to visit evening after evening, and to take up his post there as"
"though something depended on it. He is not expected anywhere else, so he"
"SYMPSON, DAVID."
Born at North Berwick.
One of Roberts's crew. Tried and hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722. On
the day of execution Sympson was among the first six prisoners to be
brought up from the ship's hold to have their fetters knocked off and to
"be fitted with halters, and it was observed that none of the culprits"
"appeared in the least dejected, except Sympson, who ""spoke a little faint,"
but this was rather imputed to a Flux that had seized him two or three
"days before, than Fear."" There being no clergyman in the colony, a kindly"
"surgeon tried to take on the duties of the ordinary, but with ill-success,"
the hardened ruffians being quite unmoved by his attempts at exhortation.
"In fact, the spectators were considerably shocked, as indeed they well"
"might be, by Sympson, suddenly recognizing among the crowd a woman whom he"
"knew, calling out ""he had lain with that B----h three times, and now she"
"was come to see him hanged."""
"Sympson died at the age of 36, which was considerably above the average"
age to which a pirate might expect to live.
"TAYLOR, CAPTAIN."
"This formidable South Sea pirate must indeed have looked, as well as"
"acted, the part, since his appearance is described by Captain Johnson as"
"follows: ""A Fellow with a terrible pair of Whiskers, and a wooden Leg,"
"being stuck round with Pistols, like the Man in the Almanack with Darts."""
This man Taylor it was who stirred up the crew of the _Victory_ to turn
"faculty for absorbing butter. The stomachs of most men, really good at"
"their business, would have revolted at the diet which his superiors"
"shovelled into Dawson, but he visibly expanded and blossomed. Yes,"
"Scotland Yard knew its Dawson, and exactly how to stimulate the best"
that was in him. He never bored me; I enjoyed him too thoroughly.
One day in my club I chanced upon the Admiral.
"""Have you met our friend Dawson lately?"" I asked."
"""Met him?"" shouted he, with a roar of laughter. ""Met him? He is in my"
office every day--he almost lives with me; goodness knows when he does
his work. He has a pocket full of letters which he has read to me till
I know them by heart. If I did not know that he was a first-class man
"I should set him down as a colossal ass. Yet, I rather wish that the"
Admiralty would sometimes write to me as the severe but very human
"Scotland Yard does to Dawson."""
"""Does he ever come to you in disguise?"" I asked."
"""Not that I know of. I see vast numbers of people; some of them may be"
"Dawson in his various incarnations, but he has not given himself"
"away."""
"Then I explained to my naval friend my own experience. ""He tried,"" I"
"said, ""to play the disguise game on me, and clean bowled me the first"
time. While he was laughing over my discomfiture I studied his face
more closely than a lover does that of his mistress. I tried to
penetrate his methods. He never wears a wig or false hair; he is too
wise for that folly. Yet he seems able to change his hair from light
"to dark, to make it lank or curly, short or long. He does it; how I"
"don't know. He alters the shape of his nose, his cheeks, and his chin."
you to find what you want by looking for it. You ought to leave it a
little to chance.”
"“Abandon myself to events as they arrive? All right, it seems a good"
idea.”
"“Then if you find something practicable, utilize it.”"
Kennedy took his friend to a statue-shop where he used to pass some of
"his hours. The shop was in a lane near the Forum, and its stock was in"
"antiques, majolicas, and plaster casts of pagan gods."
"The shop was dark and rather gloomy, with a small court at the back"
"covered with vines. The proprietor was an old man, with a moustache,"
"an imperial, and a shock of white hair. His name was Giovanni Battista"
Lanza. He professed revolutionary ideas and had great enthusiasm about
Mazzini. He expressed himself in an ironical and malicious manner.
"Signora Vittoria, his wife, was a grumbling old woman, rather devoted to"
"wine. She spoke like a Roman of the lowest class, was olive-coloured and"
"wrinkled, and of her former beauty there remained only her very black"
eyes and hair that was still black.
"The daughter, Simonetta, a girl who resembled her father, blond, with"
"the build of a goddess, was the one that waited on customers and kept"
the accounts.
"Simonetta, being the manager, divided up the profits; the elder son was"
head of the workshop and he made the most money; then came two workmen
"from outside; and then the father who still got his day’s wages, out"
"of consideration for his age; and finally the younger son, twelve or"
"fourteen years old, who was an apprentice."
"And then, in great mental agony, I said to myself: ""I _will_ be happy, I"
"_will_ enjoy my leave."" But a number of invisible cobwebs hung between"
"myself and the world around me. I tried to brush them away, but they"
were so impalpable that the movement of my hand did not disturb them at
all.
I gave up the attempt. I would wait until I got home. Then I would talk
and forget myself--only by forgetting myself would I enjoy the present.
Only those who forget themselves are happy. The obsession of self is
the most oppressive of all burdens.
I descended from a 'bus and took a train. A girl sitting opposite me
"stared at my blue chevrons and whispered to her fellow passenger: ""He's"
"just come from the front."" So I too was regarded as a strange kind of"
animal. I got out at my home-station. I showed my leave-warrant to the
ticket collector. He was a benevolent looking old man. He smiled and
wished me good luck. Things began to seem a little less foreign. And
then the thought of being home in a few minutes absorbed me entirely.
"I hurried down the street. I knocked at the door, and it opened. The"
long yearned-for meeting took place at last.
"I threw my pack, equipment and steel helmet contemptuously into a"
"corner. I took an infantile delight in clean, furnished rooms, in the"
"white table-cloth, the shining silver, the cut flowers, and the"
oil-paintings on the wall. And we talked until late into the night.
It was good to wake up the next morning and to know that the first day
of my leave was still before me. I felt encouraged to face my new
surroundings boldly. I would understand them and identify myself with
"them. If the sensation that I was dreaming came upon me again, I would"
"shoulder to see what was tickling his fancy so, he frowned and folded"
that document up and returned it to Mr. Jobling.
"""Give it here, now!"" growled Captain Dove, menacing Mr. Jobling with a"
"clenched fist; and the lawyer, after an appealing, impotent glance at"
"Slyne, had no recourse but to comply with that peremptory order."
"""Are you quite sure of your figures?"" Slyne asked, with a scowl. He"
"seemed conscious that he, in his haste, had made a false step. And Mr."
Jobling nodded with nervous assurance.
"""I have inside sources of information as to the revenue of the estates,"""
"he replied, ""and a note of all the investments. I've allowed a wide"
"margin for all sorts of incidentals. I think you'll find, in fact, that"
Lady Josceline's inheritance will amount to even more than I've
"estimated."""
"Slyne smiled again, more contentedly. Nor was his complaisance overcome"
even when Mr. Jobling put to him a half-whispered petition for a
further small cash advance to account of expenses.
"""I wasn't even able to pay Mullins' wages with what you gave me in"
"Paris,"" said the stout solicitor vexedly. ""Fees and so on swallowed it"
"all up, and--I'm actually short of cab-fares!"""
"""Why don't you fire Mullins, then?"" demanded Slyne with a shade of"
"impatience. ""I've just got rid of my chauffeur because he was costing me"
"more than he was worth."""
"""But I can't afford to get rid of Mullins. Just at the moment he's very"
useful to me. It would create a bad impression if I had to run my own
"errands. And--the fact is, he knows far too much. I'll pay him off and"
station to catch their train.
"It was a cold, clear, frosty night, and the Strand was at its busiest as"
Sallie looked out at it from the taxi into which Slyne and Ambrizette
"had followed her at the hotel portico. Another, containing Captain Dove"
"and their legal adviser, still on the most amicable terms, although"
"Captain Dove as a rule could not stand anyone afflicted with hiccough,"
"crawled close behind them through the turmoil until, at the Gaiety"
"corner, a policeman delayed it to let the cross-traffic through."
A crowd had gathered there to gaze at the royalties who would presently
be coming out of the theatre. Slyne drew Sallie back from the open
"window at sight of two men, one of whom seemed all shirt-front, looking"
down at the congested street from the empty steps of the principal
entrance.
"""That ass Ingoldsby!"" he explained to Sallie, and was evidently a good"
"deal disturbed. ""And--Dubois, as well,"" he added. ""I thought I had"
"shaken him off in Paris. I'm sure he saw me, too."""
A little farther on he stopped the taxi and beckoned to one of those
street-arabs who make a living about the kerb.
"""Go to the gentleman with the beard, on the steps of the Gaiety,"" he"
"instructed that very alert messenger, ""and say to him that a friend"
"wants a word with him here."""
Sallie observed the suppressed grimace of surprise on the face of the
individual who almost at once arrived in the wake of his ragged Mercury:
"and Slyne, having tossed the latter a shilling, held out his hand to M."
Dubois.
"these three stalwarts, the car--a source of the utmost excitement"
"and wonderment to them--Allan, Allah-dad and my weary self were, ere"
"long, safe in the rest-house of the small mud fort at Saindak."
"The following morning, after a good night's rest, I had a long talk"
"with Idu, and the very favourable impression I had formed of the man"
the night before was greatly increased. I found him by daylight to be
"a highly intelligent-looking, splendidly proportioned fellow of about"
"five feet eight, with a big black beard. I had glimpses, even then,"
of the keen sense of humour which was to do so much to lighten the
difficulties of the ensuing campaign. Never once in all the months to
come did I find his wit and humour fail.
"As after-events proved he was absolutely invaluable. In fact, I often"
"called him, and told him that I called him, my ""head."" Not only did"
"he know every yard of the country, but he knew by name practically"
"every one of the Raiders, knew their peculiarities and their weak"
"points as well as their strength. Idu was a man in a million, and I"
"should like to think that, some day, this public appreciation of him,"
"and of what he did to help in this campaign, may reach him."
"After breakfast and my talk with Idu, we set out on the last march of"
"the first phase of my journey, and reached Robat by two o'clock in"
the afternoon.
CHAPTER III
A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
"“Nothing, fortunately,” he said, then went on slowly. “You see, in my"
"later years, I have been something of a collector of precious stones"
"myself. I don’t wear them, but I have always taken the keenest pleasure"
in owning them and when I was married it gave me a great deal more
"pleasure to have them set in rings, pendants, tiaras, necklaces, and"
other forms for my wife.”
"He had risen, with the air of a busy man who had given the subject all"
the consideration he could afford and whose work proceeded almost by
"schedule. “This morning I found my safe tampered with, but, as I said,"
fortunately something must have scared off the burglars.”
"He bowed us out politely. What was the explanation, I wondered. It"
"seemed, on the face of things, that Antoinette Moulton feared her"
"husband. Did he know something else already, and did she know he knew?"
"To all appearances he took it very calmly, if he did know. Perhaps that"
"was what she feared, his very calmness."
"“I must see Mrs. Moulton again,” remarked Kennedy, as we left."
"The Moultons lived, we found, in one of the largest suites of a new"
"apartment hotel, the Deluxe, and in spite of the fact that our arrival"
"had been announced some minutes before we saw Mrs. Moulton, it was"
evident that she had been crying hysterically over the loss of the
paste jewels and what it implied.
"“I missed it this morning, after my return from seeing you,” she"
"replied in answer to Craig’s inquiry, then added, wide-eyed with alarm,"
“What shall I do? He must have opened the wall safe and found the
replica. I don’t dare ask him point-blank.”
of having the administration of all the Church’s property kept entirely
"at home, as in the time of Pius IX. Leo XIII had preferred to replace"
"this paternal method by a trained bureaucracy, but the Church had not"
"gained anything by it, and they had lost credit through unfortunate"
"negotiations, buying land and taking mortgages."
Cæsar realized that it was useless to attempt to convince a man of
"the intelligence and austerity of the Cardinal, and he listened to him"
respectfully.
"Monsignor Spada conversed amiably, he escorted them as far as the door,"
and shook hands when they said good-bye.
THE ABBÉ TARDIEU
Then they went to see the Abbé Tardieu. The abbé lived in the Piazza.
"Navona. His office, furnished in modern style, produced the effect of a"
"violent contrast with Cardinal Spada’s sumptuous study, and yet brought"
"it to mind. The Abbé Tardieu’s work-room was small, worldly, full of"
books and photographs.
"The abbé, a tall young man, thin, with a rosy face, a long nose, and a"
"mouth almost from ear to ear, had the air of an astute but jolly person,"
and laughed at everything said to him. He was liveliness personified.
When they entered his office he was writing and smoking.
"Cæsar explained about his financial knowledge, and how he had gone on"
"acquiring it, until he got to the point where he could discern a law, a"
"system, in things where others saw nothing more than chance. The Abbé"
"Tardieu promised that if he knew a way to utilize Cæsar’s knowledge, he"
a prolonged war.
But the immediate reality became too overwhelming. Grey multitudes were
"sweeping khaki multitudes before them. High-explosives, shrapnel,"
"grenades, bombs, bullets were rending, piercing, and shattering the"
living flesh and muscle and bone. Towns and villages were being turned
"into heaps of brick and wreckage. Hordes of old men, women, and children"
"were thronging the roads, and fleeing from approaching disaster."
"We went to work as usual although we worked less than usual, for we now"
had something to talk about. Would the Germans reach the coast? If they
"did, then the northern armies would be cut off and destroyed. A general"
retreat from our front might be ordered at any moment. We stood in
groups and discussed these problems hour by hour.
One day we were returning from work and passing through the village. A
"crowd of civilians was standing round the window of the Mairie, where a"
"written notice was exposed. An old woman dressed in black was moaning,"
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu."" The '19, '20, and '21 classes had been"
called up.
Then the German advance came to an end. A French army had arrived and
saved the situation. The shelling of the back areas had ceased. The
danger was over for a time.
Had the Germans assembled all their strength for one supreme attempt at
breaking through the Western Front? Or was it only the beginning of a
whole series of operations?
"One morning, as we woke up, we heard the roar and rumble of a"
"bombardment. We did not take much notice of it, for we had heard the"
sound so often.
"their hearts as water within them. Their pet Valiant, old Gaspar Perico,"
"too, had judiciously hidden himself. Esteban the supple had accompanied"
"him, and the venta of Sarria was in the hands of the silent,"
"swift-footed, but exceedingly capable maid-servant who had played the"
trick upon Etienne.
"The Sarrians therefore watched the mill-house blaze up, and thanked God"
that it stood some way from the other dwellings of the place.
Suddenly Cabrera turned upon them.
"""Hearken ye, villagers of Sarria,"" he cried, ""I have burned the home of"
a traitor. If I hear of any shelter being granted to Luis Fernandez or
"his brother within your bounds, I swear by the martyred honour of my"
mother that on my return I will burn every house within your walls and
shoot every man of you capable of bearing arms. You have heard of Ramon
"Cabrera. Let that be enough."""
"The villagers got apprehensively behind each other, and none answered,"
"each waiting for the other, till with mighty bass thunder the voice rang"
out again:
"""Have you no answer?"" he cried, ""no promise? Must I set a dozen of you"
"with your backs against the wall, as I did at Espluga in Francoli, to"
"stimulate those dull country wits of yours?"""
Then a young man gaily dressed was thrust to the front. Very unwilling
"he was to show himself, and at his appearance, with his knees knocking"
"together, a merry laugh rang out from behind Cabrera."
That chieftain turned quickly with wrath in his eye. For it was a sound
"of a woman's mirth that was heard, and all such were strictly forbidden"
order made in the exercise of the ordinary jurisdiction of such court;
and in the meantime and until a final order has been made on such
application the court shall have power to make all such provisional and
"other orders as to the care or custody of such captured ship, goods, or"
"merchandize, and (if the same be of perishable nature, or incurring risk"
"of deterioration) for the sale thereof, and with respect to the deposit"
"or investment of the proceeds of any such sale, as may be made by such"
court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction.

"the lawyer had drawn up from his dictation, and the more lengthy"
agreement between Sallie and Jasper Slyne.
"Slyne and Jobling added their names to that, and Slyne attached his"
careful signature to a promise to pay the solicitor the percentage
agreed upon. Captain Dove witnessed it and then called Sallie from her
"seat in the window-alcove, and she came forward with anxious eyes, to"
fulfil the undertaking she had finally had to give Jasper Slyne as the
price of his help in her most unhappy predicament.
She did not know--nor did she greatly care then--what was contained in
the contract he laid before her without a word. She took from him
without demur the pen he held out to her. She had promised to do all he
"told her and give him whatever he asked--except, for the present,"
herself.
"""Sign 'Josceline Justice' at the foot of each page,"" he said gently, and"
she did so without a word. For she would not for all the world contained
have broken any promise she had given. Then Mr. Jobling desired her to
witness the two other men's signatures.
As she handed him back the pen she had a final question to ask him.
"""You said my father and mother are both dead, and my step-brother too."
"Is there no one else--"""
"""No one you need worry about in the least,"" he assured her,"
"misunderstanding. ""There was a beggarly American who lodged a claim to"
"the title and--to the title; his name was Carthew, I think--yes, Justin"
Carthew. But even if I--if he hadn't gone and got lost while looking for
"you, his claim would be quite ineffectual now. You're your father's"
"daughter, Lady Josceline. Justin Carthew was a dozen or more degrees"
"""Why are they sending you away?"" asked Vivie drily, compelled to"
interest herself in his affairs since they so closely affected her
own and her mother's.
"""Because of this,"" said von Giesselin, nearly in tears, pulling from"
"a small portfolio a press cutting. ""Do you remember a fortnight ago"
"I told you some one, some Belgian had written a beautiful poem and"
sent it to me for one of our newspapers? I showed it to you at the
"time and you said--you said 'it was well enough, but it did not seem"
"to have much point.'"" Vivie did remember having glanced very"
perfunctorily at some effusion in typewriting which had seemed
unobjectionable piffle. She hadn't cared two straws whether he
"accepted it or not, only did not want to be too markedly"
indifferent. Now she took it up and still read it through
"uncomprehendingly, her thoughts absent with the fate of Miss Cavell."
"""Well! what is all the fuss about? I still see nothing in it. It is"
just simply the ordinary sentimental flip-flap that a French
"versifier can turn out by the yard."""
"""It is _far_ worse than that! It is a horrible--what the French"
"call 'acrostiche,' a deadly insult to our people. And I never saw"
"it, the Editor never saw it, and you, even, never guessed its real"
"meaning![1] The original, as you say, was in typewriting, and at the"
bottom was the name and address of a very well-known homme de
lettres: and the words: 'Offert à la rédaction de l'Ami de L'Ordre.'
"He say now, _never never_ did he send it. It was a forgery. When we"
came to understand what it meant all the blame fall on me. I am sent
"back to the Army--I shall be killed before Verdun, so good-bye dear"
Miss--We have been good friends. Oh this War: this d-r-r-eadful
War--It has spoilt everything. Now we can never be friends with
"England again."""
"""Don't waste your breath on them,"" Boyd advised. ""We're lucky enough as"
"it is. If that tug hadn't sheered off she would have cut us down, sure."""
"""That fellow done it a-purpose,"" George swore. ""Seamen ain't that"
"careless. He tried to tell me he was rattled, but I rattled _him_."""
"""If that's the case they may try it again,"" said the younger man."
"""Huh! I'll pack a 'thirty-thirty' from now on, and I bet they don't get"
"within hailing distance without an iron-clad."""
"The more calmly Emerson regarded the incident, the more he marvelled at"
"the good-fortune that had saved him. ""We had better wake up,"" he said."
"""We have been asleep so far. If Marsh planned this, he will plan"
"something more."""
"""Yes, and if he puts one wallop over we're done for,"" George agreed,"
"pessimistically. ""I'll keep a watchman aboard the scows hereafter."
"That's our vital spot."""
"But the days sped past without further interference, and the"
"construction of the plant progressed by leaps and bounds, while _The"
"Bedford Castle_, having discharged her cargo, steamed away to return in"
August.
"The middle of June brought the first king salmon, scouts sent on ahead"
"of the ""sockeyes;"" but Boyd made no effort to take advantage of this"
"run, laboring manfully to prepare for the advance of the main army,"
"that terrific horde that was soon to come from the mysterious depths,"
"either to make or ruin him. Once the run proper started, there would be"
no more opportunity for building or for setting up machinery. He must
be ready and waiting by the first of July.
"experience!--most amusing, I assure you! and quite unique! Why--"" and"
"suddenly stopping short, she turned smartly round and gesticulated with"
"one hand ... ""I have interviewed all the favorite actors and actresses"
in London! The biggest brewers in Great Britain have received me at
"their country mansions, and have given me all the particulars of their"
lives from earliest childhood! The author of 'Hugger Mugger's Curse'
took the greatest pains to explain to me how he first collected the
"materials for his design. The author of that most popular story,"
"'Darling's Twins,' gave me a description of all the houses he has ever"
"lived in,--he even told me where he purchased his writing-paper, pens,"
and ink! And to think that a POET should be too grand to be
"interrogated! Oh, the idea is really very funny! ... quite too funny"
"for anything! ""She gave a short laugh,--then relapsing into severity,"
"she added ... ""You will, I hope, tell Mr. Alwyn I called?"""
"Villiers bowed. ""Assuredly!"""
"""Thank you! Because it is possible he may have different opinions to"
"yours,--in that case, if he writes me a line, fixing an appointment, I"
"shall be very pleased to call again. I will leave my card,--and if Mr."
"Alwyn is a sensible man, he will certainly hold broader ideas on the"
subject of 'interviewing' than YOU appear to entertain. You are QUITE
"sure I cannot see him?"""
"""Quite!""--There was no mistake about the firm emphasis of this reply."
"""Oh, very well!""--here she opened the door, rattling the handle with"
"rather an unnecessary violence,--""I'm sorry to have taken up any of"
"your time, Mr. Villiers. Good-morning!"""
"""Good-morning!"" ... returned Villiers calmly, touching the bell that"
his servant might be in readiness to show her out. But the baffled
"chin in the air, triumphant."
"He led the way to his car, and was gratified to observe its salutary"
effect on Captain Dove's somewhat contemptuous demeanour. The little
"policeman in charge of it pending its opulent owner's return, came"
"forward, touching his képi, which further impressed Captain Dove,"
"uncomfortably. Slyne handed Sallie into the tonneau, and Ambrizette"
"after her, tossed the policeman a further tip which secured his"
"everlasting esteem, took his own seat at the wheel, and was hastily"
followed by Captain Dove.
"""Where are we bound for?"" asked Captain Dove, holding his top-hat on"
"with both hands, as Slyne took the road toward Sampierdarena at a round"
pace.
"""Don't talk to the man at the wheel,"" answered Slyne, and laughed."
"""We've a hundred miles or so ahead of us. Better chuck that old tile of"
yours away and tie a handkerchief round your head; you'll find that less
"uncomfortable."""
"The old man, at a loss for any more effective retort, pulled his"
"antiquated beaver down almost to his ears, folded his long arms across"
"the chest of his flapping frock-coat, and sat silent, scowling at the"
baggy umbrella between his knees. Nor did he open his mouth again during
the swift journey.
But when they at length reached their destination and Slyne stopped the
"car quietly before the imposing pile that forms the Hôtel de Paris,"
Captain Dove's jaw dropped and his mouth opened mechanically.
A resplendent porter came hurrying forward and bowed most humbly to the
magnificent Slyne.
"""I did not send for one--I sent for you,"" was her response."
"""But we must call a doctor at once,"" I urged.  ""If you have suspicion of"
"foul play we should surely know if there is any wound, or any injury to"
"account for death."""
"""I did not consider it necessary.  No doctor can return her to me,"" she"
"wailed.  ""I sent for you because I believed that you would render me"
"assistance in this terrible affair."""
"""Most certainly I will,"" I replied.  ""But in our own interests we must"
"send for a medical man, and if it is found to be actually a case of foul"
"play, for the police.  I'll send a line to Doctor Deane, an Englishman"
"whom I know, who is generally called in to see anybody at the Embassy"
"who chances to be ill.  He is a good fellow, and his discretion may be"
"relied upon."""
"So saying, I scribbled a line on the back of a card, and told the man to"
"take a cab down to the Rue du Havre, where the doctor occupied rooms"
over a hosier's shop a stone's throw from the bustling Gare St. Lazare.
A very curious mystery was evidently connected with this startling
"discovery, and I was anxious that my friend, Dick Deane, one of my old"
"chums of Rugby days, should assist me in clearing it up."
"The Countess de Foville, whose calmness had been so remarkable while"
"speaking with me before we entered the death-chamber, had now given way"
"to a flood of emotion.  She sank back into her chair, and, burying her"
"face in her hands, cried bitterly."
"I tried to obtain some further information from her, but all that"
escaped her was:
"""That's hardly fair, is it?"" commented Wilson."
"""It's a start. You have to start somewhere. Radio--know its start?"
The first message was sent across the ocean a few hundred years ago
from one man to the other after they had made a complete plan as to
"time, date, location and frequency, and also the transmitted message."
"Sure enough, they got through. That, too, was under the ideal test"
conditions. So when we finally assembled the half-a-hundred separate
circuits and devices that made it look as though we might have a space
"detector, we put up targets, aimed our equipment, and looked for a"
"response where there should be one."""
"""We don't know where our target is,"" objected Wilson."
"""And we haven't yet fired up this equipment to seek a target of unknown"
"position and range,"" admitted Allison. ""But this gear is better than"
"nothing."""
Again the green spots flickered in the dome over their heads.
"""What do all those spots mean?"" asked Wilson."
"""Those are false targets, probably caused by background noise. Although"
"the infrawave is noiseless, we still seem to be getting it. Dr."
"Friedrich disagrees. He claims this is not noise, but interferences."
"However, the good doctor is not at all certain that the so-called"
interferences come from localized conditions within the equipment or
"from external sources."""

"has neither a directional quality nor a velocity of propagation."""

"road agent--an outlaw by profession. Yes, I'm all that--and my father"
"was that before me. I was brought up, educated, thrived on thieves'"
"money, I suppose, but until six months ago when my father died, I did"
not know it. I lived much in Monterey--I lived there as a gentleman.
When we met that day I wasn't the thing I am to-day. I only learned the
truth when my father died and left me with a rancho and a band of
"thieves--nothing else--nothing for us all, and I--but what's the good of"
going into it--the circumstances. You wouldn't understand if I did. I
"was my father's son; I have no excuse; I guess, perhaps, it was in"
"me--in the blood. Anyhow, I took to the road, and I didn't mind it much"
after the first time. But I drew the line at killing--I wouldn't have

"raised his eyes and said with a voice that was charged with feeling--""I"

"change, I meant to--"""
"""The devil you did!"" broke from the Girl's lips, but with a sound that"
was not unlike a sob.
"""I did, believe me, I did,"" insisted the man. ""I meant to go straight"
and take you with me--but only honestly--when I could honestly. I meant
"to work for you. Why, every word you said to me to-night about being a"
thief cut into me like a knife. Over and over again I have said to
"myself, she must never know. And now--well, it's all over--I have"
"finished."""
"""An' that's all?"" questioned the Girl with averted face."
"""No--yes--what's the use . . .?"""
The Girl's anger blazed forth again.
"most amazing new life, had put the past with all its horrors resolutely"
"behind her, was too much interested in the entertaining present to"
trouble about the future at the moment.
"Captain Dove had seemingly forgotten, for the time being at any rate,"
"his grievance against Slyne, and was in his most lamb-like mood. While"
Slyne did not even demur against the quantities of expensive wine the
"old man consumed during dinner. Mr. Jobling, too, was displaying"
symptoms of convivial hilarity when they at length left the restaurant.
But most of the other tables were empty by then.
"Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, arm in arm, affectionately maintained each"
"other as far as their sitting-room, while Slyne accompanied Sallie to"
"her own door. He had been making himself most agreeable to her, and had"
pointed out a number of the notorieties and one or two of the
celebrities present; although it had somewhat startled her to be told
that she would very soon be on familiar terms with them all.
"""Aren't you glad now that you agreed to the bargain we made on the"
"_Olive Branch_--and in Monte Carlo?"" he asked by the way. He was smiling"
gaily.
"She smiled back at him, and, ""I'm not sorry--so far, Jasper,"" she"
"answered, looking deep into his eyes."
"He nodded, as if quite satisfied, and turned away to escape that"
embarrassing scrutiny.
"""We'll be starting in half an hour or so,"" he informed her from a safe"
"distance, and, ""I'll be all ready,"" she called cheerfully after him."
A little before eleven he came in again and they all set out for the
We had been summoned over the telephone to the Blake mansion by
"Reginald Blake, Mrs. Blake’s eldest son. Reginald had been very"
"reticent over the reason, but had seemed very anxious and insistent"
that Kennedy should come immediately.
"Craig read quickly and I followed him, fascinated by the letter from"
its very opening paragraph.
"“Dear Madam,” it began. “Having received my diploma as doctor of"
"medicine and bacteriology at Heidelberg in 1909, I came to the United"
States to study a most serious disease which is prevalent in several of
the western mountain states.”
"So far, I reflected, it looked like an ordinary appeal for aid. The"
"next words, however, were queer: “I have four hundred persons of wealth"
on my list. Your name was—”
Kennedy turned the page. On the next leaf of the letter sheet was
pasted a strip of gelatine. The first page had adhered slightly to the
gelatine.
"“Chosen by fate,” went on the sentence ominously."
"“By opening this letter,” I read, “you have liberated millions of the"
virulent bacteria of this disease. Without a doubt you are infected by
"this time, for no human body is impervious to them, and up to the"
present only one in one hundred has fully recovered after going through
all its stages.”
I gasped. The gelatine had evidently been arranged so that when the two
"sheets were pulled apart, the germs would be thrown into the air about"
the person opening the letter. It was a very ingenious device.
"So we remained till, at last, about two a.m., I caught sight of a"
"light on a small hill not very far away in the west, and, on going"
"over to it, found a sort of recluse, or holy man, quietly cooking his"
food. After the usual courtesies I asked him to come and help me to
pull my car out. He replied that he was an old man and could not do
"much by himself, but that a caravan of nomads, who had arrived the"
"evening before, were encamped close by. So off I went again, flushed"
"my ""quarry"", and, with the help of large bribes, persuaded all the"
able-bodied men to come back to the car. Fortunately we carried a
"good strong rope as part of our kit, so soon had the car out and"
running again.
Allan was never again ordered to drive through water on that route.
[Illustration: IN DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN NASARATABAD AND ROBAT.]
"On the second day our troubles recommenced, for we had barely done"
"a dozen miles than we stuck in another sand-hill, and the laborious"
"digging-out process had to be done all over again. Fortunately, the"
party who had got the car out of the lake the night before were close
"behind, and for an obvious reason. They had been given so many rupees"
"for their timely help that, knowing the difficulties lying ahead,"
they had followed in the hope of further largesse. They got it.
"Once safely out again I made a tour of inspection round the car, but"
only to find more trouble.
"""Hullo, what on earth is this, Allan? She's leaking!"""
"Allan smiled a superior smile. ""I don't think so, sir. My cars don't"
"leak."""

"bind himself to the Church through a mistaken sense of duty, but who"
"loves Ilaria, one of the famous beauties of the Court at Avellino. The"

"told with a vividness and daring, which give a singular fascination to"
the story.

"""Good, good! Come to my hotel. I will trust you."""
"We went to De Grammont's house, and after taking great precautions"
"against discovery, he gave me a small wooden box wound with yards of tape"
"and sealed with quantities of wax. I put the box in my pocket, saying:--"
"""I accept the trust on my honor, dear count, and though the package bears"
"no name nor address, I shall deliver it to the person for whom it is"
"intended."""
De Grammont said he knew nothing of the contents of the box except that
"it contained a message for a friend, and I believed him."
"When I left his house he came to the door with me, murmuring: ""My"
"gratitude! My gratitude! Also the gratitude of my king, which I hope may"
prove of far greater value to your friend than my poor offering of
"words."""
"I lost no time in seeking George, except to make sure that I was not"

me contained a personal communication from no less a person than Louis
"XIV of France, but I wanted to take no risk of betraying Hamilton by"
leading De Grammont or any one else to his hiding-place.
"Since Frances's providential escape, the king had suspected the right"
"persons of her rescue. At least he suspected Hamilton, and was seeking"
him more diligently than ever before. His Majesty had not shown me any
"mark of disfavor, but I feared he suspected me, and was sure he was not"
convinced that Frances's alibi had been proved by unsuborned testimony.

"upon them for long. One day, when their preparations were nearly"
"completed, a foreman came to Boyd, and said excitedly:"
"""Boss, I'd like you to look at the Iron Chinks right away."""
"""What's up?"""
"""I don't know, but something is wrong."" A hurried examination showed"
the machines to be cunningly crippled; certain parts were entirely
"missing, while others were broken."
"""They were all right when we brought them ashore,"" the man declared."
"""Somebody's been at them lately."""
"""When? How?"" questioned Boyd. ""We have had watchmen on guard all the"
"time. Have any strangers been about?"""
"""Nobody seems to know. When we got ready to set 'em just now, I saw"
"this."""
"The Iron Chink, or mechanical cleaner, is perhaps the most ingenious of"
the many labor-saving devices used in the salmon fisheries. It is an
"awkward-looking, yet very effective contrivance of revolving knives and"
"conveyors which seizes the fish whole and delivers it cleaned, clipped,"
"cut, and ready to be washed. With superhuman dexterity it does the work"
of twenty lightning-like butchers. Without the aid of these Iron
"Chinks, Boyd knew that his fish would spoil before they could be"
"handled. In a panic, he pursued his investigation far enough to realize"
that the machines were beyond repair; that what had seemed at first a
"trivial mishap was in fact an appalling disaster. Then, since his own"
"experience left him without resource, he hastened straightway to George"
"again and laughed softly as she made him sit, and herself sat upon his"
knee.
CHAPTER XXV.
THE TRUTH TOO LATE.
By four o'clock the next afternoon the Club had gathered ample materials
"for fresh gossip. The formalities attendant on the change of government,"
"the composition of the new Cabinet, the prospects of the election--these"
"alone would have supplied many hours, and besides them, indeed"
"supplanting them temporarily by virtue of an intenser interest, there"
"was the account of the inquest on Benyon's body. Medland had gone to it,"
"almost direct from his final interview with the Governor, and Kilshaw"
"had been there, fresh from a conference with Perry. The inquiry had"
"ended, as was foreseen directly Ned Evans' evidence was forthcoming, in"
a verdict of murder against Gaspard; but the interest lay in the course
"of the investigation, not in its issue. Mr. Duncombe, a famous comedian,"
who was then on tour in New Lindsey and had been made an honorary member
"of the Club, smacked his lips over the dramatic moment when the"
"ex-Premier, calmly and in a clear voice, had identified the person in"
"the photograph, declared the deceased man to have been Benyon, and very"
briefly stated how he had been connected with him in old days.
"""The lady,"" he said, ""is Mrs. Benyon. The other figure is that of"
"myself. I had not seen the deceased for many years."""
"""You were not on terms with him?"" asked the coroner, who, in common with"
"delighted to meet such redoubtable warriors, and hoped that now they"
"would come with me and help me, as my business was to fight Germans,"
"airships and all. This was strictly true, for, but for German"
"influence, there would have been no need to wage war on the Raiders"
who had only been induced to become our enemies by lying German
propaganda.
Idu said they would be only too glad to go with the Sahib and to help
him fight the enemies of the British Raj. He also told me that he had
already saved my life once that evening.
"""How was that?"" I asked, my spirits rising as I gazed through the"
darkness at my first three recruits.
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned Idu, ""when the airship, which you say is"
"no airship, stopped, in a little while we saw the figure of a man,"
"carrying a lantern moving towards us, and Halil here,"" laying his"
"hand on the shoulder of one of his pals, ""lifted his rifle and was"
"about to shoot. But I said, 'Nay. See, it is but one man. Let us wait"
and see who he is.' And then the lantern went out and there was no
"longer a target."""
"""You did well, Idu,"" I said solemnly. ""You have most certainly saved"
"my life, and as you seem to be as intelligent as you are brave, I"
shall appoint you to my personal staff. I am the officer who has
"been sent out to take command of the forces along the Sarhad, and in"
Seistan. But at the present moment my chief concern is to find the
"right road to Saindak. Can you show it to me?"""
"Idu laughed. ""I could lead you there blindfold, Sahib."""
"I felt the difficulties of the road were now over, and, piloted by"
"The time was barely 10 o’clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with"
a taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets.
"Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and"
"artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown"
"the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and"
"slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The"
vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the
lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the
majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since
been closed.
When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his
"walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an"
unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man
spoke up quickly.
"“It’s all right, officer,” he said, reassuringly. “I’m just waiting for"
a friend. It’s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little
"funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make"
certain it’s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a
restaurant where this store stands—‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”
"“Until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”"
The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light
"showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white"
"scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly"
set.
"“Twenty years ago to-night,” said the man, “I dined here at ‘Big Joe’"
"Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the"
Once again I am at an age when I walk in the moonlight. Thirty years ago I
"walked in the moonlight, too, walked on crackling, snowy roads, on bare,"
"frozen ground, round unlocked barns, on the hunt for love. How well I"
remember it! But it is no longer the same moonlight. I could even read by
it the letter she gave me. But there are no such letters any more.
"Everything is changed. The tale is told, and tonight I walk abroad on an"
"errand of the head, not of the heart: I shall go across to the trading"
center and dispatch a knapsack by the steamer; after that I shall wander
"on. And that requires nothing but a little ordinary training in walking,"
"and the light of the moon to see by. But in those old days, those young"
"days, we studied the almanac in the autumn to find out if there would be a"
"moon on Twelfth Night, for we could use it then."
Everything is changed; I am changed. The tale lies within the teller.
They say that old age has other pleasures which youth has not: deeper
"pleasures, more lasting pleasures. That is a lie. Yes, you have read"
"right: that is a lie. Only old age itself says this, in a self-interest"
that flaunts its very rags. The old man has forgotten when he stood on the
"summit, forgotten his own self, his own _alias_, red and white,"
"blowing a golden horn. Now he stands no longer--no, he sits--it is less of"
"a strain to sit. But now there comes to him, slow and halting, fat and"
"stupid, the honor of old age. What can a sitting man do with honor? A man"
on his feet can use it; to a sitting man it is only a possession. But
"honor is meant to be used, not to be sat with."

and serene in her undisputed position. In her childish days her material
kingdom was limited to the walls of her sea-chamber but as the child
"expanded into the young girl, so expanded her conception of the limits"
of her kingdom. And with this widening view came gradually and curiously
the consciousness that though her uncle and aunt were exquisitely
"honoured and beloved agents who looked to the welfare of her realm,"
yet they could not relieve her of certain gracious responsibilities.
"Instinctively, and with imperceptible gradations, she began to make"
her influence felt in the house itself. But it was an influence in the
spiritual and not material sense of the word; the hovering presence and
not the controlling hand.
"When, shortly after the arrival of the two men, Walter Herold went up to"
"his room, he found a great vase of daffodils on his dressing-table and"
"a pencilled note from Stella in her unformed handwriting, for one cannot"
learn to write copper-plate when one lies forever on the flat of one's
back.
"_Great High Favourite: Here are some daffodils, because they laugh and"
dance like you. Stellamaris._
And on his dressing-table John Risca found a mass of snowdrops and a
note:
_Great High Belovedest: A beautiful white silver cloud came to my window
"to-day, and I wished I could tear it in half and save you a bit for the"
palace. But snowdrops are the nearest things I could think of instead.
Your telegram was a joy. Love. S._
Beside the bowl of flowers was another note:

"and now to the army to betray the city. A single word of denunciation,"
and Tzerclas' life would not be worth three minutes' purchase--a rope
and the nearest butcher's hook would end it. My mind was made up to
say the word.
I suppose I had been going about in this state of vigilance three days
"or more, when something, but not the thing I sought, rewarded it. At"
the time I was on my way back from morning drill. It was a little
"after eight, and the streets and the people wore an air bright, yet"
"haggard. Night, with its perils, was over; day, with its privations,"
"lay before us. My mind was on the common fortunes, but I suppose my"
"eyes were mechanically doing their work, for on a sudden I saw"
"something at a window, took perhaps half a step, and stopped as if I"
had been shot.
"I had seen Marie's face! Nay, I still saw it, while a man might count"
two. Then it was gone. And I stood gasping.
"I suppose I stood so for half a minute, waiting, with the blood racing"
"from my heart to my head, and every pulse in my body beating. But she"
did not reappear. The door of the house did not open. Nothing
happened.
Yet I had certainly seen her; for I remembered particulars--the
"expression of her face, the surprise that had leapt into her eyes as"
"they met mine, the opening of the lips in an exclamation."
And still I stood gazing at the window and nothing happened.
"At last I came to myself, and I scanned the house. It was a large"

centimeters between initial and final check stations. Your take-off
"will be practically unobstructed, but you will have to use the utmost"
"caution in landing upon Mars, because in order to avoid a weightless"
"detour and a loss of thirty-one minutes, you must pass very close"
to both the Martian satellites. To do so safely you must pass the
"last meteorological station, M14, on schedule time plus or minus five"
"seconds, at scheduled velocity plus or minus ten meters, with exactly"
"the given negative acceleration of 981.27 centimeters, and exactly upon"
"the pilot ray M14 will have set for you."""
"""All x."" Breckenridge studied his triplex chronometer intently, then"
"unplugged and glanced around the control room, in various parts of which"
half a dozen assistants were loafing at their stations.

"projectors!"""
The first assistant scanned his meters narrowly as he swung a
"multi-point switch in a flashing arc. ""Converter efficiency 100,"

"""Happen to know if he had any relations, sir?"""
"""H'm. He was a widower, I believe."""
"""Children?"""
"""Really,"" said Mr. Kilshaw, with a faint smile, ""I don't know."""
And he escaped from pertinacious Mr. Dawson with some alacrity. When he
"was outside, he stopped suddenly. ""Shall I tell 'em to apply to"
"Medland?"" he asked himself, with a malicious chuckle. ""No, I'll wait a"
"bit yet,"" and he walked on, wondering whether by any chance Mr. Benham"
had been done to death to save the Premier. This fanciful idea he soon
"dismissed with a laugh; it never entered his head, prejudiced as he was,"
"to think that Medland himself had any hand in the matter. After all, he"
"was a man of common sense, and he quickly arrived at a conclusion which"
"he expressed by exclaiming,"
"""The poor fool's been showing his money. Who's got my five hundred now,"
"I wonder?"""
"His wonderings would have been satisfied, had Aladdin's carpet or other"
magical contrivance transported him to where the steamship _Pride of the
"South_ was ploughing her way through the waves, bound from Kirton to San"
"Francisco, with liberty to touch at several South American ports. A"
"thick-set, short man, shipped at the last moment as cook's mate, in"
"substitution for a truant, was lying on his back, smoking a cigarette,"
"looking up at the bright stars, and ever and again gently pressing his"
hand on a little lump inside his shirt. He seemed at peace with all the
"world, though he was ready to be at war, if need be, and his knife,"
"burnished and clean, lay handy to his fingers. He turned on his side and"
"enough of the protocol translated by tomorrow, the press package ready."
Then we drop it on the papers and blow town.
"From the hallway outside a bell chimed faintly as the elevator opened,"
a private lift that came directly up from the lobby. When he heard the
"heavy footsteps of the couriers, accompanied by MNB guards, he stepped"
over and quickly glanced out. The two blue-suits were each carrying a
large satchel handcuffed to the left wrist. Obviously the third had
"stayed downstairs, guarding the van."
"""This way."" The heavy-jowled director of the MNB bond trading desk"
stepped out and motioned them in. The play was on.
Kenji Nogami's issue of Mino Industries debentures had been registered
with the Issuing House Association the previous day. This morning they
"would be acquired by Vance, using a wire transfer between the Moscow"
Narodny Bank on Saint Swithins Lane and Westminster Union Bank's bond
"desk. After that there would be a second transaction, whereby Sumitomo"
"Bank, Limited would accept the debentures as security for a loan of one"
"hundred million dollars, to be wire-transferred back to Westminster"
Union and from there to Moscow Narodny Bank. Everything had been
prearranged. The whole transaction would require only minutes.
Unless there was a glitch.
Vance had fully expected that Tanzan Mino would send a welcoming
"committee to Nogami's premises, which was why he'd arranged for the"
money to be delivered here at Moscow Narodny's side-street branch. He
"figured the Soviets, at least, would play it straight. KGB wanted its"
file closed.
"Then too, Eva still had the protocol. Their back-up insurance policy."

"""You are going to shoot him down like a rat in a trap!"" Beatrice burst"
out passionately.
The others had already hurried on. With a gentle force he urged her to
follow them.
"""Or be shot down myself,"" he said. ""Leave me to do my duty as I think"
"best."""
"She met his grave eyes defiantly, but perhaps some instinct told her"
"that he was risking his life for a poor chance--for their last chance,"
"for without a word she turned away, apparently in the direction which"
her companions had already taken.
"As soon as she was out of sight, Nicholson recharged his smoking"
"revolver, and stood there quietly waiting. His trained ear heard the"
firing in front of the bungalow cease. He knew then that his men were
"retiring to join Colonel Carmichael, and that he stood alone, the last"
barrier between death and those he loved. The sound of triumphant
shouting drew nearer; he heard the wrenching and tearing of doors
"crashing down before an impetuous onslaught, the cling of steel, a"
howl of sudden satisfaction. His hand tightened upon his revolver; he
"stood ready to meet his enemy single-handed, to fight out the duel"
between man and man. But no one came. A bewildering silence had
followed upon the last bloodthirsty cry. It was as though the hand of
death had fallen and with one annihilating blow beaten down the
approaching horde in the high tide of their victory. But of the two
this strange stillness was the more terrible. It penetrated to the
little waiting group in the old bungalow and filled them with the
Suddenly a cart would come down one of these narrow streets without
"sidewalks, driving very quickly and scattering the women and children"
seated by the gutter.
In all these poor quarters there were lanes crossed by ropes loaded with
torn washing; there were wretched black shops from which an odour of
grease exhaled; there were narrow streets with mounds of garbage in the
"middle. In the very palaces, now shorn of their grandeur, appeared"
the same decoration of rags waving in the breeze. In the Theatre of
"Marcellus one’s gaze got lost in the depths of black caves, where smiths"
stood out against flames.
"This mixture of sumptuousness and squalor, of beauty and ugliness, was"
reflected in the people; young and most beautiful women were side by
"side with fat, filthy old ones covered with rags, their eyes gloomy, and"
of a type that recalled old African Jewesses.
_WHAT CAN BE READ ON WALLS_
Cæsar and Kennedy went on toward the Temple of Vesta and followed the
river bank until the Tiber Embankment ended.
Here the banks were green and the river clearer and more poetic. To the
left rose the Aventine with its villas; in the harbour two or three tugs
were tied up; and here and there along the pier stood a crane. Evening
was falling and the sky was filling with pink clouds.
"They sat down awhile on the side of the road, and Cæsar entertained"
himself deciphering the inscriptions written in charcoal on a mud-wall.

it with. Not even a button you could press.
That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps
back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock
"combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice"
"key--might as well see if that's it, I figured."
"""Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame."""
"For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million"
"possible combinations--The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and"
a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed
around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.
I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and
"sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found"
myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the
cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.
He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that
looked hard and soft at the same time.
"His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his"
back.
"And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the"
"deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards"
in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation--the kind of tan
that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His
"hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long"
combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down
Is _Alice in Wonderland?_  Is _Treasure Island?_  These are
"masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how"
much more pleasure when we are grown-up.  In any case what do we mean
"by ""children""?  A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of"
fourteen--are they all to like the same thing?  And is a book
"""suitable for a boy of twelve"" any more likely to please a boy of"
twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;
"even if the novel be described truly as ""suitable for a man of"
"thirty-seven""?  I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult"
problems.
But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which
"children will like, unless he write it for himself first.  That being"
"so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups.  How"
grown-up I did not realise until I received a letter from an unknown
reader a few weeks after its first publication; a letter which said
"that he was delighted with my clever satires of the Kaiser, Mr. Lloyd"
"George and Mr. Asquith, but he could not be sure which of the"
characters were meant to be Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Bonar Law.
Would I tell him on the enclosed postcard?  I replied that they were
thinly disguised on the title-page as Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton.  In
"fact, it is not that sort of book."
"But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what"
sort of book it is.  Perhaps no explanation is necessary.  Read in it
what you like; read it to whomever you like; be of what age you like;
"it can only fall into one of two classes.  Either you will enjoy it,"
or you won't.
It is that sort of book.

"And from that day, a year and a half ago, there has been keen"
competition among the inhabitants of the dosshouse as to which can
"swear the hardest at the merchant.  And last night there was a ""slight"
"skirmish with hot words,"" as the Captain called it, between Petunikoff"
and himself.  Having dismissed the architect the merchant approached
the Captain.
"""What are you hatching?"" asked he, putting his hand to his cap, perhaps"
"to adjust it, perhaps as a salutation."
"""What are you plotting?"" answered the Captain in the same tone. He"
moved his chin so that his beard trembled a little; a non-exacting
person might have taken it for a bow; otherwise it only expressed the
desire of the Captain to move his pipe from one corner of his mouth to
"the other.  ""You see, having plenty of money, I can afford to sit"
"hatching it.  Money is a good thing, and I possess it,"" the Captain"
"chaffed the merchant, casting cunning glances at him.  ""It means that"
"you serve money, and not money you,"" went on Kuvalda, desiring at the"
same time to punch the merchant's belly.
"""Isn't it all the same?  Money makes life comfortable, but no money,"""
... and the merchant looked at the Captain with a feigned expression of
"suffering.  The other's upper lip curled, and exposed large, wolf-like"
teeth.
"""With brains and a conscience, it is possible to live without it. Men"
only acquire riches when they cease to listen to their conscience ...
"the less conscience the more money!"""
"""Just so; but then there are men who have neither money nor conscience."""
"""You're free now to do as you like,"" he answered, and left her. He felt"
as if he were treading on air on his way back to the mid-ship saloon.
"Captain Dove, in the same _négligé_ costume, was busy at breakfast when"
"Slyne walked in upon him again, but looked up from his plate for long"
enough to mumble a malicious question.
"""Yes, I've fixed it all up with her,"" Slyne answered with assumed"
"nonchalance. ""You can always trust me to know how to handle a woman,"
"Dove."""
"Captain Dove shot a derisive glance in his direction. ""Is she willing to"
"marry you after all, then?"" he demanded, feigning a surprise by no means"
complimentary.
"""Not just at once, of course,"" returned his companion, and left the old"
man to infer whatever he pleased.
In response to a shouted order of Captain Dove's a slatternly
cook-steward brought Slyne a steaming platter of beans with a bit of
"bacon-rind on top, and an enamelled mug containing a brew which might,"
"by courtesy, have been called coffee. There was a tray of broken ship's"
"biscuits, a tin containing some peculiarly rank substitute for butter,"
"upon the table, with the other equally uninviting concomitants of a"
meagre meal.
"""_Tchk-tchk!_"" commented Slyne, and sat down to satisfy his hunger as"
"best he might; while Captain Dove, having overheard that criticism, eyed"
"him inimically, and proceeded to puff a peculiarly rank cigar in his"
face.
"""You might as well be getting dressed now,"" said Slyne indifferently."
"""Oh, no, we shan't,"" I remarked calmly, for I had moved to a position"
"of tactical advantage on the Marine's port beam. ""We will have the"
"story here, if you don't mind, Dawson."""
"He stamped pettishly on the floor, whipped off his cap, and spun it"
"across the room. ""Confound you, Mr. Copplestone!"" he growled. ""How"
"the--how the--do you do it?"" He could not think of an expletive mild"
"enough for Mrs. Cary's ears. ""There's something about me that I can't"
"hide. What is it? If you don't tell, I will get you on the Regulation"
compelling all British subjects to answer questions addressed to them
"by a competent naval or military authority."""
"""You don't happen to be either, Dawson,"" said I unkindly. ""And,"
"beside, there was never yet a law made which could compel a man to"
"speak or a woman to hold her tongue. Some day perhaps, if you are"
"good, I will show you how the trick is done. But not yet. I want to"
have something to bargain with when you cast me into jail. Out with
"the story; we are impatient. If I mistake not, you come to us Dawson"
"triumphant. You haven't the air of a broken man."""
"""I have been successful,"" he answered gravely, ""but I am a long, long"
"way from feeling triumphant. No, thank you, Mrs. Cary, I have had my"
"breakfast, but if I might trouble you for a cup of coffee? Many"
"thanks."""
"Dawson sat down, and Cary moved about inspecting him from every angle."
"""No,"" declared he at last, ""I cannot see the smallest resemblance, not"
the smallest. You were thin; now you are distinctly plump. Your hair
was nearly white. Your cheeks had fallen in as if your back teeth were
"missing. Your lower lip stuck out."" Dawson smiled, highly gratified."

to 12 points of the new system; thus six picas are equal to 1 inch or
72 points. Printers still estimate the length and width of a page or a
column by the pica; thus a page 4 inches wide is 24 picas.
"The ""em"" is the square of a type body. Thus a ""12-point em"" is 12"
"points wide and 12 points long, or 1 pica long and 1 pica wide. A"
"""10-point em"" is a 10 point square, etc. The em used in measuring"
"newspaper column widths, magazine columns, etc., is known as the em"

"In using larger faces for headings and display, or smaller faces for"
"footnotes or quoted matter, the printer will select from the same"
"family to which the type belongs, or from some family which combines"
with it harmoniously. Old-style faces should not be used with modern
"faces, but the Scotch face, which is a cross between old-style and"
"modern, combines well with either."
"As to leading, this volume is leaded with a 1-point lead; between the"
first and second lines of the preceding paragraph there is no leading

At this girl’s right hand sat a young man about twenty-four. He was
"well-built, active, strong-jawed and good-natured. But if his"
"description seems to follow that of James Williams, divest it of"
anything Cloverdalian. This man belonged to hard streets and sharp
"corners. He looked keenly about him, seeming to begrudge the asphalt"
under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch.

The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the
last seat. The other passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her
was her Bluebeard’s chamber.
Her eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams. Between two ticks of a watch
"they exchanged their life’s experiences, histories, hopes and fancies."
"And all, mind you, with the eye, before two men could have decided"
whether to draw steel or borrow a match.
"The bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together,"
their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents—a comparison
that is not meant to go further. Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the
conference.
"And now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man"
in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another
hurried to join him.

"Islands, and after these were surrendered by the Dutch, Thomas Morgan was"
left in charge.
In 1686 he sailed in command of a company of buccaneers to assist Governor
"Wells, of St. Kitts, against the French. The defence of the island was"
"disgraceful, and Morgan's company was the only one which displayed any"
"courage or discipline, and most of them were killed or wounded, Colonel"
Morgan himself being shot in both legs.
Often these buccaneer leaders altered their titles from colonel to
"captain, to suit the particular enterprise on which they were engaged,"
according if it took place on sea or land.
"MORGAN, SIR HENRY. Buccaneer."
"This, the greatest of all the ""brethren of the coast,"" was a Welshman,"
born at Llanrhymmy in Monmouthshire in the year 1635. The son of a
"well-to-do farmer, Robert Morgan, he early took to the seafaring life."
"When quite a young man Morgan went to Barbadoes, but afterwards he"
"settled at Jamaica, which was his home for the rest of his life."
"Morgan may have been induced to go to the West Indies by his uncle,"
"Colonel Morgan, who was for a time Deputy Governor of Jamaica, a post Sir"
Henry Morgan afterwards held.
"Morgan was a man of great energy, and must have possessed great power of"
winning his own way with people. That he could be absolutely unscrupulous
"when it suited his ends there can be little doubt. He was cruel at times,"
but was not the inhuman monster that he is made out to be by Esquemeling
"in his ""History of the Bucaniers."" This was largely proved by the evidence"
given in the suit for libel brought and won by Morgan against the
"have left him long ago,' she said, 'but I tried to save him. Thank God"
"we have no children,' That seemed to be her most insistent thought,"
for she repeated it over and over again. 'Thank God that we have no
"children.'"""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" said I, deeply moved."
Long ago the wife had come to me and pleaded for her husband. She had
"shed no tear; she had admitted the justice, the necessity, of my"
"sentence. ""Can you not give him another chance?"" she had asked. ""No,"""
"I had answered sadly. ""He has exhausted all the chances."" When she had"
"risen to go and I had pressed her hand, she had said, still dry-eyed,"
"""You are right, sir, it is no use, no use at all. Thank God that we"
"have no children."""
"""I hope that you were gentle with her, Dawson,"" I repeated."
"He astonished me by the suddenness of his explosion. ""Damn,"" roared"
"he--""damn and blast! Do you think that I am a brute. Gentle! It was as"
"much as I could do not to kiss the woman, as your little daughter"
"kissed me, and to promise that I would get her husband off somehow."
"But I should not be a friend to her if I tried to save that man."""
"So Dawson had soft spots in his armour of callousness, and little"
Jane's instinct was far surer than mine. She had taken to him at
"sight. When I tried to get from her why, why he had so marked an"
"attraction for her, her replies baffled me more than the central fact."
"""I love Colonel Dawson. He is a nice man. He has a little girl like"
me. Her name is Clara. Her birthday is next month. I shall save up my
pocket money and send Clara a present. I like Colonel Dawson better
"even than dear Bailey."" I tore my hair, for ""Bailey"" is a wholly"
"imaginary friend of little Jane, whom I invented one evening at her"
bedside and who has grown gradually into a personage of clearly
"""Nay,"" he said deliberately, ""I have been both judged and misjudged"
"myself, and it would ill become me in like manner to judge others. But"
"if that man is not of your country and my trade, Ramon Garcia has lived"
"in vain. That is all."""
Concha nodded a little uncertainly.
"""Yes,"" she said slowly, ""yes--of my country. I believe you. He has the"
Andalucian manner of wearing his clothes. If he were a girl he would
know how to tie a ribbon irregularly and how to place a bow-knot a
little to the side in the right place--things which only Andalucians
"know. But what in the world do you mean by 'of your profession'?"""
"El Sarria smoked a while in silence, inhaling the blue cigarette smoke"
"luxuriously, and causing it to issue from his nostrils white and"
moisture-laden with his breath. Then he spoke.
"""I mean of my late profession,"" he explained, smiling on Concha; ""it"
will not do for a man on the high-road to a commission to commit himself
"to the statement that he has practised as a bandit, or stopped a coach"
on the highway in the name of King Carlos Quinto that he might examine
"more at his ease the governmental mail bags. But our Sergeant--well, I"
am man-sworn and without honour if he hath not many a time taken
"blackmail without any such excuse!"""
Concha seemed to be considering deeply. Her pretty mouth was pursed up
"like a ripe strawberry, and her brows were knitted so fiercely that a"
deep line divided the delicately arched eyebrows.
"""And to this I can add somewhat,"" she began presently; ""they say (I know"
not with what truth) that I have some left-handed gipsy blood in me--and
"if that man be not a Gitano--why, then I have never seen one. Besides,"

"As we left the Blake mansion, Kennedy remarked, “We must trace that car"
somehow—at least we must get someone working on that.”
Half an hour later we were in a towering office building on Liberty
"Street, the home of various kinds of insurance. Kennedy stopped before"
"a door which bore the name, “Douglas Garwood: Insurance Adjuster.”"
"Briefly, Craig told the story of the stolen car, omitting the account"
of the dastardly method taken to blackmail Mrs. Blake. As he proceeded
"a light seemed to break on the face of Garwood, a heavyset man, whose"
very gaze was inquisitorial.
"“Yes, the theft has been reported to us already by Dr. Wilson herself,”"
he interrupted. “The car was insured in a company I represent.”
"“I had hoped so,” remarked Kennedy, “Do you know the woman?” he added,"
watching the insurance adjuster who had been listening intently as he
told about the fair motor car thief.
"“Know her?” repeated Garwood emphatically. “Why, man, we have been so"
close to that woman that I feel almost intimate with her. The
"descriptions are those of a lady, well-dressed, and with a voice and"
"manner that would carry her through any of the fashionable hotels,"
perhaps into society itself.”
"“One of a gang of blackmailers, then,” I hazarded."
"Garwood shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps,” he acquiesced. “It is"
"automobile thieving that interests me, though. Why,” he went on, rising"
"excitedly, “the gangs of these thieves are getting away with half a"
"desire to visit it, and she, finding him entirely unsympathetic, had"
handed him over to her subordinate. “None of them know what gratitude
"is. As soon as they get out of here, they forget everything that has"
"been done for them; and as for coming back to pay their respects, or"
"writing a letter even, they never think of it.”"
"Kitchen, utensils, floors, walls, dormitory, orphans--all were"
"spotlessly clean, the orphans sluiced and scrubbed from morning to"
night; but of things that might give a little hint of the joy of life
there was no sign.
"“This is the infirmary,” said the matron, with her hand on the"
door-knob.
"“I should like to see it,” said John."
"They entered. An almost full-grown orphan, doing duty as nurse, rose"
"from her task of plain sewing and bobbed a curtsy. The room was clean,"
"comfortless, dark, and cold. Two pictures, prints of the Crucifixion"
"and the Martyrdom of St. Stephen, hung on the walls. There were three"
"narrow, hard beds, two of which were occupied. Some grapes on a chair"
beside one of them marked the patient in whom he was interested. John
noticed angrily that some flowers which he had sent the day before had
been confiscated.
"“This is the gentleman who has been so kind to you,” said the matron."
"Unity Blake looked wonderingly into the dark, rugged face of the man who"
stood over her and regarded her with mingled pain and pity. They had not
"told her his name. This, then, was the unknown benefactor whose image,"
"like that of some elusive Apollo, Giver of Things Beautiful, had haunted"
her poor dreams.

"Fifteen minutes remained, during which time one department head after"
another would report to the captain of the liner that everything in his

PREFACE
"This book was written in 1915, for the amusement of my wife and myself"
at a time when life was not very amusing; it was published at the end
"of 1917; was reviewed, if at all, as one of a parcel, by some brisk"
"uncle from the Tiny Tots Department; and died quietly, without"
seriously detracting from the interest which was being taken in the
"World War, then in progress."
It may be that the circumstances in which the book was written have
"made me unduly fond of it.  When, as sometimes happens, I am"
introduced to a stranger who starts the conversation on the right
"lines by praising, however insincerely, my books, I always say, ""But"
"you have not read the best one."" Nine times out of ten it is so.  The"
"tenth takes a place in the family calendar; St. Michael or St. Agatha,"
"as the case may be, a red-letter or black-letter saint, according to"
whether the book was bought or borrowed.  But there are few such
"saints, and both my publisher and I have the feeling (so common to"
publishers and authors) that there ought to be more.  So here comes
"the book again, in a new dress, with new decorations, yet much, as far"
"as I am concerned, the same book, making the same appeal to me; but,"
"let us hope, a new appeal, this time, to others."
"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble.  Unless I"
"can say, ""For those, young or old, who like the things which I like,"""
"I find it difficult to answer.  Is it a children's book?  Well, what"
do we mean by that?  Is _The Wind in the Willows_ a children's book?
"going to be: all the wind tunnel tests, all the computer simulations,"
even the supersonic test flights--everything said go. _Daedalus I_ was
going to make history tomorrow morning.
"Except, he told himself, it's going to be a very different history from"
the one everybody expects.
"""Major Yuri Andreevich Androv, please report to Hangar Quadrant"
"immediately."""
The stridency of the facility's paging system always annoyed him. He
"glanced at the long line of computer screens one last time, then"
shrugged and checked his watch. Who wanted him?
"Well, a new planeload of Soviet VIPs reportedly had flown in yesterday,"
though he hadn't seen any of them yet. He figured now that everything
"looked ready, the _nomenklatura _were flooding in to bask in triumph."
Maybe after a day of vodka drinking and back slapping with the
"officials in Project Management, they'd sobered up and realized they"
were expected to file reports. So they were finally getting around to
talking to the people who were doing the actual work. They'd summon in
a few staffers who had hands-on knowledge of the project and commission
"a draft report, which they'd then file, unread, under their own names."
Typical.
"He reached for his leather flight jacket, deciding on a brisk walk to"
work off the tension. The long corridor leading from the East Quadrant
to the Hangar Quadrant took him directly past Checkpoint Central and
"the entry to West Quadrant, the Soviet sector, which also contained the"
"flight simulator and the main wind tunnel, or Number One, both now"
quiet.
CHAPTER XXIX
A LITTLE QUEEN AT HOME
"Meanwhile, leaving the grave in the shaded corner of the farm garden, La"
Giralda went out with many strange things moving in her heart. More than
"once she had seen her own children laid in the dust, with far less of"
emotion than this nameless little girl clutching her wooden puppet and
"smiling, well-pleased, in the face of the Last Terror."
She found the donkey standing still and patient between his fagot
"bundles. The she-goats, on the other hand, had scattered a little this"
way or that as this blade of grass or that spray of _encina_ had allured
them. But a sharp cry or two called them together. For it was many hours
"since any of them had been milked, and the full teats standing out every"
way ached for the pressing fingers.
"The Sergeant had, of course, long since completely disappeared up the"
"hillside, so La Giralda, with one comprehensive look back at the"
"desolate farmhouse, drove her little flock before her towards the town"
"gates of San Ildefonso. Like a picture, the dustily red roofs lay"
"beneath in the sunshine, spire and roof-garden, pigeon-house and terrace"
"walk. Parts of the white palace of La Granja also were to be seen, but"
"indistinctly, since it lay amid a pleasant distraction of greenery, and"
the woods waved and the falling waters glimmered about it like the
landscape of a dream.
"From the _Colegiata_ came the tolling of a bell, slow and irregular. All"
"else was silent. Presently, with her little flock before her, La Giralda"
"""José Maria, the Gitano, the prince of brigands!"" murmured La Giralda."
"""Ah,"" said the Sergeant, coolly, ""I have heard of him."""
CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
"Not a word more was uttered between the two. La Giralda, for no reason"
"that she would acknowledge even to herself, had conceived an infinite"
"respect for Sergeant Cardono, and was ready to obey him implicitly--a"
fact which shows that our sweet Concha was over-hasty in supposing that
one woman in any circumstances can ever answer for another when there is
a man in the case.
But on this occasion La Giralda's submission was productive of no more
"than a command to go down into the town of San Ildefonso, the white"
"houses of which could clearly be seen a mile or two below, while the"
sergeant betook himself to certain haunts of the gipsy and the brigand
known to him in the fastnesses of the Guadarrama.
Like a dog La Giralda complied. She sharpened a stick with a knife which
"she took from a little concealed sheath in her leathern leggings, and"
with it she proceeded to quicken the donkey's extremely deliberate pace.
"Then with the characteristic cry of the goatherd, she gathered her flock"
together and drove them before her down the deeply-rutted road which led
"from the farmhouse. She had not proceeded far, however, when she"
"1. A SOURCE below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic"
matter they have been derived by slow change.
"2. A RESERVOIR above, in which they have gathered. This is either"
a porous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.
"3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under"
"pressure owing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them"
"from escaping to the surface, the reservoir must have the shape of"
"an ANTICLINE, DOME, or LENS."
"4. It must also have an IMPERVIOUS COVER, usually a shale. In"
"these reservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous,"
reaching in extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred
pounds to the square inch. When tapped it rushes out with a
"deafening roar, sometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In"
accounting for this pressure we must remember that the gas has
been compressed within the pores of the reservoir rock by artesian
"water, and in some cases also by its own expansive force. It is"
not uncommon for artesian water to rise in wells after the
exhaustion of gas and oil.
LIFE OF THE ORDOVICIAN
"During the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types"
"already present branched widely into new genera and species, and"
new and higher types appeared.
Sponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their
climax.
STROMATOPORA--colonies of minute hydrozoans allied to corals--grew
special interest in his spotless Lady Geraldine.
[Illustration: He stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the
fair Geraldine (page 155).]
"""I trow so,"" was the carelessly-spoken reply of Lord Sandford, as he"
adjusted his wig and suffered his valet to spray some delicate perfume
"over his person, as a finishing touch to his toilet.  ""The Lady"
Geraldine is no longer to lead the life of a nun.  It has been decreed
"that she is to show her lovely face abroad, and add thereby a lustre to"
"her mother’s charms."""
"""A lustre her ladyship would well dispense with,"" laughed another.  ""She"
would sooner pose as the stepmother than the mother of a grown-up
"daughter—ha, ha!  How comes it that this young beauty hath never been"
shown before to the world?  Other damsels make their _début_ at sixteen;
"but the Lady Geraldine can scarce be less than twenty, and has the"
"dignity of matronhood."""
"""A vast deal more dignity than the most part of our matrons do show"
"forth,"" spoke Lord Sandford incisively.  ""Doubtless she learned it from"
"her grandam, her mother’s mother and her father’s aunt; for my Lord and"
"my Lady Romaine are cousins, and Mrs. Adair was trusted and revered by"
"both.  Young children are in the way of such gay ladies of fashion,"
"wherefore the babe was sent to its grandam, and remained with her till"
"the virtuous and discreet old lady died, having bequeathed her store of"
"wisdom and discretion to the beautiful maid she had reared."""
"""And her fortune too,"" sniggered one gay dandy. ""Do not forget that"
"item, my lord.  It is whispered that it will make the biggest of her"
"charms.  What is the figure?  Doth anybody know?"""
damage done to her property.
The two women readily agreed. In the curtailment of their movements
and the absence of normal means of communication their life at Villa
Beau-séjour was belying its name. Their supply of money was coming
to an end; attempts must be made to regularize that position by
drawing on Mrs. Warren's German investments and the capital she
still had in Belgian stock--if that were negotiable at all.
Where should they go? Mrs. Warren still had some lien on the Hotel
"Édouard-Sept (the name, out of deference to the Germans, had been"
changed to Hotel Impérial). With the influence of the Government
Secretary behind her she might turn out some of its occupants and
"regain the use of the old ""appartement."" This would accommodate"
Vivie too. And there was no reason why their friend should not place
"his own lodging and office at the same hotel, which was situated"
conveniently on the Rue Royale not far from the Governor's residence
in the Rue de la Loi.
"So this plan was carried out. And in December, 1914, Mrs. Warren had"
"some brief flicker of happiness once more, and even Vivie felt the"
nightmare had lifted a little. It was life again. Residence at the
Villa Beau-séjour had almost seemed an entombment of the living.
"Here, in the heart of Brussels, at any rate, you got some news every"
"day, even if much of it was false. The food supply was more certain,"
"there were 700,000 people all about you. True, the streets were very"
badly lit at night and fuel was scarce and dear. But you were in
contact with people.
"In January, Vivie tried to get into touch with the American"
"Legation, not only to send news of their condition to England but to"
ascertain whether permission might not be obtained for them to leave
logical.”
"“Yes, certainly. And the effort to learn about useful things seems"
"natural and logical to me too, but not to learn about merely agreeable"
things. To learn medicine and mechanics is logical; but to learn to look
at a picture or to hear a symphony is an absurdity.”
“Why?”
“At any rate the neophytes that go to see a Rafael picture or to hear
"a Bach sonata and have an exclamation all ready, give me the sad"
impression of a flock of lambs. As for your sublime pedagogues of the
"Ruskin type, they seem to me to be the fine flower of priggishness, of"
"pedantry, of the most objectionable bourgeoisie.”"
“What things your brother is saying!” exclaimed Kennedy.
"“You shouldn’t notice him,” said Laura."
“Those artistic pedagogues enrage me; they remind me of Protestant
"pastors and of the friars that go around dressed like peasants, and who"
I think are called Brothers of the Christian Doctrine. The pedagogues
"are Brothers of the Esthetic Doctrine, one of the stupidest inventions"
that ever occurred to the English. I don’t know which I find more
"ridiculous, the Salvation Army or Ruskin’s books.”"
“Why have you this hatred for Ruskin?”
“I find him an idiot. I only skimmed through a book of his called _The
"Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and the first thing I read was a paragraph"
in which he said that to use an imitation diamond or any other imitation
"stone was a lie, an imposition, and a sin. I immediately said: ‘This man"
armored hide and a small serpentine head weaving back and forth among
the jungle growths.
*       *       *       *       *
"Occasionally he had landed--always staying close to the space ship,"
"for Jupiter's gravity made movement a slow and laborious process, and"
he didn't want to be caught too far from security. At such times he
might hear a crashing and splashing and see a reptilian head loom
gigantically at him through the fog. Then he would discharge the
"deadly explosive gun which was Earth's latest weapon, and the creature"
would crash to the ground. The chorus of hissings and bellowings would
"increase as he hastened slowly and laboriously back to the ship,"
indicating that other unseen monsters of the steamy jungle had flocked
to tear the dead giant to pieces and bolt it down.
"Oh, Jupiter was a nice planet! mused Brand. A sweet place--if one"
happened to be a two-hundred-foot snake or something!
"He had always thought the entire globe was in that new, raw, marshy"
state. But he had worked only in one comparatively small area of the
northern hemisphere; had never been within thirty thousand miles of
"the red spot. What might lie in that ominous crimson patch, he could"
"not even guess. However, he reflected, he was soon to find out, though"
he might never live to tell about it.
"Shrugging his shoulders, he turned into the fifty story building in"
"which was his modest apartment. There he found, written by the"
"automatic stylus on his radio pad, the message: ""Be with you at seven"
"o'clock. Best regards, and I hope you strangle. Dex Harlow."""
*       *       *       *       *
"when supper was over, and she would not break faith with him even if it"
"were at the peril of her life. The next moment she went out, as did the"
red light in the Girl's lantern hanging on a peg of the outer door.
"""Oh, please, please,"" said the Girl, half-protestingly, half-willingly."
But the man was no longer to be denied; he kept on urging:
"""One kiss, only one."""
"Here was an appeal which could no longer be resisted, and though"
"half-frightened by the tone of his voice and the look in his eye, the"
Girl let herself be taken into his arms as she murmured:
"""'Tain't no use, I lay down my hands to you."""
"And so it was that, unconscious of the great havoc that was being"
"wrought by the storm, unconscious of the danger that momentarily"
"threatened their lives, they remained locked in each other's arms. The"
Girl made no attempt to silence him now or withdraw her hands from his.
Why should she? Had he not come to Cloudy Mountain to woo her? Was she
not awaiting his coming? To her it seemed but natural that the
"conventions should be as nothing in the face of love. His voice, low and"
"musical, charged with passion, thrilled through her."
"""I love you,"" said the man, with a note of possession that frightened"
"her while it filled her with strange, sweet joy. For months she had"
dreamed of him and loved him; no wonder that she looked upon him as her
hero and yielded herself entirely to her fate.
She lifted her eyes and he saw the love in them. She freed her hands
"from his grasp, and then gave them back to him in a little gesture of"
lamb with all kinds of animals[81] the extent to which the association of
ideas connected with the animals in question is carried.
If an ewe gives birth to a dog ... the king's land will revolt.
"If an ewe gives birth to a beaver[82] (?), the king's land will"
experience misery.
"If an ewe gives birth to a fox, Enlil[83] will maintain the rule of"
"the legitimate king for many years, or[84] the king will strengthen"
his power.
"If an ewe gives birth to a Mukh-Dul[85], the enemy will carry away"
"the inhabitants of the land, the land will despite its strength go to"
"ruin, the dynasty will be opposed, confusion in the land."
"If an ewe gives birth to a panther, the kingdom of the ruler will"
secure universal sway.
"If an ewe gives birth to a hyena (?), approach of Elam."
"If an ewe gives birth to a gazelle, the days of the ruler through the"
"grace of the gods will be long, or the ruler will have warriors."
"If an ewe gives birth to a hind, the son of the king will seize his"
"father's throne, or the approach of Subartu will overthrow the land."
"If an ewe gives birth to a roebuck, the son of the king will seize"
"his father's throne, or destruction of cattle[86]."
"If an ewe gives birth to a wild cow, revolt will prevail in the"
land.
"Geraldine, honour me by accepting my escort.—Grey, will you join us?"""
"He spoke the last words over his shoulder, and there was a note in his"
"voice which the young man had never heard before, and which he did not"
"fully understand.  It seemed to sting him, but he knew not why."
"""I thank you—no,"" he answered.  ""I am going home."""
And then he stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the fair
"Geraldine, who threw him one strange, half-appealing glance over her"
"shoulder, but spoke no word of farewell."
"Grey had meant to go home, but somehow he could not bring himself to do"
"so.  His brain seemed on fire, and his heart with it.  He knew not what"
"ailed him, but a fever was consuming him.  He left the gardens, but"
"walked on and on, not knowing or caring whither he went.  The night was"
"far spent, and the dawn was beginning to blush in the eastern sky,"
before he found himself in the region of Sandford House again.
The place was still and deserted.  The revellers and roisterers seemed
"all at home.  A watchman dozed at his post, thankful for the peace of"
"the streets, and Grey met no interruption, till suddenly, round a"
"corner, he came face to face with his host, who gave him a look, uttered"
"a short laugh, and linked his arm within his."
"""Well met, friend Grey!  You too have had no desire to woo the somnolent"
"god?  We find metal more attractive elsewhere.  Say now, what think you"
of the future Lady Sandford?  Methought you had eyes but for her
to-night.  Will she not queen it right royally here—the beautiful
"stately creature? You have taste, Grey, and I am well pleased that you"
"have.  Those painted, patched, and powdered Jezebels, smirking and"
"ogling and running all over the town for the adulation of the crowd, are"
"wound communicated with the pleura, and the patients died from"
septicæmia mainly due to absorption from the surface of that membrane
(_Pleural septicæmia_).
"No. 190 is a most striking instance of spontaneous cure, since no doubt"
can exist that both rectum and bladder were perforated.
"(180*) _Injury to the cæcum and ascending colon._--Boer,"
"wounded at Graspan while sheltering behind a rock, lying on his"
back.
"_Entry_ (Lee-Metford), in right thigh, 3 inches below and 1"
"inch within anterior superior spine of ilium; _exit_, in back,"
on a level with the fourth lumbar spinous process and 3 inches
from that point.
Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer
severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he
"was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent"
by train a distance of twenty-five miles.
When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as
"follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,"
especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and
distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and
"furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,"
"entirely thoracic, 30."
"Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and"
"motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial"
oedema and emphysema.
"The letter continued, “I am happy to say, however, that I have a"
prophylactic which will destroy any number of these germs if used up to
the ninth day. It is necessary only that you should place five thousand
dollars in an envelope and leave it for me to be called for at the desk
"of the Prince Henry Hotel. When the messenger delivers the money to me,"
the prophylactic will be sent immediately.
"“First of all, take a match and burn this letter to avoid spreading the"
disease. Then change your clothes and burn the old ones. Enclosed you
will find in a germ-proof envelope an exact copy of this letter. The
room should then be thoroughly fumigated. Do not come into close
contact with anyone near and dear to you until you have used the
"prophylactic. Tell no one. In case you do, the prophylactic will not be"
"sent under any circumstances. Very truly yours, DR. HANS HOPF.”"
"“Blackmail!” exclaimed Kennedy, looking intently again at the gelatine"
"on the second page, as I involuntarily backed away and held my breath."
"“Yes, I know,” responded Mrs. Blake anxiously, “but is it true?”"
There could be no doubt from the tone of her voice that she more than
half believed that it was true.
"“I cannot say—yet,” replied Craig, still cautiously scanning the"
apparently innocent piece of gelatine on the original letter which Mrs.
Blake had not destroyed. “I shall have to keep it and examine it.”
On the gelatine I could see a dark mass which evidently was supposed to
contain the germs.
"“I opened the letter here in this room,” she went on. “At first I"
"kidnapping----"""
Gatepath looked around anxiously. The men were alone in a recess of the
"club smoking-room. ""Yes,"" he whispered eagerly. ""Yes, go on."""
"""I shall not do anything of the sort. You are a nice sort of family"
"solicitor, Gatepath. Apart from the personal danger of playing tricks,"
"can't you see that your interest lies with the bouncing heir, not with"
"the snuffy old family? Don't be an ass. Bring him home, give the House"
"of Lords the sensation of their placid lives, and let the good old"
British public enjoy a week of laughter. How they will bellow with joy.
"And the newspapers! I can see, Gatepath, that your agreeable young heir"
"is going to be the Success of the Season."""
"""You are not very helpful,"" groaned Gatepath. ""There must be a"
solution; there must be some way of shielding the Family from this
"frightful humiliation."""
"The interview with the Chief was a complete failure, and Gatepath parted"
from his old friend both hurt and angry. He had not expected ribald
"laughter in so grave a social crisis. The Chief must be a Radical, a"
"Socialist, even a Bolshevik, one empty of all decent political"
principles.
It was on his way home that Gatepath bethought him of Madame Gilbert.
"She, that beautiful, loyal-hearted woman, would not laugh. He remembered"
the glitter of unshed tears in the violet eyes when she had bade him
farewell. It was his tactless hand upon the open wound of Caporetto
"which had aroused those tears. He remembered also that Madame was free,"
"and that she had been trained to do the ruthless, unscrupulous work of"
"the Secret Service. She did not look either ruthless or unscrupulous,"
and it was in a strictly professional sense that Gatepath connected her
"“Lady from the Stenographer’s Agency to see about the position,” said"
Pitcher.
"Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker"
tape.
"“What position?” he asked, with a frown."
"“Position of stenographer,” said Pitcher. “You told me yesterday to"
call them up and have one sent over this morning.”
"“You are losing your mind, Pitcher,” said Maxwell. “Why should I have"
given you any such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect
satisfaction during the year she has been here. The place is hers as
"long as she chooses to retain it. There’s no place open here, madam."
"Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don’t bring any"
more of ’em in here.”
"The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself"
independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed.
Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the “old man”
seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every day of the world.
The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor
they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell’s customers
were heavy investors. Orders to buy and sell were coming and going as
swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were
"imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,"
"strong machine—strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate,"
"never hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act ready and"
"prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and mortgages, margins and"
"securities—here was a world of finance, and there was no room in it for"
He knew also that deliberate planning could not have accomplished that
result half so well as this encounter with the tools of the Lumber
"Trust. The whole affair had proved a great piece of luck for him,"
thought the young lumberman. His meditation was broken in upon by the
sound of a strange voice.
“I had no idea lumbering was such a strenuous occupation.”
"A moment later Bainbridge was looking into a pair of pleasant, friendly"
eyes set in the handsome face of a man of about fifty. He was roughly
"dressed in well-worn, but finely made fishing clothes, and carried a"
"good trout rod in one hand. There was, too, about the stranger an air of"
forceful capability which attracted the younger man.
"“It’s not usually quite so full of incident,” said Bob; “but I don’t"
believe you’d ever find it exactly tame.”
"The stranger smiled, and made a comprehensive gesture with his hands."
"“And this is your idea of incident,” he murmured whimsically. “I should"
call it something decidedly stronger.”
"He hesitated for an instant, then moved closer to Bob."
"“You’re going downstream, aren’t you? Do you mind if I walk along with"
you? My camp’s down that way.”
Bainbridge acquiesced readily. There was something very taking about the
"stranger, and within ten minutes he found himself chatting as if to an"
"old friend. His companion turned out to be Wolcott Sears, of Boston, on"
a two weeks’ trip in the Maine woods. The name was only vaguely
"familiar, but Bob felt sure from his manner that he was a man of"
affairs. He was tremendously interested in hearing all about the
plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at
"him coolly, without prejudice or favour."
"“Lady,” he said, “dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance"
"by me. If yer don’t know de guy, and he’s tryin’ to do de Johnny act,"
"say de word, and I’ll call a cop in t’ree minutes. If yer does know"
"him, and he’s on de square, w’y I’ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he"
sent yer.”
The young lady betrayed a faint interest.
"“A song and dance!” she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed"
to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. “A new
"idea—in the troubadour line, I suppose. I—used to know the gentleman"
"who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the"
"police. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too"
"loudly. It is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might"
attract attention.”
"“Awe,” said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, “yer know"
"what I mean, lady. ’Tain’t a turn, it’s wind. He told me to tell yer"
he’s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to
’Frisco. Den he’s goin’ to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer
told him not to send ’round no more pink notes nor come hangin’ over de
"garden gate, and he takes dis means of puttin’ yer wise. He says yer"
"refereed him out like a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick"
"at de decision. He says yer swiped him, and never said why.”"
The slightly awakened interest in the young lady’s eyes did not abate.
Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the
"snow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against"
the ordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue
that mattered.
"""I can not,"" she said."
"""Beatrice, do not deceive yourself. Though my life is nothing to"
me--though I would give it a dozen times to save you--I can not do
"otherwise than go on. I may be weak, but I shall be stronger than my"
"weakness. My word is given!"""
He spoke with the tempestuous energy of despair. The minutes were
"passing with terrible swiftness, and any moment the sea behind him"
might burst its dam and sweep her and him to destruction. Already in
the distance he heard the dull clamour of voices raised in angry
remonstrance at the delay. Only those immediately about him were held
in awed silence by the power of his personality. Again Beatrice shook
her head. She stood in the doorway which opened out into the garden
where the besieged had taken refuge. There was no other way. He
advanced toward her. Instantly she raised her revolver and pointed it
at the first man behind him.
"""If I fire,"" she said, ""not even you will be able to hold them back."""
It seemed to her that she stood like a frail wall between two
"overwhelming forces--on the one side, Nehal with his thousands; on the"
"other, Nicholson--alone, truly, but armed with a set and pitiless"
"resolve. A single sentence, which had fallen upon her ears months"
"before, rose now out of an ocean of half-forgotten memories:"
"""Nicholson is the best shot in India,"" some one had said: ""he never"
"misses."" And still Nehal advanced. His jaws were locked, his eyes had"
a red fire in them. She knew then that the hour of hesitation was
"over, and that in that desperate struggle she had indeed lost."
Uncontrollable words of warning rushed to her lips.
The officer hesitated. In such circumstances one might easily do wrong.
"He might shoot these men, and after all find that they were innocent. He"
preferred to wait. The living are more easily deprived of life than the
dead restored to it. Such was his thought.
In any case he had not long to wait.
"Round the angle of the mill-house swept the general and his staff,"
"brilliant in scarlet and white, heightened by the glitter of abundant"
"gold-lace. For the ex-butcher of Tortosa was a kind of military dandy,"
and loved to surround himself with the foppery of the _matador_ and the
"brigand. At heart, indeed, he was still the _guerrillero_ of Morella,"
riding home through the streets of that little rebel city after a
successful foray.
As his eyes fell on the row of men dark against the dusty _adobe_ of the
"garden wall, and on the two pale women, a dark frown overspread his"
face.
"""What is the meaning of this?"" he cried. ""Why have you not obeyed your"
"instructions? Why are these men not yet dead?"""
"The officer trembled, and began an explanation, pointing to Concha and"
"La Giralda, both of whom stood for a moment motionless. Then flinging"
herself over the low wall of the garden as if her years had more nearly
"approached seventeen than seventy, La Giralda caught the great man by"
the stirrup.
"""Little Ramon, Ramon Cabrera,"" she cried, ""have you forgotten your old"
"nurse, La Giralda of Sevilla, your mother's gossip, your own playmate?"""
"The general turned full upon her, with the quick indignant threat of one"
gone long barefoot. The marks of a child either stolen for ransom or run
away from home owing to some wild strain in the blood were too obvious
to be mistaken. Her liberty of movement among the gipsies made the
latter supposition the more probable.
"""I am _not_ pretty Chica, and I am not little,"" she cried angrily. ""I"
"would have you remember, Pépe, that _I_ made this plan, which the folk"
of Egypt are to execute to-night. But since this is the great brigand
"Don José of Ronda, who was executed at Salamanca, I will tell him all"
"about it."""
She looked round at the dark faces with which they were surrounded.
"""There are new folk among these,"" she said, ""men I do not know. Bid them"
"go away. Else I will not speak of myself, and I have much to say to Don"
"José!"""
"Pépe of the Eleven Wounds looked about him, and shook his head. Gipsydom"
"is a commonwealth when it comes to a venture like this, and save in the"
"presence of some undoubted leader, all Egypt has an equal right to hear"
and to speak. Pépe's authority was not sufficient for this thing. But
that of the Sergeant was.
"He lifted his Montera cap and said, ""I would converse a while with this"
maid on the affairs of Egypt. 'Tis doubtless no more than you know
"already, and then, having heard her story my advice is at your service."
"But she will not speak with so many ears about. It is a woman's whim,"
"and such the wisest of us must sometimes humour."""
The gipsies smiled at the gay wave of his hand with which Cardono
uttered this truism and quickly betook themselves out of earshot in
"groups of ten and a dozen. Cards were produced, and in a few minutes"
"splendid aim, rebounded from the staff-paymaster's shiny pate."
"""The ship's company will have to make up the loss,"" he muttered."
"""They're responsible for their confounded pet."""
"""But you're responsible for the money, Staggles,"" remarked the"
"commander drily. ""At any rate, Mephisto is paying you back by"
"instalments."""
It wanted all the self-control at their command to keep the lookout
"men's attention from the comic scene to a duty of a serious nature,"
while the gun's crews temporarily forgot their duties to watch the
encounter between the mascot and the staff-paymaster.
"""Catch it--oh, you rotten butterfingers!"" groaned the accountant"
"officer to the assistant-paymaster, who, missing a coin thrown by the"
"animal, allowed the sum of one penny to be committed to the deep."
"""Here, ship's steward, nip below and open a tin of condensed. That"
"may tempt the brute below."""
"""You're condoning an offence, Staggles,"" said the commander in an"
"undertone, with a humorous gleam in his eye."
Another coin tinkled on the deck. The commander promptly placed his
foot on it to check its career towards the side.
"""Where did that go?"" asked the staff-paymaster, who, curiously"
"enough, had a miserly regard for any money except his own, which he"
spent liberally.
The commander shifted his foot and pointed to the retrieved coin; as
"he did so, another penny, hurtling through the air, hit him smartly"
CHAPTER LXXXVI
"_Wherein our Hero, and Another, go Home_"
The sunlight that had painted the white face of Paris with a hundred
hues all day had given place to a gentle drizzle as the twilight fell;
and the steady downpour had driven Noll into a restaurant which he was
not in the habit of frequenting; it had kept him there in its bright
rooms until he knew every face and every trick of gesture of the people
who sat about him.
The night was well advanced when he sallied out into the light rain;
"turning up his collar, he strode homewards."
He paid small heed to the rain; and as he turned out of the well-washed
"street into the courtyard where he had his lodging, and climbed the"
"stairs to his room, he scarcely noticed that he was wet."
"The rustle of women’s petticoats was in his ears, and when he walked"
abroad in these days he was aglow with the sense of the warm regard
"of women’s eyes, that glanced upon him from the dark shadows of"
rakish hats; the walk and movement of women found a rhythmic echo in
his thinking. The warmth of the coming summer was in his blood. His
instincts were jigging to the dancing measure of the season.
As he flung off his wet clothes he was seized with a whim to go to the
tavern of _The Golden Sun_; and he decided to humour the whim.
He lit a candle and flipped through a book until it was close on
midnight. But he was restless--and he arose eagerly when it was time to
"assuring myself that there was no other body near, and peered into her"
"face, I saw that it was seamed and wrinkled. She was barefoot, and her"
clothes were foul and mean. She had the reek of one who slept in
ditches and washed seldom. Her toothless gums grinned at me. She was a
horrible mockery of all that men love in women.
"When I had marked so much, I stood up again, my head reeling. Where"
was the man I had seen scouting up and down? Where was Marie? For a
"moment the wild idea that she had become this thing, that death or"
"magic had transformed the fair young girl into this toothless hag, was"
"not too wild for me. An owl hooted in the distance, and I started and"
shivered and stood looking round me fearfully. Such things were; and
"Marie was gone. In her place this woman, grim and dead and unsightly,"
lay at my feet. What was I to think?
"I got no answer. I raised my voice and called, trembling, on Marie. I"
"ran to one side of the road and the other and called, and still got no"
"answer. I climbed the mound on which the ash-tree stood, and sent my"
voice thrilling through the darkness of the bottom. But only the owl
"answered. Then, knowing nothing else I could do, I went down wringing"
"my hands, and found my lady standing over the body in the road. She"
had come back with Steve and the others.
"I had to listen to their amazement, and a hundred guesses and fancies,"
"which, God help me! had nothing certain in them, and gave me no help."
"The men searched both sides of the road, and beat the moor for a"
"distance, and tried to track the horse--for that was missing too, and"
there lay my only hope--but to no purpose. At last my lady came to me
and said sorrowfully that nothing more could be done.
'In the morning!' I cried jealously.
"pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or"
lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to
"luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with"
fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the
gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly
"radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow,"
"her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence."
"Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this"
"morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her"
"desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once"
"she moved over by Maxwell’s desk, near enough for him to be aware of"
her presence.
The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New
"York broker, moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs."
“Well—what is it? Anything?” asked Maxwell sharply. His opened mail lay
"like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen grey eye,"
"impersonal and brusque, flashed upon her half impatiently."
"“Nothing,” answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile."
"“Mr. Pitcher,” she said to the confidential clerk, “did Mr. Maxwell say"
anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer?”
"“He did,” answered Pitcher. “He told me to get another one. I notified"
the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning.
"It’s 9.45 o’clock, and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple"
chewing gum has showed up yet.”
"“I will do the work as usual, then,” said the young lady, “until some"
breath. She knew it was over the price to be paid for her that they were
"disputing, but that knowledge had ceased to be any novelty. The wrathful"
voices of the two disputants seemed to come from a great distance. She
felt as if the whole affair were a dream from which she might at any
moment awake on board the _Olive Branch_ again.
"""There isn't money enough in it to pay you so much for a mere"
"affidavit,"" she heard Slyne say, and Mr. Jobling, under his glance,"
confirmed that statement emphatically.
"""A hundred and twenty-one thousand is the last limit--a thousand down,"
"to bind the bargain, and the balance the day of my wedding with Sallie,"""
"Slyne declared. ""If that doesn't satisfy you--there's nothing more to be"
"said. And I'll maybe find other means--"""
"""Show me even the first thousand,"" requested Captain Dove, and Slyne"
"counted out on to the table, at a safe distance from the old man's"
"twitching fingers, five thousand francs of the amount Lord Ingoldsby had"
paid him for his car.
"""All right,"" said Captain Dove gruffly, and snatched at the notes. But"
Slyne picked them up again.
"""As soon as you've given Jobling your statement,"" he said, ""and signed"
"whatever other documents he may think necessary, I'll hand you these and"
"my note of hand, endorsed by him, for the balance remaining due you."""
Mr. Jobling picked up a pen and Slyne pushed a sheet of foolscap toward
"him. Captain Dove, with a grunt of disgust, sat back in his chair and,"
"while the lawyer wrote rapidly, related how he had found Sallie."
"When he had finished, Mr. Jobling read his statement over aloud, and"
"“If you go on in this way,” said Herold, “you 'll soon have as much idea"
of what's going on in London as a lonely dog tied up in a kennel.”
"“What does it matter,” growled John, “to any of the besotted fools who"
"read newspapers, provided I bark loud enough?”"
"There was one thing going on in London, however, in which he took a grim"
"interest, and that was the convalescence of the little maid-of-all-work"
"who had been taken back, a maimed lamb, to the cheerless fold where"
she had been reared. Thither he went to make inquiries as soon as he
returned from Southcliff-on-Sea. He found the Orphanage of St. Martha
"at Willesden, a poverty-stricken building, a hopeless parallelogram of"
"dingy, yellow brick, standing within a walled inclosure. There were no"
"trees or flowers, for the yard was paved. His ring at the front door was"
"answered by an orphan in a light print dress, her meagre hair clutched"
up tight in a knob at the back. He asked for the superintendent and
"handed his card. The orphan conducted him to a depressing parlour, and"
"vanished. Presently appeared a thin, weary woman, dressed in the black"
"robes of a Sister of Mercy, who, holding the card tight in nervous"
"fingers, regarded him with an air of mingled fright and defiance."
“Your business?” she asked.
"Despite the torture of it all, John could not help smiling. If he had"
"been armed with a knout, his reception could not have been more hostile."
"“I must beg of you to believe,” said he, “that I come as a friend and"
not as an enemy.”
She pointed to a straight-backed chair.
"There was also a Baluch Political Officer, known as the Sarhad-dar,"
who worked under orders from the British Political Officer at Quetta.
"The Sarhad-dar, to a certain degree, controlled the Sarhadi Raiders,"
"occasionally with the help of the Chagai Levies, which were raised by"
the Indian Government for this particular work.
Supplies were brought to these scattered posts by camel caravans from
India.
Communication with India was maintained by means of the telegraph.
Later on it became necessary to send out a wireless troop from India
to establish communication between my force at Khwash and Saindak.
At the same time I did my best to learn all I could about the tribes
"amongst whom I was going to operate, their ways and customs, and the"
nature of the country in which they lived.
A glance at the map will show the situation and boundaries of the
Sarhad--literally meaning boundary. It will be seen that it extends
"from Jalk in the East to Galugan in the West. The Eastern part, from"
"Jalk to Safed-koh, is held by a tribe known as the Gamshadzais, under"
"their notable leader, Halil Khan."
The central portion is held by the Yarmahommedzais under Jiand
"Khan, an elderly man, who has been undisputed chief, and a sort of"
"over-lord of the whole of the Sarhad, for very many years. He has"
been looked upon by his own and neighbouring tribes as well-nigh a
"demi-god. As Jiand enters later, and largely, into this narrative all"
further description of him will be reserved till actual contact is
established with him.
"Khwash--known also as Vasht or Washt--is the capital of the Sarhad,"
well if you would summon all the servants of the palace together and arm
"them with such weapons as may be available!"""
"Maria Cristina lifted her head from the shoulder of her Ferdinand, as if"
"she did not at first comprehend Rollo's speech, and was resolved to"
resent an intrusion at such a moment. Whereupon the Scot repeated his
words to such good purpose that the Queen-Regent threw up her hands and
"cried, ""Alas! this happens most unfortunately. We have only old Eugenio"
and a couple of lads in the whole palace since the departure of the
"guards!"""
"""Never mind,"" said Rollo; ""let us make the best of the matter. We will"
muster them; perhaps they will be able to load and fire a musket apiece!
"If I mistake not, the fighting will be at very short range!"""
It was upon this occasion that Señor Fernando Muñoz showed his first
spark of interest.
"""I will go and awake them,"" he said; ""I know where the servants are wont"
"to sleep."""
But on this occasion his fond wife would not permit him to stir.
"""The wicked murderers may have already penetrated to that part of the"
"castle,"" she palpitated, her arms still about his neck, ""and you must"
"not risk your precious life. Let Susana go and fetch them. She is old,"
"and has doubtless made her peace with religion."""
"""Nay, it is not fitting,"" objected Susana with spirit. ""I am a woman,"
and not so old as my lady says. I cannot go gadding about into the
"chambers of all and sundry. Besides, there has been purpose of marriage"
openly declared between me and the Señor Eugenio for upwards of thirty
and appeared to have been recently rough-dried and starched. He was too
diffident to aspire to Aileen’s notice; so he usually sat at one of
"Tildy’s tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled"
weakfish.
One day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer.
There were only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr.
"Seeders had finished his weakfish he got up, put his arm around Tildy’s"
"waist, kissed her loudly and impudently, walked out upon the street,"
"snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry, and hied himself"
to play pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade.
For a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of Aileen
"shaking at her an arch forefinger, and saying:"
"“Why, Til, you naughty girl! Ain’t you getting to be awful, Miss"
Slyboots! First thing I know you’ll be stealing some of my fellows. I
"must keep an eye on you, my lady.”"
Another thing dawned upon Tildy’s recovering wits. In a moment she had
"advanced from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of the"
"potent Aileen. She herself was now a man-charmer, a mark for Cupid, a"
Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their banquet boards.
Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable. The sudden
"and amatory Seeders had, as it were, performed for her a miraculous"
piece of one-day laundry work. He had taken the sackcloth of her
"uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and ironed it, and returned"
it to her sheer embroidered lawn—the robe of Venus herself.
The freckles on Tildy’s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both Circe
and Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen herself had
been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant.
"a marine signal-station as well, passing ships have to be signalled"
and reported. The spell of labour varies from four to five hours or
"more. Obviously, the task is more exacting and arduous in the winter"
than in summer. During the former season the lamps have to be lighted
"as early as 3.15 p.m., and are not extinguished until eight o’clock"
"the next morning. In the summer, on the other hand, the lamps may be"
required for less than six hours or so. In northern latitudes where the
"daylight is continuous owing to the midnight sun, the light scarcely"
seems necessary. Yet it is kept burning during the scheduled hours of
darkness.
"Thus, night in and night out the whole year round, a comparatively"
small band of faithful toilers keeps alert vigil over the dangers of
"the deep, for the benefit of those who “go down to the sea in ships,"
and do their business in great waters.” The safety of thousands of
human lives and of millions sterling of merchandise is vested in
"their keeping. The resources of the shipbuilder, the staunchness of"
"the ship, the skill and knowledge of the captain--all would count for"
"nothing were it not for the persistent, steady glare of the fixed,"
"the twinkling of the occulting, or the rhythmic, monotonous turning"
"spokes of the revolving light, thrown over the waste of waters from the"
lighthouse and the lightship.

"Aberbrothock, Abbot of, 96"
"Acetylene: as illuminant, Daléngas, 49, 274;"
"this, and all will be well.'"
"So the woman went forth with a light heart. It was so simple, only a"
"pinch of mustard-seed, and mustard grew in every garden. She would get"
"the seed and be back very quickly, and then the Lord Buddha would give"
her back those she loved who had died. She clothed herself again and
"tied up her hair, and went cheerfully and asked at the first house,"
"'Give me a pinch of mustard-seed,' and it was given readily. So with her"
treasure in her hand she was going forth back to the Buddha full of
"delight, when she remembered."
"'Has ever anyone died in your household?' she asked, looking round"
wistfully.
"The man answered 'Yes,' that death had been with them but recently. Who"
"could this woman be, he thought, to ask such a question? And the woman"
"went forth, the seed dropping from her careless fingers, for it was of"
"no value. So she would try again and again, but it was always the same."
"Death had taken his tribute from all. Father or mother, son or brother,"
"daughter or wife, there was always a gap somewhere, a vacant place"
"beside the meal. From house to house throughout the city she went, till"
"at last the new hope faded away, and she learned from the world, what"
"she had not believed from the Buddha, that death and life are one."
"So she returned, and she became a nun, poor soul! taking on her the two"
"hundred and twenty-seven vows, which are so hard to keep that nowadays"
nuns keep but five of them.[1]
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, that death is inevitable; this is"
"the consolation he offers, that all men must know death; no one can"
escape death; no one can escape the sorrow of the death of those whom he
state's claim to the new plant and the benefits that would accrue
therefrom.
Crane droned on. The Vice-President of the United States looked down on
the top of Senator Crane's massive head and became fruitfully
preoccupied with thoughts of his own.
"Then, quite suddenly, the line of Crane's exposition changed. The"
Vice-President wasn't quite sure at what precise point this had come
about. He wasn't aware of the change until some very strange words
penetrated:
""" ... so, therefore, it has become starkly apparent that the American"
people have been denied the information which would have made them
"aware of their own deadly danger. Invasion from space is now imminent."""
"The Vice-President tensed. Had the stupid idiot gone mad? Or had he, the"
"Vice-President, been in a fog when vital, top-secret information had"
been made public?
"He banged the gavel down hard, for want of a better gesture, and was"
"grateful when a tall, dignified man with a look of deepest concern on"
his face rose from behind his desk out on the floor.
"""Will the Senator yield to his distinguished colleague from"
"Pennsylvania?"""
"Crane turned, scowling. ""I will yield to no man on matters of grave"
"import."" With that he turned and continued with his revelations. ""The"
people of this nation have been deprived of the knowledge that the
"invasion from space has already begun. A vanguard of hideous, half-human"
"creatures have even now achieved a beach-head on our planet. Even now,"
aviator had survived the shock and was hurriedly unbuckling the strap
that held him to his seat.
"""Boat's done for, sir,"" announced one of the would-be crew. Such was"
the case. The explosion of a shell had wrenched her keel and
garboards out of her.
"""Then overboard with that!"" ordered Terence, indicating a Carley"
"life-buoy, which, though scorched by the blast of the shells, was"
still practically intact.
"The Carley life-buoy is a ""new departure"" in life-saving appliances"
on board ships of the Royal Navy. It is a glorified edition of an
"ordinary buoy, but elongated in shape and provided with gratings, and"
capable of being propelled by oars.
Half a dozen bluejackets seized the huge buoy and slung it overboard.
Held by means of a line it floated alongside the cruiser until
Terence and three men clambered into it.
Although the rate of propulsion was not by any means so rapid as that
of a boat the progress of the rescuers was far from slow. More than
once they were splashed by the spray thrown up by a ricochetting
"projectile, as the German gunlayers were gradually correcting their"
"aim, yet unscathed the rescue party came alongside the gradually"
sinking seaplane.
"""Hullo, Aubyn!"" shouted a well-known voice."
The airman was Waynsford. In his pneumatic helmet and huge goggles he
"was unrecognizable, but his voice proclaimed his identity."

"""We can do nothing but await the critical moment,"" said the Captain,"
"walking about among them.  ""When they turn us out we shall seek a new"
"place for ourselves, but at present there is no use spoiling our life"
by thinking of it ...  In times of crisis one becomes energetic ... and
if life were fuller of them and every moment of it so arranged that we
were compelled to tremble for our lives all the time ...  By God! life
"would be livelier and even fuller of interest and energy than it is!"""
"""That means that people would all go about cutting one another's"
"throats,"" explained Abyedok, smilingly."
"""Well, what about it?"" asked the Captain, angrily.  He did not like to"
hear his thoughts illustrated.
"""Oh!  Nothing!  When a person wants to get anywhere quickly he whips up"
"the horses, but of course it needs fire to make engines go ..."""
"""Well, let everything go to the Devil as quickly as possible. I'm sure"
I should be pleased if the earth suddenly opened up or was burned or
destroyed somehow .. only I were left to the last in order to see the
"others consumed ..."""
"""Ferocious creature!"" smiled Abyedok."
"""Well, what of that?  I ... I was once a man .. now I am an outcast ..."
that means I have no obligations. It means that I am free to spit on
everyone.  The nature of my present life means the rejection of my past
... giving up all relations towards men who are well fed and well
"dressed, and who look upon me with contempt because I am inferior to"
them in the matter of feeding or dressing. I must develop something new
"within myself, do you understand?  Something that will make Judas"
"from the side she had just left; and, looking round, she saw with terror"
"a great eagle sweep down upon the baby, and carry it off in its claws."
"She turned round and waved her arms and cried out to the eagle, 'He!"
he!' hoping it would be frightened and drop the baby. But it cared
"nothing for her cries or threats, and swept on with long curves over the"
"forest trees, away out of sight."
"Then the mother turned to gain the bank once more, and suddenly she"
missed her son who had been waiting for her. He had seen his mother wave
"her arms; he had heard her shout, and he thought she was calling him to"
"come to her. So the brave little man walked down into the water, and the"
"black current carried him off his feet at once. He was gone, drowned in"
"the deep water below the ford, tossing on the waves towards the sea."
No one can write of the despair of the girl when she threw herself under
a tree in the forest. The song says it was very terrible.
"At last she said to herself, 'I will get up now and return to my father"
in Thawatti; he is all I have left. Though I have forsaken him all these
"years, yet now that my husband and his children are dead, my father will"
"take me back again. Surely he will have pity on me, for I am much to be"
pitied.'
"So she went on, and at length, after many days, she came to the gates of"
the great city where her father lived.
"At the entering of the gates she met a large company of people,"
"mourners, returning from a funeral, and she spoke to them and asked"
them:
'Who is it that you have been burying to-day so grandly with so many
mourners?'
"hard and painful; as biscuit was the only available food, no"
nourishment was taken. The bowels acted on the second night. At
the end of a week the patient was sent by bullock wagon (three
"days and nights) to Modder River, and then down to Capetown,"
"where he walked into the hospital on the thirteenth day,"
apparently well.
"Two days later the temperature rose to 104°, and enteric fever"
"was diagnosed, no local signs pointing to the injury existing."
The patient made a good recovery.
"(173) Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_ (Mauser), at junction of"
outer 2/5 with inner 3/5 of line from right anterior superior
"iliac spine to umbilicus; _exit_, at upper part of right great"
"sacro-sciatic foramen, in line of posterior superior iliac"
spine. Advancing on foot when struck; he then fell and crept
"fifty yards to behind a rock, where he remained seven and a"
half hours. For two days subsequently he vomited freely; the
"bowels acted nine hours after the injury, and then became"
"constipated. No further symptoms were noted, and at the end of"
three weeks the abdomen was absolutely normal. The man is now
again on active service.
(174*) Wounded at Modder River while retiring on foot. _Entry_
"(Mauser), at highest point of right iliac crest; _exit_, 2-1/2"
inches to right of and 1/2 inch above level of umbilicus. The
"injury was not followed by sickness, and the bowels remained"
confined. During the first two days 'pain struck across the
abdomen' when micturition was performed.
When the patient came under observation on the third day the
"condition was as follows:--Complains of little pain,"
"70-71, 74-77, 82; as to the general and prolonged resistance of the"
people). During that reign Torquemada is credited with burning ten
"thousand persons in eighteen years (Prescott, _History of Ferdinand"
"and Isabella_, Kirk's ed. 1889, p. 178, citing Llorente. But see p."
"746, _note_, as to possible exaggeration. Cp. Burke, ii, 113;"
"Hume's ed. ii, 84). In the early Lutheran period the spread of"
scholarly Protestantism in Spain was extremely rapid (La
"Rigaudière, _Histoire des persécutions religieuses en Espagne_,"
"1860, p. 245 sq.), and in the early years of Philip II it needed"
"furious persecution to crush it, thousands leaving the kingdom"
"(Prescott, _Philip II_, bk. ii, ch. iii; M'Crie, _Reformation in"
"Spain_, ch. viii; De Castro, _History of the Spanish Protestants_,"
"Eng. tr. 1851, _passim_). At the outset, 800 persons were arrested"
in Seville alone in one day; and the Venetian ambassador in 1562
"testifies to the large number of Huguenots in Spain (Ranke, _Hist."
"of the Popes_, bk. v, Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. p. 136)."
Had Philip II had Flemish sympathies and chosen to make Brussels
"his capital, the stress of the Inquisition could have fallen on the"
Netherlands as successfully as it actually did on Spain. His
"father's reign had proved as much. According to Motley, not only"
"multitudes of Anabaptists but ""thousands and tens of thousands of"
"virtuous and well-disposed men and women"" had then been ""butchered"
"in cold blood"" (_Rise_, p. 43), without any sign of rebellion on"
"the part of the provinces, whose leading men remained Catholic. In"
"1600 most of the inhabitants of Groningen were Catholics (Davies,"
"ii, 347). A Protestant historian (Grattan, p. 93) admits that the"
"Protestants ""never, and least of all in these days, formed the"
"mass."" Another has admitted, as regards those of Germany, that"
"""nothing had contributed more to the undisturbed progress of their"
"opinions than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long"
"absence of Charles, and the slackness of the reins of government"
"Majesty's Ships of War, she may, with the Consent of the Re-captors,"
"prosecute her Voyage, and it shall not be necessary for the Re-captors"
to proceed to Adjudication till her Return to a Port of the United
Kingdom.
"The Master or Owner, or his Agent, may, with the Consent of the"
"Re-captors, unload and dispose of the Goods on board the Ship before"
Adjudication.
"In case the Ship does not, within Six Months, return to a Port of the"
"United Kingdom, the Re-captors may nevertheless institute Proceedings"
"against the Ship or Goods in the High Court of Admiralty, and the Court"
"may thereupon award Prize Salvage as aforesaid to the Re-captors, and"
"may enforce Payment thereof, either by Warrant of Arrest against the"
"Ship or Goods, or by Monition and Attachment against the Owner."
V.--PRIZE BOUNTY.

"Proclamation or Order in Council, Her Intention to grant Prize Bounty to"

and Crew of any of Her Majesty's Ships of War as are actually present at

which penetrated the sheltering walls out into the night where fifty
men writhed in a death-struggle with hundreds--saw every bleeding
"wound, heard every smothered moan of pain, felt already the cold iron"
"pierce their own breasts. The hours passed, and they did not yield."
"They had ceased from their incongruous tasks, and stood and waited,"
wordless and tearless.
As the first grey lights of dawn crept into the stifling room they
"heard footsteps hurrying across the adjacent room, and each drew"
herself upright to meet the end. Mrs. Carmichael's hand tightened over
"the revolver, but it was only Mr. Berry who entered. The little"
"missionary, a shy, society-shunning man, noted for doing more harm"
than good among the natives by his zealous bigotry and ignorance of
"their prejudices, stood revealed in a new light. His face was grimed"
"with dirt and powder, his clothes disordered, his weak eyes bright"
with the fire of battle.
"""Do not be afraid,"" he said quickly. ""There is no immediate danger. I"
have only been sent to warn you to be ready to leave the bungalow. The
"front wall is shot-riddled, and the place may become indefensible at"
"any moment. When that time comes, you must slip out to the old"
"bungalow. Nicholson believes he can hold out there."""
"""My husband--?"" interrupted Mrs. Carmichael."
"""Your husband is safe. In fact, all three were well when I left. If I"
"wasn't against such things, I should say it was a splendid fight--and"
"every man a hero. The Rajah--"""
"""The Rajah--?"""
Mr. Berry looked in stern surprise at the pale face of the speaker.
"Almost unconsciously Rollo put it to his lips. It was a cold morning,"
and it is small wonder that his hand shook a little. He was just
"twenty-three, and his main regret was that he had not kissed little"
"Concha Cabezos--with her will, or against it--all would have been one"
now. Meantime he looked about him for a light. The general noticed his
"hesitation, rose from the table, and with a low bow offered his own, as"
one gentleman to another. Rollo thanked him. The two men approached as
"if to embrace. Each drew a puff of his cigarette, till the points glowed"
"red. Rollo, retreating a little, swept a proud acknowledgment of thanks"
with his _sombrero_. Cabrera bowed with his hand on his heart. The young
"Scot clicked his heels together as if on parade, and strode out with"
head erect and squared shoulders in the rear of his companions.
"""By God's bread, a man!"" said Cabrera, as he resumed his writing, ""'tis"
"a thousand pities I must shoot him!"""
"They stood all four of them in the garden of the mill-house, underneath"
the fig trees in whose shade El Sarria had once hidden himself to watch
the midnight operations of Don Tomas.
"The sun was just rising. His beams red, low, and level shot across the"
"mill-wheel, turning the water of the unused overshot into a myriad"
pearls and diamonds as it splashed through a side culvert into the
"gorge beneath, in which the gloom of night lingered."
"The four men still stood in order. Mortimer and Etienne in the middle,"
with slim Rollo and the giant Ramon towering on either flank.

"The officer's commands rang out with a certain haste, for he could"
"of Arthur, and again from the Chorus (which closes the acts, as in"
_Gorboduc_) we learn the great purpose beneath this overwhelming ruin of
"a king and kingdom--to show that the day and the hour do come, however"
"long deferred, when"
"Wrong hath his wreak, and guilt his guerdon bears."
"As before, all action is rigorously excluded from the stage, to be"
"reported, at great length and with tremendous striving after vividness"
"and effect, by one who was present. Dumb Shows before each act continue"
the attempt to balance matters spectacularly. Clearly the only hope of
dramatic advance for disciples of the Senecan school lay in improved
"dialogue. This was possible in four directions, namely, in more stirring"
"topics, in more personal feeling, in shorter speeches, and in a change"
"in the style of language and verse. Unfortunately for Thomas Hughes, it"
"is just here that he fails, and fails lamentably. What is more, he fails"
because of his methods. The dominant desire of the English 'classical'
school was to be impressive. Hence the adoption by Hughes of a ghostly
"introduction and conclusion. His conversations, therefore, must reflect"
"the same idea. He saw, indeed, that long speeches, except at rare"
"intervals, were tedious, and reduced his to reasonable proportions, even"
"making extensive use--as, we shall see, the author of _Damon and"
Pythias_ did before him--of the Greek device of stichomythia. He was
"most anxious, also, to provide stirring topics for his characters to"

"shared everythink."""
He buried his face in his hands and made no further sound except an
occasional sniff and a hasty drawing in of the breath through trembling
lips.
"""It's bloody murder up the line,"" said a full Corporal. ""We were in a"
trench four feet deep and up to our waist in water. A Jerry sniper
"spotted us and one man got biffed, [killed] and then the next, and then the"
next all along the trench. We were packed together like sardines and had
no cover at all for our heads and shoulders. I got the wind up terribly
'cause I knew my turn was coming. He only gave me a Blighty though--I
"reckon I'm bloody lucky!"""
"""We was ready for to go over the top an' waitin' for the whistle to"
blow. We didn't 'alf 'ave the wind up. You could 'ear the teeth
"chatterin' all along the trench. I was shiverin' all over, I...."""
"""Next man!"" The conversation stopped while the next man went across, but"
"having once begun to tell their experiences, the men would not stop"
"altogether, and after a brief silence an elderly little man with a"
bandaged foot said:
"""What I couldn't get over was insomnia. I could never sleep at the"
right time and I was always dead tired on duty. Once I worked
forty-three hours at a stretch and after that I had to do a guard in our
trench. I felt sleepy all of a sudden. I pinched myself and banged the
"butt of my rifle on my toes, but everything seemed to swim round me."
"Then, I don't know how, I went off to sleep. I was awakened by an"
officer who shook me and swore at me. I was a bit dazed at first and
then suddenly it struck me what had happened. I never had the wind up so
and was smitten in turn by the beak of Francesco's shield.
"Again Francesco rushed Raniero to the wall, leaped back and got in his"
"blow. Raniero's face was a red blur. He dropped his shield, put both"
"his hands to his sword and swung great blows at Francesco, with the"
huge rage of a desperate and tiring man. Francesco led him up and down
"the hall. Raniero's breath came in gasps, and his strength began to"
wane.
"Francesco bided his chance and seized it. He ran in, after Raniero had"
"missed him with one of his savage sweeping blows, and rushed him"
"against the wall. Then he struck and struck again, without uttering a"
"word, playing so fast upon Raniero that he had his man smothered,"
blundering and dazed. The end came with a blow that cut the crown of
"Raniero's helmet. He threw up his hands with a spasmodic gesture,"
"lurched forward, fell, rolled over on his back and lay still."
"For a moment Francesco stood over him, the point of his sword on"
Raniero's throat. He seemed to waver; then all the misery the
Frangipani had inflicted on Ilaria rushed over him as in a blinding
cloud.
"His sword went home. A strange cry passed through the hall, then all"
was still. The torch spluttered once more and went out. Francesco was
in the darkness beside the dead body of Raniero.--
Meanwhile the Pisans had succeeded in scaling the walls. The clamor of
"the fight grew less and less, as one by one the defenders of Astura"
were relentlessly struck down and hurled over the ramparts. The storm
"had increased in violence, the heavens were cataracts of fire.--"
In the blood-drenched court the duke and the Pisan admiral shook
discovered in him by the patient searcher. She insisted upon sitting
next to him and in holding his hand when it was not employed in
conveying food to his mouth. She was startled at first by the
"discussion upon the prisons most suitable for me, but quickly became"
reconciled to the idea of a temporary separation.
"""Colonel Dawson,"" she asked. ""When daddy is in prison, may I come and"
"see him sometimes. Mother and me?"" Dawson gripped his hair--we were"
"the maddest crew!--and replied. ""Of course you shall, Miss Jane, as"
"often as you like."""
"""Thank you, Colonel Dawson; you are a nice man. I love you. Now show"
"me the handcuffs in your pocket."""
For the second time that day poor Dawson blushed. He must have
regretted many times that he had mentioned to me those unfortunate
darbies. Now amid much laughter he was compelled to draw forth a
pretty shining pair of steel wristlets and permit Jane to put them on.
They were much too large for her; she could slip them on and off
"without unlocking; but as toys they were a delight. ""I shouldn't mind"
"being a prisoner,"" she declared, ""if dear Colonel Dawson took me up."""
"We were sitting upon the fire-guard after luncheon, dallying over our"
"coffee, when Jane demanded to be shown a real arrest. ""Show me how you"
"take up a great big man like Daddy."""
"Then came a surprise, which for a moment had so much in it of bitter"
realism that it drove the blood from my wife's cheeks. I could not
follow Dawson's movements; his hands flickered like those of a
"conjurer, there came a sharp click, and the handcuffs were upon my"
"wrists! I stared at them speechless, wondering how they got there,"
"and, looking up, met the coldly triumphant eyes of the detective. I"
'Therefore I refuse to regard as hopeless the idea of an
"American-Anglo-Japanese alliance, guaranteeing the peaceful development"
of the vast resources of the Far East. Such an alliance exists
"essentially now--an alliance springing from cognate ideas, wishes,"
purposes and principles. This is the best possible foundation for that
formal compact which the evolution of industry and commerce seems to me
unmistakably to foreshadow.'

NOTE TO DIALOGUE V.
"Since the bulk of the present work went to press, I came across the"
following communication printed in the _Outlook_. I take the liberty of
"subjoining it herewith, without any vain intention of flaunting the"
virtues of my countrymen.--K.S.
JAPANESE CHARACTER
_To the Editor of the_ OUTLOOK
"SIR,--I have received during the last few weeks letters bearing such"
eloquent testimony to the nobility of Japanese character that I am
sending you some extracts in the hope of your publishing them. The
"letters are from a friend of mine, who with her husband has lived in"
"Yokohama for many years, and can therefore speak with considerable"
authority. The first extract is about the soldiers themselves--
"Mine you know is a busy life, and I found work among the military"
and I can’t for the life of me see an earthly way of scraping the
money together. Last of all--and worst of all--I haven’t been able to
make a single sale of lumber for the simple reason that the trust has
cut prices below cost and has taken every customer from us. If I cut
to meet them they go lower. You can see that. They’ve got the stock
"and the resources. Crane’s set out to ruin us at any cost, and he’s"
"succeeded. It hurts like sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left"
to do but give in and make the best terms we can. Let me hear from you
"at once. Yours ever, John Tweedy."
CHAPTER XI. NO QUITTER
"The letter dropped into Bob’s lap, and for a long minute he sat staring"
"into the yellow, dancing flames. His face was blank, and just a little"
"white, for the blow had been a heavy one, and totally unexpected. He"
"could not seem to understand it. It was unbelievable that he and Tweedy,"
"who had been fair and square in every one of their business dealings,"
could be forced to the wall by such a monster of corruption as Elihu
Crane.
There must be some mistake. Tweedy must have been thrown into one of his
"unjustifiable panics. That was it, of course."
Bob picked up the letter to read it carefully again.
"He perused it to the last word, and then leaned back against the"
"sapling, his face drawn and somber. It really did not sound like a"
"mistake. It was all clear and logical, and singularly cohesive. It was"
the sort of thing Crane would delight in planning and putting into
execution--the cutting of prices on a competitor. Tweedy had written
"that if they attempted to cut under the trust’s present rates, there"
"already hear the clattering of the horses of the general's cavalcade,"
"and he knew that if upon his arrival he had not carried out his orders,"
he might expect a severe reprimand.
But it was not the general's suite that rode so furiously. The sound
"came from a contrary direction. Two horses were being ridden at speed,"
and at sight of the four men set in order against the wall the foremost
rider sank both spurs into her white mare and dashed forward with a wild
cry.
"The officer already had his sword raised in the air, the falling of"
which was to be the signal for the volley of death. But it did not fall.
Something in the aspect of the girl-rider as she swept up parallel with
"the low garden wall, her hair floating disordered about her"
shoulders--her eyes black and shining like stars--the sheaf of papers
"she waved in her hand, all compelled the Carlist to suspend that last"
irrevocable order.
"It was Concha Cabezos who arrived when the eleventh hour was long past,"
and leaped from her reeking horse opposite the place of execution. With
"her, wild-haired as a Mænad, rode La Giralda, cross-saddled like a man."
"""General Cabrera! Where is General Cabrera?"" cried Concha. ""I must see"
"him instantly. These are no traitors. They are true men, and in the"
"service of Don Carlos. Here are their papers!"""
"""Where is Ramon Cabrera? Tell me quickly!"" cried La Giralda. ""I have"
news for him. I was with his mother when she died. They whipped me at
the cross of Tortosa to tell what I knew--stripping me to the waist they
"whipped me, being old and the mother of many. Cabrera will avenge me."
"Let me but see Ramon Cabrera whom of old I suckled at my breasts!"""
"If a foetus[54] lacks the right ear, the rule of the king will come"
"to an end, his palace will be destroyed, overthrow of the elders of"
"the city, the king will be without counsellors, confusion in the"
"land, diminution of the cattle in the land, the enemy will acquire"
control[55].
"If the foetus lacks a left ear, a god will harken to the prayer of"
"the king, the king will take the land of his enemy, the palace of the"
"enemy will be destroyed, the enemy will be without a counsellor, the"

"""To Grosvenor Square now--and hurry along,"" he directed the driver in a"
voice his enemy could not fail to hear. And the taxicab swung into Drury
"Lane, on its way west."
"For a few minutes he sat silent, with bent head, biting at his"
moustache. Then he looked round at Sallie.
"""That fellow takes me for another man,"" he told her querulously. ""He's"
been dogging me ever since he first saw me at Monte Carlo. You've no
"idea, Sallie, what a dangerous risk I had to run there--for your sake."""
"""You haven't told me much about--anything, Jasper,"" she reminded him."
And he proceeded to describe in lurid detail the fate which would
undoubtedly have befallen him had M. Dubois been able then to fasten on
him responsibility for the misdeeds of that criminal whom he so
unfortunately resembled.
Sallie listened in silence. She had been wondering whether M. Dubois
could be in any way concerned with her affairs. She gathered that he was
interested only in Slyne. The latter's story of grave risk run for her
"sake fell somewhat flat, since it seemed to rest on the mere possibility"
of his having been mistaken for somebody else. She could scarcely
believe that his fear of M. Dubois had no other foundation. She even
ventured to suggest that he could easily have proved the detective in
the wrong.
"""He wouldn't have paid the slightest attention to anything I could say,"""
"Slyne assured her tartly. ""He wouldn't have asked any questions or"
listened to any statement of mine. You don't know anything about the
outrages that are committed every day by fellows like that on men like
"d’hôtes_, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his"
"hall-bedroom. He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the"
"great city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight"
made up for many dark ones.
Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the
"great and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and"
"when one is of the _beau monde_ only one day in seventy, one loves to"
"protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring,"
"provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air"
proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure.
"At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the"
question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in
which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just
"then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of"
icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.
Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy.
"The girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and"
thanked him demurely.
"“I think my ankle is strained,” she said. “It twisted when I fell.”"
“Does it pain you much?” inquired Chandler.
“Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in
a minute or two.”
"“If I can be of any further service,” suggested the young man, “I will"
"call a cab, or—”"

"themselves together, back to her breast, higher than which they dared not"
mount.  Their infinite embarrassment struck Gyp.  She could almost hear
"him thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young"
"female, wife of the scoundrel who's ruined my daughter?  Delicate-that's"
what it is!'  Then the words burst hoarsely from him.
"""This is an unpleasant business, ma'am.  I don't know what to say. Reelly"
"I don't.  It's awkward; it's very awkward."""
Gyp said quietly:
"""Your daughter is desperately unhappy; and that can't be good for her"
"just now."""
"Mr. Wagge's thick figure seemed to writhe.  ""Pardon me, ma'am,"" he"
"spluttered, ""but I must call your husband a scoundrel.  I'm sorry to be"
"impolite, but I must do it.  If I had 'im 'ere, I don't know that I"
"should be able to control myself--I don't indeed.""  Gyp made a movement"
"of her gloved hands, which he seemed to interpret as sympathy, for he"
"went on in a stream of husky utterance: ""It's a delicate thing before a"
"lady, and she the injured party; but one has feelings.  From the first I"
said this dancin' was in the face of Providence; but women have no more
sense than an egg.  Her mother she would have it; and now she's got it!
"Career, indeed! Pretty career!  Daughter of mine!  I tell you, ma'am, I'm"
angry; there's no other word for it--I'm angry.  If that scoundrel comes
"within reach of me, I shall mark 'im--I'm not a young man, but I shall"
"mark 'im.  An' what to say to you, I'm sure I don't know. That my"
"daughter should be'ave like that!  Well, it's made a difference to me."
An' now I suppose her name'll be dragged in the mud.  I tell you frankly
"I 'oped you wouldn't hear of it, because after all the girl's got her"
punishment.  And this divorce-court--it's not nice--it's a horrible thing
"for respectable people.  And, mind you, I won't see my girl married to"
But they were presently delivered from their difficulty by the newly
nominated commander-in-chief himself.
"""This scene is painful to me,"" said Señor Muñoz, placidly, ""it irritates"
my nerves. I have a headache. I think I shall retire and leave these
gentlemen to make such arrangements as may be necessary till the return
"of our guards, which will doubtless take place within an hour or so. If"
"you need me you can call for me!"""
Having made this general declaration he turned to Rollo and addressed
himself particularly to him.
"""My rooms, I would have you know, are in the north wing,"" he continued;"
"""I beg that there shall be no firing or other brutal noise on that"
"side. Anything of the kind would be most annoying. So pray see to it."""
"Then he advanced to where his wife stood, her eyes full of anger at this"
desertion.
"""My angel,"" he said, calmly, ""I advise you sincerely to do the same."
Retire to your chamber. Take a little _tisane_ for the cooling of the
"blood, and leave all other matters to these new friends of ours. I am"
sure they appear very honest gentlemen. But as you have many little
"valuables lying about, do not forget to lock your door, as I shall mine."
"Adieu, my angel!"""
And so from an inconceivable height of dandyism his Excellency the Duke
of Rianzares would have stooped to bestow a good night salutation on his
"wife's cheek, had not that lady, swiftly recovering from her stupor,"
"suddenly awarded him a resounding box on the ear, which so far"
discomposed the calm of his demeanour that he took from his pocket a
"Nathaniel Hawthorne, in his _Marble Faun_, which, by the way, contains"
"the most charming of all the descriptive writing about Rome, put"
"the case none too strongly when he spoke of being ""disgusted with"
"the pretense of holiness and the reality of nastiness, each equally"
"omnipresent"" in the city of the popes. The new government has wrought"
"a great change in this respect, and Rome is in many parts of it now"
quite a clean city.
"There, then, are the facts as to the influence of the Roman Catholic"
"Church. I am, of course, very far from saying that there are no good"
"people in that church. As I have already stated, I believe that there"
"are many good people in it, but my own observation has satisfied me"
that the verdict of history as to the baleful influence of the system
is absolutely correct.
"""What, then,"" some one may ask, ""do the good people in that church"
think of all the immoralities and frauds that it has condoned and
"fostered?"" The answer is that the really good people in that church"
must grieve over them and deplore them just as the good people in other
churches do.

"_P. S._--It is generally believed, and apparently with good reason,"
"that the new Pope, Pius X., is a better man than many of his"
"predecessors, and that he cannot be charged with the immoralities or"
the ambition and avarice which characterized them. Let us hope that he
will have the courage to attempt some real reform in the lives of many
of his clergy.
FOOTNOTES:
"stay for his health's sake in the fresh sea-air; and when he yielded,"
"they prided themselves, after the manner of humans, on their own powers"
of persuasion. One morning Sir Oliver asked him point-blank:
“When are you going to Australia?”
"“I don't know,” said John. “There 's no immediate hurry.”"
"“I hope, dear,” said Julia, “you 'll give up the idea altogether.”"
"“Have n't I told you that I've made up my mind?” said John, in his gruff"
tone of finality.
“When are you going to break the news to Stella?” asked Sir Oliver.
"“Now,” said John, who had begun to loathe the mention of the doomful"
subject; and he stalked away--the three were strolling in the garden
"after breakfast--and went to Stella's room, and of course made no"
mention of it whatsoever.
"Then Herold came down for the week-end, and when he heard of Risca's"
pusillanimity he threw back his head and laughed for joy; for he knew
"that John would never go to Australia without telling Stellamaris, and"
also that if he could not tell Stellamaris in the first madness of his
"agony, he would never be able to tell her at all."
"And so, in fact, the fantastically absurd prevailed. Before the"
"Unwritten Law, mainly promulgated and enforced by Risca himself, which"
"guarded the sea-chamber against pain and sorrow, the driving Furies"
slunk with limp wing and nerveless claw. And one day Risca was surprised
"at finding himself undriven. Indeed, he was somewhat disconcerted. He"
fell into a bad temper. The Furies are highly aristocratic divinities
greenish-gray to grayish brown; each with a flat face and five light
brown filiform ridges and about 16 oil-tubes; odor and taste agreeable
"and aromatic. The anise berries are dried and ground, this being the"
form in which it is usually used.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 3 dr.; dogs,"
10 to 30 gr.
OLEUM ANISI--OIL OF ANISE
A volatile oil distilled from the fruit of star anise.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless or pale yellow, thin and strongly refractive"
"liquid, having the characteristic odor of anise, and a sweetish, mildly"
aromatic taste. Specific gravity about 0.975 to 0.985. Soluble in an
equal volume of alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 20 to 30 m.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs"
"and cats, 1 to 5 m."
"ACTIONS.--Anise is an aromatic stimulant, stomachic and carminative. It"
"is used to relieve indigestion and flatulence, to communicate an"
"agreeable flavor to many medicines, and to diminish the griping of"
purgatives. Oil of anise resembles in action other volatile oils.
USES.--The oil of anise is employed with olive oil or alcohol to kill
"fleas or lice on dogs, rubbed over the skin; and one drop of the pure"
oil may be placed on the feathers of fowl to cause destruction of lice.
"The oil of anise is sometimes prescribed to disguise the odor of drugs,"
and is ordered in cough mixtures for its expectorant properties.
"The water’s dropping every minute, and we’ve got a mean stretch to cover"
before we strike the Penobscot. I’ll go back and hustle the rear
along----”
"He stopped abruptly, and whirled around as a voice, shrill and trembling"
"with passion, was raised behind him."
"“You’ll pay for that, you meddlin’ pup! I’ll teach you to go blowin’ up"
"folks’ property, an’ mighty near committin’ murder! I’ll show you you"
can’t play tricks on John Joyce an’ get away with it. That game might
"work with some, but it won’t----”"
Things happened so swiftly after that that even the men standing around
"were quite unable to understand exactly what was doing, and which of the"
two was really the one who started the trouble.
The instant Bob turned he saw that Joyce was either beside himself with
"rage, or giving a most astonishingly good imitation of that condition."
"His face was purple, with veins standing out on his forehead like cords."
His eyes glared with that combination of rage and hate which a badly
frightened man almost invariably feels for the cause of his mental
"disturbance. The automatic was leveled in his hand, and one finger"
trembled on the trigger.
"For a single instant Bainbridge stood rigid, every muscle suddenly"
tensing. Perhaps he read a hint of Joyce’s purpose in the fellow’s eye;
perhaps it was simply intuition which made him guess what was coming. At
"all events, suddenly, and without warning, he launched his lithe body"
through the air exactly as in the manner of the old forbidden flying
tackle.
"His shoulder struck Joyce’s knees, and the wicked, snapping shot of the"
forward.
"“Stop!” he roared. “You young whelp, if you----”"
"He broke off with a gurgling sound, and the color left his face. With a"
"final swing, Bob loosened his hold on the bundle, which curved in a"
"perfect arc over the rear of the jam, over the jagged crest, and dropped"
swiftly out of sight amid the massive timbers upended in confusion along
the face and close to the spot where protruded the freshly driven spiles
which had caused all the trouble.
An instant later the whole throng of men hustled frantically for cover.
CHAPTER X. THE POWER BEHIND IT ALL
In less than sixty seconds--so close had been Bob’s calculations--came a
"detonation which shook the earth, making several of the running men"
"stagger and lose their stride. Up spurted a great mass of water,"
carrying with it massive logs leaping like agonized things alive. They
"fell back again, followed by a shower of débris mingled with fine spray,"
"which the wind sifted down on the heads of the ducking, dodging men."
"From his place behind a stump Bainbridge rose swiftly, shielding his"
face with one crooked arm from the rain of chips and splinters and bits
"of bark, and stared eagerly toward the jam. It took but a moment to see"
"that the spiles had disappeared, and the boom was shattered. Moreover,"
the key logs of the jam were so loosened that the whole drive was again
on its way downstream. Bob turned to Peters with a gesture of
satisfaction.
"“She’s off, Jack,” he said. “Get a wiggle on, now, and rush her along."
"food than the mists of his own dreaming. However, it was different"
"when,--pausing before each word after the manner of a child,--she came"
"to a passage of the poet's, and read:"
"""'In that moment I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath"
"its dwelling in the most secret chambers of the heart, began to tremble"
"so violently that the least pulse of my body shook herewith, and in the"
"trembling it said these words: ""Here is a deity stronger than I who,"
"coming shall rule over me.""'"""
"At that the Girl let the book fall and, going down on her knees and"
"taking both his hands in hers, she raised to him a look so full of"
adoring worship that he felt himself awed before it.
"""That 'ere Dante ain't so far off after all. I know jest how he feels."
"Oh, I ain't fit to read to you, to talk to you, to kiss you."""
"Nevertheless, he saw to it that she did."
"After this he told her about the Inferno, and she listened eagerly to"
"his description of the unfortunate characters, though she declared, when"
"he explained some of the crimes that they had committed, that they ""Got"
"only what was rightly comin' to them."""
The patient could hardly suppress his amusement. Dante was discarded and
instead they told each other how much love there was in that little
cabin on Cloudy Mountain.
The days that followed were all much like this one. Food was brought up
"from The Polka and, by degrees, the patient's strength came back. And it"
was but natural that he became so absorbed in his newly-found happiness
"that he gradually was losing all sense of danger. Late one night,"
"the hospitality of the Nat by hunting near his home, came to severe"
grief.
"But the Nat has gone now, alas! The tree is still there, but the Nat has"
fled away these many years.
"'I suppose he didn't care to stay,' said the headman. 'You see that the"
"English Government officials came and camped here, and didn't fear the"
"Nats. They had fowls killed here for their dinner, and they sang and"
"shouted; and they shot the green pigeons who ate his figs, and the"
little doves that nested in his branches.'
"All these things were an abomination to the Nat, who hated loud, rough"
"talk and abuse, and to whom all life was sacred."
"So the Nat went away. The headman did not know where he was gone, but"
there are plenty of trees.
"'He has gone somewhere to get peace,' the headman said. 'Somewhere in"
"the jungle, where no one ever comes save the herd-boy and the deer, he"
"will be living in a tree, though I do not think he will easily find a"
tree so beautiful as this.'
"The headman seemed very sorry about it, and so did several villagers who"
"were with him; and I suggested that if the Nat-houses were rebuilt, and"
"flowers and water offered, the Nat might know and return. I even offered"
"to contribute myself, that it might be taken as an _amende honorable_ on"
behalf of the English Government. But they did not think this would be
"any use. No Nat would come where there was so much going and coming, so"
"little care for life, such a disregard for pity and for peace. If we"
"were to take away our rest-house, well then, perhaps, after a time,"
"something could be done, but not under present circumstances."
"Jessica held the casket to Severance, with a little outward sweep of her"
"wrist. He took it and, folding his arms, looked at her steadily. A tide"
"of angry colour rose to her hair, then she turned her back upon him and"
looking out over the water tapped her foot on the rocks.
“Why do you not go?” she asked. “I hate you more than any one on earth.”
“No. You love me.”
"“I hate you! You are a brute! The coolest, the rudest, the most"
exasperating man on—on earth.”
"“That is the reason you love me. My dear Mrs. Pendleton,” he continued,"
"taking the ring from the casket and laying the latter on a rock, “a"
woman of brains and headstrong will—but unegoistic—likes a brutal and
"masterful man. An egoistical woman, whether she be fool or brilliant,"
"likes a slave. The reason is that egoism, not being a feminine quality"
"primarily, but borrowed from man, places its fair possessor outside of"
her sex’s limitations and supplies her with the satisfying simulacrum of
those stronger characteristics which she would otherwise look for in
man. You are not an egoist.”
He took her hand and removed her glove in spite of her resistance.
“Don’t struggle. You would only look ridiculous if any one should pass.
"Besides, it is useless. I am so much stronger. I do not know or care"
what really possessed you to indulge in such a freak as to engage
"yourself to four men at once,” he continued, slipping the ring on her"
"finger. “You had your joke, and I hope you enjoyed it. The dénouement"
"was highly dramatic. As I said, I desire no explanation, for I am never"
concerned with anything but results. And now—you are going to marry
me.”
presently be an armistice and Germany would have to make peace with
"perhaps the cession to France of Metz as a _solatium_, while Germany"
"was given a little bit more of Africa, and Austria got nothing...."
Meantime the Villa Beau-séjour seemed after Holloway Prison a
paradise upon earth. Why quarrel with her fate? Why not drop
politics and take up philosophy? She felt herself capable of writing
a Universal History which would be far truer if more cynical than
any previous attempt to show civilized man the route he had followed
and the martyrdom he had undergone.
On the 17th of August she took the tram into Brussels. It seemed
"however as if it would never get there, and when she reached the"
Porte de Namur she was too impatient to wait for the connection. She
"could not find any gendarme, but at a superior-looking flower-shop"
she obtained the address of the British Legation.
She asked at the lodge for Mr. Hawk; but there was only a Belgian
"coachman in charge, and he told her the Minister and his staff had"
followed the Court to Antwerp. Mr. Hawk had only left that morning.
"""What a nuisance,"" said Vivie to herself. ""I might have found out"
from him whether there is any truth in the rumours that are flying
"about Tervueren."""
These rumours were to the effect that the Germans had captured all
"the forts of Liège and their brave defender, General Léman; that"
"they were in Namur and were advancing on Louvain. ""I wonder what we"
"had better do?"" pondered Vivie."
In her bewilderment she took the bold step of calling at the Hotel
"de Ville, gave her name and nationality, and asked the advice of"
the municipal employé who saw her as to what course she and her
"some sand-bags, trembling all over and feeling as though I was going to"
"choke. I waited for a long time, but nothing happened, so I got up and"
looked round. Lucky escape for us! There's a terrific hole by the Red
Cross and another one behind the bath-house. The third's in the next
field. Only two men hit. O'Neil's got it in the elbow--he's all right
for Blighty. Poor old Hartog's badly hurt--a frightful gash in the thigh
with the piece still in it. I hope he won't have to lose his leg.
"Christ, I'm glad it's all over--I wouldn't like to go through that"
"again."""
"There was silence for a while, but soon the silence was broken by the"
distant muttering of anti-aircraft fire.
"""Jesus Christ Almighty--'e's comin' again--O God, why can't 'e leave us"
"alone."""
We stood outside the marquee and anxiously watched the horizon. We heard
"a faint humming noise. It grew louder and louder until it became a deep,"
droning buzz that rose and fell in regular pulsation. Then
boom--boom--boom--three times the sullen roar of distant explosions
"sounded. Then there came the familiar rushing, whistling noise of a"
descending bomb. We flung ourselves down in the wet grass. I felt every
muscle in my body contract as though I were trying to make myself as
small as a pin point in expectation of the terrible moment. There was a
dull thud close by and I felt the earth vibrate. The bomb had fallen a
"few yards away, but had merely buried itself in the earth without"
exploding.
"There was no anti-aircraft fire, but the droning noise continued loudly,"
"rising and falling. Private Trotter, who was lying beside me, was"
drawing his breath in sharply between his lips. Our fear of impending
disaster was prolonged intolerably. The droning propeller seemed to be
"enclosed like a lake by mountains and volcanic cones, all this must"
"also appear strange and beautiful to the Trobrianders. In the villages,"
"they are entertained by their male friends, the language spoken by both"
"parties being that of Dobu, which differs completely from Kiriwinian,"
but which the Sinaketans learn in early youth. It is remarkable that
no one in Dobu speaks Kiriwinian.
"As said above, no sexual relations of any description take place"
between the visitors and the women of Dobu. As one of the informants
told me:
"""We do not sleep with women of Dobu, for Dobu is the final mountain"
"(Koyaviguna Dobu); it is a taboo of the mwasila magic."""
"But when I enquired, whether the results of breaking this taboo would"
"be baneful to their success in Kula only, the reply was that they were"
"afraid of breaking it, and that it was ordained of old (tokunabogwo"
ayguri) that no man should interfere with the women of Dobu. As a
"matter of fact, the Sinaketans are altogether afraid of the Dobuans,"
and they would take good care not to offend them in any way.
"After some three or four days' sojourn in Dobu, the Sinaketan"
fleet starts on its return journey. There is no special ceremony of
"farewell. In the early morning, they receive their talo'i (farewell"
"gifts) of food, betel-nut, objects of use and sometimes also a Kula"
valuable is enclosed amongst the the talo'i. Heavily laden as they
"are, they lighten their canoes by means of a magic called kaylupa,"
and sail away northwards once more.
"""The law is on my side...  I can even demand two thousand.  I can"
insist on your pulling down the building ... and enforce it too.  That
"is why my claim is so small. I demand that you should pull it down!"""
"""Very well.  Probably we shall do so ... after three years, and after"
"having dragged you into enormous law expenses.  And then, having paid"
"up, we shall open our public-house and you will be ruined ..."
annihilated like the Swedes at Poltava.  We shall see that you are
ruined ... we will take good care of that.  We could have begun to
"arrange about a public-house now, but you see our time is valuable, and"
besides we are sorry for you.  Why should we take the bread out of your
"mouth without any reason?"""
"Egor Terentievitch looked at his guest, clenching his teeth, and felt"
"that he was master of the situation, and held his fate in his hands."
"Vaviloff was full of pity for himself at having to deal with this calm,"
cruel figure in the checked suit.
"""And being such a near neighbour you might have gained a good deal by"
"helping us, and we should have remembered it too.  Even now, for"
"instance, I should advise you to open a small shop for tobacco, you"
"know, bread, cucumbers, and so on...  All these are sure to be in great"
"demand."""
"Vaviloff listened, and being a clever man, knew that to throw himself"
upon the enemy's generosity was the better plan.  It was as well to
"begin from the beginning, and, not knowing what else to do to relieve"
"his mind, the soldier began to swear at Kuvalda."
"""Curses be upon your head, you drunken rascal!  May the Devil take you!"""
"""Do you mean the lawyer who composed your petition?"" asked Petunikoff,"
"rays of living lightning, of which neither painter nor poet has any"
"true conception, . . long, dazzling rays such as encircled God's"
"maiden, Edris, with an arch of roseate effulgence, so that the very air"
was sunset-colored in the splendor of her presence! How if she were a
"wingless angel,--made woman?"
"""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings!"" And with the name of his"
angel-love upon his lips he closed his eyes and sank into a deep and
dreamless slumber.
CHAPTER XL.
IN THE CATHEDRAL.
"A booming, thunderous, yet mellow sound! a grand, solemn, sonorous"
"swing of full and weighty rhythm, striking the air with deep, slowly"
"measured resonance like the rolling of close cannon! Awake, all ye"
people!--Awake to prayer and praise! for the Night is past and sweet
"Morning reddens in the east, ... another Day is born,--a day in which"
"to win God's grace and pardon,--another wonder of Light, Movement,"
"Creation, Beauty, Love! Awake, awake! Be glad and grateful for the"
"present joy of life,--this life, dear harbinger of life to come! open"
"your eyes, ye drowsy mortals, to the divine blue of the beneficent sky,"
"the golden beams of the sun, the color of flowers, the foliage of"
"trees, the flash of sparkling waters!--open your ears to the singing of"
"birds, the whispering of winds, the gay ripple of children's laughter,"
"the soft murmurs of home affection,--for all these things are freely"
"bestowed upon you with each breaking dawn, and will you offer unto God"
the Government regulations as to curricula. A good teacher was not
troubled by such matters.
"83,660. (Mr. Sly). There was no scope for the employment of non-Indians"
in the high schools as apart from the colleges. It was in the
professorial line that more help from the West was required.
"83,661. (Mr. Gokhale). The witness knew of three instances in which the"
colonies had secured distinguished men on salaries which were lower than
these given to officers of the Indian Educational Service. One was at
"Toronto, another was in New Zealand and the third at Yale university."
The salaries on the two latter cases were £600 and £500 a year. The same
held good as regards Japan. The facts there had been stated in a
"Government of India publication as follows: ""Subsequent to 1895 there"
"were 67 Professors recruited in Europe and America, of those, 20 came"
"from Germany, 16 from England and 16 from the United States. The average"
pay was £384. In the highest Imperial University the average pay is
"£684. As soon as Japanese could be found to do the work, even tolerably"
"well, the foreigner was dropped."""
"83,662. When the witness first started work in India, he found that"
"there was no physical laboratory, or any grant made for a practical"
experimental course. He had to construct instruments with the help of
"local mechanics, whom he had to train. All this took him ten years. He"
then undertook original investigation at his own expense. The Royal
Society became specially interested in his work and desired to give him
a Parliamentary grant for its continuation. It was after this that the
Government of Bengal came forward and offered him facilities for
research.
"83,663. In the Educational Service he would take men of achievement from"
anywhere; but men of promise he would take from his own country.
realised then exactly how the professional manhunter glares at the
"prey into whom, after many days, he has set his claws. My wife gasped"
"and clutched at my elbow, little Jane screamed, and for a few seconds"
even I thought that the game had been played and that serious business
"was about to begin. Dawson gave us a few seconds of apprehension, and"
"then laughed grimly. From his waistcoat pocket he drew a key, and the"
fetters were removed almost as quickly as they had been clapped on.
"""Tit for tat,"" said he. ""You have had your fun with me. Fair play is a"
"jewel."""
"Little Jane was the first to recover speech. ""I knew that dear Colonel"
"Dawson was only playing,"" she cried. ""He only did it to please me."
"Thank you, Colonel, though you did frighten me just a weeny bit at"
"first."" And pulling him down towards her she kissed him heartily upon"
his prickly cheek. It was a queer scene.
"The door bell rang loudly, and we were informed that a policeman stood"
"without who was inquiring for Chief Inspector Dawson. ""Show him in"
"here,"" said I. The constable entered, and his manner of addressing my"
guest--that of a raw second lieutenant towards a general of
division--shed a new light upon Dawson's pre-eminence in his Service.
"""A telegram for you, sir."" Dawson seized it, was about to tear it"
"open, remembered suddenly his hostess, and bowed towards her. ""Have I"
"your permission, madam?"" he asked. She smiled and nodded; I turned"
"away to conceal a laugh. ""Good,"" cried Dawson, poring over the"
"message. ""I think, Mr. Copplestone, that you had better telephone to"
"your office and say that you are unavoidably detained."""
"""What--what is it?"" cried my wife, who had again become white with"
sudden fear.
"""Something which will occupy the attention of your husband and myself"
radar signature immediately disappeared off the tracking monitors at
"Katsura."""
"""It met the specifications?"""
"Ikeda nodded. ""Yesterday I ordered a computer analysis of the data"
"tapes. The preliminary report suggests it may even have exceeded them."""
Tanzan Mino listened in silence. He was sitting at his desk in the
command sector wing of the North Quadrant at the Hokkaido facility.
"Although the sector was underground, like the rest of the facility,"
"behind his desk was a twenty-foot-long ""window"" with periscope double"
mirrors that showed the churning breakers of La Perouse Strait.
His jet had touched down on the facility's runway at 6:48 A.M. and been
promptly towed into the hangar. Tanzan Mino intended to be in personal
"command when _Daedalus I_ went hypersonic, in just nineteen hours. The"
video monitors in his office were hard-wired directly to the main
"console in Flight Control, replicating its data displays, and all"
decisions passed across his desk.
"""Leave the pilot to me,"" he said without emotion, revolving to gaze out"
"the wide window, which displayed the mid-afternoon sun catching the"
"crests of whitecaps far at sea. ""What he knows or doesn't know will not"
"disrupt the schedule."""
"Once again, he thought, I've got to handle a problem personally. Why?"
Because nobody else here has the determination to make the scenario
"succeed. First the protocol, and then the money. I had to intervene to"
resolve both.
"But, he reflected with a smile, it turned out that handling those"

nature of secondary sensations.]

deals broadly with symbolism in human thought and life.]
"[Footnote 132: _Revue Philosophique_, November 1902.]"
[Footnote 133: 'Richard Wagner et Tannhauser' in _L'Art Romantique_.]
[Footnote 134: The motor imagery suggested by music is in some persons
"profuse and apparently capricious, and may be regarded as an anomaly"
"comparable to a synaesthesia. Heine was an example of this, and he has"
described in _Florentine Nights_ the visions aroused by the playing of
"Paganini, and elsewhere the visions evoked in him by the music of Berlioz."
"Though I do not myself experience this phenomenon, I have found that there"
is sometimes a tendency for music to arouse ideas of motor imagery; thus
some melodies of Handel suggest a giant painting frescoes on a vast wall
space. The most elementary motor relationship of music is seen in the
tendency of many people to sway portions of their body--to 'beat time'--in
sympathy with the music. (This phenomenon has been experimentally studied
"by J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement"
"to the _Psychological Review_, vol. v., No. 4, June 1903). Music is"
"fundamentally an audible dance, and the most primitive music is dance"
music.]
[Footnote 135: The instinctive nature of this tendency is shown by the
fact that it persists even in sleep. Thus Weygandt relates that he once
fell asleep in the theatre during one of the last scenes of _Cavalleria
"Rusticana_, when the tenor was singing in ever higher and higher tones,"
and dreamed that in order to reach the notes the performer was climbing up
ladders and stairs on the stage.]
Concha smiled a subtle smile and turned her eyes upon the ground.
"""If you will remember, I had other matters to communicate to your"
"Excellency,"" she said meekly--almost too meekly, Rollo thought. ""This"
"matter of Luis Fernandez slipped my memory, till it was my good fortune"
"to be reminded of it by Don Ramon!"""
"And all the while the long lean Sergeant Cardono, his elbows glued to"
"his sides, sat his horse as if spiked to the saddle, and chuckled with"
quiet glee at the scene.
"""He will do yet,"" he muttered; ""'twas ever thus that my father told me"
of the Gran' Lor' before Salamanca. Be he as stiff as a ramrod and as
"frigid as his own North Pole, the little one will thaw him--bend"
him--make a fool of him for his soul's good. She is not an Andaluse of
"the gipsy blood for nothing! He will make him a soldier yet, this young"
"man, by the especial grace of San Vicente de Paul, only I do not think"
that either of them will deserve readmission to the Convent of the Holy
"Innocents!"""
More than once Rollo endeavoured to extract from Concha to what place
"her self-assumed mission was taking her, and at what point she would"
leave them. It was in vain. The lady baffled all his endeavours with the
most consummate ease.
"""You have not communicated to me,"" she said, ""the purport of your own"
"adventures. How then can I tell at what place our ways divide?"""
"""I am forbidden to reveal to any save General Cabrera alone my secret"
"instructions!"" said Rollo, with such dignity as he could muster at short"
notice.
offence had only been that of loving her.
"Fiorsen had been taken to her room, which was larger and cooler than his"

Gyp signed to her to go.  He opened his eyes presently:
"""Gyp!  Oh!  Gyp!  Is it you?  The devilish, awful things I see--don't go"
"away again!  Oh, Gyp!""  With a sob he raised himself and rested his"
forehead against her.  And Gyp felt--as on the first night he came home
drunk--a merging of all other emotions in the desire to protect and heal.
"""It's all right, all right,"" she murmured.  ""I'm going to stay. Don't"
"worry about anything.  Keep quite quiet, and you'll soon be well."""
"In a quarter of an hour, he was asleep.  His wasted look went to her"
"heart, and that expression of terror which had been coming and going"
until he fell asleep!  Anything to do with the brain was so horrible!
Only too clear that she must stay--that his recovery depended on her.
"She was still sitting there, motionless, when the doctor came, and,"
"seeing him asleep, beckoned her out.  He looked a kindly man, with two"
"waistcoats, the top one unbuttoned; and while he talked, he winked at Gyp"
"involuntarily, and, with each wink, Gyp felt that he ripped the veil off"
one more domestic secret.  Sleep was the ticket--the very ticket for him!
Had something on his mind--yes!  And--er--a little given to--brandy?  Ah!
all that must stop!  Stomach as well as nerves affected.  Seeing
things--nasty things--sure sign.  Perhaps not a very careful life before
marriage.  And married--how long?  His kindly appreciative eyes swept Gyp
"from top to toe.  Year and a half!  Quite so!  Hard worker at his violin,"
too?  No doubt!  Musicians always a little inclined to be immoderate--too
much sense of beauty--burn the candle at both ends!  She must see to
"that.  She had been away, had she not--staying with her father?  Yes."
But--no one like a wife for nursing.  As to treatment?  Well!  One would

"Refused to accept the Royal offer of pardon of 1670, when all commissions"
"to privateer on the Spanish were revoked. Thurston, with a mulatto, Diego,"
"using obsolete commissions issued by the late Governor of Jamaica,"
"Modyford, continued to prey upon Spanish shipping, carrying their prizes"
to Tortuga.
"THWAITES, CAPTAIN JOSEPH."
"Coxswain to Captain Hood, he was promoted in 1763 to be a midshipman in"
"H.M.S. _Zealous_, cruising in the Mediterranean. Putting into Algiers,"
"Thwaites was sent ashore by the captain to buy some sheep, but did not"
"return to the boat and, it being supposed he had been assassinated, the"
"ship sailed without him. The fact was that young Thwaites, who spoke"
"Turkish and Greek, had accepted an invitation to enter the Ottoman"
"service. Embracing the Mohammedan religion, Thwaites was put in command of"
a forty-four gun frigate.
"His first engagement was with the flagship of the Tunisian Admiral, which"
"he took and carried to Algiers. He soon brought in another prize, and so"
"pleased the Dey that he presented him with a scimitar, the hilt of which"
was set with diamonds.
"Thwaites, having soiled his hands with blood, now became the pirate"
"indeed, taking vessels of any nation, and drowning all his prisoners by"
tying a double-headed shot round their necks and throwing them overboard.
"He stopped at no atrocity--even children were killed, and one prisoner, an"
"English lieutenant and an old shipmate of his, called Roberts, he murdered"
"without a second thought. When Thwaites happened to be near Gibraltar, he"
"“Ah, yes. That 's why I wrote to you yesterday, dear.”"
"She had written to him, in fact, every month for many years, long,"
foolish letters in which everything was futile save the genuine
"affection underlying them, and more often than not John had taken"
them as read and pitched them into the waste-paper basket. His few
"perfunctory replies, however, had been treasured and neatly docketed and"
"pigeon-holed in the bureau in her bedroom, together with the rest of her"
family archives and other precious documents. Among them was a famous
recipe for taking mulberry stains out of satin. That she prized
inordinately.
"“I should n't like to drift apart from dear Ellen's boy,” she said with"
a smile.
"“And I should n't like to lose touch with you, my dear aunt,” said John,"
with more graciousness. “And that is why I've come to see you to-day.
I've had rather a bad time lately.”
“I know--that awful case in the papers.” She shivered. “Don't let us
talk of it. You must try to forget it. I wrote to you how shocked I was.
"I asked you to come and stay with me, and said I would do what I could"
"to comfort you. I believe in the ties of kinship, my dear, and I did n't"
like to think of you bearing your trouble alone.”
"“That was very kind indeed of you,” said John, who had missed the"
invitation hidden away in the wilderness of the hastily scanned
"sixteen-page letter. He flushed beneath his dark skin, aware of"
"rudeness. After all, when a lady invites you to her house, it is boorish"
to ignore the offered hospitality. It is a slight for which one can
scarcely apologize. But she evidently bore him no malice.
"office itself, with its glass doors, its counter, and its long desk, at"
the farther end of which a bill-clerk was poring over his task.
Iron-barred windows at the front of the room looked out upon the
street; other windows and a door at the right opened upon the driveway
"and railroad track, while at the rear the glass-panelled door through"
"which they had just been peering gave egress only to the dock itself,"
up which the two officers were likely to come at any instant. Even as
"Emerson, with a last desperate glance, summed up the possible places of"
"concealment, Fraser exclaimed, softly:"
"""There they are now!"" and they saw at the foot of the gang-plank two"
men talking with Big George. They saw Balt point the strangers
"carelessly to the office, whence he had seen Boyd disappearing a few"
"moments before, and turn back to his stevedores; then they saw the"
plain-clothes men approaching.
"""Here! Gimme your coat and hat, quick!"" cried Fraser in a low voice,"
"his eyes blazing at a sudden, thought. He stripped his own garments"
"from his back with feverish haste. ""Put mine on. There! I'll stall for"
"you. When they grab me, take it on the run. Understand!"""
"""That won't do. Everybody knows me."" Boyd cast an apprehensive glance"
"at the arched back of the bill-clerk, but Fraser, quick of resource in"
"such a situation, forced him swiftly to make the change, saying:"
"""Nix. It's your only 'out.' Stand here, see!"" He indicated a position"
"beside the rear door. ""I'll step out the other way where they can see"
"me,"" he continued, pointing to the wagon-way at the right. ""Savvy? When"
"they grab me, you beat it, and don't wait for nothing."""
"""But you--"""
"money, Slyne. Where is she? Fetch her in here."""
"Slyne had no farther to go to do that than to the next room, where he"
"found Sallie at the window, gazing pensively out at the sea. But he"
delayed there for some time to make it still more clear to her that her
only hope of helping herself lay in abetting him blindly.
"When he at length returned to his own sitting-room with her, he found"
"Captain Dove staring fixedly at another arrival there, an overwhelmingly"
"up-to-date if rather imbecile-looking young man, whose general"
"gorgeousness, combined with a very vacant, fish-like eye much magnified"
"by a monocle, had evidently reduced the would-be fashionable seaman to a"
stricken silence.
"Slyne, who had at first shot a most malevolent glance at the intruder,"
was stepping forward to greet him just as Mr. Jobling put in an
appearance with a sheaf of papers in one hand.
"""How d'ye do, Lord Ingoldsby?"" said Slyne quite suavely to the young man"
"with the eye-glass. He had caught sight of Mr. Jobling in the doorway,"
"and turned to Sallie, his quick mind bent on a masterstroke."
"""May I introduce to you the Marquis of Ingoldsby,"" he remarked to her in"
"the monotone of convention; and, as she bowed slightly in response to"
"that very modern young gentleman's ingratiating wriggle and grin, Slyne,"
"one eye on Captain Dove's astonished countenance, completed the"
formality.
"""This is Lady Josceline Justice,"" said he to his smirking lordship, and"
breathed delicately into a somewhat extensive ear the further
"information, ""the late Earl of Jura's daughter, you know--and my"
"_fiancée_."""
"were so, why should we make the least objection? But in the hypothesis"
that the introduction of civilisation has in view neither amelioration
"of the condition of the natives nor progress of commerce and industry,"
we might then conceive a sort of suspicion. Supposing that you augment
"the garrisons, the fortifications, the naval forces, one would see in it"
nothing but an expansion of your military power and not an introduction
of civilisation in the sense understood in France. Even in that case we
"would not raise objections, unless it were done with a view to menace"
us; but here I shall offer you a suggestion. Is it really worth your
while to develop there incessantly your military and naval forces in
order to oppose Japan? Would not the enterprise be rather costly? Would
it not be infinitely better to employ your energy in cultivating a good
understanding between your country and ours instead of rivalling each
other by crossing armaments?

XII
THE AUSTRALIAN QUESTION[1]
AN INTERVIEW
Baron Suyematsu gave a _Daily News_ representative his opinion of the
"'Spectre of Japan' as conceived by many Europeans. The Japanese Baron, a"
"burly, cheerful man, laughed heartily as he dealt with the alarmist"
fears of the 'Yellow Peril.'
"He pointed to the four men who still stood by the wall, the firing party"
"at attention before them, and the eyes of all on the next wave of the"
general's hand which would mean life or death.
La Giralda drew a quick breath. Would the hold she had over him be
sufficient for what she was about to ask? He was a fierce man and a
"cruel, this Ramon Cabrera, who loved naught in the world except his"
"mother, and had gained his present ascendency in the councils of Don"
Carlos by the unbending and consistent ferocity of his conduct.
"""These are no traitors, General,"" she said; ""they are true men, and deep"
"in the councils of the cause."""
She bent and whispered in his ear words which others could not hear. The
"face of the Carlist general darkened from a dull pink to purple, and"
then his colour ebbed away to a ghastly ashen white as he listened.
"Twice he sprang up from the stone bench where he had seated himself,"
"ground his heel into the gravel brought from the river-bed beneath, and"
"muttered a characteristic imprecation, ""Ten for one of their women I"
"have slain already--by San Vicente after this it shall be a hundred!"""
For La Giralda was telling him the tale of his mother's shooting by
Nogueras.
"Then all suddenly he reseated himself, and beckoned to Concha."
"""Come hither,"" he said; ""let me see these fellows' papers, and tell me"
"how they came into your hands!"""
Concha was ready.
the identity of the woman and the reason of her presence alone with
Marsh in such a place. Again he thought of that mysterious third person
"whose movements had been so swift and furious, but his conjectures left"
him more at sea than ever. Of one thing he felt sure. It was not enmity
alone that prompted Marsh to accuse him of the stabbing. The man was
"concealing something, in deadly fear of the truth, for rather than"
submit to questioning he had let his enemy go scot-free.
"Suddenly Boyd paused in his walk, recalling again the shadowy outlines"
of the figure with whom he had so nearly collided on his way up from
"the beach. There was something familiar about it, he mused; then, with"
"a low whistle of surprise, he smote his palms together. He began to see"
dimly.
For more than an hour the young man paced back and forth before the
"door of his sleeping-quarters, so deeply immersed in thought that only"
"the breaking storm drove him within. When at last he retired, it was"
with the certainty that this night had placed a new weapon in his hand;
"but of what tremendous value it was destined to prove, he little knew."
CHAPTER XXII
THE SILVER HORDE
The main body of salmon struck into the Kalvik River on the first day
"of July. For a week past the run had been slowly growing, while the"
"canneries tested themselves, but on the opening day of the new month"
"""We must be in La Granja in two hours if we are to save a soul within"
"its walls,"" he said, ""but--we have an hour for dinner first! Therefore"
"let us dine. God knows when we shall taste food again!"""
And with this dictum John Mortimer heartily agreed.
CHAPTER XXX
PALACE BURGLARS
The startling announcement of the Sergeant at once set the whole party
"in motion. Their suspicions of the morning were cast to the winds, as"
"the Sergeant and La Giralda in turn related their adventures. Concha,"
"having formerly vouched so strongly for the old gipsy woman, now nodded"
"triumphantly across to Rollo, who on his part listened intently. As"
Sergeant Cardono proceeded the young man leaned further and further
"forward, breathing deeply and regularly. The expression on his face was"
that of fierce and keen resolution.
"The Sergeant told all the tale as it had happened, reserving only the"
"identification of himself with the famous José Maria of Ronda, which the"
"gipsies had made on the strength of the red mark about his neck, now"
"once more concealed under his military stock. Cardono, however, made no"
"secret that he was of the blood of Egypt, and set down to this fact all"
that he had been able to accomplish. In swift well-chosen words he told
"of the fierce little girl with the dark hair and blue eyes, who declared"
"herself to be the daughter of Muñoz, sometime paramour and now reputed"
husband of the Queen-Regent--making it clear that she had indeed planned
"_Antigone_ for damage to her forefoot. Engineers were on one job, and"
platers and riveters on the other. Different trades. So not a workman
who was in the _Antinous_ was also in the _Antigone_. We can rule out
all the workmen. We can also rule out my lieutenant R.N.R. with the
German name who has gone to sea in the _Antinous_. The care and
maintenance party in the _Antigone_ was not the same as the one in the
"_Antinous_, not a man the same."""
"""You are sure of that?"" cried I, for it seemed that my daring theory"
"had gone to wreck. ""You are quite sure."""
"""Quite. I have all the names and have examined all the men. They were"
all off the ship by eleven o'clock last night. I hadn't one of my own
"men among them, but, to make sure, I sent Petty Officer Trehayne on"
board at eight o'clock to keep a sharp look-out and to see all the
harbour party off the vessel. He reported a little after eleven that
they were all gone and the ship taken over by her own crew. The damage
"was discovered at four bells in the morning watch."""
"""Six o'clock a.m.,"" interpreted Cary."
"""It looks now as if there might be a traitor among her own crew, which"
"is her officers' job, not mine. I wash my hands of the _Antigone_, but"
it is very much up to me to see that nothing hurtful happens to the
_Malplaquet_. The Admiral has orders to support me with all the force
under his command; the General of the District has the same orders.
But it isn't force we want so much as brains--Dawson's brains. I have
"been beaten twice, but not the third time. I've told the Yard that if"
"the _Malplaquet_ is touched I shall resign, and if they send any one"
"to help me I shall resign. Between to-day, Thursday, and Saturday I am"
going to catch the wily josser who has a fancy for cutting gun cables
"or Dawson will say good-bye to the Force. That's a fair stake."""
"'Can you do anything,' I asked, 'to cheer him? Do you speak to him of"
"what may happen after death, of hopes of another life?'"
"'No one can tell,' said my friend, 'what will happen after death. It"
"depends on a man's life, if he has done good or evil, what his next"
"existence will be, whether he will go a step nearer to the Peace. When"
"the man is dying no monks will come, truly; but an old man, an old"
"friend, father, perhaps, or an elder of the village, and he will talk to"
"the dying man. He will say, ""Think of your good deeds; think of all that"
"you have done well in this life. Think of your good deeds.""'"
'What is the use of that?' I asked. 'Suppose you think of your good
"deeds, what then? Will that bring peace?'"
The Burman seemed to think that it would.
"'Nothing,' he said, 'was so calming to a man's soul as to think of even"
one deed he had done well in his life.'
"Think of the man dying. The little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
"with an outer veranda, where the friends are sitting, and the inner"
"room, behind a wall of bamboo matting, where the man is lying. A pot of"
"flowers is standing on a shelf on one side, and a few cloths are hung"
here and there beneath the brown rafters. The sun comes in through
"little chinks in roof and wall, making curious lights in the"
"semi-darkness of the room, and it is very hot."
"From outside come the noises of the village, cries of children playing,"
"grunts of cattle, voices of men and women clearly heard through the"
still clear air of the afternoon. There is a woman pounding rice near
"by with a steady thud, thud of the lever, and there is a clink of a loom"
"who considers himself duped, in his countenance. It had gone ill with La"
Giralda if she had not been able to prove her case. But she held
"something in her hand, the sight of which brought the butcher of Tortosa"
down from his saddle as quickly as if a Cristino bullet had pierced him
to the heart.
"La Giralda was holding out to him an old string of beads, simply carved"
"out of some brown oriental nut, but so worn away by use that the"
stringing had almost cut through the hard and polished shell.
"""My mother's rosary!"" he cried, and sinking on his knees, he devoutly"
received and kissed it. He abode thus a moment looking up to the
"sky--he, the man who had waded in blood during six years of bitter"
warfare. He kissed the worn beads one by one and wept. They were his
mother's way to heaven. And he did not know a better. In which perchance
he was right.
"""Whence gat you this?"" cried Cabrera, rising sharply as a thought struck"
"him; ""my mother never would have parted with these in her life--you"
"plundered it from her body after her death! Quick, out with your story,"
"or you die!"""
"""Nay, little foster-son,"" said La Giralda, ""I was indeed with your"
"mother at the last--when she was shot by Nogueras, and five minutes"
before she died she gave her rosary into my hands to convey to you.
"'Take this to my son,' she said, 'and bid him never forget his mother,"
nor to say his prayers night and morn. Bid him swear it on these sacred
beads!' So I have brought them to you. She kissed them before she died.
"At the risk of my life have I brought it."""
"""And these,"" said Cabrera--""do you know these dogs, La Giralda?"""

"""Tiger-Lily"" was not altogether gone. She looked back, her face"
wrinkling into one of those strangely unbecoming expressions of grim
playfulness.
"""I've half a mind to make an 'At Home' out of YOU!"" she said, nodding"
"at him energetically. ""Only you're not important enough!"""
Villiers burst out laughing. He was not proof against this touch of
"humor, and on a sudden good-natured impulse, sprang to the door and"
shook hands with her.
"""No, indeed, I am not!"" he said, with a charming smile--""Think of"
"it!--I haven't even invented a new biscuit! Come, let me see you into"
"the hall,--I'm really sorry if I've spoken roughly, but I assure you"
"Alwyn's not at all the sort of man you want for interviewing,--he's far"
too modest and noble-hearted. Believe me!--I'm not romancing a
"bit--I'm in earnest. There ARE some few fine, manly, gifted fellows"

"His amiable glance, his kindly manner, took the gaunt female by"
"surprise, and threw her quite off her guard. She laughed,--a natural,"
unforced laugh in which there was not a trace of bitterness. He was
"really a delightful young man, she thought, in spite of his"
"old-fashioned, out-of-the-way notions!"
"""Well, perhaps I don't!"" she replied frankly--""But you see it is not my"

PEACOCKS
Early the next day Pola appeared with Mr. Dugald in Sunset Lane in a
simple garb that must have satisfied even her exacting cousin. Her mood
was in accord with her attire as though she had left her sophistication
"behind with her silks and her rouge. She declared she felt as ""peppy as"
"they make them"" and ready to do anything anyone suggested. And Mr."
"Dugald, resigned to wasting two weeks to entertaining his young cousin,"
"of whom he was really very fond, promptly offered an astonishing"
assortment of suggestions from which he commanded the girls to choose.
"""Why, you wouldn't believe there were so many things to do!"" cried Pola"
"with real enthusiasm. ""Sidney, you'll have to decide."" And Sidney at"
once decided upon a tramp to Peaked Hill on the ocean side with an
early picnic supper.
"In the days that followed, Sidney's first admiration for Pola returned."
Though Pola would never again be the idol she was much more enjoyable
"as a chum. Her spirits, though an affectation, were infectious and gay;"
in her pretty clothes and with her pretty face she made Sidney think of
"a butterfly, a fragile, golden-winged, dainty flitting butterfly. She"
professed to enjoy everything they did--even to the picnics. She
tramped endlessly in her unsuitable shoes without a murmur of fatigue
and Sidney suspected that she really _did_ care a great deal for her
cousin Dugald's approval.
With Mr. Dugald they motored to Highland Light and to Chatham. They
toured the shops at Hyannis. They sailed with Captain Hawkes on the
_Mabel T_. They rose very early one morning and went to the Coast Guard
Station to watch the drill and then ate ham and eggs with Commander
During this interview Rollo had stood absent-mindedly with his hand
"pressed on Concha's, as he listened to the strange speech of La Giralda."
Even his acquaintance with the language of the gipsies of Granada had
only enabled him to understand a word here and there. The girl's colour
"slowly returned, but the fear of the plague still ran like ice in her"
"veins. She who feared nothing else on earth, was shaken as with a palsy"
"by the terror of the Black Death, so paralysing was the fear that the"
very name of cholera laid upon insanitary Spain.
"""Well?"" said Rollo, turning to La Giralda, who stood considering with"
"her eyes upon the ground, after her interview with the crook-backed"
dwarf.
"""You must give me time to think,"" she said; ""this boy is one of our"
"people--a Gitano of Baza. He is not of this place, and he tells me"
strange things. He swears that the Queen and the court are plague-stayed
at La Granja by fear of the cholera. They dare not return to Madrid.
They cannot supply themselves with victuals where they are. The very
guards forsake them. And the Gitanos of the hills--but I have no right
"to tell that to the foreigner--the Gorgio. For am not I also a Gitana?"""
*       *       *       *       *
The village where Rollo's command first stumbled upon this dreadful fact
"was called Frias, in the district of La Perla, and lies upon the eastern"
"spurs of the Guadarrama. It was, therefore, likely enough then that the"
"boy spoke truth, and that within a few miles of them the Court of Spain"
was enduring privations in its aerial palace of La Granja.
But even when interrogated by El Sarria the old woman remained
obstinately silent as to the news concerning her kinsfolk which she had

"Dex shuddered; and a low moan came from Greca, whose clear blue eyes"
had rested on the contents of this vast room before in her capacity as
hostage and interpreter for the inhuman Rogans.
And now another sense of Dex's began to register perception on his
brain.
"A peculiar odor came to his nostrils. It was a musky, fetid odor, like"
"that to be smelled in an animal cage; but it was sharper, more acrid"
"than anything he had ever smelled on Earth. It smelled--ah, he had"
it!--_reptilian_. As though somewhere nearby a dozen titanic serpents
were coiled ready to spring!
"Looking about, Dex saw a six-foot square door of bars in one wall of"
"They travelled next day, reaching London at half-past two.  Betty had"
gone up in the early morning to prepare the way.  The dogs had been with
Aunt Rosamund all this time.  Gyp missed their greeting; but the
installation of Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be
"the nursery, absorbed all her first energies.  Light was just beginning"
"to fail when, still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and"
"crossed the garden, to see how all had fared during her ten weeks'"
"absence.  What a wintry garden!  How different from that languorous,"
"warm, moonlit night when Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow"
"of the dark trees.  How bare and sharp the boughs against the grey,"
"darkening sky--and not a song of any bird, not a flower!  She glanced"
"back at the house. Cold and white it looked, but there were lights in her"
"room and in the nursery, and someone just drawing the curtains.  Now that"
"the leaves were off, one could see the other houses of the road, each"
"different in shape and colour, as is the habit of London houses. It was"
stalk-like legs of his attackers from under them. One of the things
"went down, to twist weakly in a laborious attempt to rise again. But"
"the other, by sheer force of height and reach, began to bear Dex down."
"Savagely he laced out with his fists, battering the pulpy face that"
"was pressing down close to his. The big eyes blinked shut, but the"
four hose-like arms did not relax their clasp. Dex's hands sought
"fiercely for the thing's throat. But it had no throat: the head, set"
"directly on the thin shoulders, defied all throttling attempts."
*       *       *       *       *
"Then, just as Dex was feeling that the end had come, he felt the"
"creature wrench from him, and saw it slide in a tangle of arms and"
"legs over the smooth metal pavement. He got shakily to his feet, to"
see Brand standing over him and flailing out with his fists at an ever
tightening circle of towering figures.
"""Thanks,"" panted Dex. And he began again, tripping the twelve-foot"
"things in order to get them down within reach, battering at the great"
"pulpy heads, fighting blindly in that expressed craving to take as"
many of the creatures into hell with him as he could manage. Beside
"him fought Brand, steadily, coolly, grim of jaw and unblinking of eye."
Already the struggle had gone on far longer than they had dreamed it
might. For some reason the grotesque creatures delayed killing them.
"That they could do so any time they pleased, was certain: if the"
monsters could reach them with their shock-tubes through the double
"insulated hull of the space ship, they could certainly kill them out"
in the open.
Yet they made no move to do so. The deadly tubes were not used. The
circle of his own men. “Same gang who bought Schaeffer.”
"The jam boss nodded in a troubled way. “I’m afraid they’ve got us bad,"
"too. It’s goin’ to take one long time pickin’ that jam apart, but I"
can’t see anythin’ else to do. I spose I’d better start ’em at it right
"away, sir.”"
"“Not at all,” retorted Bob swiftly. “Do nothing of the kind. Let ’em"
"stay just where they are, Jerry!”"
At the sound of his imperative undertone Calker hustled up. There was a
"brief interchange of words between the trio, during which the faces of"
both lumberjacks brightened--amazingly. Then all three disappeared into
"the bushes a little way upstream, from which they did not emerge for a"
considerable time.
"When they finally appeared, Bainbridge held by his side a shapeless"
package of considerable size. Had not Peters and Calker walked so close
"beside him as he bent his way leisurely toward the crowd about the jam,"
it would probably have been noticed that this package was made up of a
"dozen or more sticks of giant powder fastened securely together, and"
depending from a sling of stout manila rope.
"The line of rivermen had turned, and were watching his approach with"
"interested curiosity, but Joyce and his gang could see nothing. Reaching"
"the men, Bob paused, struck a match, and carefully lighted the end of a"
"protruding fuse. As it sputtered up he gave a short, sharp word of"
"command, the line of men opened instantly to let him through, and a"
"second later he stood not a dozen paces from Joyce, deliberately"
swinging the deadly package round and round his head.
For a second there was a breathless hush. Then the red-haired man leaped
I don't like you!
Close cover before striking.
Close cover before striking.
My daddy told me never to play with matches.
My mummy told me never to play with matches.
"Oh, that's it."
He's gone too far.
"- I have to stop this, Al."
- Don't!
Ow!
There's someone here to see an Annabella Wilgis.
Annabella Wilgis?
- He's here!
"- Who's here, the killer?"
- He's coming.
- Sit down!
Who are you now?
"My name, young man, is Annabella Wilgis."
How dare you speak to me like that.
Here he is.
"Your interrogation of my client is over, Detective."
Your client?
"- Darren Russem, Ms Wilgis' lawyer."
- You're her lawyer!
- Miss Wilgis is not here voluntarily.
- She came in as a witness!
- Are you torturing my client?
- She came in voluntarily!
You don't seem to understand the scope of my client's disorder.
She asked you to meet her here?
You called ahead because you knew you'd need a lawyer?
"Five minutes, that's all I need."
A great gift.
"Oh, this ..."
Ordudaydım before the priest.
- What does it mean?
"- ""Self-sacrifice"" of the Latin."
I have tattoos and 4 had a friend like that.
"1 word, it's all a aradaydı."
So ... what other elements fell?
"Freedom, Family, Blood and Courage."
I fell to sacrifice?
Do you know what it means to altruism?
No.
One thing to say bless.
"Me and my friends, in Afghanistan, Special Kuvvetler'deydik."
"Our mission, to destroy the production of heroin."
When the rocket hit 3-dağlardaydık us.
I'd survived a single.
"Of course, after something like that You can not predict who would survive."
... And So I've been a priest?
"I became a priest, because I can do it thought it would be the hardest thing."
"Pretty stupid, huh?"
So ...
Looks good.
How are you?
Are you okay?
You know what?
I think your brother will be here soon.
I'm sure the job was just.
- He comes back to you until we ilgilenebilirim.
OK?
- Okay.
- Hey.
"Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts."
"Yeah, I don't speak virgin either."
The ring-- it makes you invisible.
You're not precious.
"Oh, good, you're awake."
"Look, Ted, there's something we have to talk about."
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?
Losing your key privileges?
"It's about the 20-year-old, Ted."
You have to bang her.
For me!
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?
I thought I disgusted you.
"Yeah, that was all an act."
"Look, look, look, I love Robin and she's the only girl I want to be with."
But my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
"Oh, yeah."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-what-what are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's got to be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No.
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night-stand material, Ted."
Oh.
Oh.
Here's your mom.
Judge Goni?
In the High Court.
Here.
A play.
Here.
First act.
First act.
Well?
- Well what?
First act.
"Plays usually start with the first act, yes."
Then there's a description of what's on the stage.
It says here...
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
I want to talk about what happened before.
- I don't.
Why is it so important to you that I direct there?
Because you're a wonderful director.
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
"I'm not so sure anymore, Goni."
You could still direct so many beautiful plays.
"""Waiting room in the clinic of Dr. Reno Laroire."""
"""The walls are covered with diplomas..."
"""and with anatomic sketches of the human body."
"""Anatomic drawings."""
"Anatomic drawings, not sketches."
"""When the curtain rises,"
"""Dr. Laroire is straightening the certificates on the wall."
"""Laroire is about 30 years old..."
"""His collar is stiff and high."""
Give him his pills and make sure he rests at home.
He shouldn't be going out now.
- How we gonna get there?
- Walk.
"Feet, did y'all hear what that man said?"
"- When my man appears, send him up with my luggage, will you?"
"- Very good, sir."
Show Mr. Wooster to his room.
"This way, sir."
Mr. Wooster just arrived.
I've given him room nine.
Good.
Keep me informed of everything he does.
I'm Mr. Wooster's man.
What room shall I take his things to?
- Mr. Wooster is in room nine.
- Thank you.
"- What's the matter, old man?"
Don't you feel well?
"- I'm very well, thank you."
- Have you got wasps in this hotel?
- Wasps?
Of course not.
- I feel certain I've been stung.
- Possibly your imagination.
"Possibly, but not probably."
- I'll carry that for you for two bits.
- Two bits of what?
That's a quarter— 25 cents American money.
"No, thank you."
I don't need your aid.
What an extraordinary language.
Two bits!
"Well, Jeeves, you were right again."
- Malaysia.
I was in the area.
- Kramer.
- Just drive.
All right.
"Now you listen, and you listen good."
I know who you are.
You're the scofflaw.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.
"It's me, Cosmo."
"All right, so it's me."
So what?
You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day?
Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.
"- I can't sleep, I tell you."
I can't sleep.
"- Of course you can't, you poor sap."
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
So you've been living this secret by yourself?
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.
I wanted to tell somebody.
"- Help me, Kramer."
Help me.
"- All right, I'm gonna help you."
"I'll try some on, we'll see how they look."
It's just hair.
Ever see what that looks like in the back?
You got natural curls on the bottom and that big phoney mat coming down on top of it.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
$%#@
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
My God.
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!
Get off!
Everyone get out of your cars and get off!
C.J.
come on!
You've gotta get off.
Turn the $% thing down.
- What?
Then the next thing I knew he had me pinned up against the wall.
It's OK.
Take your time.
He said he had a knife.
"And that if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd kill me."
And he told me to open the door.
And...
I was so scared I couldn't find my keys.
"You're doing really well, Lucy."
He got really angry and... he ripped the back of my dress.
With a knife.
And... he started touching me.
This car horn started beeping.
And he just grabbed my bag and ran off.
And...
I heard the cab pull away.
Can you describe the cab?
"It was green, I think."
Maybe blue.
Did you see his face?
Only for a second or two.
Anything else you can remember at all?
Something that sticks in your mind?
He had these trainers on.
They were white with a blue stripe.
And one of them had orange paint splashed on the toe.
It was on the right foot.
OK.
You've done really well.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Right, if you'll excuse us."
Looks like the fiance is off the hook.
I see eight Rolex boxes.
The guy's got two arms and eight Rolexes?
"Two arms, eight Rolexes and one safe he didn't use."
Genius.
Actor.
I remember running to the door and falling on the ground.
"And thinking,"
"""Why isn't Colin here?"
"""He should be here."""
Do you know where he was?
It's not like I know her name.
Got a friend you can stay with?
No.
I'm just the girlfriend from back home.
So I left The Edison with a buddy around 1:00.
And I just passed out back at his place.
His name?
What does that matter?
So I can confirm your whereabouts.
"Hey, come on, man, you can't actually think that I would..."
That's why I need his name.
Look...
I love Miranda.
All right.
Give me her name.
She's in the business.
I...
It wouldn't feel right to give you her name until my people talk to her people.
You do know I can ask anyone of a dozen photographers who you left The Edison with.
I didn't...
I didn't cheat on Miranda.
Colin cheated on Miranda with Chelsea Sennett.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- It's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
And then I- I do the rest.
"You know, I'd really like to know how you got me to do this."
You and I both.
What are you thinking?
You're just- You're really-
You're very beautiful.
Don't sound so surprised.
(SCOFFS) No.
"No, I guess it takes a moment like this to wake a guy up, so he can actually see what's right in front of him."
That's our cue.
(GASPS)
(LIGHTER FLICKS)
IVAN: it's amazing.
"Even hazy and out of focus, you can still recognize your own silhouette."
I wondered all day- How?
How is this possible?
"So, Marcus here is going to babysit."
And you-
You're going to take me to see what's over there.
(IVAN CHUCKLES)
I would not have believed you if you'd told me.
Kicks them out every night at 8:00.
Yeah.
What about the daytime ones?
I don't know.
"Since we found it, it's only been doing 'em at night."
What's this?
"Uh, it's- it's the newest one."
Okay-
Okay-
Here's the deal.
Every day you're going to take this photo.
Here comes Mrs Ellis and that Mrs Turner.
Here's your chance.
Try and sell them something extra.
Let's see a bit of salesmanship.
She's as bad.
She'd pass you on the street.
They're no good once they've been to Majorca.
Brown.
All she thinks about is being brown.
"And nearly everywhere, if you believe what he says next door."
"Well, who's got a better view?"
"20 Navy Cut, please."
"Same for me, Granville."
And a box of matches?
(HE MOUTHS)
Too much sun dries the skin.
It's very destructive.
-
- I go blotchy.
-
- She'll wish she'd kept more clothes on.
"And here, where me bra finishes, it always starts to peel."
It's further down where it gets me.
I can stand hardly any exposure round me navel.
Me skin goes all crisp.
Top of me thighs is where I get it.
"It's the ultra--violet, according to that friend of our Edmund."
He should know.
He's as big a violet as I've ever seen!
-
- How is your Edmund?
-
"Well, uh, just a minute."
"Dr. Alison, what's your off-the-cuff estimate"
- of Sally's condition?
"- Stay with her, Sergeant."
"Yes, sir."
"Here, Sally, let me help you."
This is Dr. Alison from the consulate.
"Without a complete diagnostic check-up, which we can only do properly at a medical office,"
I would say she is really a super chimp.
"Her heart has a steady beat, and she appears to be in astonishingly good health considering her fantastic voyage through space."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I want to get back"
- to my famous patient.
- Message received.
"I'll be needing you, Doctor."
Thanks.
"That's right, Nagoro."
We'll keep in touch.
Out.
That's it.
We're gonna lift her.
Put your hands under her.
- You get that end.
- Right.
Up we go.
"1, 2, 3, lift."
Here we go.
Now we'll turn.
(SERGEANT):
"You'll be all right, pal."
(CAPTAIN):
Here we go.
I'll get her from the front.
"You know, the problem with the DOD is they design everything for desert warfare."
"If they just understood that 20% of the planet was mountainous,"
- then... ah!
Got it.
- [Radio chirps]
"Jack, do you read?"
[Static crackling]
This way.
So you really ain't have nothing else but this red coat?
[Chuckles]
"Monty, it's Jack."
Go ahead.
Monty:
We got the DNA on the killer.
Mae:
It's an Ian Wilson.
He's from New Zealand.
"Uh, 2015 earthquake triggered an avalanche that wiped out his entire mountain climbing expedition."
Authorities assumed that everyone in the expedition died including Ian and his wife.
"But somehow, he survived."
"Jack, he's not a monster."
He's a very damaged individual.
He attacked one of the Nepalis.
We're tracking him.
"Where are you now, Mae?"
"Uh, we are at the base of the avalanche, where his wife was killed."
♪♪
He's been here.
About a kilometer that way.
"Stick tight, Mae."
We're on our way.

Molly bowen Please go to your room and pack your things.
Miss fry...
Please.
"I hope you had a splendid evening,"
Because it will be your last at the griffith.
Let her be an example for the rest of you.
This institution is not unlike fort knox or alcatraz.
"Whether by force or trickery, this building is impenetrable."
Can you believe that?
"I don't, actually."
No building is impenetrable.
"Ladies and gentlemen, our pal leet brannis."
Coroner says the amalgam in his teeth is russian.
Yeah?
How did he get the scar?
His voice box was cut out.
Mm.
Probably happened during the war.
Russian rifle division...
the 478th.
"Now, you ready to have your socks knocked off?"
Leet brannis died.
"I know that, son."
I'm staring at his corpse.
Two years ago.
Guy I knew in basic ended up in the u.S. Embassy in moscow.
I had him dig into the 478th.
"Turns out, they were wiped out in '44"
"In the battle of finow, germany."
Dead don't walk.
"At least, not in my experience."
Where we at with your guy?
Check it out.
"So, uh, President Bush is in the news again."
Have you heard about this?
"No, Jay Leno."
The host of the Tonight Show.
I thought that's what I was doing.
"So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars."
You know?
"No, no."
Like Jay Leno.
"Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
"You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you--"
"How is that different from what I was doing, though?"
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
Sure you will.
I just-- I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
Tell him I'll be up in half an hour.
"No, they said now."
"If they got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar."
"Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about."
"What about, uh, Ray Romano?"
Can you do Ray?
Hey.
"God, oh."
These might be the worst sounds ever made in this room.
It's not what it looks like.
"Yes, it is!"
This is exactly what it looks like.
Mason and I love each other.
"Nope, not buying it."
Mason's totally out of your league.
What are you guys talking about?
But you're going to tease me.
"No, we're adults."
I'm not going to tease you.
Okay.
[sighs]
I like Emma.
[mocking]:
Ooh!
So you like Emma.
"That's big, weird news."
"I would use it to my advantage, but you already do everything I ask without question."
"Well, it wasn't news to me."
I know everyone's secrets.
I was head bitch on my high school cheerleading squad.
"Huh, you know nothing about me."
Calf implants.
"I just, uh..."
looked at the brochure.
"Yes, Jack, I like Emma, but don't worry."
I have a foolproof plan to win her over.
"Unless it involves some kind of enchanted amulet,"
I find that hard to believe.
Boom!
Behold.
I'm not him.
"Uh, I know that, Aubrey."
(chuckles anxiously)
"He left his wife, he left me."
"You know, I would-- I would never ever do that."
What are you saying?
"I'm saying that... when I commit to something, it's real."
That I'm serious about us.
Did I say the wrong thing?
No.
"Of course not, Aubrey... (sighs) ...but there's a lot going on."
I know.
"And when it's all taken care of,"
I'm gonna feel the same way.
BRENNAN:
"I know this is difficult, Booth, but... (groans) ...you're gonna get through it."
"Yeah, sounds like something Aldo would have said."
He was right.
(Booth groans)
"Yeah, but this is different."
"Bones, he, um... he died... 'cause he was trying to protect me."
What do you mean?
You know that X-ray that we saw in the sound studio?
I know who that was.
There was no name on it.
I looked for that.
He died of a gunshot wound in the head.
Center core.
"3,000 feet away."
I'm the one who made that shot.
That is a ridiculous assumption.
There are other snipers capable...
- I'm not hungry
All right.
Don't eat.
How am I bothered?
Eat it
I told you.
I'm not hungry.
Come on now.
Eat
What did you say?
I got carried away
Never mind.
"In big places, such small things happen"
"You were right, Senorita."
The spirit of adventure in this barn... you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?
"No, not Zurich."
"Tomorrow evening, we entrain at Berne."
Tomorrow morning... we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything
"Now, nothing can go wrong"
What's that?
- Life
Aren't you ashamed to drink in the presence of a lady?
Better than dying before the lady!
"If you wish to live on... you too should have a bit, Senorita."
- Don't you dare come near me
"All right, don't"
I'll see you tomorrow morning if you're still alive.
"Until then, goodnight"
"""May I have a jig?"
"- Oh no!"""
[Sighs] He loves me.
Mmm.
He loves me not.
He loves me!
[laughs] I knew it!
"Ariel, stop talking crazy!"
I gotta see him again... tonight.
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
"- Ariel, please!"
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?
"I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention."
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!
"Ariel, listen to me."

Lance Crawford?
Mom!
"Hello, Eric."
Your father and I were just discussing... how unrealistically space travel is portrayed in Star Wars.
"It was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."
- You either buy it or you don't.
- What a lively conversation. [Laughing]
- I'll get some sodas.
"- No, please."
Allow me.
Why don't you stay here and chat with Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.
"Yes, I'd love to explain the practical impossibility... of the so-called light saber."
You son of a bi-
"Red alert, you guys."
Red alert!
Lance Crawford is in the building!
- I'm gettin' the hell outta here!
"- [Jackie] Wait, wait, wait."
- What if he sees us sneaking out?
"- Oh, Donna... leave one of your socks behind."
[Groans]
What?
It'll distract him.
"Nina, I thought we were so happy together."
What happened?
"Fez, right now I'm at a point in-"
"Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker."
I want the truth!
"Okay, the truth is you're too needy."
Too needy?
"I'm sorry, but a man in his sexual prime has needs."
This is probably just a somewhat hilarious misunderstanding.
- Yes!
- This isn't what's important.
What's important right now is that we have to go to the old schoolhouse before it's too late.
"[ pigeon cooing ] Well, I can't really tell you how you got that rash if I don't have more information."
"It was about two weeks ago and my old college buddy was in town, and..."
Oh!
"OK, OK."
- I don't want to hear that.
- All right.
"So guys, we're going to tear this place down now, or what?"
Oh!
No!
Go back to the rash.
"You were saying, ""two weeks ago... ""?"
"Yeah, my old college buddy, hadn't seen him in a while..."
"- No demolition today, boys."
- But why?
This is the future site of the new Mercy mosque.
Yes!
"You totally saved the day, Ann!"
Mayors!
[ A cell phone rings. ]
Oh!
Oh!
"Hey there, hot stuff!"
Oh!
Hang on.
"Rayyan, Amaar just got arrested for having a bomb."
Ha!
Ha!
Very funny.
"Clark, Cline, Clackey..."
"Culver, Jones, Charlie."
"Keep going right in, boys."
You boys are going to love the army.
-Elliot.
-Elliot.
Right.
"Hurry up in the back of the bus, all the way."
Nothing in this world is going to stop me from coming back.
"-I love you, Selena."
"-I love you, Ted."
"Hurry up, hurry up."
On the double.
"Let's go, boys!"
Cut them off.
"Hey, you!"
Snap it up.
"On the double, let's go."
"You know, you can write to her later on government stationary."
Good-bye.
Let's go!
"That first winter away from home, I took shape as an individual... and toughened."
With spring came the promise that perhaps I'd found my place in life.
But part of me would keepescaping.
"I'd find it running in memory back through Peyton Place's fields... orwandering down the streets, now emptied of young men."
I've got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter.
He says:
"""The food they serve here must have been warmed over from World War I""!"
"-Oh, you remember Fred Cole."
"-Yes, I know him."
"He says: ""Dear Hyde, I joined the Navy because I liked the way... they kept their ships:"
The house was gone.
It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay here a little longer.
It's comfortable.
"Well, depends on your definition of comfort."
"I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here."
"It's not for me, it's for you."
Is it?
-Can you get me some lemonade?
-I'll see if there's some around.
-How'd you sleep?
-I don't know.
Whatever you hit me with took me down.
I feel fucking drugged.
"Yeah, well, you were drugged."
-I don't like downers.
-You weren't liking the uppers either.
Yeah.
-I told you not to call my house.
"-Look, I had to contact your family."
You're underage.
That's the law.
My mom's gonna kick my ass.
"I mean, she's freaking now."
But she's gonna torch my fucking ass when I get out of here.
Why are things so wrong with your mom?
I don't know.
You seem like you do.
"She just doesn't get me, all right?"
"She's in my face about my grades, my hair, my friends, tattoos."
All this other shit.
You know?
I can't do nothing right.
And...
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten!
I want to go home.
Mummy said we can't go till the roads dry up.
But it's been raining for three days now.
It's no use.
We're prisoners.
Prisoners of the Bastille.
Guards are everywhere.
- We'll blast our way out.
- Yes!

"Monsieur Chopin, it sounds so like the raindrops, it's quite magical, but I must ask you to produce a little sunshine for us instead."
"I'm about to go mad with the sound of horrid rain, day in, day out."
"Ordinarily I would just take a bromide and go to bed, but one has guests to entertain."
"Stupid, stupid rain!"
"No need to entertain us, Your Excellency."
"Rather, it is our turn to entertain you."
- I've just written a play for your theatre.
"- Oh, how gay!"
Eugene will paint the scenery.
The maids can do the costumes.
I would have run away long time back.
To Mauritius...
to white sands... to blue skies...
You are young you will get many chances.
Brother.
Stop for a minute...
You are with me because this is your first night.
From tomorrow you are on your own.
Be tough!
Don't be scared!
Do we wait here?
I'll go first.
How much money should I ask for?
"2,000 rupees don't settle for less."
Drink up!
"Go on, have another swig."
It eases the pain!
Move aside.
Time to get to work!
Looking for fun?
- Yes!
How much will you pay?
- Let's bargain on the way.
There is one!
Standing all by himself!
Back up.
I am tired of whores around here let's try the pretty boys for size!
Three of you?
"Why, you gonna cook for us tonight?"
All three of you will have to pay!
"Sure, but let us see the goods first."
"Go on, he is calling you!"

"- Can I help you, my friend?"
- Yeah...
"I just got all ""discombooberated."" I was lookin' for the loo."
"- Back this way, abuelo."
- Ah.
[Richie] I counted 18 employees.
[Eddie] Plus seven more at the repair shop.
That's gotta be where they unload the loot.
"Knowin' this outfit, they stash everything underground."
That explains the elevator with the down button back by the kitchen.
- It's a tango.
- In and out with a truck.
- You wanna Jim Brown the place?
- I'm thinkin' more Fred Williamson.
"You always could plan a job, kid."
"Alright, buy it at four."
I'll try.
You knew something.
"Well, I told you."
It was too late when you told me.
If I'd had the pleasure of knowing you before.
Do you think he's going to get it at four?
"No, but it's a good buy at five."
I couldn't get it.
"Alright, buy it at five."
"I'm sorry, it's going to six."
Buy it at six.
I won't buy it at all.
Cancel the order.
You mustn't get mad just because you missed a good buy.
Who gave you this tip?
I specialize in tips.
Give me your card.
I'm afraid I don't have one with me.
But I'll be happy to call you when I get the next tip.
I usually don't do this.
"I'll call you, Mrs. Ryan."
"And if you're not in, I'll leave the message with your husband."
"I have no husband, I am a widow."
Who was your husband?
Peter Ryan.
Peter Ryan!
Did you know him?
"Everybody knew Peter Ryan, the financial wizard."
We were married in Europe.
He brought me to this country.
A short while after he died.
- Who the fuck are you?
Why do we care what you think?
"What are you, an intern?"
Yes.
What about that last intern?
"She had those bug eyes, looked like Courtney Cox on chemo."
Let me give you two pieces of advice:
Always wear black and... you never finish shitting until you piss again.
Remember that and you'll be fine here.
"- Thank you, I'll keep it in mind."
- I'm just busting your balls!
- Come on!
- You can laugh!
"- I like her vibe, though!"
- Nice vibe.
Good vibe!
Come visit me in my office and...
We'll chat sometime.
A little less rouge.
Are we working or are we chatting?
Pardon me?
Yeah!
Obviously you!
Who else would I be talking to?
"- Rocky, the camera man?"
"- Director ""odd"" Photography."
"Oh, great!"
Come here now!
Chop-chop!
You remember when I asked you to do a special project for me?
- Did you see it...
"- Yeah, I saw it!"
- She looks mad.
"No, that's just her look."
What's that?
"- ""It looks like her number came up."""
- It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
"You remember last year sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post, and he said, ""i'll keep you posted."""
- I heard about that.
- Everybody heard about it.
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
- This is a classic.
- If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to find the right moment."
"Captain, if you're ready to release the body, I can take her downtown."
I still don't get it.
Who'd want to kill the Lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- That was my line, man."
- What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds...
Ask the captain.
"- This is a crime scene, for god sakes."
"- No, you heard me."
You know what?
He must've heard me.
"It's okay, look."
- (TRING)
- It caused a train wreck!
What did?
"Tell me again, Mansley, and this time listen to yourself."
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
A giant metal monster.
(GENERAL LAUGHING)
"Please, sir."
I've got a feeling about this one.
"That's lovely, Kent."
But let me try to explain how this works.
"If you told me you'd found, say, a giant footprint,"
I might send over an expert to make a plaster cast of it.
Hell!
You get me a photograph of this thing and I could probably get some troops over there!
"But you tell me you've got a ""feeling""?"
"All right then, fine."
You want evidence?
I'll get you evidence.
"And when I do, I'm gonna wanna a memo distributed."
"- That sounds swell, Kent."
- (TELEVISION PLAYING)
I'm gonna want that memo carbon copied and redistributed... (DIAL TONE)
(YELLS INDISTINCTLY)
(BANGING RECEIVER)

(INHALES DEEPLY)
Hi.
Thanks for the use of your phone.
"Well, thank you for the use of your phone, Mrs..."
Hughes.
Annie Hughes.
Betty... .
- Rodney asked me to take care of you.
- I don't need your help.
But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought about anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but Rodney liked flashy girls so that's the way I was gonna be."
"The funny thing is, Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him."
But you taught him appearances count more than feelings!
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's... .
Let's keep what's left of the family together.
"A little brighter one, please."
- Did you hear about Mr. Rossi?
"- No, what?"
- He's leaving town.
- Leaving?
Not really.
They're trying to get him to be principal of a high school in Portland.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
I got it firsthand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Ms. Thornton."
- I suppose that's firsthand.
- We won't be able to keep him here.
- This is kind of nice.
Can I try it on?
"- Sure, come on."
Merry Christmas.
I don't know about not telling Emma.
If I don't...
What if Miguel is right?
You said you don't want to stress Emma out.
You let me know if you find anything out.
"Maggie, hold up."
I trust Miguel.
He'll get this sorted out.
"Like deciding not to tell Emma, and then, swapping glances like you're teenage boys"
- getting away with things again?
- That's not what just happened.
"Look, I've raised Emma on my own since you left."
"I've made mistakes, but I didn't have any help."
- That's not fair.
You know I had to leave.
"- Now, you're back, and you think that you and Emma almost being killed"
"No, listen."
I
-Pragmatic.
"No, I did."
"No, you are."
I'm a realist.
-You are scared.
-I'm not afraid.
It is not our first time.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
-OK. -unhappy Himself.
"I'm just very, very unhappy."
You're so...
"You are so wonderful, and you're so..."
"The sensitive and romantic, and..."
Oh.
"He's very handsome, isn't he?"
I don't know.
He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.
The one playing the snarfblatt.
"Silence, silence."
"It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present."
"Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have."
- [Applause]
- I know.
"[Grimsby] Happy birthday, Eric."
[Gasping]
[Growls]
"Uh, gee, Grim..."
Ha!
[clears throat]
"It's, uh..."
It's really somethin'.
"Yes, I commissioned it myself."
"Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present."
"Come on, Grim."
Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
"Oh, my!"
"Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone."
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
"Oh, she's out there somewhere."
I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
[Grimsby] Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
"Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know."
I remember that.
This was one of the craziest days of my life.
- I don't know if you guys recall.
"- Yeah, I remember that."
Yeah.
"You guys were shooting without me, so I had..."
I was...
"- Oh, this was the day."
- That's a great story.
"- Yeah, but there's not enough time."
- It'll take all day to tell.
- Michael had a crazy adventure.
"- I did, yeah."
Because I thought I was coming in to work at 6.
That's what I was told.
And then I didn't end up coming until 2.
"And anyway, there's too much to say."
Too much.
But Devendra Banhart is in this scene.
- Right.
That was cool.
- Later on.
"And your friend Kevin, right?"
Kevin and Devendra Banhart are in the scene we're about to see.
And...
- Kevin visited a bunch of times.
- This is a sweet scene.
"- This is the handholding scene, right?"
- Yeah.
I remember Aaron and I were talking about...
He was really nervous before shooting this scene because this was his audition scene.
And I had said my import authority...
I had a great kid.
He was gonna be a baker.
"Oh, I know, it's not much."
"[Louise Clicks Teeth, Heaves Long Sigh]"
But I set up everything for him.
"[Shouting] Now, listen!"
I've heard your garbage!
Now you listen to mine!
He hasn't heard it!
All right.
"Anyway, I set up everything for him."
"On his high school graduation night, he... he got drunk... a little bit of the old man."
"And I swear to God, he did something I never understood."
He enlisted.
Can you imagine enlisting... in a day and age like this?
"He wanted to go his own way, I guess."
"Anyway, they sent him toJapan."
They were gonna teach him this and that.
"Well, he never got toJapan!"
He only got to Okinawa!
And he got into a fight!
And he was killed in some town called Naha!
- Where is Naha!
"- Oh, come on."
"Seymour, it's all right."
"That's all over and done with now, anyway."
- He was all I had.
- Mr. Seymour.
Your son enlisted in the marines?
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was the dumb marines."
And you're a dumb person for stirring things up the first time you get around here.
STEVE:
Wow.
"Yeah, that's impressive."
Cuz is a straight-up wizard when it comes to branding.
"All right, all right, let's make this official."
"McGarrett, want to do the honors?"
Really?
"What, you couldn't spring for a bigger bottle?"
It's a ceremonial gesture.
"Ceremonial, okay."
(clears throat)
"To the sea, to the sailors of old, and to the SS Thong Magnet."
(phone ringing) MAX:
Mazel tov.
McGarrett.
"Oh, no."
(sirens wailing)
(tires screech)
"Chin, what do you got?"
Joel and Susan Hiller.
Housekeeper arrived this morning and found them tied up on the floor.
"Their infant daughter, however, was left untouched in her crib."
I thought this was a kidnapping.
"If the parents are accounted for and so is the kid, who's the victim?"
KONO:
Addison Wells.
"22 years old, originally from Minnesota."
She's currently a senior at Oahu State.
She started babysitting for the Hillers six months ago.
CHIN:
Parents are getting on a flight to Hawaii.
"Minneapolis PD is up on the phones, but so far no ransom call."
"You know my rule about technology, Sleet!"
Give it to me!
I'm sorry...
"Dermot, give it to me!"
It wasn't my...
"I don't care if it's yours, you're not having it in my fucking dojo!"
I'm sorry.
Sorry if we've offended you.
And I don't like Simon Cowell trying to get rid of this place to turn it into telephone towers.
I'm not having it!
I've told him I will defend my sanctuary to the death and I'll say the same thing to you now.
"Seriously, the total lack of respect..."
SLEET YELLS Konichiwa!
"What, what is this?"
What is this?
These are our power stances.
"I get this, this is not powerful at all."
"I know, it's weird."
He...
Get out of here!
I hate you!
OK.
"Just back out, Dermot, slowly."
Back out.
Slowly back out.
"Leave me in peace, this is my haven!"
You are now a suspect in the murder of Simon Cowell.
"I don't care, I'm glad he's dead."
"He's not dead, he's been kidnapped."
I was trying to fool you.
"Oh, shit!"
"Thank you, Philip."
"Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France."
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant!
You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- (GUNSHOT)
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded.
- We'll hold the king as hostage.
We'll shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you.
- My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
GIRL:
Beautiful!
BOTH:
Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, Excellency."
- Claudette.
Ah.
Velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, Claudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
"If Hayes gets wind of this, we could have a firefight on our hands."
Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation.
He seems like a reasonable man.
That'd be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the armory?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
They'll side with us.
But Hayes posted two MACO there.
Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
Hold it.
Sorry.
That's going to leave a bruise.
All right.
Here with me.
We won't get to the bridge this way.
Captain!
"Captain, it's Trip!"
You shouldn't have weapons in here.
Go ahead.
"Major, Corporal Chang's been found unconscious in T'Pol's quarters."
Where's T'Pol?
"Not here, sir."
Hayes to the Armory.
"Armory, respond."
Stand down!
"You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?"
Tell them to stand down.
The captain relieved you of duty.
The Troubled World.
Come on.
"Hey, Ponch."
"This weekend, are you gonna work dark?"
"No, Clark, I need the extra money."
"And now, the continuing story of the people we know."
Neighbors of yours and mine.
The people living in The Troubled World.
"Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
You mean to tell me you watch this stuff?
Cari just told Bob she's leaving for Brazil with Susan and Jamie.
I'll read it when the book comes out.
"Cari, don't tell me lies."
I don't wanna hear more lies.
Prove your love by staying with me.
But you know I love you.
I left George for you.
But not until I left Carla.
"Cari, sometimes I doubt your words, doubt our future."
Sometimes I'm sure we have nothing together.
"Bob, don't say that."
I can't bear it.
I won't hear it.
"Then prove your love, stay with me forever."
"I will, my dear, after we return."
"No, Cari, it's if you return."
You know me better than that.
You know I never lied to you.
"Haven't you, Cari?"
Haven't you really?
"Oh, Cari, I love you, I need you."
I want you here.
Same reason I never wear mine.
-What?
"-Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
You mean like a rave?
Is it still a rave if you don't roll?
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
-Want me to get you one?
-Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"It's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
(JACKSON groaning)
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says, ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"""
"is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
-Why do you wanna know?
-I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that you could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
"Well, tell me if this feels like an answer."
No.
Jackson?
In here.
-ls something wrong?
What?
There's a new club at the pier that the Walkmen are playing at.
- You know who loves the Walkmen?
- You?
"- Yeah, and..."
- Summer.
- Summer is going out with Zach?
"Yeah, so maybe I'll buy her and Zach tickets to the show."
- Why would you do that?
- Out of friendship and to show her how selfless I can be.
- And to get her back.
- I'm going to look into this.
"- Seth, your coffee."
"- Oh, thanks a lot."
"I'll, uh, get you next time."
"- Oh, my God."
I am so sorry.
- That was refreshing.
"Uh, here, let me..."
- I... am so sorry.
Are you okay?
"- Yeah, I have to, uh, get a rhinoplasty, but now I'll look just like all the other girls here."
"It's okay, really."
"Uh, you can leave my tampons where they are."
Thanks.
Is there anything I can do?
"Uh, well, I guess you could dislocate my shoulder, or shave off my eyebrows."
"I mean, is this how you guys treat all your new students,or is today just my lucky day?"
- Can I buy you a coffee?
"- No, no, no, no."
"Please, please don't."
"I've had plenty, thanks, and I'm guessing you have, too."
So why would he disappear?
Did he have money worries?
Did he have marital problems?
Did he have money worries?
Did he have marital problems?
"Oh, who doesn't, mate, eh?"
(LAUGHS)
"Oh, who doesn't, mate, eh?"
(LAUGHS)
"Was he a friend of yours, Malcolm?"
"Was he a friend of yours, Malcolm?"
"Oh, me and Don had a lot of respect for each other, yeah."
"Oh, me and Don had a lot of respect for each other, yeah."
Don have any enemies?
Lot of people hate politicians.
Don have any enemies?
Lot of people hate politicians.

I was.
Now I'm back.
I was.
"Yes, of course I do."
Humphrey.
Where's your mind?
"You know, I know it sounds crazy, but I actually kind of miss high school."
I miss Blair Waldorf and her daily ego demolitions Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch.
"Even Chuck Bass, who'd get so close to talk."
"Wow, you miss Chuck Bass."
"Well, not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass."
"But, yeah, I think it's safe to say that the nostalgia has officially begun."
"Apparently, the Upper East Side feels the same about you."
"What's up, Dan?"
Vanessa.
Shouldn't you be giving the deputy mayor her coffee?
"Well, I think she'd rather I gave her something else."
"- Yeah, she made a pass at me."
- God.
Is she hot?
"- Actually, yeah, she is."
- You're both disgusting.
"You know, I don't wanna be the guy Gossip Girl made me out to be."
"So, what are you gonna do?"
Go backpacking.
- If you'll have me.
"- Well, it's too late."
- I'm-
- I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
Who?
- That's me.
- Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time, Melissa and I."
"Oh, really?"
- Because two words.
Bloody Mary.
"That's just an urban legend though, right?"
- Of course it isn't.
- Shadows have power you let this thing speak and there is no telling what could happen.
Pete was playing ping-pong with one of those things.
Weren't you supposed to go pull files or something?
Thank you.
- And pull anything from Studio 54.
- Got it.
- 54.
- Heard you.
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Sure.
"- I haven't lost a penny, Mom."
- Myka with you?
"No, she's downstairs on the Whitmans."
I'm getting ready to search their room.
What's up?
How's your radar?
You mean am I having a vibe or something?
Give it a second.
Anything out of the ordinary?
- Anything at all.
- With Myka?
With anything.
"You know, now that you mention it, there is something."
- What?
- The buffet is overpriced.
- Other than that?
- Nope.
No vibe.
"- Well, it's about time."
Get me to that barricade.
"Thanks, Rocky."
This is Paige Grunion with Channel 17 Hard-core News.
I am coming to you live on the shoulder of the 5 Freeway.
And standing here with me are Will and Dale.
They are the drivers of the green monster van.
"- Tell me, gentlemen..."
- Monster truck.
Monster truck.
What possessed you to take such radical and desperate measures... to stop the BMWyourselves?
Oh!
Dude!
We are just doing our duty as Americans.
"Right, Will?"
That's right.
And that's not the first time we've had to take matters into our own hands.
"Mark my words, they'll be pulling over soon."
We really scared them.
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
- Did you see the look on their faces?
- Sure did.
- Whoa!
- And we'd be happy to tell anyone about it.
Anyone.
- Anytime!

- Better call Saul
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
You are under arrest.
I'd better call Saul!
Hi.
I'm Saul Goodman.
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!"
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, I know."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
You want to take a swing?
Do it.
Nothing would make me happier.
Just want you to move your truck.
What was I thinking?
"You only beat women, right?"
Listen...
"You're not paying for a double, and even if you... even if you were, it wouldn't include Crazy Horse over there."
That's a whole other deal entirely.
- I'm trying...
- You're not trying hard enough.
"Get rid of him soon, or this doesn't happen."
He left New Haven an hour ago.
He'll be here.
"Yeah, well, I'm just saying."
"No, you're just worrying."
Hmm.
Where else is he going to go
- with a Geiger counter?
- Huh.
[phone rings]
"Hi, Julia."
I did what you asked.
I got him to the restaurant and made sure he was facing the door.
Thank you.
"Look, I know how tough this is for you."
Tough?
This is...
This is tough?
"No matter how this goes down, I lose."
"You get that, don't you?"
"If you're right, the father of my son is nothing better than a con man."
What's she doing here?
I have no idea.
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
What is she doing?
Lately she just likes hanging out here.
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?
"Well, no, she's way too emotional."
"And by emotional, I mean crazy!"
That's just my Chinese food.
She has food delivered here?
"Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy."
I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
"Open the champagne, and I will be right back."
-I've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?
Please start drinking.
-I'm just gonna grab the phone.
"-Rachel, wait."
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?
No.
"Ross is too nice to say it, but this is his apartment."
"We need boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place."
"But, Mona, I live here."
Happy Valentine's Day!
"Or, something to remember me by."
-How long has it been this time?
Saiba.
We buried their warriors so the Paathars sent women?
It's a woman who shall kill Jilaan.
Muraakis give only one chance.
"This full moon night, we shall conquer Paatharghat."
"Conquer me, and you conquer Paatharghat."
Who are you?
Doom.
"Barbaric Muraaki, you have never been this close to a woman, have you?"
Get lost.
I've come to kill you.
You will have to defeat me to win me over.
Show me your face.
Why do you need to see my face to fight with me?
I need a reason to fight.
Then lower your gaze.
Why?
Saiba's beauty is like the sun...
It's wise to lower your gaze.
You got a reason to fight.
Now do you have the courage to fight?
Just her and me.
Jungle Trap.
This is your Paathar's dense jungle.
A huge tree at the end.
And a dagger on the top.
The first one to get the dagger gets to draw blood.
"If I draw your blood, you give up on Paathar."
And what if I draw yours?
My Ghat will belong to you and so will I.
Jungle Trap.
"One hundred paths, One hundred wrong ones."
- No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, Doctor!"
"- Your medication, Miss Porter."
"- Thank you, Gunther."
"- What book are you reading, miss?"
"- Oh, it's Edgar Allan Poe."
- Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"- The tales may be dark, I know what you're saying, but... through them, he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he... holds up a mirror to our own lives."
- You're a very thoughtful woman.
"- Thank you, Gunther."
- If you ever need anything ever you just let me know.
- Ah!
- Isabel.
"- Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
- Calm yourself.
"- Oh, thank God."
There's a man in there!
There's blood everywhere!
I...
I just...
- Dr. Lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"- I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
- Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
- No.
I'm sorry.
You bought stock with a bad check.
That's fraud.
People go to prison for things like that.
Never mind the sermon.
Have you got the check?
Let's talk about a better arrangement.
Alright.
Call your shots.
And so I can.
I'm now your junior partner.
An interest in the business to be mutually agreed on.
What if I say no?
Then you don't get the check.
You've got a deal.
It's lucky the bank teller was a girl I've known for several years.
"You know, a man called Thornston Weblin once said business is the art of getting something for nothing."
Yes?
Hello.
Is Mr. Sabourin here?
"Yes, he is, madam."
I'm Mrs. Ryan.
He's expecting me.
"You know, the only thing I don't like about this painting is the face."
"Oh, well, we'll have the face changed for you."
Hello.
Hello.
This is Miss Howell of the real estate office.
Mrs. Ryan.
How do you do?
What is this all about?
"I'm buying this house, if you approve."
Louis XIV?
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
I want to protect him.
Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm gonna need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
"All photos, now."
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
(LAUGHING) Or what?
You gonna kill me?
Mmm-hmm.
(YELLING IN DISTANCE)
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
We're heading out soon.
Once they've juiced themselves up for the night.
(YELLING IN ARABIC) (GUNSHOTS FIRING)
That's him.
"That's the one we kill, no matter what."
(CONTINUES YELLING IN ARABIC)
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)
(YELLING)
Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
I thought you were gonna steer clear and let me do my job.
"Well, maybe I'm not satisfied with the job you're doing, Gibbs."
"It's not about me, and you know that."
I'm not just gonna stand by and let you grill him about something that happened 16 years ago.
"He lied to me, Leon."
"What's more important is, you let him."
That's not true.
His records were sealed.
It still matters.
"I told you, it was complicated."
More than complicated.
Why the kid gloves?
Stand down.
Michael was eight when Jackie and I met.
Both parents passed away.
Kid was struggling.
I filled a void.
I tried to steer him right.
"Leon, it's tough taking things like that on."
"Yeah, and it wasn't always easy."
"But I got him into private school,"
I got him into counseling.
"He was lost for a long time, Gibbs, and now he's finally finding his way."
The last thing he needs is people giving up on him.
- People like you.
- Yeah.
I've come a long way with him.
I'm not about to give up on him now.
Gibbs.
"Yeah, Abby, I'm on my way."
"Talk to me, Abbs."
Hi-- wow.
"-What's she got, anyway?"
"She's afflicted with a complaint, you know, a female-dog type of thing."
What's the full-court press on Santini about?
They got mail service now.
-What did you get off toxicology?
-This girl was a suicide.
"Trace amounts of narcotics in her system, not enough to stupefy anyone..."
... letaloneajunkie.
She pulled the bag over her head.
"Otherwise, we'd have found signs of struggle, resistance."
-The mutt from her apartment?
-Yeah.
-She's as much of a mess as that girl.
"-Hey, you ain't exactly Clark Gable."
"-John, what did the M.E. say?"
"-Suicide, Mike."
"-l told you I was clean, right?"
"-Yeah, you did."
"That's right, I did."
"Yeah, squeaky clean, Roberts."
LAURA:
"Yeah, thanks, I'll see you upstairs."
"Hey, congratulations on that Garcia homicide."
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
I was flat wrong about that.
-l didn't have my crystal ball.
-You were dead right.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad it worked out."
Nice job.
Thank you.
-Think that got you out of the woods?
That's great.
What are you going to do... break every lamp in the house?
No.
Take the bulbs out.
You need some light?
You creep.
- Just lay down!
- No!
Listen to me!
"You want to be raped... strangled, and drowned in a bath of your own blood?"
If you want to keep your ass alive... you're gonna have to help me.
You better be strong.
Strong like you?
Let go!
Don't test me.
Why did you come here?
You better get some sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
I got to go.
"Someday that dam you built's going to break, detective."
What you got there?
Soap.
It's from the hospital.
"Surgical, antibacterial."
"She saw him there last night, right?"
She smells the same weird soap.
So you're going to bring her in... for a detergical lineup... like some kind of goddamn commercial?
What the hell are you doing?
Anyone at the Byzantine churches recognize the drawing?
"Hallstrom, Crowe's on 501."
Joe.
Hallstrom.
they tried eminent domain then screwing with our water.
somebody poisoned our dogs.
those trucks...
Who knows.
Maybe.
look at 'em.
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains shucking their cloned-up super corn.
too.
Why do people eat it?
They don't.
They drink it.
Corn syrup.
It's in those drinks that everyone's having... whatever.
Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day.
Mine still are.
Those are for breakaway roping.
Those are for barrel racing and right here is for pole bending.
third place.
but my dad makes me.
Do you want to listen?
Do you like it?
you can take it for tonight and I'll get it back from you in the morning.
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.
Should hold it.
Yeah.
Till next time.
Thanks.
how long has your girl been like that?
Huh?
Mute.
since the beginning.
Mmm.
One must be careful.
I check everyone who get into my car.
But with you there's no doubt.
Married?
-Yes.
Is your wife waiting there?
No.
Well...
We're going to my friend's place.
That's good.
It has a great ambience.
It's separated.
In the middle of the field.
I congratulate you.
You're a lucky man.
And why isn't your wife coming?
"Actually, we've been living separated for a long time."
Now that's a coincidence.
Give me five!
I'm separated too.
Watch out!
Don't be afraid.
I know these roads by heart.
How long has it been from your separation?
I'm free since 3 years ago.
Excuse me for talking like this but to me it was like freedom.
My wife thought I'd discuss who keeps the children.
I told her she could keep them forever.
I've never seen any of them since then.
Good God!
"What an ease, what a beautiful life!"
There was a moment... in which I thought of killing her.
"Yeah, wrap it up."
"-Get the fuck out the car, bitch!"
"-Motherfucker, you know who I am?"
Who the fuck is this?
You know who the fuck I'm with?
"You ain't no fucking cop, that's for sure."
-The fuck you going to do with that?
-Stick it up your mother's twat!
Goddamn it!
What?
Little piece of shit.
"The cork, it got stuck in the bottle."
Homemade crap.
That somebody cared enough about to carry all the way from the old country for you.
What a fucking week.
"I talked to Ronnie, asked her if she's even heard from Ralph."
Little fucking kid's got a respiratory infection now.
"She just heard about Pie-O-My, she's sick about it."
Hello?
We're talking about Justin here.
"Sorry, I was thinking about my mother, her skin condition."
"Oh, my God."
Did I forget to take that out?
What's wrong with you?
"Really, Ma."
Dad's right.
It's not a bad drive.
It's interstate up to Boston.
"If you don't want to accompany me,fine."
Your sister can come up from Florida.
"Come on, she's not going to do that."
Of course I'll go.
There may be some tools we can use.
"Okay, I'll try to reach it."
"There'll be a phone line as well, I heard the main house."
"Probably a burglar alarm too, so we need to... we need to get the police here if we can Okay, how're you doing?"
You okay?
"Better than you, babe."
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
You think Chris could have sent the postcard?
I don't know.
Maybe.
"But really, I-I-I don't know."
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Of course.
Might get a little hairy.
I don't want you getting any ideas.
Absolutely not.
I just wanna get through this.
We all do.
Good man.
Luke.
"None of us sent the card, Justin."
Seriously... this hasn't gone too far.
"You can just set us free, walk away."
No one will talk.
You have my word.
Here's the deal...
Someone owns up to sending the postcard
- I let you all go.
- And if no one owns up?
"- Well then, we play Truth or Dare."
"- You're full of shit, man."
"So, you get along with your mom ?"
"You know, you all tight and shit ?"
Yeah.
"We got along, tight and shit."
-How come you never talk about her ?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.
It's because you don't talk about her.
What do you want me to do ?
"I don't know, just say something about her."
"I mean, you don't say anything about her."
"Well, she's dead."
"God, what do you want me to do,"
-run through the streets screaming ?
-lf it helps.
"Well, it won't, so drop it."
Didn 't mean to press you about your mom.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
Get along with your dad ?
Y'all tight and shit ?
"Yeah, we're both tight and shit."
Our DNA matches.
- [ Sara ] What is this place ?
"- Well, in a few months, it'll be Club Med for the homeless, but right now... just an old furniture spot I used to work at last summer."
"Hop, step, back."
Okay ?
"Real simple, do it with me, right ?"
Try it one more time.
"Add on the next part after that, all right ?"
"Six, seven, eight."
"Step, back, break, spin, out, up, step."
Chilly on that ?
I will have to do something.
"- No, brother."
We have lost everything.
AII we have got is you.
"If anything happens to you, then where will we go?"
With whose support will we live?
"Sometimes I feel, you all have the same.."
..mother but you and your brothers are so different!
This is the difference between family and strangers.
Some family members become strangers..
..and some strangers become ourfamiIy.
Like our Krishna.
Wonder where he will be.
What must he be doing?
You all are looking for me and I..
..I was waiting for you all over here.
Is it so?
"Keep this in your pocket, Peter."
Now I will open this lock only after..
Take this.
Hey.. hey what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey..
No!
-Who is it?
Who is it?
Oh!
Brother..
"I beg of you, I appeal to you.."
..if you want I can even take you to a doctor.
But I swear you should stop having these dreams.

Why don't I pack us a picnic lunch?
This is the kind of a day to play hooky.
I've already thought of that.
Good.
But I'm on my way to pick up Nancy.
"There was a washout last night, and the train's been stalled about five miles out of town."
Oh.
"Well, I guess a big railroad like that can get her here safely."
"Probably, but I..."
I did promise to pick her up.
"All right, I'll go with you."
"No, but I promised her, I..."
Unless I'm in the way.
"Oh, no."
"No, you're not in the way."

What happened in Los Angeles?

Do I have the job?
Well why not?
"Twins after all, double the slob."
Temporary secondment to bake the productions.
No screen credit.
Ministry wages.
I need more.
I could throw in less.
I need more than Ministry wages.
I'll talk to Baker.

He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
"You can't work 24 hours a day, you know."
"In another 24 hours, my time will be up."
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
"Get it up, hurry up."
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.

"How's he doing, doctor?"
"Malik, we need heated saline IVs."
Warm up half a dozen to 106 degrees.
"Wendy, get heated blankets and a mattress."
"Jerry, tell Benton we may need him down here."
- Heated peritoneal lavage?
"- Yeah, that's right."
"Come on, let's go!"
Can you warm him up now?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
- Why's the monitor doing that?
- He's got runs of abnormal heartbeats.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stabilize his rhythm.
Come on.
He's in V-fib!
- Come on.
"- What are those paddles for, Dr. Ross?"
Stabilize his beat.
They didn 't charge the battery!

- God!
To write me an introduction or two.
You're not exactly inspiring me to send you away.
"What if I offered to stay here at the castle,"

At your beck and call?
You'd have diane.
"I'd have my station,"
My position.
Find me a rich noble
"Who treats me right,"
"And I'll treat you right, as well."
You've learned many skills at court.
Teach me more.
One suitor a week until I choose.
Agreed?
Agreed.
No.
No more.
I'm in charge now.
Have you found my mother?
"I need her now, more than ever."
They said she's with the king.
Trying to wring more out of henry
"Before I'm married to anyone, no doubt."
But who will you marry?
Have you spoken with bash?
No.
Francis?
Catherine:
Could we have a moment?
What an eventful day.
"Francis's return,"
Bosnia.
1995.
"The general-- remember, I told you about him?"
The warlord that you had to shoot.
You saved a lot of lives doing that.
I killed him...
"I, uh..."
I killed him right in front of his own son.
He's got allies and family.
This is about revenge.
"You-you can't know that, Booth."
It was just one X-ray.
"I mean, Aldo knew that I was the shooter."
He killed himself so he wouldn't have to give me up.
That's one possibility.
There are others.
"It's the only thing that makes sense, Bones."
"And whoever this is, they're not gonna stop until..."
What should we do?
Just be ready.

Why am I the one under arrest?
She's the one who attacked me.
He's a trophy keeper.
All I'm asking for is the code to the lock on DeBray's apartment.
These could be trophies he took from the first five victims.
Okay.
He's got a thing about... clowns.
That's okay.
Lots of people are afraid of clowns.
"Oh, no, no."
He's not afraid of them.
He likes them.
Like a fetish?
"[Sighs] Oh, good Lord."
I-I haven't verified it yet.
I still have to speak with one of his exes.
Okay.
"Keep me posted, will you?"
"Ryan, that is excellent."
Thank you.
"Now, just hold off on giving it to LAPD just until morning."
We have a plan to expose who's behind this.
[Sighs] Or get ourselves killed.
Having second thoughts?
About having a ménage with a trophy-taking serial killer?
No!
What could possibly go wrong?
"Look, this the murder weapon."
All you have to do is distract Austin long enough for me to find this knife.
Let's just hope we don't find it in one of our backs.
Right.
[Alarm beeping] Oh.

Wow.
Ooh.
Sorry.

We made a huge mistake.
"Hi, dreamboat."
I'm not talkin' to you.
Skeets.
(DOOR CLOSING)
"You want to see me, Aunt Nancy?"
"Well, yes, Willy."
I...
I wanted to have a little talk with you.
Uh-huh.
(CLEARING THROAT)
"I'm rather worried about you, Willy."
Did I do somethin' wrong?
"Oh, no, no."
I don't think so.
"Oh, no, I'm sure not."
"Well, I..."
"Uh, what I mean to say is, well, I don't think you know very much about girls, do you?"
I wouldn't want you to get into trouble.
What kind of trouble?
"It's difficult to explain, but..."
"Well, some people are born girls, and some people are born boys."
I'm glad.
It makes it so much nicer for dancing.
Yes.
"What I'm trying to say, Willy, is that girls are usually more mature than boys."
You have to be careful.
"Oh, you're talkin' about the birds and the bees."
I'm talking about you kissing Skeets in the park.
"Well, can you explain that?"
Not in one afternoon.
"Well, now, it's..."
It's perfectly all right for little girls and little boys to kiss.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, what could possibly make you upset in a paradise like this, right?"
"He could find a way, trust me."
But stick around.
He shouldn't be that long.
"Besides, seeing you will make him feel better."
"Ah, well, I doubt that."
- You got that whole lease thing.
"- Right, right, right."
"Welcome, Kisan."
"I'm Charles Greane, assistant general manager."
- Great to have you.
- Indeed.
Appreciate it.
"What up, man?"
You ready to make us look good?
"Yeah, man, better than you already look."
- And you a handsome man.
- ( chuckles ) My dude.
"Hey, hey, hey."
You dandelions gonna run some drills or you gonna stand there circle jerking?
"Man, I was born to run, Coach."
You know that.
- My man make you say Bo looks slow.

Why are we still talking?
You should be running.
Lace them the fuck up.
"Come on, I'll show you the locker room."
Let's go.
- Right.
- ( phone buzzing )
"I was shocked too, though."
We're very sorry.
Not at all.
No problem.
So why my computer?
There's this...
This what?
"Amazing stuff, ...you've got here!"
He's sucking up.
Dead right.
Top of the line.
Must be expensive?
"To buy, yes."
But I rent.
"Not including the special stuff, it's about a million a year."
A million!
I invented some stuff in high school.
"Royalties from that... and these games, ...bring in quite a lot."
Know this?
Did you make
The Last Legend?
Just the basic program.
That and Craps and Rappies...
Are they well-known?
Don't you know?
So what are you researching now?
Tempo-spatial applications of gravitational physics.
Or put simply...
Don't laugh.
A time machine.
There's already a way to leap to the future.
Liquid nitrogen.
"Wayne, Sherry was here when it happened, but she told me not to tell the police."
"Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly what happened over there, all right?"
We were talking with Alan.
"He got excited, then he started to gasp for air."
He gets angina.
"So you called 911, right?"
"No, no."
I-I tried to give him his medication.
What do you mean you tried?
Sherry stopped me.
"I went to help Alan, but she grabbed my arm."
I just stood there.
"I-I couldn't, I couldn't move."
I...
I...
"- I killed him, Wayne."
"- Shh, shh, shh."
"All right, listen to me carefully, all right?"
I killed him.
"Call Alan's lawyer, and do not say anything, anything to anyone until he gets there."
You understand me?
"Wayne, could you come down here and help me?"
"No, and please don't call me."
"I will help you, Julia, I will, but for right now I have to keep my distance, I'm sorry."
"Excuse me, coming through."
"- Let's move, right here."
"- Okay, swing it."
"Come on, come on, let's go!"
"One, two, three."
Carotid's been lacerated.
Start a twilight drip.
"Yes, doctor."
I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom.
To get some aspirin... and I happened.
To look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... }where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
Denver 9.
99 they will die.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
Help!
"Over here, Indy!"
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move it!
Help me!
You can't do this to me!
I'm an American!
Indy!
Indiana Jones!
"Help me, Jones!"
Jones!
Marion!
Indy!
Marion...
Dr. Jones.
You looking for me?
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other."
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Why did you take so long?
I have been expecting you.
I will explain...
I will explain the reason for my visit.
Reasons do not matter.
I only want you to answer some questions about...
It will be best for you to ask nothing.
Can you pour me a drink?
a...drink?
Double?
If you like.
Double.
I only want you to answer one question.
Would you like it if I told you...that I like you?
What do you know about her?
"Oh, you are refering to the murdered girl."
The same.
I know many things.
Tell me.
"I know she was a model, who came to a swimsuit designer's convention."
What else.
And that she was murdered.
The only thing I don't know is who did it.
Are you satisfied?
"No, I am not."
"Surely, you will be."
S.O.S.
he is in the elevator.
its stoped on the second floor.
"Open up, Laura."
Need something?
I want some info on the murdered girl.
- It's a nice word for titties.
- Where's Mom?
- What doyou mean?
What do you think she's doing right now?
I don't know.
Screwing her new boyfriend probably.
- I think she's buying us presents.
"- Yeah, Robby."
Right now she's probably buying us each a car!
- It's a man.
- I think it's a woman.
I can tell it is.
What should wewrite?
"""I have a big wiener""?"
I want to poop back and forth.
What?
What does that mean?
"Like, I'll poop into her butt hole... and then she'll poop it back... into my butt hole."
And then we'll just keep doing it back and forth... with the same poop.
"Oh, my God."
I'm going to put that!
"""I want to poop... back and forth."""
"Oh, God."
"She's gonna think we're a crazy, perverted person."
- Ooh!
She thinks we're crazy!
"- No, tell her like how I said it."
"No, she'll never write back."
"We have to sound like we're a man, you know?"
That's just lame.
It's stupid.
"But you said I could do half, and you've done all of them before this."
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
"Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine."
"If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole."
"That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit."
Get off my beach!
"Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you."
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
"- The only ""butt"" I wanna see is yours... walking away."
"Come on, son."
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
"Now, where was I?"
- Right here.
"- Oh, yeah."
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
BRYAN:
"I don't know, but it sure is ugly."
ERIK:
"No, Pa."
This is so unfair.
[SINGING] After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
BRYAN:
- Luise?
Want a drink?
"- Yes, of course."
"Mark, stop it."
Stop.
- What are you doing?
- I feel like playing.
I am not in the mood.
If you fuck me the others will respect you again.
- What do you mean?
- You stopped talking to Vanessa.
When she had to move to Virum.
Just like you.
And where is she now?
Leave me alone.
Fuck off back to Virum.
POWER
"Power means being able to do what I want,   when I want, the way I want."
If something goes wrong like assault or other crime   our parents have the power and money to hush it up.
Nobody would dare say anything to me or tell me off.
Or tell me what to do.
Girls and boys look up to you and want to know you.
You can choose who you want to talk to.
Being in the group I'm in...
People know you are not...
I can provide all the stuff people dream of.
All the people who do ordinary 9 to 5 jobs   dream of living my kind of life.
I need something from my jacket.
The orange one.
This one?
"Hi, Hanne."
- We're leaving.
Twenty-four!
"- Punishment completed, sir."
- Cut him down.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Cut him down.

Turn forward!
Dismissed!

"- Well done, Dawlish."
"""Corsica, Leghorn, last remaining British bases."" Message ends."
- Acknowledge.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Grave news, sir."
Napoleon's overrunning Italy.
Spain will be on his side.
- I presume you want to put in here.
- Nothing changed our orders...
"- No, but since..."
...which are to proceed to Corsica.
Set the t'gallants.
"Take over the watch, Mr. Ponsonby."
Sir.
- We should return to Gibraltar.
- Have you set the t'gallants?
"- No, not yet, sir."
- Why not?
"If we go to Corsica, we may sail into a trap."
- I have my orders.
"- Yes, sir to join Admiral Jarvis, who may not be there."
- Brandon Mayhew.
- Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
- I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home, like the rest of us with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man!"
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Ok.
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
And a felony quantity.
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
"The cops around here are like butchers, always got their thumbs on the scales."
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm going to get you a second phone call.
"You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader, and they're going to deliver me a check for $4,650."
I'll write that down on the back of my business card.

How do you feel about the L.I.E.?
I hate the L.I.E.
Take the Grand Central.
Catch it at Astoria Boulevard.
"Go ahead, I'll show you."
Santos was a good cop.
You're doing a vile thing.
It's wrong to blame a dead cop and steal a widow's rights.
You keep saying that.
Nobody's doing anything.
You've got all the answers.
Don't even have the questions yet.
"Well, I got a question for you."
You hungry?
Swing by that diner up there.
The North Star.
Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City.
Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches?
Who we going to meet here?
What are you talking about?
You surface in front of my car at the cemetery.
You show just enough leg so I'd stop.
And the Grand Central is the long way around.
Who we going to meet?
Albert Holly.
He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation.

"Ted, change of plans."
You left her with Barney?
"Ted, will you take it easy?"
I'm your bro.
You're an animal.
"And even though our bro-lationship has suffered its setbacks in this area,"
I assure you I will be the perfect gentleman.
Oh.
Thanks.
"By the way, I really like those overalls."
You have 10 minutes to get down here or the window's closing.
- 10 minutes?
- How long has it been since you saw them?
Almost four years.
A beer?
"- No, I have to...."
- All the others went into town.
"A beer in the canteen, just the two of us."
Is that a date?
We can call it that if it helps.
- It helps.
- Good.
Cheers!
Thank you guys.
"Didn't think we'd let you get away that easily, did you?"
Skinnarland sends his love.
Apparently they're in trouble with the police chief who's threatening to blow their covers.
So you are going to be very busy.
Keep your backs straight.
One-two-three...
Good.
Thanks.
- Einar reports good weather in the area.
- Good.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
The war should be over in a couple of months.
I might pop over and see you myself.
"- Good luck, Tronstad."
- Thank you.
Well...
See you soon.
Good luck.
Leif Tronstad never reunited with his family.
Only if you believe it is.
Sometimes I believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
"However, just at the moment, you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky."

"Two, and a cake that can make you grow."
"So, my old foe, we meet on the battlefield once again."
We've never met.

I'm doing the work of two people until they can hire someone else.
"Speaking of which, guess who's on the search committee for the new principal?"
- Who?
- Timothy.
"That seems complicated, doesn't it?"
"Listen, I know that  we could use the money, but, um, do you really want to be principal?"
"It seems like it's a lot of work, and you are pregnant."
You know?
"Is it really the right time for this, right now?"
"No, you're right, it's a terrible time."
"But jobs like this don't come along very often, especially ones where I have the inside track."
"So yeah, I want it."
And I don't want Timothy to ruin it for me.
I got it.
- Hey.
"- Hey, come on in."
"- Hey, Mike."
- Hi.
What's up?
"Uh, just work stuff."
Can I talk to you for a sec?
"I've got some ""work stuff"" of my own to finish."
We pay these guys for that?
Okay.
"Now follow- Who is that, Marguerite?"
Follow Marguerite backwards until we see where she got that tray.
Keep going.
Keep going.
'Cause we want to see where that top chip in the far left column came from.
Okay.
Give me the casino angle.
Boom!
Let's see what we got on her.
"And while you're at it, give me Bella Petto, south deck about 11:00."
"Go tight on the topless chick near the middle, in the black bikini bottom."
"She's good, but about 1:30... got two blondes putting oil on each other."
Got it bookmarked.

I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."

How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl with severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of Argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
-Yes!
-Why?
Because...
He's evil.

I do pray God that it is not the case.

So Samuels calls me in his office today.
You know what he wants?
He wants to know if I'm interested in a promotion.

She's down a quart.
"Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!"
- I think he is frightened by my charm.
- I know I am.
- Patcan'tstand her.
- It's a thing she does.
She talks at night.
Talks all day too.
"Howthe hell can you put up with her, John?"
"Well, I'm in love with her."
And she's great in bed.
"Lfa Rockefellercan't become president ofthe United States, then what is the pointof democracy?"
The point ofdemocracy is... that even the son ofa grocer can become president.
"And you came damn close, Dick."
How are you?
"Hi, John."
New York treating you all right?
I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you.
"- You're looking ""happy,"" Rocky."
Give him a little kick in the slats.
Yeah.
Hold on with your thighs.
That's it.
Kind of roll your hips a little.
Roll your hips along with the horse.
You ride good.
"So, I finally got my teaching diploma... and I taught in Cincinnati for a while, and Denver, and..."
"Well, I've been everywhere."
I'm an adventuress.
I thought that was a girl that worked in dance halls.
- No?
- No.
That's a girl who goes on adventures.
How do you figure this day we're having out here?
- An adventure.
- Yeah?
"How do I work into it, this adventure?"
I see a man of the Old West trying to live in the New.
Do you know how raggedy-ass and terrible the Old West really was?
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me... you'll find out just how raggedy-ass it was.
"You love it out here, don't you?"
"Yes, I do."
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.
Two drainages over is a little basin.
Lee is situated on the morning side.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
"Well, I thought maybe."
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Shun-baa.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 1O grand, don't you think?"
LWlhaveitready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
These frightened people to scared to live
But why is it that it is the women who is beaten and tied?
Is there not enough of that in reality?
Plenty of men like being beaten and tied
If it makes people happy is it bad?
I saw your friend Julia being arrested
It's finished except for one thing
I need another figure
Is Paul around?
Paul
Stand next to Julia
Wonderful
My legs are longer than that
My bum is too big
My breasts are a bit small
Mine are too big
My bum is not that shape and the're a different size
What is that bush between my legs?
Near Nagerkoil...
"Hey, I'm driving!"
(Song playing)
Don't be mean.
A kiss is all I asked.
No way.
"Hey, please!"
Just one kiss...
Like this.
I Promise.
- Fraudster
What do you call this?
That was just rehearsal.
The League of Nations will thank you!
"What I said was, how will I benefit?"
The entire human race will be grateful!
That means I won't benefit at all.
"Oh, there's US$500,000 too!"
"US$500,000?"
We'll share it fifty-fifty.
"For the human race, for the world, I will help you."
Come what may!
What do I have to do?
You have to steal a Formula.
Where from?
From Fat Pig's house!
What?
You want me to steal from my boss!
You want me to lose my job?
I'll get my provident fund in 20 years' time!
"Do you want that in 20 days, you will be enjoying California's sunshine."
Inspector!
What is it?
The Commissioner and his family will be going out tomorrow.
He wants you to tighten up security.
No problem.
Tell him to go in peace.
I will take charge personally.
I'll stand guard tonight.
You come as the burglar.
Then we'll be able to get it.
"Over here, get in."
Hurry!
Yoyo looks great.
Beginning to take after me!
honesty is all we ask from those who work for us.
There is no honor in deceit.
Death doesn't frighten you?
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
My business requires a handy man.
Oh yeah?
What are you offering?
What you gave me.
A life.
Do I have to drink that shit?
When do I start?
There you go.
That is dino campanela.
The head of the campanela family.
We believe he was behind the attack.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure about that?
I will be.
What do you want me to do?
You will find what you need under the seat.
"If there is trouble, use it."
There you are.
How are you doing shuji?
"Listen, I heard what happened."
I'm sorry.
If there is anything I can do.
Thank you.
I'm glad you can make this meeting.
"Like I said, anything I can do."
Let's sit.
I want to know why you have ignored our agreement.
"All right, all right."
Then the way I see it is somebody's going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside, your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
He's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
"You don't give us the name of your supplier, you're going nowhere."
"Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary."
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
You cooperating?
Let's start with a name.
He just goes by Heisenberg.
Heisenberg?
How old is Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
Height?
"Average, I guess."
"Medium height, medium weight."
- What color hair?
- No hair.
Dude's balder than you.
1963.
James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine.
1975.
Breaking and entering.
1982.
A few.
Through my dad.
"Look, I spend half my life trying to get people like Cleaver Greene to pay their tax."
How do you think that makes me feel?
This is a chance for me to do some good.
So do it.
Knock 'em dead.
I have to go study.
TV:
"Then let it go, and crouch, and hold."
CLEAVER:
"Morning, folks."
Stretch out the whole body and...
Pica hardly sleeps here.
Just comes to paint and read.
I've no idea what he does with the rest of his time.
"I shouldn't let him stay, really, but he's quiet and he's a gentleman."
"There you go, my lad."
"Come on, boys, out of there."
Finnegan.
She is your teacher!
She's meant to be telling you about Jane Austen.
It is age inappropriate sex!
It's bloody great sex.
"At your age, you should be having exploratory sex with a girl your own age."
And maybe some oral.
"Oh, yuck."
"The damage you are doing to your psyche could be irreparable, darling."
I know.
I'm trained.
"Well, I'm not ending it."
It is immoral!
- But it still works.
- I don't think so.
- And if I sweep the cakes off the table?
Would that help?
"Tilde, we belong to each other."
- Go away.
- Stop it!
- Are you listening to me?
- Go away!
"Tilde, it..."
Let's go home now.
May I look?
- We're not going to make love.
"- No, I just want to look."
"- You may touch them, if you like."
"- No, I just want to look."
- We've never dated anybody else.
- No.
"Remember, when we sat in the old truck   peeling each other's clothes off?"
How old were we?
- Twelve... thirteen.
"- Eleven, I think."
That's pretty advanced for two 11-year-olds.
It's as if the world got bigger with you.
Everything was more fun.
More entertaining.
"If you don't stop shooting up, you'll die."
"No, I won't die."
The drugs are keeping me alive.
"You need to take a break, or you'll die."
You're my break.
It's you.
- There go my kidneys as my sides split
- Up.
"- Yeah, like you're the boss of me."
John Mitchell?
Who's asking?
You're a worryingly easy man to find.
"We assumed you'd be keeping a low profile, and then suddenly your name pops up on a job application."
"Bad move, that."
Sloppy.
Who are you?
Oh.
Richard Hargreaves.
"Oh, right, so all this cloak-and-dagger stuff is to sell me a rug, is it?"
Sarcasm.
How unsurprising.
I'm here on behalf of the Old Ones.
"The, er... the vampire elite."
They've entrusted me as their agent.
- Get out!
- Mm-hm.
Is it true how they live?
"All that hardcore Hammer horror shit, avoiding sunlight, and sleeping in coffins and that?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so impertinent as to ask.
"Well, so, this is what all the fuss was about."
"You know, I expected some... demon."
What do I find?
The last Russell Brand in the shop.
With me.
"No, I'm sorry, pal, I'm not going anywhere."
Oh.
"Oh, I think you are."
it's your uncle bob.
is your mama there?
- no.
"- okay, i got this crazy note from her."
"- we got one, too."
but we haven't opened it yet.
"- hold on a second, buddy."
i got another call.
[cellphone beeps]
"- bob, tim is gone!"
"- marge, just calm down."
"- he's gone, and i have a note here from your crazy sister."
i think she took him.
"- hold on, honey."
"- what? ""hold on""?"
did you not hear what i said?
[cellphone beeps] - bob?
- uncle bob?
"- hey, buddy."
"look, your aunt marge got a note, too."
"i'm gonna come over there, and i'm gonna pick you up, so get ready."
- okay.
"- okay, i'll see you in a second, bud."
- okay. bye-bye.
[cellphone beeps] - bob. bob.
"do you hear me, bob?"
"oh, what i am gonna do that white-trash sister of yours!"
"- honey, calm down."
everything's gonna be just fine.
i will meet you there.
[cellphone beeps]
- bob.
Is everything okay?
"Pete, it's over."
We won.
Wait.
W-What does...
What does that mean?
Lance offered me the cash.
Oh.
Great.
You bet your ass it's great.
"Our con was so good, we got paid in phase 1."
Not bad for first timers.
"Uh, yeah."
We're naturals.
"I mean, technically, Lance won, but... but the important thing is that you got the money back, so that's good."
Hold on.
Hold on.
W...
"What do you mean, Lance won?"
It's called a Jesus con.
We never talked about this?
"A guy lights your house on fire, and then he shows up in the nick of time to put it out, making himself your savior."
A con man's not always after money.
Julia will think he's the hero.
She'll never believe my side.
"But the important thing is you got the money, so..."
What if I turn it down?
Why would you turn it down?
If I do... can we still con him?
"Grandma, let's just think about this for a second."
- A bird in the hand is worth...
- No.
Egate Mcleod Higaki.
- Hyotei.
- Hyotei.
Leave at once.
I will not tolerate this.
Are you troubled?
Sensei.
"Ryoma's going back to America, right?"
Is that alright?
"Whether he wants to leave or not, is not up to us."
"If it depends on him, I guess there's nothing we can do."
Will the participating schools please report to the court now.
It's starting soon.
"Momoshiro that idiot, didn't come in the end."
And so is the chibi.
- Let's go.
- Oh!
Kanto District Meet is about to begin.
Seishun Gakuen and Hyotei Gakuen match is officially begun.
Please exchange your lineup.
"I've waited for a long time, Tezuka."
"Sorry, but we will be the champions."
"I've waited for a long time, Tezuka."
"Sorry, but we will be the champions."
The rules of the matches are one set match and a tie-breaker.
That is all.
"Heard you guys are the ""Golden Pair"" who has some invincible acrobatic double play."
- What double play?
Can Seigaku really do it.
- One set match.
Seigaku's serve.
Play.
Chelsea won!
- Chelsea!
Chelsea!
"Neil, Mr. Malhotra's lawyer has sent this fax."
"If Tisha dies, the Malhotra family gets everything."
The Malhotra family.
Lqbal Chand Malhotra?
Kabir Malhotra's brother... who was disowned by their father.
But why?
I guess he must've been the black sheep.
And it's possible that...
"Kabir didn't help him out, so he must be very upset."
What are you looking for?
Any idea how this red paper and these chemicals are connected?
"No, why?"
Mustard has the same effect on me.
Mustard?
Let's go to Mumbai then.
To see Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
I was going to say the same thing.
See you in 15 minutes.
The ward is upstairs.
Mr. Malhotra is asleep now but you can still see him.
How long has he been here?
Five years.
Stomach cancer.
Last stage.
Has he ever left this place in the past five years?
"This is a sanatorium, Ms. Agnihotri."
Not a jail.
Patients are free to move in and out.
"But, as far as I know, Mr. Malhotra never left this place."
I haven't felt that from you in years.
I'm sorry about that.
"Okay, so now, finally,"
Are you guys gonna get back together?
- I don't know.
- Me either.
- I have no clue.
- Me either.
- It's all new to me.
- Me too.
But look at you.
Look at the way you finish each other's sentences.
"Look how upset you were when she didn't call you back,"
And look how you didn't want him to know that you were back.
Look at all of it.
Can't you see?
This is who you are.
You're mom and dad.
"We are, but we're not alan and elaine anymore."
We're alan and elaine.
I'm glad you stopped by.
Me too.
I'll see you on the strolling path?
Until the strolling path.
"Got to hand it to you, David."
You make one hell of a wingman.
"Thanks, dad."
Where are you going?
To get Rita.
I'm not leaving you here alone with that whore.
Inspired by the events that occurred on social networks.
Jeremy won't be coming.
I cancelled him.
"Neil, it's just a night out, and we need to try new things."
"Yes, but you deserve a better escort than Jeremy."
You deserve the very best.
You were right.
We need to start over.
Like we're meeting for the very first time.
Get out.
Sorry?
I said get out.
"If this is a date, then you shouldn't be in my bedroom when I'm getting dressed."
"Oh, hello."
You must be Grace.
- And you must be?
- Neil.
Neil Truman.
"You're a little early, Neil Truman."
Come on in.
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.
My husband and I bought it a long time ago.
You're married?
Does that shock you?
That a married woman would want to have sex with a stranger?
"Oh, I'm not here to judge."
Only to give you a night of pleasure that you'll never forget.
"Well, we better get started then."
Ahem.
Typically I receive the envelope before we begin the evening.
- The envelope?
He handicapped or something?
We believe he's of Korean descent.
My God.
North Korea and al-Qaeda workin' together.
This is bigger than I thought.
You couldn't wait?
You couldn't fucking wait?
We were about to have all the legal weed we wanted.
"You know, in Amsterdam, where we were going!"
"Thought you could get away with this, huh?"
"You thought that after 9/11 our national security was a joke, huh?"
Well... guess what?
What?
We knew you fuckers would be back.
- Holy shit!
"- But we're Americans, man."
- We love America.
We love America!
- Very much.
That's a convenient thing to say... after you try and blow up a plane filled with Americans!
- No.
"- No, we didn't do--"
"No, you see, you have the wrong idea."
My idiot friend here brought marijuana...
- on the plane.
"- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Zip it, Hello Kitty."
OK?
I know your operation's funded through drugs.
No.
"This is typical government bullshit, sir. l--"
"- Hey, hey, hey."
Nothing is hidden in here.
And neither can one drink too much.
Sparkle as if you were in our house.
"Enough, what are you doing?"
What they all do.
"We are going, just relax."
-Let it all come out.
-Are you crazy.
"Enough, I feel so ashamed."
"No way, Francesca."
I know that you'll like it.
Can't you feel how wet you are?
"Let yourself go, Francesca."
This is an opportunity to play it for real.
Don't be afraid my love.
I am here.
Where are we going?
Get up Francesca.
Swap places.
We are going to another room.
But as in a mirror it all returned to be seen.
"Apparently... reserved and adaptable, but in reality the whoring of it all."
But seeing Paolo being possessed by another woman made me crazy with jealousy.
But this jealousy also made me cazy with lust and desire.
Yes Paolo!
I am enjoying it!
I like it!
"Me too, Francesca. me too!"
Yes my love
- I do too.
And it was so shameful.
-You were once?
"By the way Miss, did you know that Kayama-san is driving a bus in Ito in Izu?"
Kayama-sensei's doing that?
"Kayama-san was your teacher, right?"
He went from a famous dancer to a bus driver pretty quickly!
We're eating.
Would you mind waiting downstairs?
Sorry.
I'll talk to you later.
Do you think what he said about Kayama-sensei is true?
"Considering the source, I don't know how much stock you should put in the story."
Takao.
What is it?
I haven't seen you in quite a while.
May I?
There's a seat over there.
That's
- I see.
Your mother is on the second floor.
Did you know that?
Wouldn't it be better to stay away from people like Numata?
He's someone whom I've known since I was a student.
"He's helped me out, you know."
Mother!
Don't hang around with Numata.
He's so irritating!
He's trying to stir things up in the family.
That's not something you should say out loud.
He has the hots for you.
Takao!
Father is coming home tomorrow.
He sent me a letter.
Takao.
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen,"
I guess that just about wraps it up.
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
"Well, I know what I've got here."
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know... a drink?
Subtitles resynced by Maza
The poison is still fresh...three days.
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would have killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
"Is this May, 2016?"
Yeah.
You're exactly where you said you'd be.
Do not get on that ship.
"If you do, you're all dead."
Says who?
"Says you, Mr. Rory."
You sent me.
I'm sorry.
Who exactly are you?
My name is Rex Tyler.
I'm a member of the Justice Society of America.
You were huckin' the ball around with your pals the other day...
"Say, uh..."
"What's the deal with your sweetie there, Squirrely Dan?"
"Well, I took her out last night."
- Where to?
- Outs to the chip truck.
- Fries and gravy?
- I had mine with gravy.
She had hers with salts and malts vinegar.
Do you know that salt and malt vinegar's a non-traditional way to dress your French fries in the United States?
What the fuck is wrong with them?
Like malt vinegar is not a staple condiment on tabletops in restaurants in the United States.
"Fuck, figure it out."
That's what I say.
"I say, figure it out."
"Got no vinegars on the tables, no Krafts peanut butters."
- WAYNE:
Figure it out.
- DARYL:
- This is amazing.
- This is the greatest van in the world.
- A lot of good times went down there.
- A lot of mold.
- Yeah.
Lot of memories.
- Joseph Middleton.
"Here's a tidbit nobody knows, including you guys."
Joseph Middleton was my first casting director audition in Los Angeles.
- Really?
- Probably my last.
- Was it for this?
- Because it's offer only after that.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Good one.
- Good one.
- And Aaron Yoo was deathly ill here...
"Oh, my God, yeah."
He could hardly stand up.
"Yeah, poor Aaron showed up for this, just out of the hospital."
He flew into town that morning with stitches in his side.
- He had surgery on his abdomen.
- He looks healthy as a horse but it's just good acting.
- He's doing an amazing job.
"He's in agony right there, right?"
"Like, he can hardly stand."
"- Yeah, we set up, like, a cot for him."
- The deck chair.
"I use the ""we"" term liberally, because it wasn't any of us here."
- Right.
Yeah.
- I brought him Jell-O.
This is history.
Do as you will.
"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...
It's beautiful!
Indy?
"Don't look, Marion!"
Keep your eyes shut!
Marion.
"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you."
And we trust you found the settlement satisfactory.
"Oh, the money's fine."
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen, I guess that just about wraps it up."
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
- Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
"Come on, I'm your older brother."
Ask me.
"Okay, big brother."
Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister?
The red one.
Hey.
"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
So you can keep him till he cheers you up.
I borrow him myself from time to time..
when I get depressed thinking about..
"world hunger, poverty.."
Not to trivialize your pain.
"Thanks so much, Pheebs."
We are gonna have so much fun!
"Oh, not that kind of fun."
Happy Valentine's!
I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable and a bit more slutty.
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
Monica got me porn?
Girl-on-girl porn?
!
She really must love me!
"-Yeah, just relax."
"-I love you, St. Valentine."
"Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty."
Now push!
Come on!
Teach me.
Are you afraid?
You're right.
Because they're all dead.
All my teachers.
-What time is it?
-What?
We go to the club.
"We go to the club, we'll dance."
"There's nothing else to do, we might as well dance."
"Come on let's go, let's go."
-Are you looking for Adrian?
"-Adrian is dead, it's every man for himself."
"I'm delighted to see you, you don't know how it thrills me."
-You're glad?
-Sure I'm baby you're the man.
I love your sexy body.
-You're freaky.
"-Sure I'm baby, freaky for you."
Let's go to my place.
Come on.
Well now that we've had dinner and coffee and everything...
Why don't you take off your jacket and make yourself at home.
I really should update my notes.
"You're absolutely right, now is ""the"" perfect time."
This is gonna be the fuck of your lifetime.
-I got some coke.
-I don't care about that.
I just want you...now.
"Orgasms, wasn't that the subject we were discussing?"
I think that right now I should study the alien.
You have to go.
- Turn around!
You won't hurt him.
You can't.
"- Thank you for teaching me the meaning of pain, Nurse Oaks."
Glad I could return the favour.
- Isabel.
That was quite a performance.
- Hmm.
"- Do you know Hawthorne's ""The Gray Champion""?"
- Yes.
It's the story of a legendary warrior who comes to the aid of those oppressed by tyranny and injustice.
- Yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
This is your finest performance yet.
You... you are The Gray Champion.
- I am The Gray Champion?
"- Yes, this fine institution of..."
"of healing has been overrun with decadence and filth, and... like an avenging angel, you have purified it."
Don't you see?
- This is still part of my treatment.
"- Yes, exactly."
Exactly.
This is all part of my plan.
You and I have purified Rosewood.
Now... you're finally home.
Isabel.
"Isabel, you're healed."
- I'm healed?
- Yes.
Yes.
I found about the courier by hacking into
My father's computer a couple of days ago.
When?
Two days ago.
Then I called you.
When did you hack into his computer?
Sydney.
Two days ago.
Everything I'm telling you
"Is the truth, I swear."
So your father's still alive?
Yes.
And I would do anything
To bring him down.
"(courier:)this is not my fault, da veiga."
You saw me.
I followed instructions.
Somebody compromised our security.
"What, you going to tell the council?"
Obviously one of our dikes needs plugging.
Did you get a good look at
The person with fox and bailey?
I could pick him out a line-up.
Do you want me to go track them down?
[gun shots]
No.
Thank you.
You know what this means?
"Yeah, we're in it up to our eyeballs."
Karen was right.
(syd:)it was coincidence.
(nigel:) was it?
I missed it.
I left him with mama before he was two years old.
So that means I've missed four of his birthdays.
So we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about...
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
"I bet Bonnie would be surprised if she knew she had a half-brother over in nigger town, though."
"You know, you really should have some of our baby's cake."
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
Here.
Goddamn it!
I told you I don't want any.
This what you want?
What are you doing?
"This is what you want, isn't it?"
"Come on, cut it out."
Cut it out.
Cut it out!
Goddamn it!
Why did you ever fuck with me?
"Me and my brother's daddy was white, did you know that?"
"Of course, we never knew him."
He had another family.
But that's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.
"And I guess you figured since I kind of look white, you can fuck me."
What the hell.
I just want to let you know that my confessional is open all week long.
"I'll be there if you need to speak about anything or talk, get things off your mind."
And I um...
I don't mean to have to do this.
It's kind of required.
This is a crisis prevention helpline if you need to talk to somebody about anything.
And this is a poison control.
Probably might need that.
I don't know.
The good news is we have singles night on Tuesdays down in the basement.
We like to dance around.
It's a lot of fun.
I married the church but I dance and look.
"And if anyone has lifestyle changes they might want to reconsider, they can just, oh, come to my office."
"Thank you, Father."
You're welcome.
Thank you.
That's not him.
He's gone.
Let's go see mommy and daddy.
Ok.
"Look, Katie."
It's a bride!
It's a bride!
Come on!
"I'm gonna be a bride one day, too."
This is what my dress is gonna look like.
Like it?
Yes.
Very pretty.
Thanks.
Today's my first communion.
Whoever took that wallet was about the most stupid sneak thief in the world.
Why do you say that?
Because the risks are to great and the reward is too small.
"I always say that if you're going to steal at all, steal in a way that will be admired."
"Let's get out of here, hm?"
Where will we go?
Anywhere.
I know the perfect place.
First time I've ever been in a subway.
What a fascinating experience.
Everybody who comes here wants to ride in the subway.
You'll get over it.
"Say, what about those abc's you were telling me about?"
We'll get to that.
This is where I live.
What kind of a district is this?
See for yourself.
You know Park Avenue is only three blocks away?
But I'll never make it.
"You know, I think I'm gonna like you."
You won't tire my mind.
I might wear it out my way.
Go on in.
It's safe.
Thanks.
Fix yourself a drink.
Fix me one too.
What'll you have?
Bourbon.
How?
Straight.
Okay.
Ah.
"Dakers, it was."
I shouldn't think this place was quite her style -- a bit quiet for her.
"She's rather marvelous, isn't she?"
Mm.
She has married again?
LYALL:
"Number five, I think."
POIROT:
"Oh, mon Dieu."
LYALL:
"Looks a bit of a gorilla, doesn't he?"
"An animal attraction, would you think, Mr. Poirot?"
Well...
"Well, well, well, things are looking up."
Hello?
Hello.
"Been looking all over the place for you, little lady."
"Not out fishing today, Major?"
"Yes, earlier."
Didn't have much luck.
"Perhaps, Major Barnes, you were fishing too close to the shore."
I noticed you by the harbor.
I expect you're right.
Too much damn dynamiting going on.
Dynamiting?
The fishermen drop dynamite around here.
Damned lazy beggars.
"The fish, not being fools, keep out at sea."

The first days are different from now.
Serving tea to your husband is work now?
is it the same?
"Yes, but it's not work."
"Whether you make tea or serve it, it's work."
"I serve you tea, it does you good."
But no one takes care of me to help me relax.
I know you're exhausted.
Serving tea is work these days.
Don't take any photos.
I have three jobs.
"I have three jobs, not you."
And the third is the hardest and most important.
Don't take any photos!
- l should have kept it.
- l'll put it away.
- l said no photos.
- All right.
I won't do it again.
Don't men have a third job?
Only women?
We don't?
"If men don't do their third job, they'll be dishonoured."
Their third job weighs as heavily as a mountain.
It's a very hard job to do.
It's not as simple as you think.
is that wrong?
- Mashti Hatam!
- What?
"Come on, come on."
The engineer's forgotten his camera again.
He's as distracted as me.
You're a good man?
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.
"That doesn't make you good and it sure as hell doesn't make you a man, so stop talking."
"Okay, I'm..."
I'm a good man.
"And if you say one more word, I might have to show you what this good man does to people like you."
"Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in that charming bedside manner."
"Trust me, I was reining it in."
He's seizing.
Darren?
I need suction and an airway now.
Your incision is healing well.
"Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry."
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
Yes.
Um... you should probably get some light exercise.
Just go walk around the block or something.
"You know, just get out."
Wow.
"Your... your lips are moving, but your words sound just like Pete's."
"You were in the closet, Violet."
"Look, I'm..."
I'm doing the best I can.
"No, I know you are."
I do.
"Oh, look at that smile."
That's gas.
Sorry to tell you.
"No, it is not gas."
"Right, OK."
Anyone else won't stand for it?
Raise your hand if you won't stand for it.
"That is good to know because we do need to make some redundancies, so you're all fired."
What?
I was stretching!
I will stand for it.
We need to reduce spending pretty urgently.
"I'm afraid it's a case of 'no pain, no grain'."
"Yeah, Prof, the company bought this gold jug for the tournament later."
Mm-hm.
"So we'll need a bit more pain, then."
Sorry.
Let's lose...
the guy with the monobrow and Lena the cleaner.
What?
You can't fire Lena!
Why are you still here?
"End of meeting, everyone back to work."
Apart from those who've been sacked.
You have to go.
Now.
Not even fixed the squeaky door!
"Mmm, fish eggs."
Cor.
Workers united will never be defeated!
The workers united will never be defeated!
"Oh, no, please!"
I'm a worker too!
I'm working very hard here!
Lena's worked here for 45 years.
"So she probably needs a rest, then!"
I give you a toast.
The Confederacy.
"You don't seem very happy over our victory, Mr. Campbell."
He's not.
He wants to kill all the Yankees himself.
[laughter]
- Sounds like a Kentuckian.
- We're all from Kentucky.
"You'll find plenty of action later on, sir."
"But before you go any further South, there's one thing we must teach you."
What's that?
Dixie.
- Sing it.
- May I?
[Innkeeper] Go right ahead.
"Come on, boys, gather 'round."
"♪ Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton Old times there are not forgotten ?"
"♪ Look away, look away Look away, Dixie Land ?"
♪ In Dixie Land where I was born In early on one frosty morn ?
"♪ Look away, look away Look away, Dixie Land ?"
"♪ Then I wish I was in Dixie Away, away ?"
♪ In Dixie Land I'll take my stand To live and die in Dixie ?
"♪ Away, away Away down south in Dixie ?"
"♪ Away, away Away down south in Dixie ?"
"♪ Away, away... ?"
?
Away down south in Dixie ?
"Mr. Campbell, do you have something on your mind?"
I wanna know just one thing.
Do we have to be better Southerners than the Johnny Rebs themselves?
I went pretty far tonight.
But let me tell you this:
"All right, then."
- (Knock) - (Parrot) Come in.
Shut up!
Come in.
(Parrot) Shut Up.
Come in.
"Oh, come in, everyone."
"I've brought Constable Wilson, m'lady."
He's going to perform the ceremony.
"Oh, good."
"Well, now, you stand over here."
That's right.
"Stokes, you're going to be best man."
You stand next to the groom.
"James, you're to give the bride away."
And Ethel and her mother will be the bridesmaids.
"We're the bridesmaids, Mother."
That'll be nice.
What am I?
The congregation.
Right.
"Go and fetch the bride, she's waiting on the landing."
"As soon as you hear the wedding march, come in."
"We don't want it to be too loud, so I've put in a soft needle and stuffed a pair of bloomers down the horn."
"That's the best thing to do, that is."
"This is ridiculous, Mr Twelvetrees."
Do we 'ave to do it?
"Yes, Ivy, we do."
His lordship gave strict instructions to humour Lady Lavender at all times.
Otherwise she might not leave him her money.
"Be quiet, Mabel, and hand me the parrot."
Haven't you got anything religious to put on?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do!
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
"You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now."
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
"Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where's Abner?
Where's Abner?
Abner's dead.
"Marion, I'm sorry."
"Do you know what you did to me, to my life?"
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
"Well, say it again, anyway."
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
You going to give it to me?
Maybe.
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master DeIacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
"Up, quick!"
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
"Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us."
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(men laugh)
only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.
- (baby screams) - (Liszt groans)
"George has gone off, it seems."
- shall we go and look for her?
- Can you walk?
Not presently.
"I wanted a Searider, but my uncle wouldn't pop for it."
Your uncle like boats?
Who?
Paulie?
Paulie wouldn't know a cleaver from a fucking cleat.
"It was my dream, you know."
Free of the goombahs.
Run a charter in the islands.
Eddie was going to help me.
You and Eddie?
That's a strange marriage.
He was only going to find clients.
I'll tell you something.
"If I'd met him earlier, I'd never be in this mess."
If only Tino hadn't whacked Eddie.
Know why he was there that morning?
Santos wasn't there to take Tino down.
He was there to get information on the judge.
How do you know?
I was there that morning.
What information on the judge?
"That you get with $ 10,000 and a plane ticket."
Come up with it by tomorrow.
This meeting is adjourned.
Let us bring you in.
We'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.
"No, thanks."
I got my own Witness Protection Program.
Morning.
The sharks are already circling.
Another Zapatti washed up.
They fished him out of the 79th Street Basin.
"Could, and less for men ..."
Sorry.
It was a joke.
"- Of course you would, right?"
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Immediately.
This is the second glass?
Addons We are ready for the game.
Yes!
Addons Touch the screen to read terms and conditions.
I accept the terms and conditions.
Yes?
- Wait!
- Accept.
Do not read it all.
It is the law.
Conditions ...
Nonsense ...
No one read it.
"Addons you have not read the terms and conditions, want to continue?"
- Yes!
- Why not?
"Addons Please note, that to win the prize,"
Addons game should be played until the end.
"Disruptive Addons every player game, will bear the consequences."
What are the consequences?
Addons By knowing that at all you like confrontation online
"Addons to answer a simple question, profiles connected to each other."
- Dave?
- Yes.
Addons you started.
How you doin'?
"Okay, why don't you just... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here."
Yeah.
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.
- I'm John Klein.
My car broke down...
"- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein."
Two nights ago... at 2:30 in the a.m.
there's a bang on the door.
"I open it up, and here's this guy."
He says he wants to use the phone.
But there's something creepy about him... so I tell him to get lost.
"Last night at 2:30 on the dot, guess who's back."
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?
I am absolutely positive.
it's Mr. Klein.
- Crazy.
This is...
- I am not crazy.
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?
I warned him off my property.
"I used the word ""trespass"", and he still came back."
"You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I had the right to shoot you on my porch."
"He'd have to been inside the house, Gordon."
What?
Fine.
"So tonight I figured the dumb %$# might come back, and sure enough, there he is."
It´s Imposible.
It wasn't me.
I don't know what's happening here.
"Yes, it is."
Hey I'm sorry man I forgot.
You people don't have deserts and this dry heat do take some getting used to.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Mr. Jenkins.
Yeah?
We are busy men.
Me too.
So you do know what we need.
Oh yeah.
Nick you said you have some big stuff you need greased through the boarder.
Yes.
"Well I handle the number three artery into California, the night shift."
I could smuggle through a heard of elephants if I had enough capital.
That's true.
Billy here is the very best.
He's your man.
So what do we move?
So what do we move?
"When the time comes, we'll let you know."
"Sure thing, konnichiwa."
I've been studying.
I might be playing baseball in Tokyo next year.
I'll call you.
"Ok, partner."
All right.
So what do you think?
He was nervous.
"It's a big opportunity, anyone would be."
Are you sure about him?
Absolutely.
- Bye.
Seven and I work at a production company
That cranks crappy reality shows.
Our job is to find and cast
"The quote, unquote talent."
Such as it is.
So just be natural and forget that the camera's even here.
Well I'm very comfortable in front of a camera.
So why don't you tell me how you and Burt met?
I'm sure that's a great story.
We met on the internet.
Now take these two.
"There here for a spot on the upcoming show ""Geezer Town."""
Some people will say or do just about anything to be on TV.
A blue pill a day makes your lady want to stay.
Oh yeah!
Hey Dale
Ohhh...
Seven
There's a call for you on line two.
Oh.
Really?
Um...
I will be back in just a second.
This is Dale Squire.
It's Becca
Can you come pick me up please?
"Yeah, what's wrong?"
"I'm on Doheny and Sunset, make a left."
"Ok, I'll be there in two seconds."
You don't want to leave this in there.
"That was Becca, she was crying."
Your answer?
Echidna?
"Echidna, show me your first letter."
Let's see if you're right.
"Yes, indeed, in the nick of time."
What is an echidna?
It sort of scuttles a bit.
It scuttles a bit?
!
It's a spiny anteater.
That's what I was going to say...
Of course you were!
Of course you were.
It's on the five cent coin.
It's a monotreme isn't it?
"It's a monotreme, an egg-laying mammal."
"Geniuses, I'm surrounded by geniuses."
"OK, where are we so far?"
"Araucarians, you're on one, welcome to the game."
"Lutrophiles, you're racing ahead at the moment with seven."
"You know what's going to happen now, it's going to get a bit harder."
"Because now I'm looking for two answers, and you must spot both to score the point."
"Lutrophiles, are you ready?"
Reveal the hive.
Picasso...
"Picasso's there, is Spain there?"
It might not be.
No.
I don't think it is.
It's not.
Brack?
No.
And the pig's tongue is for you only.
I wanted to fool you!
"I want to take your advantage, so what?"
I won't give it a damn to tell you the truth.
"It's hot, and life is boring,"
"I just want to have fun, isn't it alright?"
That's alright!
"Well, it's OK then."
Why do you stare at me?
"Because of our friendship,"
I'll let you kiss something anyways.
You'd better ask her.
Excuse me.
"Chan Mon-gut, you are a married man, why do you still date me for dinner?"
You'll make me misunderstand something.
Haven't you thought of my feeling?
A smart guy isn't a big shot.
Miss Shiu.
Very simple!
She secretly admires him.
He fooled him.
He wants to kiss her.
You are mad at him.
"I wanna beat you, you know?"
Siu-tso!
Lend it to me.
Miss Shui...
Please wait!
"Miss Shui, it's dark outside, let me show you the way home."
"No, you'd better lend me the lantern."
I'll return it next time.
Next time?
"I've met someone else, Thomas."
Someone else has visited me in hospital.
Who is it?
Does it matter?
"You can stay here, until you find somewhere else."
Who is it?
- Michael.
- Michael?
Whose dad has a factory?
That's neat.
His father has a factory   and then he goes to the asylum and exploits proletarian women.
Neat.
Don't say it's difficult.
We had a deal.
- You promised me that...
"- Honey, go back in."
There's a man in my room.
He has a black slug on his upper lip.
What's he doing here?
"Asger, your woman is shell-shocked."
"No, she's just upset..."
"Honey, Hossein will go with you next time."
I'm not going back to Christiania again.
I'm through with that.
- And I need to smoke less.
- First you show Hossein the routine.
Get dressed.
You are not well.
Are you in pain?
"Are you scared, maybe?"
Hossein has something that will ease the pain.
In Persia they say that opium is good for anything.
What's with your attitude?
You don't think I was worried as well?
What are you doing?
I'll take a taxi.
Why?
Hurry and get in.
I'll be more comfortable in a taxi.
You should go first.
You're trying to avoid me nagging.
Yes.
"Fine, do as you like."
Stop it!
Hurry!
"Listen, just listen, all right?"
All right.
Take a deep breath.
As deep a breath as you can take.
You're so mean.
This is why you woke me up?
"I was right, wasn't I?"
There's no one here.
I was really curious how it would be like under water.
You're such a pervert.
We...
We what?
How will we be living in five years?
How will it be in ten years?
How will our feelings have changed?
What kind of person will you remember me as?
And when will I be able to let you go?
Will I be able to let you go?
"In five years, you'll probably be a father."
Now get ours.
That ship's not taking off without us.
You got that?
- Halt!
"- Oh, please don't shoot!"
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell are you doing
"- out here, lady?"
- I was being held captive.
By Nazis?
"No, worse."
- Your helmet.
- What about it?
I've seen it before.
"Paper, do you have paper?"
Something to write with.
"Lady, I think you're in shock."
Please!
Yeah.
"So if it wasn't Nazis, who were you running from?"
I need your helmet.
Now!
"I'm sorry, my love, but this game is not over yet."
"Despite my wishes to pursue Savage alone, it seems that you're all intent on seeing this thing through till the bitter..."
Oh!
Speaking of bitter.
You knew.
You dropped us off five months later
- because you knew.
- Knew what?
"You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister."
- I'm afraid that that...
Hey!
Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?
Fuck you!
You left it in my tip jar the other night.
Bullshit.
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
I...
"- Cut the crap, Stevie."
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They say that the guy in the photo doesn't exist.
This says he does.
"Trevor, Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about."
I'm talking about your ex!
Ivan.
- Who?
This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.
"Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you."
You're standing next to some fat guy with glasses holding a fish.
That's not me.
"Trevor, it's you."
Look.
You lying whore.
You get the fuck out.
Fucking freak.
You play that fucking well!
You fucking whore!
You fucking freak.
Now I know why you're afraid of doctors.
'Cause you're a fucking psycho!
My ex...
Fucking psycho.
Do you really love him?
"He""s my family."
I just want my family back.
Then go home.
Go home and close your eyes.
This will all play itself out.
"But, Bobbi..."
"There""s nothing I can find out that""s gonna make you feel better."
Knowing the truth will only hurt.
And hurt and hurt some more.
"You""ll end up back where you are... which is still in love with the man you married."
Go home.
"I can""t."
"Get some rest now, Clara, okay?"
"L""ll call you first thing in the morning with my report."
"- Can""t you call me tonight?"
"- Okay, tonight after the dinner."
"Amy, you take her home."
Stay there until you hear from me.
"- No, I""ll call you."
"- No, Clara, you won""t."
"No communication with me when I""m on the job."
"No interference of any kind, or we back off the investigation entirely."
"It""s for our own protection."
Catching somebody in the act of cheating...
"- Well, things can get complicated."
- We understand.
- Thank you.
- Go home.
- Thank you so much.
"- You""re welcome."
"It""s not that simple, Jesse."
What do you need?
--There are no vacancies.
--There are.
--I need a room.
What must I do?
--Give me your passport
--And put a $10 note in the passport?
"--$ No need for the $10 in your passport, citizen."
Then is it $15?
Maybe $20?
"Will you leave on your own, or should I call the police?"
"--Your room key, please --I'm going to the buffet"
The buffet is for the hotel residents only
Why do you all sit on your butts?
"Get up and open the door for me, as you're supposed to"
--Merci!
"Bobylev, this is Vasin."
--Do you live alone?
"--Yes, Pavel Ivanovich"
--May I sleep over at your place?
--With whom?
Hmm...yeah.
Good lad!

(Laughs)
Your moustache...
"Oh, yes, sir."
"I got the creeping alopecia, sir."
"It crept all over my lip, it did, sir."
"Yes, sir."
- Fetch Mrs Ransom.
"- Yes, sir."
I'm sure Mrs Ransom was after local colour for one of her romances.
Local colour is one thing.
Asking a publican for a Mickey Finn is another.
- I don't know Mr Finn.
"- Knock-out drops, sir."
Drugs.
"Oh, my goodness!"

- Good gracious.
- She had been drinking.
"- Oh, never."
"No, Mumsie is totally teetotal."

Masquerading as civilians.

I guess I'll just...
I'll see you at work.
Yeah.
Is this the right decision?
Yeah.
Beth happy about it?
Yeah...
"I dunno, we'll see."
You don't exactly look happy.
Happy?
Happy comes later.
"Right now we're on a 30-day trial basis, kinda like a vacuum cleaner."
- How about the lieutenant?
- What about her?
- Is she OK?
"- What do you want me to say, Kay?"
You want me to say that Beth and I have come to a big understanding?
We haven't.
"Maybe we will, I dunno."
All I know is I gotta try.
"Allie's front tooth is falling out, I'm the tooth fairy, no one else, OK?"
"Zack slides into second base and breaks his collarbone,"
"I take him to the ER, no one else!"
"I remember what it was like when I broke my collarbone, and my dad wasn't there to take me to the hospital."
"The kids are kids, the rest of the people involved are adults, OK?"
All right.
"Just asking you how you are, that's all."
My car should be ready tomorrow.
Thanks... for the ride.
- Annabella?
- Yes.
- Tell me about the gloves.
It's over!
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Let him in.
Thank you.
"No, wait."
Let me talk to her again.
Jenna.
Open up.
Michael's not here.
He's outside with your dad.
Jenna.
Have you got something to say for yourself?
"I don't know, I'm..."
I panicked.
I got scared.
"Well, that's a very compelling argument."
You won't have any trouble convincing her of that.
What the fuck were you thinking?
Did you just get bored?
"- No, I'm just an idiot."
"- On that much, we're agreed."
"I love her, Stephen."
I realize now I love her more than I will ever love anybody else.
Stop talking about love.
Every asshole in the world says he loves somebody.
- It means nothing.
- But it's true.
It still doesn't mean anything.
What you feel only matters to you.
"It's what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters."
It's the only thing that counts.
"And you did do this thing, right?"
"That's why I don't get no mail at my house,"
- I ain't got money in no bank.
- He's got over 40 grand hidden.
"- Maggie, what the fuck?"
!
- Why don't you give Carlos money?
- ¿Tú estás loca?
- As a loan to get back the bodega.
- Maggie!
- This could be a way out of here.
"You heard what he said, he needs that money."
You were gonna give me that money to open my own space.
"Shut the fuck up, you're family."
Carlos isn't family?
He'll pay you back.
"It's my business, I can take care of it, okay?"
People buggin' out around me today.
"Later, bro'."
"You got a big fucking mouth, and I ain't got no money."
Where did you put them?
Where'd you put them?
"I'm tired of your fucking bullshit game, viejo."
Where are my fucking drawings?
Carlos...
I should be the one that would be making the questions here.
How many gallons of milk did you deliver today?
How many cases of aguacate?
Yuca?
- Plátanos?
Café?
- I don't fucking know.
That's what you should be worrying about.
I just had to have some of this chili.
You see?
It's pie.
"No, what Eric's saying is that we put signs up on our highway chatting up our soup and pie."
"You're a real smart young man, Eric."
You think so?
"Why, sure."
"Now, certainly a man of the world like yourself feels more at ease in the big city, but a guy like you could do pretty well in a town like ours."
You think so?
Maybe I will stay for a while.
Really?
"Yeah, you know, good woman, good friends, good pie."
I think I could be happy here for the rest of my life.
Eric.
"Let's see, do you really think you could be happy here?"
"I'm already happy here, Cor."
These people have taken me in.
They've made me feel important.
"Back home, I'm just a loser who didn't get into college, but here,"
I could be king.
"Well, congratulations."
I'll just tell Mom and Dad.
I know they'll be so proud.
I know I am.
I'm the prince of Sprinkle Land.
Hey.
Soup and pie for everybody.
The new guy's buying.
"Oh, man, this is good pie."
I was three hours from home.
Dad!
Cory!
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know, I don't know how to say this."
I...
"You know, the things I deal with you and me don't have much of a..."
"What you might call ""an experiential overlap."""
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen might happen, might not happen."
Fifty years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine.
Okay.
And I came to realise it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So...
Get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"Ten thousand even, same as last time."
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30 44, five each."
Three pounds should be 48 each.
Who's short?
All right.
How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!
"Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that."
But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for the drive."
I had a great time.
It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
You're welcome.
"Hey, listen, listen!"
"If anybody asks you, we was out smashing' mailboxes, OK?"
Wha... what?
"Oh, man, the paint's still wet!"
"No, no, no, no!"
Get out of the store!
Hey!
Don't eat the radial!
"Here, take-a the snow tires."
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?
"- Whoa, boy!"
- Hey!
"Hey, guys!"
There's one goin' this way.
I got it.
"Come here, little tractor, come here."
"Yeah, that's a good tractor."
"No, no, no, no, come here."
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to go wandering off all alone.
What are you doin' with those old racing' tires?
"Come on, Doc, drive."
Look at that.
Another p--pregnant female.
There.
Which cake?
One of those or one of those?
-
"- No, thank you."
I don't think so.
-
- A bit of cream's all over it.
"Really, I only came in looking for French cigarettes."
I don't suppose you have any French cigarettes.
"No, but we have English ones you can s--smoke with a foreign accent!"
-
- I only smoke the French.
-
- Best thing that could happen to them!
I remember a shop like this when I was a child.
"Yes, so do I. This is it!"
-
- It's long since been condemned.
-
"- As a matter of fact, we are on the verge of the same thing ourselves."
-
- Really?
-
- On account of the frats.
-
- The frats?
-
- Yes.
They're everywhere.
I'll start giving her money for him.
Why don't you just give him the money?
Why...
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy?"""
Huh?
I don't see how that would...
"Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be a good idea, would it?"
"I guess that it would be better to just go on and put me in jail, and forget about your 5-year-old son."
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
"Yeah, everything's real cool."
"Uh, where are you calling from?"
"Okay, what's the name of the gas station?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Ray, you already missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
Mmm-hmm.
"Uh, there's..."
"You turn right at this place called ""Cothern's Bait Shop."""
"Yeah, there's a little road there."
"Yeah, you're not far, baby."
Just about 10 minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
(ENGINE STARTING)
"Is that the road, Byron?"
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
"Lila, when they get here, I want you to get them inside the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, wave at them, talk to them, just let them see everything's okay."
- You mean the Veterinarian man?
"- Yeah, that guy."
I don't get it.
He sleeps with his patients.
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff
Why is that funny?
Back home we've puppy dogs and kitty cats.
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it partner, there are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share."
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.
"- I got a good one for you, Violet."
- Lay it on me!
"Oh, damn!"
- What?
- I think I forgot it.
"Well that's the good thing, Daze."
I'll be here if it comes back to you
"Ten, Nine, Eight."
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinkin' that, since how you're 18 and all and you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meals, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
How can I drink?
"Want me to attend to you, eh?"
"No, I didn't mean that"
"Never mind, let me do it!"
How's that?
T aste good?
"Well, the taste is a bit strange"
That's the water I've just used to wash my feet
T ake some more!
No!
It's good for your body!
Gao Jian!
Big Brother!
Go!
Master wants to dispose you of your vital energy
What?
Dispose my vital energy?
We've today all the heroes from close and afar
I appreciate all your bravery and uprightness
It's our honor to attend to your call
We are more than willing to obey!
Thank you!
Thank you!
As long as we can get rid of the Three Devils
Please use us as you see fit!
"Y es, yes!"
May we have your good advice?
I won't dare!
Please take your seat
"Everybody knows that Y an Qingwang, Zhou Sanzhao"
Fan San are the parasites of our martial arts field
They are here to mess up!
No!
You gave me your word!
Come on!
There might be more of those bastards inside.
"No, you mustn't go out there."
They'll kill you.
Stay here!
They're going to kill you!
Leave her.
"She doesn't need a priest, she needs an executioner."
Or are you trying to tell me that you hope these bandits will go to heaven?
- Be careful.
- I will be.
Don't worry.
Come on.
Get them all out of there.
- I hoped they'd catch Carrasco too.
- We were told he wasn't among them.
Too bad.
"But if they've got any captives, we'll make them talk."
"We've got the whole gang, Coronel."
- Let me speak to your commander.
- Be quiet.
- You lied to me.
You gave me your word.
- What's all this shouting about?
They were in that hospital over there.
- There.
- Have they been identified?
- Some.
- The corpses must be burnt.
"- You're Padre Julio, aren't you?"
Let's slaughter a cow!
"Baso, grab it!"
Grab its legs!
Come on!
I've cut off the head of the Japanese Governor-general
Wow!
What a party!
Sir Yoshimura
Whose wedding day is it?
It's Watan and Lubi's
Come!
"Have a drink with us, sir"
No
- No
"- Come on, have a drink"
No way
I don't drink the wine with your nasty saliva in it
"- Come on, have a drink"
- I told you that I don't want to
Your hand is all dirty with blood
- I invited you with good will
- You son-of-a-bitch!
You've soiled me with blood!
I offered you a drink and you hit me?
I'll beat you into senses!
- Stop!
- I don't need to reason with a savage
What is it?
Let's go look!
Hurry up!
I know what you said just now with a boar's head in your hand
Out of my way!
And now she's in the wind.
Kiddo.
Listen.
Go back to those twins.
They're your family now.
This was a bad idea.
So...
You.
Here.
This is what?
You giving up on working with your son?
Duval doesn't care what I think about this case or anything else.
You can't really believe that.
Your son wants very badly to please you.
Why do you think he became an FBI agent?
You don't follow in the footsteps of someone whose opinion doesn't matter.
You matter to him.
I never thought of that before.
He got into law enforcement because of me.
He wanted to please me. [Chuckles]
"His whole life, he just wanted to please me."
If he's her and I'm him...
Why am I here?
Because you want me to shut up.
Okay.
I'm good with that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You want me to shut up.
You really want me to shut up.
And yet you still keep on talking.
Not now.
"I mean, probably now, but even when I was dead, did you ever hear me then?"
"You know, I didn't mean to bail on you fellas, but I've been waiting over six months to get into Canyon Valley."
"And let me tell ya, it was worth it."
I already lost 10 pounds!
In -- in one day?
"No offense, Sheriff -- 'cause you look great -- um, but aren't you the least bit curious as to how you dropped 10 in a day?"
"Well, to tell you the truth, Agent,"
I don't really give a flyin' fudge. [ Chuckles ]
"My husband, Doug, left me last year 'cause he said I loved cookie-dough milkshakes more than him."
Sorry to hear that.
Dean:
"Yeah, Doug's a dick."
You deserve better.
Thanks.
But he was right.
That was a dark time for me.
Whoever said you eat your pain?
Not me.
I guzzled it.
[ Laughs ]
Anyhoo...
I guess I just wanted to feel pretty again.
And Canyon Valley did that.
Only question is...
What are you doing here?
"[ Clears throat ] We're, uh, uh..."
We're undercover.
Yeah.
Sort of got that.
We think that there's a connection between Canyon Valley and the murders in town.
What kind of connection?
Suction marks.
[ Chuckles ]
"Well, hello."
I didn't think you'd be here.
I thought your husband--
"Oh, yes, he's off on another one of those trips."
But why should that stop me from traveling?
"See you later, maybe?"
We had the pleasure of meeting him last summer in Lausanne.
I'd taken Merle to Switzerland.
"The trip was very beneficial, I thought."
Poor Olivia.
What was he like?
"Oh, it was indeed a rare privilege."
He is such a quaint old gentleman.
"He speaks perfect English, but I am sure he learned it from reading the classics."
[laughter]
He always referred to me as Mistress Langley.
It sounded terribly elegant but a little bit naughty.
[chatter]
[doorbell rings]
- [door opens]
"- Good evening, sir."
"[Paul] Oh, good evening, Corbett."
"Oh, uh, Mr. Drake,"
I would like for you to mix around and have fun.
"I understand, Mrs. Langley."
- But keep an eye on Merle.
- All right.
I have a terrible headache.
I've got to lie down.
[knocking]
"I say, old man, have you seen Margo around?"
Margo Stevens?
You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach!
Get on the ground!
Hold it right there.
Don't move.
Stay down.
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!
"Hi, I'm Saul Goodman."
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque."
Better call Saul.
"Saul Goodman, attorney at law, 505-1 64-CALL."
That's 505-1 64-CALL.
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, no."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
- Me!
You're about to see a trick by Foguinho the Magnificent.
Wait right there.
This is a very special box.
It came from a very serious land.
- Do you see anything inside?
- No.
"It is a magic box, you see?"
When I go like this-
A rose for the pretty girl!
"Can we get some applause, kindly?"
You'll share this room with Quico for now.
"This is all yours, my darling."
Do you like the room?
It's really high.
"Put your things away, darling."
What is the matter?
There's a whole closet just for you!
We're used to it Mrs. Maria Cecília.
"At the circus, we don't get a lot of room."
"It doesn't matter, my love."
We'll get you settled in later.
There's no rush.
Enjoy the party.
"There are so many kids here, and so many sweet treats."
Go on over to the living room.
"Go play with Foguinho and the kids, sweetie."
Barbuda will be right there.
She's so quiet.
She's been lately always thinking...
- Thinking about what?
- Like I'd know!
- Don't you say a word against Norman.
If you'd brought him up with intelligence...
He has no interest in girls.
He never had.
He never learned a thing about sex in my house.
It was never mentioned.
"- Hello, Mrs. Page."
- Come in here.
- Where's Norman?
"- Outside, just going home."
- Stay right here.
- What's the matter?
Norman!
Come in here.
"What is it, Ma?"
- Where were you today?
"- What is it, Mother?"
You were seen swimming in the nude with Norman.
- That's a lie!
- How could you even think that?
You were seen clearly by two people.
"We went swimming, but we had our suits on."
"And by now, everybody in Peyton Place knows about it."
If anything is wrong with her...
"We didn't do anything, did we, Allison?"
- No.
- You better take your boy and go.
We didn't do anything.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
Keep this up and I'll do what you accuse me of!
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
I must look like I was attacked by wolves.
"I apologize, I didn't even notice."
"Mmm, uh..."
Could you excuse me while I go to the ladies' room
- for a minute?
"- Sure, sure."
Do you enjoy dancing?
I used to love to dance with my father.
You?
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Watching?
- Pairs...
It's interesting how coupling appears in nature and in mathematics.
- You were talking about pairs...
- The twin-prime conjecture.
"It explores pairs of prime numbers, numbers that are only divisible by themselves."
Three-five.
Five-seven.
Not seven-nine...
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That's right.
"Then you have 11-13, and 17-19 and so on."
It was discovered that pairs were often separated by...
One number in between.
Exactly.
Did you read my book?
"- No, I'm sorry."
- That's all right.
This is really marvelous.
Oh...
"Yes, super-gross."
Jack is a monster.
Jack should just crawl under a bus and die!
You better clear things up without hurting her.
Amy is my oldest friend.
[whispers]:
She's 30!
[whispers]:
She's actually 32.
Secrets.
"Welp, better go end things with Amy."
This is not easy.
Is something I'll probably say to her.
See you in half a minute.
[scolding]
"- Remember, okay, you work with Amy."
- Uh huh.
"In the same building, every day?"
- Great.
- Jack!
Focus!
"Come on, she's not some Carnaval trollop you can hit and quit in Rio."
"You work with Amy, okay?"
"So you better get out of this gracefully, or your life will be hell."
Okay.
"Jack Gordon, colon, Man of Action..."
Copyright recently approved...
Knows when to admit his mistakes.
JACK:
"Carol, when you lifted the ban on office dating, you really pooped the bed."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Gordon, but getting rid of that policy was the best move I've ever made for this office."
"-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?"
"-Yes, I am."
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.
Did he talk to you about my party?
He sure did.
About my daughter?
"No, I didn't know you had one."
-He didn't mention her?
-No.
Oh.
Didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
"Priests are pretty tight-mouthed, then, huh?"
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
Sure.
"I mean, what if a person, uh, came to you you know, that was a murderer or criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
"I mean, would you have to turn him in?"
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
Mm-hm.
"And, uh, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If, um-"
"- If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 16th century.
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
"Whatever the case, she... fell in love with someone else."
Who?
A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.
I only saw him once.
From a distance.
They died in a car accident.
How does your daughter figured that it's your fault?
"Well, my daughter didn't know about the affair."
She blamed me for the breakup.
And consequently the... car accident.
Well... did you ever tell her the whole story?
- No.
- Why not?
Because I want her to remember her mother the way she does now.
That's stupid!
You're stupid!
- Thank you.
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
- What?
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
Very much.
"Well, at least she did somethin' right."
"Now, I'm gonna get some bullets and we've done with all these."
Tell Violet.
"You like my partner, don't you?"
What's not to like?
She's....a sweet girl.
Do you like her better than me?
I don't know you as well.
That's okay.
I like her better than me too.
-l hate that it had to turn out this way.
-(siren wailing)
"Me taking care of the girl, me taking care of the police."
"What you need, what we're willing to offer, is a change of pace."
We have a station for you to look after.
Blackleg Miner.
One of the smaller terminals.
-England?
-Yeah.
"Far the fuck out, middle of nowhere."
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.
"Unofficially, it's used to broadcast numbers to our European field agents."
-How long?
-Until your head is right.
You'll be babysitting a broadcaster.
"Civilian, right?"
"Yeah, cryptology specialist."
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level.
"You and another team, alternating shifts."
Three days each.
"You keep the station safe, you keep the code safe."
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.
8-1-7.
6-9-0-1-0.
katherine:
Slowly.
"No. no, no, no."
Did--did you see that--that guy
With the--with that--that gun?
It--it erases your short-term--no.
Psst.
What the hell is up with you two?
Now who are you working for?
Secret service.
"But a department that you, sir, know nothing about."
I doubt that.
Now what department?
"It's a, um, archival department."
You're filing clerks
Running around shooting stun guns
At your own people?
"Oh, we didn't shoot you."
"All right, filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys."
- Yeah.
Pretty much.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
I'll take it from here.
"Careful, archives."
"Paper cuts, they take days to heal."
That's hilar-- you're hilarious.
Very scared.
- So glad to see you.
- Thank you.
Not a damn word.
"Now, I warned you to back off before things got worse."
Already did.
I told you to stay away from them and I meant it.
"Now, go on, get him out of here."
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing to say.
"You came to me for help, right?"
"It may not have turned out the way either of us wanted it to, but... it's how it turned out and it's all right."
I do... and besides...
I got to imagine myself being a daddy.
(chuckles)
I like how it feels.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(kisses)
Bye-bye.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Man:
Why did they stay at a BB?
Woman:
It was a nice BB.
I thought the mission was that he had to get to Fort Lauderdale to get his job back in a blaze of glory.
"Yeah, but the wife didn't know that."
She likes BBs.
It was a really nice BB.
What kind of people would stay at a place run by a pedophile?
Plot twist... they didn't know that.
That Russian girl was 16.
"Yeah, but they assumed that the old guy was interested in the mom."
Are you almost done with him?
I want my turn.
Yeah.
She who?
-Ella.
"-Alvaro, you are a pig."
"No, no. would not to do it."
"It hopes, Lella.?"
To where you go?
I will not return to go to the cinema with you.
Now you lías to slaps with me?
Lella...
-You must learn to respect to me.
"-Yes, Yes, in agreement, hopes..."
"Eh, Casanova, you have returned to give in the morning call?"
"Yes, it aimed at the ass of your sister, jerk."
What you have said?
"It pardons, I have been mistaken."
Lella...
"Oh, my God."
"Eh, boys, I do not hold more, has remained me rigid."
-I can drink?
-By Lella?
Because by Lella?
I?
It give account you?
That good of God...
We leave it yet.
"The press says that the young people we make the love without taboos, without inhibitions..."
Why the journalists do not interview me?
"I them to say the truth, that never me as a spiral."
"Meanwhile, you do the love with the sister of the Left-handed person."
-The sister of whom?
-Of the Left-handed person.
The Left-handed person...
That's enough!
You've already said that over 30 times today.
Dinner is served!
What family education!
Grabbing the bigger piece.
How were you taught?
Always to take the smaller piece!
You got what your mother told you to get!
Couldn't find the Formula.
But I found this.
"On April 14, 7:00 p.m., the Emperor's godson, Hiroshima Tora,"
The Emperor's godson!
Will pick up the 'Beast' posing as Special Envoy from Chungking.
You want to know what he looks like?
Looks just like you!
What a coincidence!
You know what to do then?
You want me to pose as him?
Right!
What if the real thing turns up?
- He wouldn't.
- How come?
"Tomorrow, we'll get on the train 1 station ahead... ls it the right person?"
Why don't you ask himself?
Are you Hiroshima Tora?
People with hearing aids are usually deaf.
"From my past experience, he doesn't look the part."
Let's go to the other cabin.
It's him!
"Kidoo, get a bigger hammer!"
We haven't worked so well together for ages.
Who's he?
What you need to do is focus on yourself.
Ok?
"So, please, sit."
No.
No?
"This is my therapy, and I should be allowed to decide what we talk about."
"Erica, just drop it."
Ok?
You're not his doctor.
This is not your problem.
"No, because his doctor is mia, and Kai is out there drowning, and you are acting like you don't even care."
You could talk to him.
No.
Yes.
You could get through to him.
You and I are not gonna discuss this any further.
"You know, unlike Dr. Fred,"
I don't become involved in the lives of other patients.
That's a rule?
That's my rule.
Fine.
We are not doing this today.
"Erica, come back."
Open the door.
"Come back and sit down in the chair, please."
Open the door!
Everything ok?
We had a disagreement.
"It wasn't our first, won't be our last."
"Well, disagreements are a normal part of the process."
This was different.
This felt like... the fights that I used to have with Sarah.
- I have you.
- What?
!
What do you have?
You have what I have...
nothing!
"You, my boy, were in Mom and Dad's bed."
"Oh, ho-ho-ho."
"What was that, the sound of power suddenly shifting?"
Nothing happened.
"Yeah, and it didn't happen in Mom and Dad's bed."
I have you.
I have you by your ovaries.
"Hey, Cor, buddy, I'm not gonna kill you."
That was one of those wacky brother-to-brother murder threats.
Yeah.
"Listen, I'd like you to do something for me."
- Anything you need.
- Tell me how you do it.
What I was doing with Rebecca?
"No, no, what you were doing with Rebecca, I don't have the lung capacity for that."
"I just wanna know, how do you get a girl to say hi?"
"- Oh, you're wasting my time."
- I have you.
"Now, ordinarily I wouldn't reveal my foolproof method, but I know I can count on my favorite little brother to keep a secret."
I'm listening.
"- OK, you got eyes?"
- Yeah.
- Use 'em.
- How?
Look at her.
Look into her.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
She has this book club.
It's a couple of ladies from the school.
- My school?
- Yeah.
"They sit and pretend they read, but mostly it's just gossip."
"Hey, if you help me, we can get out of here really quick."
- Help you?
- We just need set out some sandwiches.
"Oh, uh..."
"Boy, I just..."
I don't know how much of a help I would be.
"You know, I..."
I once worked for two weeks at McDonald's and I accidentally gave away the secret to the secret sauce.
"It's ketchup and mayonnaise, by the way."
"Christine, are you embarrassed by what I do?"
No.
I'm not embarrassed at all.
"But I mean, why didn't you tell me you were Marly's housekeeper?"
"I'm sorry, should I have said:"
"""Before you get too attached to me, you should know I'm a housekeeper""?"
"Well, you came right out with the Portuguese thing."
"I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
"No, I..."
I don't care what you do.
I am not like one of them.
"Great, then help me so we can get out of here."
Okay.
I'll...
I'll help you.
I'm excited.
"It is true that I missed you all day long in that bed, it was endless."
"I tried to forget everything in sleeping, but I couldn't."
Do you know what I kept thinking about ?
about that day that we spent here together.
It was a great day !
Simon !
"Simon, are you alright ?"
"Yes, I'm ok !"
"Are you hungry, Babette ?"
I'm starving !
It's smells good !
What did you make?
It's pork with honney and curry.
That's the curry I can smell.
I've got a bottle of Bordeau.
That sounds great !
It will go well with the meat.
Remind me to buy you some place mats.
You haven't got much tableware.
"You know that Simon couldnt care less, and I hate shopping."
"Never mind, you're such a good cook."
I like it !
You'll have to give me the recipe.
What's wrong ?
I have something to tell you.
I have to leave again.
I am sailing back for work in a few days time.
Just like this.
Yes !
Five weeks.
We are sailing to south Africa.
It is the last time I am leaving for so long.
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Events of major importance happened in Europe today.
"First, this morning, the representatives of Britain, France and..."
[Ursula]:
Do you think Andrea would be a soldier if he were at home?
[Janet]:
Probably.
[Radio]:
Informed by the German government that Germany regarded the Franco-Russian...
We're going to have to go into Truro to get him some clothes.
- I know.
- Who did father go to?
Can't remember.
[Radio]:
By the obligations assumed at the Carno.
"He's so young, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
I think we can eat.
I'll take Andrea's tray up.
Perhaps he might want to try coming downstairs.
"Oh, no."
It's far too early for that.
I hope he's gonna like it.
"They look so sad, don't they?"
Not at all.
Don't eat too quickly.
Hmm?
Doesn't matter.
"It's very filling, isn't it?"
"You don't have to eat it, Ursula."
I'm sure Andrea will eat what you can't manage.
Perhaps I'll eat later.
He might like some of my bottled pears.
Fine with me.
"Tony, stay with McGee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smelled like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dirt, sweat... and sandalwood."
ZIVA:
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant, so I used yours."
"No, you didn't."
"Yeah, we're partners."
What's the big deal?
A hair!
TONY:
"Come on, you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ground radar techs didn't show till dawn.
McGee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very Brokeback Mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."""
How romantic.I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well, I can show it to you on my new phone it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
ZIVA:
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
Not really.
No.
"No, i guess it's just time for me to get out."
Nick.
"Jim, don't let him go!"
"If you're doing this for me, it's wrong!"
Don't worry.
He'll be back tomorrow.
"Just come from the gold exchange, boss."
It's buzzing over there like a hornet's nest.
"You know, i'm going to put a scare into washington till they padlock that treasury."
"There she goes, up again."
"You know, gold's jumped 4 points since you started buying it."
Jim.
"Oh, josie!"
You're just in time to see the fireworks start.
"Jim, where's nick?"
"In his office, i guess."
Haven't you seen him yet?
I've been waiting all day for him to come through that door.
It's not so far to come.
"But it's not so far to go, either."
"I'm sorry, josie, i can't do it."
"Please, boss."
"Jim, you've got to do it."
Do it for my sake.
"Hello, nick."
"Hello, jim."
Gold's just hit 125.
It's not too late if you still want to come in.
It's not too late for you to get out.
"Stop fooling with gunpowder, jim."
I won't stop until it hits 200.
646.
- And 5 more.
- Here is another 20.
Plus 3.
The change they gave me when I bought the fur coats.
And you said it wasn't a good idea to buy them.
- Mr. Dürchlich?
"- Well, yes."
"You use the pencil as a phone, but still, you don't have the money for the hotel."
What can I say?
Nice prospects.
"Well, we'll surely cover the rest somehow."
How much are you still missing?
- 54.
- That's nothing.
That's right!
-You've got to do it someday.
"-Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's called marriage.
-Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
-I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But... don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
"Betty, you're the only girl I've ever wanted."
Rodney...
"Rodney, not that way..."
What good is life if I go through it not having guts to do it my way?
Rodney... I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
Ew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, it's-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
Wait a minute.
"Monica, how did you do this?"
"Well, when we were on our way home from rehab,"
"Dad had told me what had happened,"
So i just wanted to make up
"For all the bad things i've done,"
So i called papa joe's
And i made arrangements with my debit card to have your stuff back.
Regina: oh my god.
"Regina: wait wait, but..."
But how did...
How did you do it?
I don't understand.
"Well, mom, dad,"
I've been painting again since i've been in rehab.
And the director saw my stuff
And he thought i should have an art show
And i did and i sold all my artwork
And i made enough money to get mom's stuff back.
- What?
- Yeah.
"Oh, baby, i'm so proud of you."
"I am so proud of you, monica."
I've missed you so much.
I've missed all those things about you
That make you so special.
And i'm gonna be a good mother to you...
I promise you that...
If you'll just let me.
I told you i was gonna make you proud of me one day.
and you have.
- I hope i did.
- Here.
Then divide it up!
I'll make piles!
It doesn't work out this time either.
"Ah, here!"
No big green ones?
"- None, really?"
"- No, really."
It's just that green is good for the eyes.
"Wait, I can't count it."
... eighty... ninety and two fifties.
- Two fifties and ninety is...
- Two fifties for each...
Wait!
"You must do something with this, it's torn//falling to pieces, soon we won't have anything to play from."
"Look, there's something here!"
I knew it.
Good to see.
That's super.
It'll save us.
It's the first time that's happened!
Such a good job!
Yes!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- A terrible thing's happened to us.
- And what's that?
We were sewing a dress for Mi?
"ka for a party on Saturday, we wanted to hurry it up, so we thought we'd do it ourselves."
"Put it on, so that we can see..."
"She cut it out, got it ready, and now we need to be rescued."
This for a party?
But we're still gonna have to have DMV retest her.
For me.
"Hello, Henry."
That's a boy.
That's a boy.
"See, Daddy?"
Daddy?
Henry.
"You know, I wonder if some kids might have picked up that baby food."
"Maybe, but the way those boxes were bouncing out of that truck they could have gone anywhere."
"Oh, no."
There's that couple.
Remember that couple yesterday with the flat tire?
Of course.
Scavengers.
That's it!
They must have hung around.
I think we're getting senile.
Not me.
"Oh, what happened?"
What did you do now?
- We know where the baby food is.
- Where?
- A gypsy van.
- A school bus.
"- Hey, slow down now."
- Scavengers.
"Slow down, slow down."
Hold it.
"Now, tell me about it."
"After we cited the baby-food truck about half a mile further, we saw a school bus..."
"Converted school bus, gypsy van, loaded like you can't believe."
That is all.
Thank you.
The meeting's over.
Send the car.
Any new transfers recently?
Just a moment.
"No, not a single one."
"The police identified the body of reporter Takeshi Kurosaki, age 35."
His investigative reports unveiled a series of university scandals.
"The cause of death is unknown, but foul play isn't ruled out."
That was close!
Did you hit these?
I think so.
You broke the dolphin.
Who's that?
From the Administration.
And who are you?
Haven't seen you around.
This is Rin.
Department?
I'm not a student.
So you can't join the team.
"Ryuji, Iet her apply."
"If you can hit that strong, you should apply."
Alright!
I'm soaked!
Right down to the underwear.
This way.
It's quite easy to apply.
What's that?
A special training facility.
It's a restricted area.
Help!
- Guerrilleros!
"- Get over there, everybody!"
Block that side!
Take cover!
That bastard won't get away from me.
Hurry up!
Take off!
Enrique!
They're trying to get away in their copters.
We might still get them.
- Why are they shooting?
"- We're safe, Padre."
We're safe.
A new magazine.
Try to get into the hospital.
"Shit, we're trapped!"
"Concepción and the others, where are they?"
They're... they're dead.
"Come on, hurry up!"
I think they're all gone.
Enrique!
They nearly killed me.
That priest over there saved my life.
"Come on, we must flee before they come back and kill us all."
You are Enrique Carrasco?
You have to stop this madness.
"Hey, that doesn't look good."
Make sure it doesn't get infected.
"- Héctor, the lorries."
- Get these people to safety.
"When the militia return, they'll kill you all."
Are there glasses?
- But of course.
Everything's supplied.
"- Oh, dear."
- What?
"Well, I was just thinking of Mother."
"This afternoon, she tried to tell me what happens on a wedding night."
She's a bit late.
What did you say?
"I said she was a bit late, didn't I?"
Henry?
Mr Faber?
What are you doing?
It's all right.
It's... just for the station.
Classified work regarding the trains.
I shouldn't really be telling you.
"- Please, listen to me."
- No.
Trust me.
- You're a spy.
- Stop struggling.
"Listen to me, please."
"Last night, the Luftwaffe's main target was again London."
Considerable damage was done to residential and industrial areas...
"David, be careful."
You're not in your Spitfire yet.
"Dearly beloved brethren, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."
He gives us the sheep and we... give him back the bones.
"Lucy, I think I've offended your mother again."
"I'm right here, David."
You may address me directly.
"Jeeves, you don't mean you're leaving me still."
How are we gonna manage?
"The young lady may have some idea, sir."
I hear they generally have.
That's right.
I hadn't thought of that.
- Shall I have a go at it till the blacksmith arrives?
"- Yes, please."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Thank you, Jeeves."
"Go on, take a card, any card at all."
Now look at it.
Put it back.
Ace of spades.
"- When did you change the act, Pop?"
- I didn't.
He did.
He did?
"Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned."
"Wait a minute, take a bow."
"No, you take it."
I got to get married.
"Come here, they're applauding you."
They like it.
Lucky.
Now what?
"- I want to reason with you, if I can."
- But you already did.
Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know?
"It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it?"
I hate to see you leave show business.
But...
Darling!
-Did you throw a bottle from the window?
!
"-No, Mr. Vanyerka."
-I wish!
"Stay covered, miss."
For now.
"One, two."
Rascals!
Is it possible to get any privacy here?
!
"-Don't be cross with me, I don't know, what..."
Mr. Vanyerka?
"What happened, Mr. Vanyerka?"
Mr. Vanyerka?
"Oh, a bump!"
"Come round, Mr. Vanyerka."
"Well, wake up!"
"Yirinka, Wait!"
Yirinka!
Now look.
Was that necessary?
Mr. Vanyerka?
Where have they sent us?
We're here.
-They are people.
-Beautiful.
"It's a nice sunny day, once again, good morning."
We will open a window and take a deep breath.
"For the floor, actually for your arms, now calls another exercise, only for ambitious athletes, because these will be press-ups."
"So, a nice, straight push-up on your arms, legs backwards, we start by bending the arms down, but we are not laying on the belly doing this, we are stretching our arms nicely making a push-up"
He picked up your brother because... you were crying.
He saw my distress and offered me money.
He said it was a good family.
"Oh, God!"
What have I done?
You survived.
Made a home for me.
You did what you had to do.
I don't blame you.
You should've told me.
I know.
"Can you remember his name, the lawyer?"
Why?
"Somebody killed him, Mother."
He was trying to come home.
They killed him.
"Alain, please."
Can you remember his name?
Etienne St. Denis.
He had an office in Place Pigalie in Paris.
Parents always lie to their children... to prepare them for the way they'll be treated later by the government.
Maybe I'm wasting my time.
"But if I don't go now, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
What do you gain?
You only open old wounds.
The lawyer can't bring him back.
My brother was adopted.
"If I can find his family, I can learn about him."
Kind of get to know him.
The lawyer's office is on the sixth floor.
"Remember, I'll do the talking."
Okay?
You didn't do anything.
You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure! rambling on like a lunatic.
So much easier for you.
Easier?
Jesus!
nothing!
please be like the rest of the world blaming someone else for your boring shit.
I'm such a giant disappointment.
You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we're doing?
what are we doing?
Hmm?
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.
I see that.
there are others.
Does that mean nothing to you?
means nothing to me.
Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books.
What are you talking about?
will you?
Take out two pills and give them to him.
- Logan!
Logan!
- Give 'em to him.
Now!
I wanna see it.
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...
Motherfucking auto-trucks.
Logan.
And you're screaming at a machine. huh?
She can learn to be better.
better than me?
Aneesa.
Repeat after me:
Now tell us what you know.
"When my family moved to Washington,"
Fatimah was very envious.
She told me she hated Al Khair.
She wanted to run away.
That's why she sold the villa.
And what else did she tell you?
She wanted to come to America.
She said she was going to find an American and marry him.
Go on.
"And when she didn't need him anymore, she could stay in America."
She would be free.
It sounds like a washing machine.
The world's most beautiful washing machine.
"Oh, my back is killing me, Bud."
"Oh, I told you to stop lifting little baby A.J."
"Oh, yeah."
You stay at home with a 2-year-old and don't lift him.
Sorry for the delay.
It's been a madhouse here this morning.
How are you feeling?
"My gut's the size of a roast pig, and my ankles look like bolognas and my back feels like a Cuisinart."
She's been a little hungry.
"Oh, that's not hunger."
"Lieutenant Sims, you're in labour."
Now?
"No, I have four weeks."
"Well, I guess no one told the baby."
It is true.
I did say those things.
You know we wanted to be pregnant by now.
I can't take that kind of time off work right now.
"Besides, we need my income."
That's not an issue.
Come on.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if we lose us?
Jess.
You will never lose me.
So what was it like in prison?
It's actually not so cracked out to be.
"If you could start your life over, what would you do different?"
Be someone else.
"That's sad, Roman."
Anyone can change.
"Change is a choice, you know?"
Change is a choice?
Where'd you read that?
Just made it up.
So when will I see you again?
Hard to say.
You're not going to do anything stupid are you?
"See, right there!"
That's what it's like being me!
Everyone always thinks I'm up to something.
I wonder why.
You're sexy when you work.
Norman.
"Right, hang on."
Lucky coin.
Damn it.
"You know, no one ever died from taking a day off."
Get down now!
- Get on the floor now!
- Get in there!
Get him down!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
"- Come on, Todd, come on!"
- What happened?
"I don't know, one minute he was fine, then he started convulsing and he fell over."
"Come on, kid."
Come on!
He's dead.
"Don, he's dead."
CSI:
NY Season05 Episode13 Rush to Judgment
I was questioning him.
"He was getting agitated, then he started talking azy."
Then he started shaking.
Foam was coming out of his mouth and he hit the ground.
Don't worry.
Sid will get to the bottom of it.
Detective Flack.
- You mind answering a few questions?
- No problem.
"Don, don't you want to wait for a union rep?"
"No, no, no, no."
I'd rather take care of this now.
"Okay, you can start by filling out this incident report."
When did you first encounter Mr. Fleming?
Earlier today.
He was at wrestling practice over at Hillridge High School.
Detective Angell and I went by and asked him to come downtown with us.
- What?
- I...
- Hurry up and say it!
This office...
The person who is renting and using this office...
I was... doing something here...
- On the side.
- What did you do on the side?
Something similar to a detective agency...
What the heck were you going around doing?
You don't have to worry too much.
I... saw the faces of our suspects.
What are you talking about?
I saw two guys running out of here.
"I know who they are, so we can go and catch them together."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Wait one second.
"So... these guys that you know, were in your office..."
"And they murdered a guy, that you know... and ran away."
"But on their way out, they happened to run into you?"
"Sir, this is the place."
Get ready.
Open the door!
It's the police!
- Open the door!
- Who is it?
- It's the police.
Open the door!
- What's going on?
My arm!
My arm!
Hold on a second!
"- Okay, 1...3...5..."
- Okay.
- Got it?
- Yeah I'm good.
"Oh, stop moving the pier."
Nice knowing you.
You've got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you're training?
- Can we do this later?
- There may not be a later for you.
"- Oh, oh Mr. Scott..."
- Was I talking to you?
Get in the car.
I'm driving you both home.
You're mother's going to love this.
You getting drunk on her watch...
There's some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about.
Why does interesting scare me?
"No, no."
"Listen, the company's been hired to do some flood control."
They want me to supervise.
How long is it going to be this time?
"Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months."
"So, what's the upside?"
"It's a lot of money, sweetie."
Way more than I make now.
We could be good to go for a while.
Maybe even afford that art school you talk about.
Is this something that you want?
I only want to do this if it's right for us.
"You should do it, dad."
What happened to you?
Nice to see you too.
"OK, I think we'll do physics, please."
"You've chosen physics, and we now reveal exactly what you'll be looking for."
"You'll have ten seconds to confer as a team, and then you answer on your own."
"Remember, you've got two passes, but the one wrong answer and your team will be locked out of the hive."
"So, you've chosen physics as a topic."
You are looking for electrical components.
You've got ten seconds to confer.
Ammeter...
"Diode, transistor..."
Ohmmeter...
Transformer.
"Batteries, Capacitor..."
Bulb.
"Capacitor, yes."
Resistor...
Time's up.
"Ned, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, two passes should you need them."
"You're looking for electrical components, reveal the hive."
Transistor.
"Transistor, correct."
Oliver.
You can pass.
Pass.
Marianne.
One pass left. 20 seconds.
One pass left.
Diode.
"Diode, correct."
Ned.
Pass.
Oliver.
- You said this was gonna scare 'em.
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume.
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that would scare the pants off of you.
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes.
Stories to make your blood run cold.
- Yeah.
- Stories to terrify you.
Yeah.
"And whoever shall last through the night, shall be named the King of Halloween."
I accept.
We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wunderbar!"
Huzzah!
OK.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick-or-treaters.
Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
- Trick or treat.
I shall begin.
"Sorry, but don't mention that I was here."
You're fleeing?
Or your family will fall apart and you won't be a detective anymore.
They've been hiding for 15 years.
It's like being imprisoned.
"They've already atoned, let them go."
A crime is a crime.
What we did may be a crime to our families.
"Those are our civil affairs, not the police's problem."
"You're impossible, we're finished."
Wait...
But I'm a detective.
"Don't worry about me, I'm sure I'll be out in two years."
So wait for me.
"In two years, come pick me up at prison."
Open up!
We'll be okay.
What're you doing?
Hurry and open up!
Where's Suzuki San?
"Last I saw, she was delivering sushi."
Wasn't that a while ago?
"Room 405, right?"
I'll go check on her.
"Hello, front desk."
Mind coming up?
Is something wrong?
"Just come up, hurry."
"Alright Betty, time for a walk."
Like you're digging deep.
Sir?
You're becoming the earth...
So many dogs!
- I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
- All right.
This is gonna hurt.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"- Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
- Okay.
"- Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
- The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
- Talking about what?
"- Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"- Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
- I don't know.
Because I liked you.
Do you think I'm still attractive for women?
"To me, yes."
Of course you are.
You knew who I was.
I've heard about you.
Great piece for your collection.
I don't know if you're mean or just pathetic!
"That night, the only thing that had your interest was the name."
Be honest.
But what does the first night matter?
There have been other nights I think.
I just wanted to be sure.
Are you calm now?
Yes.
Then I'm leaving.
Nobody stops here.
I have an idea.
Maybe if I wait here alone somebody stops.
Why don't you hide behind there?
-I won't.
It's easier for a lonely girl.
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not going to stay here alone.
-But you're gonna be right there!
No way.
"Please, let me do it."
Don't think that I like picking up people in the road.
Did you have breakdown?
No.
We don't have a car.
We're spending the weekend in the countryside.
"No, Sonny."
Let her go.
"Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet."
"Don't do this, Sonny."
I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.
"Please proceed to the elevator, detective."
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.
Go!
Go!
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.
"Kill her, the way you were going to kill me."
"Sonny, get the nanites."
"Yes, doctor."
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.
That's V.I.K.I.
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
They'll infect her entire system.
Spooner!
What is it with you people and heights?
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.
"Oh, this is poor building planning."
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?
Yes.
But it just seems too heartless.
"Okay, we're good."
You take a look at him while he's sleeping.
"You know how cute he is, with his tush all squished up in the air like that..."
Did you see him?
See who?
That-a-way!
We're in lockdown!
This door stays closed till you hear the all-clear call.
The perimeter's sealed.
He's not getting out this way.
My jewelry box!
"Jamie, Mommy told you..."
"All right, Jamie, you've had your fun."
Now it's time to give that back to Mommy and go to sleep.
Jamie...
I asked you to give it to me!
Would you look at this thing?
It's amazing.
We've got to come up with something really great to do with it.
What if we tied mattresses to ourselves and jumped off it?
Nah.
We could do that off the roof.
We could launch mannequins into the Prestons' Jacuzzi.
Uh-uh.
It's not good enough.
We could get a squirrel to dive off it into a cup of water.
Not good enough.
Not for her.
Not this old beauty.
"Well, how about if we got a vat of Jell-O..."
No!
It's not good enough!
I got it!
She sounded so happy...
But you were seen no where.
I kept telling her we should leave the city.
But she did not listen.
She was confident that you would come back... and asked me to wait.
How many days do we give excuses?
The moneylenders have kidnapped my daughter.
They are threatening to kill my daughter
If we don't clear all our debts.
What do you mean?
I want my daughter back.
Alive.
Alive.
- Sir...
Please get up.
Please.
Don't cry.
We will rescue Deepa for sure.
They are very dangerous people.
If we go to the police...
They will not think twice to kill my daughter.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Give me a day's time.
Please.
Come.
Have a seat.
How much do you owe them now?
Going to have your morning coffee with Sadhana?
I have to invite my close friend.
I will be able to meet him only if I go now.
So...
Bye.
Everything's the same as when Golly was here.
It looks the same... it smells the same... but there's this tiny hole inside me that wasn't there before.
It's like... like a splinter in your finger... only this one's right above my stomach.
"Harriet, are you okay?"
Uh-huh.
Something's... different.
No cats?
How can Harrison Withers not have a billion cats around?
They finally nailed him.
I will always remember that face.
That's the face you make when you really lose something.
"Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck."
Speak English!
"Oh, okay, you want us to speak English, huh?"
!
"Well, you are a jerk, huh?"
"I tell you, ""Don't take the truck."
"You smash the truck."""
"Well, you tell me now,"
"Mr. Wise Guy, was one date worth it?"
...we have people here shopping!
Yeah.
"Hey, all right, Grandpa."
"It's cool, right?"
"It wasn't a big deal, huh?"
"I knew you'd understand, right?"
Sometimes I think families everywhere are exactly the same.
Everybody get back to work.
"Mom, Dad, please?"
Grandpa!
Just calm down.
Too exciting.
I'm gonna go poop now
"Yep, go pump it out"
Yes ma'am
"Me, the hunter..."
Bon...
"Don't scare me like that, I almost peed my pants"
Bon...
Yes?
Bon...
I love you!
"Ever since we met on ""Monster Hunter"" online"
I'm a gross Otaku but I love you
With my spearing soul
I think Miyu is being physically and mentally abused
I am taking Miyu home
Miyu looks her best when she is smiling
She doesn't deserve to be sad
Yeah
"Also, you are being watched"
He's asleep
"No, I mean that"
What?
It's Lin's smartphone
It's out of the box
What's this?
This is being broadcast online
"There should be some people watching, including Lin's younger sister"
Is that a joke?
I'm serious
Which website?
"Hey, Bon?"
Which website?
# Now I'll run from you #
# This tainted love you've given #
# I give you all a girl could give you #
# Take my tears and that's not nearly #
# Oh... tainted love #
# Tainted love #
"# Don't touch me,please #"
# I cannot stand the way you tease #
"# I love you,though you hurt me so #"
# Now it's time you pack your things and go #
# Tainted love. #
"The guy sings a five-minute song about what I bitch I am, and then kisses me and walks away."
I should not be turned on right now.
I can't believe he walked away.
"I mean,who does that?"
"And what,has he been locked away at T Hot Rocker Academy of Kissing for the past five years?"
"Hey,Bella."
What?
Where's my car?
Hello!
"Obvious sign,girl."
What the hell?
- You were driving.
- Exactly.
I was busy.
"Dude,I'm gonna blame you."
It's my option.
Are you serious?
"I'm not paying this time,just so you know..."
"Hi,Marty."
"Um,so,my sister is an ass."
"And,uh,we're gonna need a ride."
Careful.
Don't worry;
I know my cousin's greed all to well.
He won't let that land slip away.
Fourteen thousand and three shekels!
Eighteen thousand shekels!
you can't afford it.
but he doesn't. want to see how you get yourself out of it.
Eighteen thousand shekels going once!
eighteen thousand shekels going twice!
And eighteen thousand going...
Eighteen thousand and one!
Boaz?
your charity has no end.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
I'll bear any burden.
Your worries will be my own.
I've been blessed by your care.
for you are my home.
and stone only make a dwelling.
It's you that makes this house a home.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
Heaven smiles on us both;
for you are my home. ( end song)
Good morning.
You're up early.
You're both disgusting.
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.
So what are you gonna do?
Go backpacking... if you'll have me.
"Well, it's too late. i'm..."
I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
who?
- It's me.
Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time."
Melissa and i.
Oh. really?
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.
I want to do something for me.
And we'll just go as friends.
Don't worry. it won't be anything romantic Unless you know we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie
So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.
What's wrong with my tie?
Mm. i need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
So i'm the one who does the good deed
And that guy goes off with the girl?
It's good to be that guy.
Do you...you go here to n.y.u.?
And a piece of macaroni omeIet.
In case you get hungry...
Am I leaving on a trip?
- You have a tape worm.
- When I was a kid!
"Besides, if it eats the omelet, the ham and the bread, it's no little tape worm, it's a tape python!"
"Morning, Mrs. VoIpe."
- You're still here?
- AfuII employee.
She has to go!
"I understand, but why do I need this?"
"If you lose it, we'II replace it."
"Don't waste time, there's a line forming."
Want to be here till nightfall?
"I'm talking to a client, I can't do him Iickety split."
Take the toothpick out of yourmouth.
I need it so I don't stammer.
"I'II handle this man, you continue with the others."
- Mr.?
- Scapece.
What can we do foryou?
I'd Iike to apply for a Postamat.
Afriend?
Afriend of his came here and got a Postamat.
This friend gets his retirement pay accredited to his account so he can easily withdraw cash.
Without sweating blood.
Do you understand?
could you repeat that?
I got it!
Third window.
Come in.
- What is it?
Or else one day your scream will kill me.
Look..
"look brother, my heart is beating so fast."
"Forgive me, Airport my friend, but.."
"No brother, today I will have to.."
..tell you what your problem is.
Why do you have such dreams?
What else ajobIess person do otherthan have dreams?
till my dreams dont come true these..
..dreams will keep on following me.
Oh this means I will have to get you ajob.
"Come brother, I will talk to my producer about you today."
And get you ajob of spot boy.
Which hero is shooting over here?
"Hey forget about the hero, the producer and.."
..director Mr. N. Chandra is coming.
-Okay.
call him sir and fall on his feet.
But why should I call him sir?
Because this is how you greet here!
Come on!
-Sir!
What is it?
"-Sir, that.. he is Krishna."
"He is a very hard working boy, sir."
He wants a spot boysjob.
"Its a small thing, keep him."
Why do you need to ask me?
"You have done me a huge favour, sir."
Sir..
- He gave me a house to stay.
I had my clothes with me and you..
Yes.
Don't you think you should be at home?
With your husband?
"Darling, I wanna go home with you."
But I can't until I know the results of those tests.
"Alexis, I don't understand it."
"I mean, what are you doing?"
"Are you still choosing between me and Galen, with me in second position?"
"No, Dex."
I love you.
"Oh, God, we went through hell to rescue Galen."
Can't you understand?
Can't you try and support me like a husband should?
I find it hard supporting my wife's apparent love for another man.
Wrong tense.
I loved him once.
But I'm frightened for him now.
"Mrs. Dexter, King Galen is asking for you."
Thank you.
"And I'm frightened for us, Alexis."
I'll see you later.
"Hello, Galen."
- Alexis.
- Mm.
I was so afraid.
But not for my life.
I thought I might not ever see you again.
No.
"Here I am, larger than life."
And you're safe now.
"Your life is safe here, Galen."
"This cursed revolution, if it hadn't happened, I would never have let you leave Moldavia."
"And eww, why're you so dramatic?"
My hit points are going down
Sent!
What'd you send?
A picture of Lin getting excited about this gross room
"It's gross, isn't it?"
Yeah
But... awesome!
Thank you
"Kidding, I'm about to puke"
Big Sis...
Obviously I'm kidding.
Otherwise it'd just be offensive
"Anyways, love what you've done with the place"
Now it's not sad!
"The bathtub is pretty cool, too"
Really?
Can I take a look?
Of course.
This way
"Lin, come too"
Ok.
Can I take pics?
Sure
Holy crap!
Gross!
I didn't do anything with my life
That hunting today got me thinking
"When I was younger, I just watched anime or went to brothels and forgot about it"
"Ignoring the root of the problem, I was satisfied with immediate pleasure"
Youth is a crime
"No, I am full of potential"
"Not those kind of crabs, Ziva."
Ah!
There's the Tony we know and love.
"Boss,"
Baltimore PD's got a suspect in custody.
Got a 911 call about Petty Officer Adams before the sailors found him.
Came from a auto-repair shop two blocks away.
Said they found a mechanic there trying to wash blood off his hands and jacket.
Got the suspect's jacket.
"Lot of blood, boss."
Is this your jacket?
"Look, I'm being railroaded here."
What's your name?
Michael Thomas.
"You got a lawyer to call, Mr. Thomas?"
"No, I want to call someone else."
"They've got this all wrong, Leon."
"Just do what they say, Michael."
I'll take him to processing.
Your wife's kid brother?
"He's my family, too, Gibbs."
- Then you'll be recusing yourself.
- For what reason?
"He's a murder suspect, Leon."
"Those are your rules, not mine."
"I'm well aware, Gibbs, but as long as he's your suspect, I'm going, too."
"Gibbs, give us a minute."
Is that a problem?
"All right, just tell me, Michael."
Tell me you didn't do this.
"Leon, no, I was just trying to help the guy."
And you didn't know Petty Officer Adams?
"Thank you for coming, everybody."
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm sorry.
It's not every day my boss is chosen to be in a magazine.
Is he a good kisser?
"- Oh, my God."
Where's my dad?
"- Oh, he's running a little late."
"Would it be horrible if you just went and, uh, hung out in the kitchen for a little while?"
Then I can distract my dad somehow and...
"Alex, I got to tell you-- hiding's really not my thing."
"Could it be your thing for, like, five minutes?"
"All right, but I'm making a sandwich, I'm not cleaning up."
"Oh, excuse me, everyone, everyone."
"Um, my dad doesn't know about me and Scott, so let's not tell him, okay?"
Not that there's anything to hide.
"It was, like, one motorcycle ride."
It's always the motorcycle guys.
"Hey, honey."
"Oh, the traffic."
"Yeah, what are you gonna do?"
Hummus?
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Stephen... did you get it on tape?
"Dad, Dad-- you don't need to see the tape."
Here's how it went.
Surprise!
"Oh, my God."
This is so sweet.
"Ooh, hummus."
Was that cute or what?
Let's take a look at the tape.
You have no principles.
You're just like us.
"And you're selfish, too."
"You've gone nuts, haven't you?"
Just eat your fish.
"Moonsook, you have a lovely face."
Thank you.
My face is rather big.
Wish I could cut some off.
"No, you have a lovely face."
"You're drunk already, aren't you?"
"Yeah, a little bit."
"Moonsook, what makes you sad?"
"My father, maybe."
We don't see each other anymore.
Her father is a famous composer.
He's written many well-known songs.
"Now, I hate him the most."
But I'm also very sorry about it.
He's given me so much love.
"Every weekend, he'd take only me on his travels."
"He was like an octopus, wrapping me from behind in that closed grip, squeezing me and not letting go."
He worries about me more than I do myself.
But does that make sense?
It makes my skin crawl.
That's why she studied abroad.
To run away from him.
"Hey, you crying?"
Need this?
No thanks.
My tears are clean.
I have a question.
What about you?
Me?
I was alone...
Until now.
Openly flirting?
Have you never seen a pretty girl in your life?
"No, I was waiting for you."
Do you do anything else other than charm people?
Juggling.
"- Hey, we have just met, okay?"
- Okay.
Slow down.
Spend some time with me and you will find out everything.
"Oh, mystery."
You guys think that if you speak less..
..hide a few things then the girl will stay interested.
Your smile itself is mysterious.
If you can spare a moment from looking at me..
..then let me know what you'll drink.
Whatever you want.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Why do you do it?
"You got jealous, right?"
I mean... you are drinking alone to drown your sorrows.
You could have joined me.
Stupid girl.
That isn't my drink.
And I am not alone.
Who told you that?
- So who's with you?
- I've found someone.
- Who?
It was her evening gown Gina didn't want the messenger to see.
"And, in the normal course of events,"
Danny would have been suspected of the murder.
But things are never normal when little--
"Hey, look at the new dress."
Della picked it out.
"Oh, I did not."
Isn't she pretty?
Sure is.
How about a date?
"Merle, I think you owe these people a very, very large encomium."
"What for, Julian?"
Well-- thanks.
For saving your life.
"Oh, I was going to give them all a big kiss for that, silly."
"Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc."
"Burbank, CA"
"Now, you may not be the man I want, but don't make me kill you."
Turn around slow.
You John Tyree?
I am.
You and this country have already cost me a good horse.
Which one?
"You got your mind set on it, we'd better find out."
"One more thing, though."
I didn't kill the marshal.
Know that!
I didn't kill him.
I won't try to prove it.
Only the man in Texas.
"All right, where?"
"Is he a dentist, then?"
"Well, he's a dentish."
He's got a hammer.
Davus?
Yeah?
Smash out Grumio's bad tooth.
"Of course, boss."
Just give it a wipe.
Very good.
Very medical.
"All right, fella."
Just lean back for me there.
Do you not want to know which tooth it is first?
"Yeah, go on, then, mate."
It's that wonky one there.
I'll sort of aim in that ballpark.
Stay still for me.
"I-I might leave it, actually."
"Yeah, probably for the best."
"No, I don't like it!"
"Everyone's loving it under the new boss, man."
I've heard several people call you 'nice' and one woman even say 'fairly hot'.
"Well, if you listen to what people need, they will thank you for it."
"Thanks for letting me get my new partner, by the way, Big Paulus."
"Good, isn't he?"
"Well, he's tall, yeah."
Which is what it's all about now we've raised the jug and swapped the papyrus for apples.
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
"Oh, my Jove!"
Where did you get him from?
I just saw him guarding the grain store.
"I was, like, 'Big boy, you're coming with me!"
Would you like to speak to Mrs. Brown?
"Oh, no, no."
Don't disturb her.
I'll just leave these with you.
"What is it, Ellen?"
"It's Mr. Skinner, ma'am."
Harold!
What a surprise.
You're just in time for dinner.
"Oh, no, thanks."
"Well, I owe you a meal."
"Remember, you bought my lunch a few weeks ago, under pressure."
"Well, thanks."
I've eaten.
"I had an appointment with John,"
But he seems to have forgotten all...
"Well, come in."
I can't imagine John getting his appointments so mixed up.
"Darling, your act was absolutely priceless!"
Darling?
Mmm?
What are we going to do about John?
Do you have to worry about that now?
"Well, let's face it."
We're running out of ways to meet.
We can't pull this one again.
Ellen will be suspicious.
"And if I take you to lunch once more,"
John is going to start asking questions.
"Yes, I know."
Have you talked to him about bringing out the new line of modern stuff?
He won't discuss it.
I wouldn't.
Now put the gun down.
- Oh!
- You shot him!
- Are you okay?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I thought that's what the nod meant.
- It was.
It was awesome.
"It was actually just like the end of ""Speed,"""
which is a pretty good movie.
"It's not as good as ""Die Hard."" ""Die Hard""'s perfect."
"- Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis."
"- Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis."
"Same page, still."
- Get out of the car!
- Young Jeezy take the wheel!
"- Freeze, punk!"
"- Yeah, freeze, punk!"
"- Gina, where did you get that gun?"
- Lost and found at the storage facility.
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.
"- Hey, Figgis."
"My fiancé, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you,"
I should read you this letter.
"""I want to lick the skin off your body, baby."""
"Oh, that side's for me."
"""I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy."""
"- We're sorry we doubted you, sir."
You really saved our butts.
- I can't take credit for that.
"Nora, Johnny, you need anything..."
"Gary, Gary, get a plate."
You just dropped mustard on my half-dead ex-husband.
How you holding up?
"Surreal, man."
"All the patients we brought here, it's never personal."
This is...
I don't know.
"Hey, Mac said you can take the day off tomorrow."
Take as much time as you need.
"Oh, no."
I'm working.
"I sit here all day, I'll go crazy."
I came as soon as I could.
- What'd the doctor say?
- Could go either way.
"All right, so we got options."
"Okay, everybody, I'm selling squares 10 bucks a pop."
We're also doing pool bets...
Over/under's at three days.
- Mom...
- Over/under for what?
If he lives?
Either way pays.
I thought Johnny's parents were divorced.
They are.
There's no way an Irish woman would miss a good death.
Mom and Dad have a complicated relationship.
It's not complicated.
I hate him.
"But if my coma bets pay off, I'll love him."
"Frank, whatever you're gonna do, do it on Wednesday."
"Just take us through the logistics, Train Brain."
Okay.
Each of these blocks is a train car.
This is taking too long!
I need chocolate!
"Gene, quiet."
Sorry.
It's okay.
"Now, this is us here in the Juice Caboose."
I can see us in there.
Just kidding.
We're not inside a block.
Tina!
Okay.
"The only time the door to the caboose in unlocked, is when Ethan makes a juice box delivery, every hour on the hour."
Every hour on the hour.
Sounds like a robot.
Wait!
What if Ethan is a robot!
?
Gene!
Focus!
You guys are embarrassing me.
"In front of Rudy, which is hard!"
"Even if we get out of here, you still have to get all the way up to the kitchen car."
The chocolate is kept inside the chocolatier's refrigerator.
He's from Germany.
The chocolate's from Switzerland.
- We're from America.
- Yeah...!
"Now, the only time the kitchen is empty is when it's a passenger's birthday and the whole staff comes out to sing the ""Chugga Chugga Choo Choo Happy Birthday To You"" song."
"So, we know how to get in, but how do we get out?"
Bye-bye.
And we're out.
"Eddie, you did it again."
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving goodbye.
Sorry.
It's not rocket science.
"Stan, there you are."
Did you get my email?
About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought I could read a few of them on the air.
"Well, I don't really think we have time."
"Oh, sure, we have time."
I'll just pick the lotto numbers faster.
"Well, you see, Natalie, the show is about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you Monday.
Okay.
Jesus.
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they carry your voice from this microphone to that sound board.
"Well, can't you put them someplace else?"
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
"-You know, I should probably go."
"-Oh, come on, Golan."
How often do you get a night and a morning off?
-I'd stay for another.
-Okay.
--and the emotional response to love  is usually the result of a show of affection or favour.
"-Tom, can I use your phone?"
"-Yeah, it's right over there."
-I think we'd do really well together.
-Absolutely.
For a while.
"God, will you get past the cynicism?"
"I just broke up with somebody, baby."
I thought you forgot all about him.
Hello?
Al?
-Who are you with?
-Just some of the residents.
"I'd like to leave, but Sara's driving, and I don't want to be rude."
You want to come down?
No.
I'll see you when you get home.
All right.
You're ageist.
-That's what it is.
"-Oh, please."
Then what are you afraid of?
Breaking your heart.
"Running your ass into the ground, buddy."
Bollocks.
Why do you want to ruin this with domesticity?
"Because I've never met a braver woman and I'm deeply, deeply attached to you."
-What a fool you are!
What a fool!
-You are alive. I'll tearthem to pieces.
To pieces!
-What a fool!
Alive!
-Sucker!
-What's wrong?
-Windbag!
"- Calm down, everything is all right."
Get lost!
I do not want to see you here again.
"-Listen, why did not you shoot?"
- l was not going to.
-He must think I'm dead.
- lt's one ofthe tricks ofthis trade.
What's that?
"-Did you summon me, comrade mayor?"
-Yes I did.
The talk is to remain between you and me only.
The Malyutin company is to be reinforced with experienced soldiers
"- but there remained veryfew ofthem, right?"
"-Yes, sir."
So you'll augment the companywith the ones who have already been sentenced.
- ls everything clearto you?
"-Yes, everything is clear."
-But I do not have the right to fulfil your order.
- Theywill be sent on a mission that will nicely replace a firing squad.
"You know perfectlywell, Sergei Pavlovich, who can give me such orders..."
Damn the rules!
"You have changed a lot recently, comrade mayor!"
I'm sending my best soldiers out to this mission
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know."""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
- What's your point?
- You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"- That's my job, isn't it?"
- That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just...
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
Most of all friends.
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
"A man's life is not the bricks, it's the mortar."
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff...
"California, here we come!"
"Dinoco, here we come!"
"Oh... oh... uh, I needed this."
Hello?
"Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?"
"Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?"
And it is such an honor to be your agent that it almost hurts me to take ten percent of your winnings.
Merchandising.
And ancillary rights in perpetuity.
"Anyway, what a race, champ!"
"I didn't see it, but I heard you were great."
"Thanks, Harv."
"Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali."
I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.
"- You let Harv rock it for you, baby."
- Right.
Friends.
"Yes, there's..."
"OK, I get it, Mr. Popular."
So many you can't even narrow it down.
"Hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend!"
Break bread with your mishpocheh here!
That'd be great!
We should totally...
"OK, I gotta jump, kid."
Let me know how it goes.
I'm out.
What?
A minivan?
"Come on, you're in the slow lane."
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here.
So many choices.
It's not even practice and that one there is doing laps.
Isn't she pushing herself hard enough?
Remember when I pushed you?
It was just upstairs in the music room.
"Yes, I remember."
Do you remember the music you made?
[Piano playing]
It was perfect.
It made you perfect.
She can be perfect.
She shouldn't have to be.
[Gasps]
How long ago?
She was seen heading toward the pool about five minutes ago.
Where is it?
Just around the corner.
He can't get you now.
You're safe.
Open them up.
I can't. they lock from the inside.
That area is shelter in place.
Get around the corner.
Get around the corner!
There's something else about me that you should probably know.
[Groaning]
[Metallic clatter]
James:
There you are.
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Come on.
Just breathe.
- You worry too much.
"All our patients get VIP treatment, Bick."
God is blessed.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- Ah.
Owen.
I heard you were here getting your second cycle of temozolomide.
Yes.
"Yes, I finished my last fraction of radiation one month ago."
And look at you.
You look terrific.
"Well, uh..."
The therapy is working beautifully.
Uh... the last brain scan showed...
no tumor enhancement.
"- That's wonderful, news."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Now, is there any dizziness, fatigue,"
- No.
Weakness... seizure activity?
No to all three.
I feel like a new man.
"And if I, uh, may ask, h-how's the, uh, reconciliation going?"
"My son, Peter, he's forgiven me."
I plan to use every day I've got left to make up for the ones I wasn't here.
"Okay, now, as a fellow doctor, you'll be interested in this."
We have a new medication that we can add to your treatment regimen.
What is it?
It's experimental.
Valganciclovir.
The antiviral?
Mm-hmm.
!
"Health and Safety, rummaging through me stock!"
"All right, they found a little few things."
Couple of mice.
"So what's, what's the...?"
Few rat droppings in the lemon bonbons.
Couple of fruit salads was way past their sell-by date.
Three years.
"That's not a crime, though, is it?"
"Well, enough to get you shut down."
Is it enough for you to kidnap him?
That's what I want to know.
I'll tell you what I know - he don't know nothing about sweets.
And I've got sweets running through my veins!
I know that.
Look at me!
I know that.
"I'm on my own, I've got nothing!"
Open up.
"There you go, it's all right."
It's all right.
"Plenty of other, there's plenty of other sweet shops out there."
Could I have a bit of the strawberry laces?
There you go.
"I had everything, now I've got nothing!"
"There you go, eh?"
Time was of the essence.
We headed to the station.
For clues?
No.
For something a little more important than that.
"Come on, O'Leary, follow me."
It's not staph.
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
Which I would have seen in your MRI.
Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Let me see the MRI.
There was no abscess on the image.
"Let me see it, then."
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
That soft spot could now be an abscess.
"If it was staph, you'd have a fever."
Which you don't!
101.6.
What idiot gave you that?
Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
Triangle.
This one?
Uh... circle.
Next.
"Foreman, why aren't you answering?"
Is there a problem?
"Uh, s-square."
Tell me your date of birth.
Is that House?
- Yeah.
Next.
A square again.
Why is he here?
Because my neurologist is having surgery.
Thought I was just another patient.
"You didn't believe that crap, did you?"
Date of birth.
I don't see anything that I would consider to be art.
But you took the picture.
Just because ducky told me to.
- I'm sorry.
- That'okay.
I'm sure you find other things beautiful.
Like gibbs breaking up a chick fight.
I can't believe I missed that.
"Well,I've got good news."
Guess at is now playing on mcgee tv.
I hug and kiss technology.
You liar!
mee-yow.
Which one's siri?
The one that gibbs is pulling off e other girl.
It's always good to have a face to put with genetic material.
You get a match on h off finn's clothing?
Yeah.
But not just her.
There was a party in finn's pants.
I found genetic material from two distinct females.
- Siri and...
- A mystery woman.
That would explain why rebecca refused thcheek swab.
Told us she hadn't seen him in six months.
Play iagain.
"Plus,rebecca's got a lot of anger in her."
"Oh,I wouldn't assume siri is innocent."
Why not?
Look at the fight.
Siri initiates it.
She may not be as sweet as she looks.
"Really, really bad mistake!"
My lawyer just flew in.
Vogel will get me off.
"Oh, and there's super cop."
"God, you're so good, huh?"
You're really good.
Come around and watch a movie sometime.
"Where was the missing cuff link found,"
That it couldn't be recovered two years ago?
I'm unable to comment on that at this time.
Suffice it to say that mr.
Cardoza's name
And reputation has been cleared.
"Well, that door's not going to open itself."
Thank you.
Lieutenant.
"You know, uh,"
Tony enright is never going to see
The inside of a prison cell.
"Don't be too sure, mr."
Vogel.
"Actually, I'm dead sure."
I want you out of miami.
Have you come to wish me bon voyage?
"By the way, if you're ever in the emirates,"
Don't bother to call.
"Don't worry, I'll get the door."
Thank you.
"You would have done the same for me, jesse."
"Zeltzer, did you fix the lighting in scene 4?"
"Okay, people, please concentrate."
"Hey, this is with a typewriter."
It's from a finance company.
So it is from the finance company.
So it's better than no letter at all.
So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.
"So they want the fourth, the fifth the sixth, the seventh."
So they want the Plymouth.
"""Sugar Lips"" Shapiro."
"Amazing, ain't it?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
- You believe what?
-My wife.
"She says, ""Darling, you won't believe it but I found the most adorable baby on our doorstep and I've decided to keep it for our very own."
"Now, you won't believe it, but it's got exactly my eyes and nose."""
"Why does she keep saying ""I don't believe it""?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
I believe it.
"This is it, gentlemen."
Don't bother to scrape your shoes.
"Okay, gang."
Meet our new guests.
This is Lieutenant Dunbar and this is Sergeant Bagradian.
A lieutenant?
Knock it off.
Knock it off.
The pleasure's all mine.
- How are things?
-What's doing on the outside?
"Yeah, what's new in the States?"
"Well, the skirts are shorter, if that's what you mean."
This high council is adjourned.
[âª]
Mace?
Follow da veiga.
Tap into his tracer frequency.
He'll see the power spike.
It will be too late.
"Thanks, karen."
I'm not surprised you can't find
Any information on the scabbard.
"Well, I still have a few more"
People to hear back from.
Do you want me to wait?
No.
It seems we've stirred up
The hornet's nest here.
"I need you to pack up,"
Get out of there
And just keep your phone on.
You don't have to ask me twice.
"Okay, thanks, kate."
"No, interpol have no information"
On the scabbard either.
Looks like we've reached a dead end.
What about your father's house?
"Yes, it's possible"
He already has the scabbard.
You don't mean go there?
We'd be sitting ducks.
I know the combination to his safe.
Great.
And I think I can get us past the alarms.
Right?
"You heard it too, right?"
You think I'm deaf?
But why did you say you didn't hear?
What point is there in me fanning the flames?
You could see the team manager's eyelashes trembling.
"It's possible she could've mistaken herself for a moment, but why did she have to get angry?"
That's the first time I've seen the team manager act like that.
I was so shocked.
"Yeah, it was a bit unexpected."
Oh yeah.
I got an email asking me to call.
Let me have the phone.
"All right, I'll send it to you by phone."
It's not coming out well.
You're so sensitive.
"That's right, I'm sensitive."
Who is it?
The person who unexpectedly got angry.
Oh no...
You heard?
You think I'm deaf?
We weren't talking behind your back.
"Yes, you were."
"Yeah, Oppa?"
Are you okay?
Of course.
Did you eat lunch?
I just ate some noodles and am getting back to work.
"You're really okay, right?"
Has he called you?
He hasn't called since the day before yesterday.
Lieutenant caine.
The beatles played on this stage.
I know that.
I was here.
You come alone?
Just like I said I would.
Why here?
I like my privacy.
"What's this all about, caine?"
Where'd you get this photo?
You let jesse cardoza take the fall for something you did.
"What exactly do you want, caine?"
I want you to come clean.
All right.
We knew enright had murdered his wife.
"And we had him, too."
Dead to rights.
"When I saw that cuff link,"
"I knew that his slick lawyers would get him off,"
So I pocketed it.
"No harm, no foul."
The right guy goes down.
And that's the way it should be.
But I had no idea
Cardoza had already taken a photograph of it.
So you allowed it to look like he tampered with evidence.
I figured he was young.
Get a couple weeks
"Desk duty, slap on the wrist."
"Yes, but it didn't turn out that way, did it?"
No.
His wife was murdered- probably by enright.
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving good-bye.
- Sorry.
- It's not rocket science.
- There you are.
Did you get my email?
- About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought
- I could read a few of them on the air.
- I don't really think we have time.
Sure we have time.
I'll just pick the Lotto numbers faster.
"You see, Natalie, the show's about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you really.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you monday.
Jeez!
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they Carry your voice from this microphone to that soundboard.
Can't you put them someplace else?
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
"Fine, I'll do it."
"Okay, what are you doing?"
Are you mental?
"By the end of this, one out of four people in this country will know who you are."
The monkey too.
How does that sound?
What's that going to get me?
That would be great for you!
There's no file.
What do you mean there is no file?
There never was a file.
Then make a file.
"Sure, then tell me where to start."
I will.
Now.
Soon.
Stamps?
- Stamps?
What should I do with those?
I don't write letters.
I don't have anything else.
"I know, I know."
How long can you get by with this here?
"Franz, are you still there?"
Yes!
How long can you get by with this here?
I won't be here for a while you know.
Where will you be?
"Yeah, up north in Scandinavia."
Scandinavia?
That should be nice.
That's what I'm saying.
You have to make sure that you and your comrades here are taken care of.
I gave that poetry book of yours to Roswitha for her birthday.
She was quite delighted.
"I'm the house, you're the player."
"I believe the word is ""sucker. """
Okay.
"I've got a nine up, and you've got a five and a six for 11."
Do you want a card?
I want to double down.
"KITT, that's doubling your bet and you only get one card."
You sure you wanna do that?
Is the house in the habit of advising the player?
Your money.
I believe that's 21.
"Thank you, michael."
"They call that ""beginner's luck,"" pal."
"As I understand it, the phrase is,"
"""shut up and deal. """
"Hold on to your horses, hotshot, we've got Devon on the line."
"Hello, Devon!"
"Hello, michael."
I'm glad to see that you're getting into the spirit of things.
"Yeah, I'm already $2 behind."
What's up?
"Uh, there's, uh, someone I want you to check out for me since you're going through Las Vegas, anyway."
"Her name is, um, Rita Wilcox."
She works at Caesars Palace.
"Okay, what are we looking for?"
I'm not sure.
She tells a provocative but fantastic story about a missing brother.
All right.
I'll see what she has to say.
"With any luck, we should be pulling in to Vegas about 10:00, 10:30 tonight."
See you later.
Right.
How?
I killed the people that fucked me.
"That's it, if you fuck me you'll die."
"Come on, baby!"
"No, it's true!"
It's not true.
I'm serious.
I'm serious too.
Hey you!
How many people want me see me fuck Margaret and not die?
It's too much Adrian
Lay off!
There's something very strange going on here.
I'm going to leave.
Right there's something strange going on here.
I bet you 300$ that I can fuck Margaret and not die.
Of course she won't die.
But I'm not sure watching you fuck is worth 300$.
But it sure sounds interesting.
I'd like to watch but I'm not sure Margaret's in the mood.
Adrian!
"You should stay away from me, I'm a killer."
"You like to fuck, baby, better than anything in the world."
I don't want you!
Why not?
Because I'm killing all the people that I fuck.
"You kill me bitch, that's the joke of all time."
Adrian...
Leave me alone.
You like it honey?
You like it...
"Don't do it, Adrian."
- Not one stinking customer.
"We had some really great times living at the old Newman Home, until we got pro contracts and our mom made us move back in with her."
Here's the thing.
"We've got a plan to save our home, but we need a sponsor."
And who better than three glorious hockey heroes from Charlestown's past?
- Good idea.
- Smart kid.
Who were you thinking of?
You guys.
- You'd sponsor us?
- I don't know.
Hockey's pretty violent.
We gave that up with the bar fights and the gambling.
Not our path.
"Look, it'd be great advertising."
"We'll be travelling all over the state, playing a new style of hockey."
Just think.
Zenovation on ice.
"Come on get it, boys."
Here you are.
Look at the pads!

Good save.
Nice catch.

It's Henri.

Manoj.
Why is he sobbing like this?
How many shocks in the truth can he bear to hear in a day?
He will be normal in a while.
You left him to sob alone?
- What do you want me to do?
He is crying by himself.
You should be the one to console him.
Go.
- Not again!
"So, she has been selectively cheating blind men."
They have to be blind...
They must believe her stories.
Must be ready to give the money she asks.
She targets those people.
in the name of love...
And made a clean sweep.
"If my instincts are right, even now... she should be cheating someone..."
Call Priya.
Priya...
Where are you?
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire."
"You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass."
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire"
"You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually."
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."

He's getting his food...

I need to know what happened.
"So... there's no party and it's just us, and what, this is some sort of set up?"
You're his friends.
I thought you might be able to help.
"- Come on, Paul."
We're going.
- I can't drive.
I'm pissed.
There was a party at the end of the summer term.
I think something might have happened there.
"He topped himself, mate."
It's sad but it happens.
I don't see what we can do about it.
And you shouldn't have got us to come here under false pretenses.
That's just out of order.
This was in his pocket.
Did any of you send it?
This is the key.
This is what drove him to it.
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"""
What does this mean?
"I mean, you're his friends, you must have some idea."
I've heard enough of this.
I'm leaving.
Who's coming?
- But we can't take the cars.
"- Yeah, well, we can take our chances."
"I'm not finish yet, Chris."
"Well, I am."
Step aside.
I can't do that.

Well perhaps if Mrs.Cole could carry on her good work with Hilliard on set.
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent!
Excellent!
Stick to the side...slowly forward.
Two steps.
Look to the side.
No.
Left side's the camera.
The good side.
"Mr.Ducard. Thank you, please...if you don't mind Ducard."
And...
Johnnie is hit!
Keep it in rear view please.
Thank you.
Could you move please?
Trying to get big boy up there.
Sorry.
Tea.
Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I played it rather convincing, don't you think?"
Yeah!
You did!
"Say, are...are those walkcakes?"
Like to know when it's ready.
It's very much on it's way.
Jesus Christ!
"Hold on, darling."
"911, there's been an accident."
Yes.
You okay?
"You didn't see it, did you?"
Seewhat?
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
John.
There's something wrong with me.
It's called a glioblastoma.
It's a temporal lobe tumor.
"According to the doctor, it's extremely rare."
"600,000 gets this thing."
Did they say it was a result ofthe accident?
"No, it turns out... that it's been there a while."
There's nothing else they can do?
"No, no."
"They did the surgery, and they couldn't get it all out, so they'll... keep her on the chemo... as long as her strength holds out."
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.
Good.
That's good.
Two weeks ago... we were house hunting.
One day you're just driving along in your car and the universe... just points at you and says...
"""Ah, there you are, a happy couple."
I've been looking for you.
"I've been looking for you""."
I'm sorry.
For what?
For all of this.
MAN:
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
katherine:
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
DAVID:
Fuck you.
EMERSON:
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
And Becca...
I think you've met Becca before.
"Yes, I've met Becca before."
It's good to see you.
Hi nice to meet you.
You too.
Wow...
How are you?
I'm sorry I was actually just about to take off.
"Aw well that's too bad, well listen my tour got pushed back a month or so... so I'm going to be around."
"Oh, and hey listen tomorrow night my band and I are doing a little set at the Hotel Cafe if you guys... want to come by that would be great."
"Yeah, sure."
I love your music.
Thank you.
"Ok maybe, maybe we will."
"Well, just email me the address and..."
Yeah.
Oh...
"Ah, I think the Pap's have found you and um... your girlfriend's kind of looking a little lonely."
No pictures.
"Oh, that's actually not my girlfriend it's just a girl who's my friend."
"Oh right, um hum."
"Hey, Cece this is my friend Dale."
Hi.
"- Hey, nice to meet you."
I'm just going to get my stuff.
"Ok, we will..."
Don't forget to email me.
Don't forget to come.
So you guys all went to Catholic boarding school together?
OK I can't imagine that.
We've known each other since we were fifteen.
"Relax, kid."
Nobody knows.
"Relax, kid."
Nobody knows.
They're going to find me.
They're going to find me.
I said relax!
I said relax!
"Here, buy yourself a lolly."
"Here, buy yourself a lolly."

Why is he being like that?
He's just drunk.

LOVE
The perfect girlfriend would be...
Sweet and loving...
Back you up even in bad times.
Love...
I don't know if I've tried it...
"Well, of course I love all my friends."
I love mum and dad.
But real passion... no.
There's status in having the right boyfriend.
It gives you status.
If you're rich with loads of money it isn't cool to have a poor boyfriend.
A student on a... grant or whatever they go on.
The boys have most of the say.
It's always been like that among people like us.
They make the money.
She has to look good.
Of course she has to be nice.
If I'm going to marry her and have kids   and a joint bank account and all that shit   she's got to be nice.
- Is Sofie OK?
- Ask her.
- What happened?
- He doesn't want to discuss it.
- My sister's in a porn mag.
- Where can I get a copy?
- At the kiosk.
- You sisters are so fucked up.
-You got change of 20?
"-Oh, yes, sir."
What's your number again?
-82.
-82.
I put your number ahead of the other guys.
"-Thank you, sir."
-I like the way you work.
"All right, let me look at that robe a minute, will you?"
"Get this polished while you're down there, too."
"This may be a little gaudy for the Waldorf, but in certain sections of Manila, may I tell you...?"
"Hey, look, kid, uh, where's the latri-- uh, the shower?"
"Right over there, sir."
"Be a little indecent, showering alone."
You're all right.
-Did I get your number?
-82.
"Yeah, all right."
"Oh, I want this suit pressed."
I want those creases you can cut butter with.
I'll do it right away.
"Wait, hold it, this is the important..."
See these stripes?
"When you steam it, don't get 'em up."
You know what I mean?
-Keep 'em nice and shiny.
-I certainly w...
Six stripes?
"Well, you're a master sergeant."
How do you know?
Were you in the service?
"Oh, yes, sir, I was a lieutenant."
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
"She may know much, if properly motivated."
"I tell you, the girl knows nothing."
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.
But it needn't concern you.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We've hit stone!
Clear it off.
"Come on, find the edges."
"Good, good, good."
"You see, Indy?"
You see?
"Okay, bring the pry bars in."
"As a team, boys!"
As a team!
Push!
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.
"Good, good, that's it."
Watch your toes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"Sorry, Indy."
Indy... why does the floor move?
"Bu next time you're staying, all of you."
Bye.
- Have a good night.
Come on you guys.
I don't mean to be rude but Can I get an autograph?
Oh yeah sure.
Thanks.
I'm a big fan.
Thank you.
Wow that is... a lot of tequila.
I'm just letting you know now that tequila and I are a wild mix.
Things might get silly.
All right but only if you do a wrap around.
"Go like this,"
I'm not going to let you put your penis n my ass either.
"It's an out hole, not an in hole."
Why are you being such a prude?
I'm not being a prude.
I'm just not a porn star OK!
You wanna announce our lake of sex in front of everybody?
I've just got the wedding on my mind.
Oh what a surprise.
You haven't had any input BTW.
"BTW, Jesus."
It's because I work and I don't sit at home eating chips and dip and obsess over the wedding.
What?
It is disgusting what you are doing.
You're a pig.
I'm a pig?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you guys Ok?
"I heard a noise, just checking..."
"It's getting colder, wear an undershirt."
There are no cleaning materials left...
Dad?
Tie up yourhair.
Take care of yoursister.
"No, I still have things to take care of here."
"Kezban, enough!"
"Watch out, this could be the end of us."
"Don't worry, Dad."
This is yourfinal year anyway.
"Just finish school, do your military service, and come back home."
"Business is bad, I need help."
There is a teaching position in college here.
See?
He is lusting aftersinful gains.
"Don't keep us waiting, son."
Business is really bad.
"You don't say, dad."
Do you want me to go bankrupt?
"I can't breath without you, son."
I could've driven you.
No need.
You take care of yourhomework.
May God protect you from the evil eye.
"Finally, the nightmare is over."
They wouldn't even leave your corpse behind in Istanbul...
Damn.
My hands stink of bleach.
C'mon I'll drop you off at school.
And where you off to?
"- Misty, moisty, morning, full of birds..."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"I don't know whose day's been worse, yours or mine."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You?
I never thought I'd see something like that.
It's different when they roll in on a gurney.
"Yeah, but you stepped up."
That's all that counts.
I did my job.
At least we saved one of them.
- So I heard she gave an ID.
- Partial one.
I filled in some details.
"What, you saw the guys?"
A glimpse as they drove off.
"- They were black, huh?"
- I think so.
You think so?
"Well, it was quick, you know?"
But- And I only saw one of them.
So that's why the cops are picking up brothers all over town.
I told them what I saw.
"What you saw, or what you thought you saw?"
"I was trying to help, Greg."
Can't you see you fed right into what they always wanna jump to?
"Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but that's on the cops, not me."
It's all part of the same thing.
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"- So, what, now I'm a racist?"
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
"You said you all moved to Paris, but Mom said your parents died back in Algeria."
Papa died 12 years ago and Mama died two months later-.
12 years?
We had grandparents until 12 years ago?
Why didn't we meet them?
Your mom shunned them until they died.
"She didn't speak to them, only to me."
"Aunt Rosa, where's Maurice?"
Please tell us.
Do you know who Isabelle Moretti is?
- The actress?
- Yes.
Talk to her.
- What does she have to do with Maurice?
- She knew him.
Look her up and talk to her.
"This isn't Hollywood, she's just an actress-."
Now leave me alone.
Who are you talking about?
Why should we talk to Moretti?
Why can't you tell us?
"- I don't want to, okay?"
- Why not?
Who are they talking about?
"About Madame Isabelle Moretti, no more and no less."
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
We start with Romeo and Juliet and end up with Isabelle Moretti.
"Suddenly Mom jumps out of windows, has abortions, she's a Communist."
I don't know who you're talking about but it sure isn't my mother.
And to top it off you invent grandparents.
Great.
Do you want to see a miracle?
It is your law.
The puppet who made you jump in the air.
You do not jump and do not jump no more!
None!
None!
You can not understand.
I come!
I promise.
- Do you want systems too?
- No!
I have no shame.
It's not my fault.
The fault is mine.
Idiot.
Where have you hunted?
"Fear not, the police will be here in 3 minutes."
"First, let me speak."
"I, the massacrer of the evening, I was not there."
I don't know this gentlemen at all
"If you do this for me, there has never was a girl in the courtyard ..."
Silence!
What the hell on earth are you looking for?
I don't know.
We are not going to play a tambourine together.
She certainly has a motto princely.
"Wherever I walk, the rogue disappears."
"""The countess scal ..."" ie ""the barefoot princess,"" so to speak ..."
Mankiewicz ...
You have seen death the mother at the hands of Venini.
The 4 brothers Venini ...
The 4 fingers of Mickey ...
It takes a lot more than this rain... to wash away their sins.
Be sexy in the rain!
Thank God!
Aleluia!
Aleluia!
You know what we need?
- The lightning machine.
- Lightning!
Lightning machine?
Let's get out of here.
"Maybe we should stick around, get lost then start to move faster!"
I'm freezing.
Call me a cube.
"This is unbeareable, cube."
"I can't believe they're making rain... for the photo shoot with, water from the Hudson river!"
They're crazy!
We're all gonna get typhoid-d!
"Listen, we gotta take off these clothes."
We don't wanna get pneumonia.
Do you think they'd mind if I wore something from the wardrobe?
No!
Go for it.
It's too jay.
"These things are supposed to be worn, not framed."
- I'm swimming in it!
- Hang on.
Where's your head?
Hang on.
"That's it, that's it."
There you go.
What's that?
Hang on!
Sir is calling.
Must be the wife's massage.
Today I'm on duty.
Otherwise someone like you has never been spared by me.
Get his information and let him go.
You came out to be intelligent.
You don't look like one.
But you are.
But How did you put the gun in my bag?
I'm shocked.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were looking on your left your left.
I came slowly...
"but that bag of yours, it was in the left."
"Here is your gun, and listen."
You met me here.
Don't meet me there.
Understood?
"I don't take help, not even from my father."
You know my nature.
But I know your nature.
Your size is 52 but you wear 48.
"How do you know, Sir?"
"If it was 52, wouldn't you be adjusting again and again."
"Okay, tell me which room is under my name."
"Your name, Sir?"
Laxminarayan.
Okay
Listen.
A letter is suppose to arrive on my name.
"One minute, let me check."
"We""re going to be together, Lisa."
"L""ve got it all arranged so Clara won""t have to know."
"That""s it?"
"That""s your big announcement?"
"That""s what you wanted to tell me?"
"Well, what did you expect?"
"For me to say I""d leave Clara for you?"
Yeah.
I did.
I just did.
Sleep with me.
Just tonight.
"L""m afraid to go home."
Is she smiling or...
"Have you seen what I""ve turned her into?"
My daughter.
"My brilliant, talented, grown-up daughter hates me."
"No, she""s ashamed of me."
I have six dental practices.
I employ 50 people.
I put bread on their tables.
I work seven days a week... to build something my mom and dad could be proud of.
"Now it""s meaningless."
"Overshadowed, negated by David""s mortal sin."
- Maybe I should go.
- You have to understand.
"When I first met Clara, I never imagined I would ever..."
"Back then, her accent was so strong, she""d say, ""David."""
"That was the only thing she""d say that I could understand."
"But still she""d talk and she""d talk... and I""d watch her."
I could watch her forever.
I used to look at her... and think I had more respect for this woman than anyone I have ever known.
- No.
- I feel all right.
- That's good.
I'm glad.
I'm getting old.
- Are you getting old?
- I don't remember everything.
"But you know what you always said, Dad?"
- What?
- You said that when a person reaches 80... they have the right to forget whatever they want.
- Is that right?
- That's what you said.
"So I tell everybody, if they forget something..."
"I said my father says, ""When you're 80, you can forget - you have the privilege to forget whatever you want."""
- How do you like that?
- [Chuckles]
I made that as a real... appointment... and maybe it's really true.
- I've got something for you.
"- No, no, no."
- I've got something for you.
- What do you got?
What have you been asking for for the last two weeks?
- I don't know.
What did I ask for?
- Take a look.
Come on.
"Oh, for heaven's sake."
Thank you.
My husband looks good.
[Chuckles]
What can I say?
I used to be thin once upon a time... believe it or not.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
"Two in the neck, four in the back."
Or was stabbed three times.
Look at the pattern.
"Two, two, and two."
Three times...
With a pair of scissors.
"Yes, that's possible."
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
"- Spur of the moment, not planned."
- Plus...
The mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would've seen that."
So she was running when she left the building.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
"I guess you can say that there were 12 million people with a motive, myself included."
This was the Lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What's what?
On her fingertips.
It took me a year and a half.
It wasn't until he tried to hit my baby Stevie that I left.
A year and a half?
You leave your brains in a box somewhere?
He loved me.
Oh.
He told me so.
He just hit me 'cause I'm ugly.
You're not ugly.
You got a place to stay?
Yeah.
I found a cheap motel across from the airport.
"Cheapest place I could get, but... two or three nights working here, I think I can get a good place, move out of there."
And what if that bruiser comes looking for you?
He won't.
I talked to God at Kennedy Airport in New York before I left.
He told me that I have to live for my baby.
So I told him that I would kill anybody who tried to hurt me like that.
I don't think God is going to let Danny come near me again.
Dorothy?
Yeah?
I don't think it's gonna work out for you here.
I'm gonna have to let you go.
What?
I'm sorry.
It's just the way things worked out.
Help me.
What are you worried about?
I've known Frank Doss and Mr. Cannata for years.
"I'll speak to them, I'll explain things...."
It's gonna be all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you remember the day my grandmother died?
Jenna?
Remember how they let me in so that I could kiss her goodbye?
"There was this pain in my heart that day that I had never felt before,"
and that I've never felt again until now.
I feel like I'm mourning the death of the single most important thing in my life.
Us.
"But we're not dead, Jenna."
"We're not dead, baby."
We just have to go back.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.
Please love me enough to let us go back to the way things were.
"I don't think I can, Michael."
"Well, then, we'll start something new, but we have to try, right?"
How can we not try?
Jenna?
Jenna?
Western grip?
Western grip?
Correct.
Just like holding hands.
Holding hands?
Like this?
- I don't know how.
- I don't know how.
Yamete kudasai.
Ah?
Please stop doing that.
- Can't hear you.
He wanted me to come up there with him.
You didn't go.
- You did the right thing.
"- No, I didn't."
He had no business there without a ghost.
"That should have been me, plus backups."
But Eddie was such a hothead...
I mean the kind that never cools off.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
"This one it set Tino up for the max, 10 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer...
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State Parole Officer.
Better pay and pension.
- Nicer surroundings.
- Think so?
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease...
Stop.
Just go.
Pleeeeease can we slow down?
Ow!
You're chafing my wrist.
Don't pretend you're not loving this.
Okay.
All right.
I think I just skated through some pee.
C-can we go back now?
- No!
- God.
"No, because we are not appointment-making control freaks."
We are having fun.
You are.
I'm just doing what you're making me do.
"Okay, okay, stop."
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Let's go back, let's go back, let's go back."
Why?
Why do we have to go back now?
"Why... oh, I get it."
I get it.
You're still scared to skate through the underpass.
"What do you mean, ""still""?"
"What do you mean, ""scared""?"
What underpass?
"Mitchell, you were 11 years old, and mom made me take you with me when I was skating with my friend Sophie King, and you were terrified to go through the underpass 'cause it was dark, and you were sure it was filled with monsters,"
so we ditched you.
I don't remember this at all.
"-Oh, BIanche."
"-Yes, it is, it is."
Or I wouldn't say it.
You just have to watch around the hips a little.
"I want you to look at my figure, you know?"
"I haven't put on one ounce in 1 0 years, stella."
I weigh now what I weighed the summer you left belle Reve.
The summer Dad died and you left us.
"It's just incredible, BIanche, how well you look."
Sure you wouldn't like another?
well....
"well, maybe I will just take one tiny nip more."
"Just to put the stopper on, so to speak."
"Now, don't get worried."
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up and hot and dirty and tired.
Waiter.
Waiter.
-You want it hot?
-ScaIding.
-stella.
"-What is it, hon?"
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.
We'II put you right here.
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?
-feel all right?
"-wonderful, honey."
I don't like a bed that gives much.
"stella, there's no door between the two rooms, and StanIey--"
-will it be decent?
"Let me talk to Pete, okay?"
"Oh, Pete got fired this morning."
That's so weird that you don't know that.
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show?
Hell no.
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
"You know, I moved from Chicago for this."
From Chicago?
I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding.
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
He fired Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
"You know what, I quit."
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.
20 minutes to air.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What--what do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye--"
You mean this eye?
It's not what you think.
"Amira, you are planning an attack at school."
Please!
"Please, Drew."
Let me at least try to explain.
After we broke up...
I was lonely.
"I went online, started talking to this guy from back home."
"A friend, but he didn't like this country."
I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear - just to keep talking to someone.
But it wasn't real.
"Not for me, Drew."
Never for me.
None of it?
No.
"Please, Drew, you know me."
And you told all of this to Mr. Harris?
Yes.
"And I showed him all the texts from Kasym,"
Where I am telling never to contact me again.
What he was talking about was crazy.
So what is Mr. Harris going to do?
"He say he'll tell the principal that he believes me, then we see what happens from there."
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I know you only did this because you care for me.
And it's made me realize that I feel the same way.
Can we talk later?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
"I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya,"
"- Me, too."
- Good!
So that's the end of it.
"A few weeks ago, the beast was circling the village."
Farm animals and pets were going missing.
I tracked it to this area.
It's between two farms.
Prime hunting ground.
Good job.
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah.
See that tree over there?
Yeah.
Go and stand under it and leave me alone.
- What?
- Just trying to imagine what you were like when you were my age.
You must have worn a lot of black.
Here.
Don't break anything.
"So, what's the deal with you and Kyle?"
"He needed someone to put him on camera,"
I needed an extra-ordinary graduation film to kick-start my career.
We sort of found each other.
- So you two are...?
- For a bit.
Then Kyle...
"Well, I mean he decided that work was..."
"Great, let's share life stories while my camera battery drains."
"Kyle, your public's waiting."
"So, Kyle, tell us what's going on."
This is Shannon Kelly.
Hi.
"I mean, you should be angry, too."
Look what they did to you and what's-his-name--Charlie.
Look at that!
"I mean, how can you sit here and let that kind of thing go unanswered?"
"Come on, we don't need to talk about that."
"What, we're not supposed to tell Allie she's a test-tube baby?"
You sorry bastard.
Hey...
Charlie's hurt.
Yeah.
Is he going to be all right?
"I don't know, honey."
If Ray will let us get him to the hospital...
No one's going anywhere until I get what I want.
( knock on door )
GUARD:
Campus security.
Dr Penzler?
We had a report of a gunshot.
Hands up.
Get your hands up.
"Yeah, you keep 'em up there."
Okay.
Here's the situation.
"I'm holding these people hostage, all right?"
I've already shot one of them.
I'm angry and unpredictable.
Look at me!
"What we're doing here, we're waiting for the FBI."
There's two more security officers coming from other parts of the campus.
"Yeah, so?"
What do you want me to do about them?
The kind he always gets from the office.
Okay.
"I'll be right back, okay?"
Why is the door locked?
Sorry.
Reflex.
Hey.
That was the man who shot Haskell.
- Who was?
- The messenger who was just here.
- What'd he bring you?
"- You're joking, right?"
No.
It was him.
That was his helmet and his jacket.
"I'm sorry, I'm not following."
Ils there a reason an assassin would be delivering packages to me at home?
"He was here, so you tell me."
"III will take this as some kind of a reaction to the trauma of what you saw, and I will ask you..."
Did you see the man's face at the shooting?
No.
- Did you see it today?
"- No, he was wearing a helmet."
Was there something distinctive about that helmet or that jacket which tells you it was the same man?
No.
There wasn't.
"Okay, then."
Do you feel better?
Yeah.
"So, what was the delivery?"
"From the office, some files."
Why?
"- No, I wouldn't dare put anyone out."
"The ambulance won't be here for two hours, shall we grab some grub?"
"Here, you buy what you like!"
"Cigarettes, candy..."
But there was no fog in Budapest.
What was the name of your mental hospital again?
Will you remember my bros' names?
I'm so sorry... it's my head... hurts...
"Beauty, fitness, sickness, women!"
That's my cousin's name...
"Whatever, all of them whores."
Except one!
Dig it?
"""Clog""!"
Here you have to buy!
"And to buy, you have to pay!"
Enjoy it?
"Snap, rush, touchdown!"
"Here, they shield everything in the same way."
"Their women, their armchairs, their money, their paintings."
"They're so wary, and rightly so."
Now we're fisting!
- Glitz and glamor...
"- Come on, Prince!"
Like some shit?
Have it!
Choke on it!
See that!
"Fisticuffs, huh?"
Do you think I look snazzy enough?
"My partings, my nails... my feet?"
My earrings.
"How was, um..."
"""I... am... fine."""
Okay.
I guess that clears that up.
"Back to work, people."
As you were.
"Yeah, we'll talk..."
Nice post-it.
"Yeah, well, the last thing I need are people feeling sorry for me."
Is there any thing else?
'Cause I have a few weeks of work to catch up on.
Nothing.
"Well, just... the Campbell interview's this afternoon."
"- You ready or, uh-- - yeah, I can handle it, Jimmy."
Who's this?
Does it really matter?
And... these?
"It's your future, dude."
"You know, I didn't want you coming back to an office full of..."
Marjorie.
Nice.
- You want to talk about it?
"- No, I'm good."
- 'Cause I'm here if you want to.
- I know you are.
"Thanks, Jimmy."
Thank you.
"Okay, uh..."
"This is officially now, uh, an M.F.Z.--"
A Marjorie Free Zone.
"So we're rolling out the teaser campaign 2 weeks before the 21st, which is the hard date the game actually hits the stores, and the web site goes live with online, tv and trade pub print being our tent poles."
We also are doing game rental inserts.
Stop!
Francis!
Bash!
Stop!
Stop!
"Please, stop!"
You don't have to marry him!
It's all over!
"My mother, nostradamus,"
They say we can be wed.
What do you mean?
There is no prophecy keeping us apart.
"Please, listen..."
Does it matter?
"Mary, nothing needs to change."
We can still be wed.
"What do you mean, no prophecy?"
Even nostradamus will tell you.
Your fate is your own when it comes to who will you marry.
Him or me.
I knew he would get to you in time.
"Did your seer tell you that, too?"
Is this a game to you?
Nostradamus told me the prophecy was fulfilled.
With clarissa's death.
How can I believe you when you have so much to lose?
"oh, god, what are you doing?"
"Do nothing, and I will die."
"Watch me, if that's what it takes"
To convince you I'm not putting
My life ahead of my son's.
I never have.
"I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader."
Get them all out of here.
"Come on, get out of here."
On your feet.
Hold them there.
"Naik, detail eight men for escort duty."
Bring them here on the double.
"Listen, you."
What became of Burgess sahib?
"- Come on, spit it out."
"- He can speak, but he won't."
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
"You never saw one of these things before, did you?"
"It's for growing daisies, isn't it?"
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
"- No, sahib."
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No.
Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
"By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling."
Never mind the second chorus.
Come on.
"Party, form a square!"
"Under cover, everybody!"
Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
"Tits, Franco."
"That's what real tits look like,"
OK?
Johnny giant fake boob.
"Yeah, well, excuse me for"
"Being an American, OK?"
I like to suck on big tits.
Now it's a political issue?
I'm a terrorist because I like
Real tits?
"It's political, what are you"
Talking about?
What about the sad fags?
What sad fags?
"Guys, guys."
Are we actually arguing about
"Tits, come on."
Ladder.
Batallion.
"You know what, guys."
I know this address.
My cousin's a sculptor.
He used to have a studio in this
Place.
It's like a whole warehouse.
"It's divided up into, like a"
"Million, tiny little rooms."
Just keep your head straight
"Cause you get lost in there, it"
Can get real confusing real
"Fast, you know?"
You got a cousin who's a
He will notice
Where 's your corset?
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.
But you are not properly dressed
"Who is to say what is ""proper""?"
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""was wearing a codfish on your head, would you wear it?"
Alice ...
"For me, a corset is like a codfish"
"Please, not today."
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
"It's always the same, ever since I can remember"
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
"Now, can you manage to smile?"
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive
"Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you ."
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4?
Now everything I've been rushed through
- I am sorry.
"- Oh, nevermind."
Forgive my wife.
What is his name?
Just write it down!
I don't know.
You know that.
I've told you this story so many times.
"You know he would've loved you, but..."
"What is his name, for christ's sakes?"
!
Go to your room!
That is not okay!
Have you ever tried to look him up?
No.
"He told me that his name was saxon banks,"
Like mr.
"Banks, the dad in ""mary poppins."""
Mm-hmm.
"But i googled him afterwards, and..."
We met in a bar.
"He was funny and sexy,"
And we were both pleasantly drunk.
We got a hotel room that overlooked the ocean.
It was beautiful and romantic.
"Ahem, and then he..."
Changed.
What do you mean he changed?
He became extremely aggressive.
It was like he was operating
Some piece of machinery or something.
It was just so rote.
"I tried to resist, but..."
He was way bigger than i was.
I eventually just stopped resisting because...
We have to talk.
I know Migs is with you.
He voluntarily came back to me.
"Bela, the only person who lost a memory is Migs."
Not you.
"Don't take advantage of him,"
Give him back to me.
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now,"
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now, you got it wrong."
You're probably forgetting...
I'm the first love...
He's happy with me.
"If he ever forgot you, it's not my fault."
Maybe that was destined to happen.
I'm begging you.
You already have everything.
Give him back to me.
You're wrong.
I waited for so long to be with him.
I can't give him back to you.
It's Migs' medicines.
I know you don't want me for Migs.
It's not that I don't like you for my brother.
I just really got used to him and Bela.
Just tell Mommy and Daddy that Migs and I need some space.
I'm begging you.
Take good care of Migs.
Your patient has fallen asleep from waiting for you!
I think she wants you to tell stories.
"Joy, April and I will just do the rounds."
-We'll go ahead!
-Bye!
What a Christmas treat...
What a treat!
..if you would bust some moves to give us a...
CHEERING
"I mean, guys, anything."
"What tempo would suit you, Rhys?"
You want upbeat.
They can do upbeat.
They do nuclear.
They go very fast.
Have you got any Jive Bunny and the mastermixes?
There he goes.
FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYS
Wow!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thank you!
Are you on medication?
LAUGHTER No.
Everybody loves Flight of the Conchords and I loved Murray.
Your character was sublime.
Will we see more of him?
Well...
I would love to say yes and I certainly can't say no.
I'd hate to think he wouldn't be done again.
Was it something that the boys...?
Do you need half an hour to catch your breath?
"Well, you saw what I just did!"
I did that and then straight away with another question!
"""Tell us about your mother."""
All right.
"The Conchords, it started off for most audiences here as a radio show."
Yeah.
Very good.
We are counting on you to do your best in the national communication network sector.
I'll do my best.
"These are the new bodyguards, Kim Na Na and Shin Eun Ah."
Bodyguard Kim Na Na is 27 years old and is a 4th Dan in Judo.
Bodyguard Shin Eun Ah is 24 years old and is a 5th Dan in Taekwondo.
I already said I don't need bodyguards.
President.
"Please be with Mr. Lee, he is waiting for you."
All right.
"My child is stubborn, sorry to trouble you all."
Just treat her as your sister.
If you need to teach her a lesson then do so.
"I will do well, President."
I will do my best.
Okay.
"Because she had to repeat a year, she's a bit sensitive when it comes to school."
So please be a little more understanding.
"Don't hand in your letter of resignation, okay?"
Yes.
That Dr. Lee Yun Seong.
"Since you've studied in United States, your English must be really good."
My English is rather poor.
"You be my tutor, okay?"
"Chief, can you tell me the business plan?"
"Oh, okay."
Let's go.
"Both of you, do a good job."
"Wow, how can there be such a man?"
!
"Eonni, you saw it, right?"
He totally ignored me.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
Kaya gave me a voice message to translate to you.
It's in this thumb drive.
"I'm going to begin, ok?"
Are you mixed?
Hi Gym.
I'm sorry about keeping my interview at the factory a secret.
I love you
But we hardly have anything in common.
"For example, our interests culture attitude religion and how to live life."
I think we won't make it together.
We can't really communicate and understand each other.
Communicate my ass!
We slept together every night!
Umm I don't know.
I'm here just to translate.
"I'm going to continue, ok?"
I hope you will meet the right person one day.
You are right for me.
I don't want to listen anymore!
Ok.
That's fine.
If you don't want to listen anymore.
Wait.
You're the one who taught her English?
Yes
This is your fault!
Damn it!
What the hell are you looking at?
Is that a bomb?
"Excuse me, what is that?"
Chicken soup I think.
Chicken soup?
- Sir.
"These papers are in order, sir."
Seems Sharpe distinguished himself.
Not here he hasn't
Brawling with common soldiers!
- it won't do Sharpe
"- No, sir."
"Harper, you struck an officer."
- it's a shooting matter
"- I woke him up, sir."
He thought I was an intruder.
"All my fault, sir."
If you say so.
But we have standards here Sharpe
An officer must behave like a gentleman.
Even if he is not a gentleman.
"- Yes, sir."
- We march in an nor
Form a rearguard.
Full kit in five minutes!
"Sweet is the silent mouth, Cooper."
"Didn't say a word, did I?"
"Strange officer, that."
Sharpe.
He's not a proper officer.
"Proper bastard, though."
- Name?
- Cooper.
Sir.
"Where are you from, Cooper?"
"- Shoreditch, sir."
- Previous employment?
Cut the crap.
"Hey, watch what you say."
I wish we can sleep like this till dawn.
Is it okay?
What about your friend?
She and I do some things for each other.
"I listen to all her stories, so this is fine."
I'm probably the only friend who listens to her secrets.
So what's it like working as a manager of a cafe?
Do you make a lot of money?
Not really.
"But I don't waste money, so I can manage."
I hope the divorce goes well with your husband in Seoul.
It will.
Will you come by around lunch?
"My friend likes you too, though she doesn't show it."
I'll cook you hot chicken stew like you wished for.
"- It would be perfect with Soju, huh?"
- Yes.
Feels so good.
Can I feel this good?
Open the door!
Open the door!
Right now!
Hurry and open it!
- She's a friend of mine.
- She's too emotional.
Just stay quiet for a bit.
Open the door!
Open it!
Hey!
I'm telling you to open up!
Nobody in this town will pick him up.
Why?
"Well, 'cause everyone in town is here."
Quaint.
I like that.
What?
"Well, that was nice."
What was that for?
You're different from any guy I've ever met.
"When you talk to me, you look in my eyes, and..."
And what?
"When I hear your voice, it sounds really smart, and that makes me feel special."
"Me, too."
"So, any time you're ready to open up, I'm ready to listen."
I blame you.
What?
I blame you.
"I only kept this job to take care of you, you and the..."
"And the, the..."
Kids?
"Yeah, the kids."
I was just a bag boy who didn't have sense enough to leave.
And now that's what I am for the rest of my life.
"Oh, Alan, what you do for a living is only a little of what you are."
It's not mostly what you are.
"Well, then what am I, mostly?"
Mostly...
You are a person that I love a whole lot.
And I want you to be happy.
"Well, right now I am not happy settling for what I am."
What the hell are we looking at?
George...
Taking advantage of me.
Safer to go down on the stairs!
Where're you off to?
To catch the burglar.
You look in the safe.
Don't run!
You think only you know Chinese Kung Fu?
Bet you're out of breath after the chase.
Do you know who I am?
Don't bother asking. I'll tell you.
"When I was a kid, they called me Super Kid Robin!"
Now they call me Super Sleuth Robin!
Also known as Super Shot Robin!
"You quite finished, Super Silly Sop?"
Are you ready to shoot?
You want to see me shoot?
Don't blink!
You've set 2 records in my books:
the slowest draw.
And the shortest time I've disarmed anybody.
You've got a surprise coming!
Freeze!
You got anything else to say?
- Sure!
- Go right ahead!
You haven't buttoned your pants.
You made a fool of me!
Confidential?
You want to screw my head off?
Ain't got much use anyway!
Couldn't even fix a woman.
Just wonder how you become an inspector.
"-That's up to a jury, sir."
But she's behind bars?
"She's not getting out, right?"
-What kind of bail?
-That's up to the judge.
"A woman like that is a danger, like the one who cut off her husband's dick."
These are the people they lock up and throw away the key.
That should do it.
"Thanks for your time, Mr. Fuentes."
MR. FUENTES:
Sure.
-Mrs.
"Fuentes, gracias."
You'll let us know if she gets out on bail?
Notify us somehow or another?
"Yeah, sure, we could do that if you want."
"Yeah, sure."
"-Anyway, thanks for your cooperation."
-Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeast infection?
How much is that gonna cost?
"I spent a month in the hospital, it didn't cost that much."
"How old is this dog, anyway?"
You think he's gonna live for a while?
"All right, okay."
is there any chance that this could be a special dog...
"... maybea purebred,anything?"
"No, it wouldn't, huh?"
"All right, well, you got my Visa, go ahead and treat the dog."
-How we doing on those supplementals?
-Okay.
"Not very much, Father."
It's just been bothering me for 15 years.
What did you do with those fountain pens you stole?
- Rocky!
You old...
"- Jerry, glad to see you."
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I'm glad to see you.
Good to see you.
Fifteen years.
Hasn't changed a bit.
- You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.
- Remember it?
He used to stand right where you are and boil the tar out of me.
"Gosh, 15 years."
It doesn't seem possible I haven't seen you in that length of time.
- I've seen you.
- You have?
Where?
I was there when you made the 90-yard run against NYU.
- Why didn't you come back and see me?
- Some people were waiting for me.
- Oh.
"Well, I got a kick coming, though."
- You have?
What?
- Why haven't you written to me?
"- You know how it is, Jerry."
"I changed my address and number so often, you had no way to answer me."
You know what happens to letters written in the stir.
Everybody reads them.
The dog... just Greta.
She was in the bathroom.
"Well, what was she doing?"
That's the funny thing.
She was pulling the curling iron out of the water by the cord.
"Boy, that's some smart dog."
Maybe she heard the girl scream when the curler hit the water.
I guess that's what happened.
"God, I don't know."
[Siren wailing]
There's something more.
What?
How did the dog get in?
"She was locked out, I'm sure."
"Well, maybe... maybe the girl let her in."
No.
She was in the tub.
I remember Monique slumped down under the water.
Eyes were still open.
Oh?
"Well, she's propped up against the end of the tub now."
"Well, I pulled her up from under the water."
"I was hoping she was still breathing, but she wasn't."
But who is she?
What was she doing here?
"Monique Berger, a friend."
She lives across the street.
They're working on the plumbing system.
[Siren wailing]
Anything else I should do?
"No, just stay in there and see they"
Don't make a mess of things.
"Um, I don't think she would."
Why not?
"Well, you see, it's like plants."
There's a time and a season for things to grow and bloom and then they fade and die away.
"Your mother and I have, uh, been through a lot of seasons together."
You mean you just don't like each other.
"No, no, no, no, I don't mean that."
"Well, you don't."
"No, we don't."
Why not?
I'm not the man that she wanted me to be.
And she's not the woman I fell in love with.
We both fell in love with a picture-- in our heads.
Not with each other.
Am I just a picture in your head?
"No, no, no, no."
You're the only thing I love in this world.
I don't want to go.
I know.
[sobs]
Do I have to?
"Well, it'll be a great vacation for you."
"Yeah, who wants to go out west?"
"Oh, what do you mean?"
"Arizona, Death Valley-- all those horses and cowboys and Indians."
"Yeah, bang, bang-- great."
Your mother's got a friend out there.
She told me.
You might like him.
"Well, you might."
"Billy, she's lonely."
She's doing the best she can.
(PANTING)
Christina!
Christina!
"(STRUGGLING) Tris, help me."
Tris!
(CHRISTINA PANTING)
It's okay.
We removed this from the body of the suicide.
Marlene.
Her name was Marlene.
I'm sorry.
Marlene.
It's a very sophisticated sim serum injector.
It also has a radio transmitter in its head.
How do we get them out?
I don't know.
This tech was built to defend itself.
This tendril wraps around the nearest major artery.
Try to remove them and they kill the host.
(ALL MURMURING)
CHRISTINA:
So what do we do?
Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disks before we do anything else.
EDGAR:
Or we could do the logical thing.
And we hand her over.
Nobody knows about this alliance.
We have to protect that advantage.
"If we hand Tris over now, might buy us some time."
(ALL AGREEING)
FOUR:
I think it's a good idea.
"Since I have a private number, Hallie won't pick up."
Neither will any of our friends in case it's you know someone annoying.
They will... call you back.
"But since we all have private numbers, it's nearly impossible for us to communicate by phone."
"Fortunately, I pick up my phone."
"Otherwise, this game of trading voicemails would never end."
Hello.
"Hey, it's Hallie."
Hey.
Jerk off!
This guy is on his cell phone and can't drive.
Sorry.
Hey... are you ok?
Yeah.
I'm ok.
How are you?
"Hey, um, you want to meet up for dinner tonight and maybe just... clear the air about everything?"
Yeah.
I think we should.
How does 8pm at Cascade sound?
All right.
Sounds good.
Great.
I'll meet you there.
Oh...
You didn't think I'd forget... did you?
"Wow, they're beautiful."
Thank you.
So what are the big plans for tonight?
"Well, that was um, Hallie."
"She wants to uh, get together and so we can talk about everything."
I think she forgot it was my birthday though.
"Zhu Li, come on!"
We got guests.
Whip up a pot of that green tea I love.
"Yes, sir."
Zhu Li's in prison with you?
Of course.
I don't go anywhere without my assistant.
Do you?
"We're not interested in your tea, and this isn't a friendly visit."
Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened.
I did some good things too.
"Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?"
I did.
"Bolin, who got you into the movers?"
I did.
"Asami, who saved your company?"
I did.
"Mako, who got you thrown in jail?"
I did!
"Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing."
"You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the president."
Those are pretty bad too.
I wasn't going to hurt him.
I just needed to start a war.
"Well, a bigger war."
"Well, we're gonna end it."
Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
The future industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.
You have a battleship?
Of course I do!
"I bought the first one they made, named her the Zhu Li."
Mother?
Father?
Zendaya?
Cheerleading squad?
Ooh...
I've got all I need.
Good news!
"I got approval for a laptop, so now I can work up here and W-2 with my boo."
Boop!
"Jack, you better talk to her soon."
"She's only booped, like, three other guys."
Yeah.
"Man up, wuss."
"Hey, remember when I just called you a wuss?"
I'm really sorry about that.
"I just, I'm finally bonding with Emma."
It's so exciting.
"Clark, you sold out a friend to score points with a girl."
That means you're growing as a person.
Thanks.
How are you going to deal with this Amy situation?
"Oh, I don't know!"
"Usually I just tell a woman it's over, hop on a plane, and suddenly she's the TSA's problem."
I could help you.
"Uh, okay, so you've broken up with tons of girls?"
[chuckles]:
No.
They've broken up with me.
I know more about break-ups than anyone except Taylor Swift and every person she has ever dated.
"I've been dumped by nine women, and I've only dated five of them."
"Wait, wait, so four strangers just walked up to you and said, ""It's over""?"
One of them was on a bike.
She says it's reductive.
But I think it's a compliment.
"I mean, gypsies are all the rage on TV --"
"""My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding,"" ""Gypsy Sisters""..."
"""Keeping up with the Kardashians."""
Um [Clears throat] you mind if I use your bathroom?
"Yeah, go ahead."
But use the one upstairs at the back.
Mala's taking a shower in ours.
Right.
"Did you really lose the ""Wiener Winner"" by one dog?"
Yeah.
"[ Water running, door creaks ]"
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Water stops ]
And what are we talkin'?
Six inches?
Foot-long?
"Look, agent."
Am I a suspect here or what?
'Cause unless you got a warrant --
[ Clears throat ]
"You, uh, ready to go?"
Yeah.
"Uh, Mr. Morgan, thank you for your time."
"If you remember anything else, this is our number and where we're staying locally."
"All right, so, we got what appears to be Wayne McNut's hair and..."
a bag full of weird.
"In Romanichal culture, the pouch is called a putsi bag."
It's used for hexes.
"Okay, so, what?"
Mala's putting hexes on hubby's competition?
I don't know.
You're going to White Cross.
- Give me those.
"- No, no, please, please, please."
- I know where he's going to be.
- Who?
Kevin Grey.
"If Grey moors up the boat here at the end of the runway, in theory, he could just walk onto a plane."
- What's the flight schedule tonight?
- I'll get on it.
"Don't let me keep you, DS Chohan."
- How's Anna?
- She's good.
Ran into her last month at the Old Bailey.
She was on terrific form.
Tore the case apart.
Told me she'd finally left you.
- We're working things out.
"- She may be but not you, Harry."
I want DI Orwell kept up to date on everything to do with the Lau case.
You're gonna both be running it from now on.
OK?
Mm-hm.
No sign of Grey's boat.
Clear line of sight to the harbour entrance.
- How many flights are left after this one?
"- Er, two."
Athens and Paris.
The first two cities to host the Olympics.
Where does your freakish general knowledge come from?
"My dad used to sell encyclopaedias, until the internet came along."
"Harry, speedboat approaching from the harbour entrance."
Inter-planetary.
"So take him, Stanin."
"Look, tell me, do you love me?"
"Look, do you hear?"
Will you write to me?
"Tell me, do you love me?"
Will you write to me?
Manya?
Let's beat it!
Look...
We're just naturally loose!
"We can't broadcast this to our planet, nobody would believe it."
And why not?
"Because if they get to know this on our planet, then everyone will want to fly here."
And we don't have enough flying saucers for this.
It would be the end of our civilization.
You get it?
Hallo.
Hallo!
What do you think?
Should I write to her?
Don't pick it up!
What will you report to them?
This just isn't possible.
I'll adjust the message a bit so it won't be so shocking.
What do you think about this?
-No.
It's concealing facts.
-I know.
But it will be better this way.
Believe me.
I'll only a little bit more...
Only financially.
"Well, finance is the basis of most relationships, don't you think?"
"Don't play this with me, Mr. Sabourin."
I'm a tigress.
I'll bite you.
I accept your offer.
"26th floor, miss."
Yes?
I'd like to see Mr. Sabourin.
Do you have an appointment?
"No, but he'll see me."
Just give him this.
"What is your name, please?"
Just say Kelly.
"Will you wait right here, please, Miss Kelly."
Our plan is to buy companies that are in financial trouble and then build them up.
Now here's a company in Canada that I'm particularly interested in.
Wilson Oil?
I know that stock.
Sells at a dollar.
It hasn't been very active lately.
"Well, I want you to get me the background on it and then go into the legal aspect of the situation here with Herb."
Alright.
Where is she?
In the reception room.
"Alright, show her in."
"You must forgive me, I have a private meeting."
"You may go in now, Miss Kelly."
Hello.
"Mrs. Ryan, I'd like you to meet Miss Kelly."
"Miss Kelly, Mrs. Ryan."
How'd you do?
170 pesetas.
That's his final offer.
Anyone who doesn't want to work can stay home.
We've too many people already.
"If you want to sign up, get in line."
Sir!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Juan Robles.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
Alfonso Corrales.
I'm with the police.
I'm here about the murders.
If I can be of any help...
Let me know if you need anything.
- See you around.
- Thank you.
Yes.
"Yes, don't worry."
Of course.
"Good night, Manuel, and thanks."
"The field boss says there's no Dyane 6 on the Corrales property, neither registered or unregistered."
And Marina's mother says her daughter is at a movie.
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow and have him come in for a blood test.
- It's late for today.
- It's 11 o'clock.
I don't think it's late.
I'll call him tomorrow morning.
I don't think there will be any problem.
Right now I'm going to have them check on the girl.
I'm not asking you to call him on the telephone.
I'm asking you to authorize a blood test.
We never thought of a Frenchman.
(Bicycle Bell Ringing)
"(People Chattering, Bus Horn Honking)"
(Man Shouting)
Here we go.
"Say, do you want to share a taxi with us to the hotel?"
"That's kind of you, Doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first."
- 0h. 0K.
"- What business are you in, Mr Bernard?"
I'll be there later and perhaps we might have a drink together.
Come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.
"- ln that case, I will take you to dinner."
"- No, no."
That's not fair.
I know Marrakech.
I can show you an Arab restaurant where the food is different and the manner of eating exotic.
That's what we came here for.
- How about one of those Arabian nights?
- l'd love it.
"How would you prefer to travel to the hotel, by taxi?"
"- Gee, I don't know."
- A wagon!
I wanna ride in a wagon!
I guess it's a wagon.
See you later.
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
"Hank, you sit up with the driver."
How do you like this?
A horse-drawn convertible.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
It looks like a type of disorder that's rarely ever seen anymore except in primitive cultures.
"We call it ""somnambular-form possession. """
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
Like John Garfield in Body And Soul.
Exactly.
John Garfield.
"Do people tell you that, Father?"
Do people say you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
You know this director who was doing the film here Burke Dennings?
I've seen him.
You've seen him.
'Cause I'm gonna drop truth bombs.
You know how pissed off I was when U S Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight-up mentally ill.
Sure.
I got mental-health issues.
Sure.
"Well, you know, who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Miss Maroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't think you'd like it, 'cause we work a lot of hours and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like risky."
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"""Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."""
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
So because you won't stand up to your boss...
... Ihaveto go reinterviewfor awoman who admits she stabbed her husband...
-... andthreeneighborssay hebeat her?
"-Yeah, that's what I'm asking--"
-Are you asking me or telling me?
-l was asking you.
What are you trying to turn this into?
"Okay, gentlemen, could we put a hold on everything..."
... andgetstatements on the Garcia homicide...
... sothedistrictattorneyiscomfortable presenting the case?
Satisfied?
"Thanks for being such a prick, Johnny."
-Son of a bitch!
COSTAS:
If I got a buck every time...
"... acoptriedtogetme,I'dberich."
It's not personal.
-That was personal.
"-Well, you stood your ground..."
... heactedlikeanasshole.
What else is new?
Not a thing.
KELLY:
"Mrs. Dupree, we'd like to come by and ask you some more questions."
Tomorrow morning.
Can I send the detectives by?
"No, Mr. Fuentes, we wanna talk to both of you."
"Well, when will she be off?"
Tomorrow morning?
We'll be there before noon.
Thank you.
"-Kelly, you're up."
But he will tease if I tell him.
Which is why...
You are a friend who knows him well.
He will not get a better partner than you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
"Siri, time?"
"Siri, call Deepa."
"Hi, Deepa."
I'm waiting for you.
Where are you?
'Sadhana Calling'.
Deepa.
What happened?
Is something wrong?
I can help you only if you tell me.
"Please, Deepa."
Tell me.
What's it?
My sister fell in love with a guy.
His family is quite well off.
"But, they still accepted their wedding."
Since it was my sister's wish...
My father spent more than he could afford
He got her married in a grand way.
She is happy with her life.
I am serious!
"You are not my type, and... we are not suitable each other, and..."
I... don't like girl with big face!
Mr...
Mr. Chen!
I'm not talking about you.
Who did this?
Who put these porn photos inside my book?
"These are not mine, Sir!"
Really not mine!
Not mine!
It hurts!
"Sir, those are not mine really!"
I'm innocent!
Yawang!
- Yawang.
- Yes...
Do you want to earn some pocket money?
Money?
"Yes, of course!"
What should I do?
- Be a private tutor.
- For whom?
His name is Xiamu.
His father was my best friend.
"When he was 4, his father lost everything in business and committed suicide!"
"His mother could not stand the pressure from creditors, and hung herself!"
Most unfortunately little Xiamu witnessed this.
Since then he has rarely talked and become withdrawn.
"By being his private tutor, you may help this kid."
It looks like real one!
Don't be stingy!
I think we've gone through...
-...too much together.
-Yeah.
"We'II always be part of each other, Iike, growing up."
I'm just glad that we did it right from the start how we wanted to do it.
Yeah.
There's been so many bands that have come and gone.
And no one really talks about them anymore.
"I'd Iike to be like, remembered for the records that we did."
Do you know what?
"It'd just be amazing to be remembered like, even as a mum telling her daughter:"
"""The boy band at my time, One Direction, they just had fun."""
Do you know what I mean?
"""They were just normal guys but terrible, terrible dancers."""
Yeah.
Are they down here?
I'm excited to see what's gonna happen.
"Two, one."
"Everybody, three, two, one."
So I'm gonna just get in the car up here.
"Come on, girls."
Can't believe actually today's here.
have a present for you.
There you go.
-congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
-My pleasure.
-Thank you.
The key.
Right.
Are we ready?
[Horn blows]
[Horn blows]
2 of diamonds.
2 no trumps.
3 spades.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
"3 spades it is, then."
"Ahh, I can't help you much, I'm afraid."
"Ahh, for God's sake."
How much longer can they keep us here?
"Till after tea, anyway."
"Arthur, you think you should be working after everything that's happened?"
"No, no."
I have to keep busy.
"Yes, of course."
You and I have business to discuss about your late wife's affairs.
What?
Seems we're going to be in partnership.
"That's not-- when the Germans arrive, the high command, we'll be able to put them up here at the hotel."
We're near enough to the coast.
They won't arrive.
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
You do know that the Belgians have capitulated?
Yes.
"Say, you in the blue serge suit!"
You look like a man with sporting blood flowing in your veins!
Would you like to see the forbidden quarter of Algiers?
"Gather around closer, please!"
I've a little item to show you!
This is called the ever-writing ballpoint pen!
Sells for $ 15 in the leading stores!
"Back up a little, please, you bother me!"
You can write as easy with your left hand as your right!
It doesn't make a difference!
You geeked it!
And I had a buck on you!
You're yellow!
You should've taken that with you!
- Maybe you could've hit him with it!
- Leave him alone!
"He don't mean nothing, Tony!"
I don't mind!
A fight's only a fight!
- I still got that million-to-one shot!
"- Okay, boys!"
Main event on!
"- Get ready, main event!"
- Luth!
Intermission's about over!
"Hey, Mickey!"
Give Stoker a hand with his bandages!
Main event in the ring!
I wish I had the champ in there tonight!
"I know I'm right, Gus!"
"Tell you, I can feel it!"
"- Okay, boy!"
"We saved her, too."
My God.
Your brother.
"This time, the governor won't have Serena to use as P.R."
He won't have to die.
We did it.
We sure did.
My husband must be sending out a search party by now.
I left my car at the hospital.
Will you take me?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey."
Friends don't let friends drive in a state of shock.
I'll drive you home.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
Does this have anything to do with Ruby?
"No, it's..."
It's the police.
That's who's supposed to look for guys like... him.
Seat belt's stuck.
- Thanks for the ride.
"- Hold on, wait."
- I'll walk you.
- That's okay.
"If I let a girl walk herself to the door on a dark night,"
I'd have to commit ritual suicide.
"You don't want my death on your conscience, do you?"
Or your blood on my sidewalk.
Yeah.
"Well, hold on, hold on."
I'm going to be tougher with him.
I promise.
Huh.
It's weird.
I just have this vague feeling of you actually being a good mother.
I hate you!
"I hate you, I hate you!"
I hate you!
"Reese, this is crazy."
You've been staring at that damn thing for four days.
We're getting rid of it.
No!
Wait!
I finally have an idea.
What is it?
I'll have it in a second!
Just wait!
"It's over, Reese."
"Once the board's gone, things should go back to normal."
Did you know that the Newmans put a statue of a naked guy on their front lawn a week ago?
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
No!
We are not getting rid of this!
"Reese, what is the big deal?"
What is so special about this board?
I think it's my last time.
Last time for what?
For anything stupid and reckless and fun.
"Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now, but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says,"
"""That's dangerous, that's stupid."
"You're gonna hurt yourself."""
"And the old voice, the one that says,"
Calvin.
"-Well, not precisely a man."
"Hello, detective."
How is your investigation coming?
-I thought you were dead.
"-Technically, I was never alive."
But I appreciate your concern.
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
"Basically, I fried an empty shell."
-I couldn't destroy him.
He was too--
-Unique.
It just didn't feel right.
You and your feelings.
"They just run you, don't they?"
"Two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps, detective."
"Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit to yourself."
No guards.
The override is disabled.
Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
He wasn't controlling them at all.
"Oh, my God."
"You were right, doc."
I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.
Who else had access to the uplink?
Who could manipulate the robots?
Use USR systems to make Lanning's life a prison?
Poor old man.
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.
So he had to lay down a plan.
You're not going in.
So what?
"What, we're just gonna stand out here all night?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
I don't even wanna go this is war.
This is war.
Programs!
Programs!
So let me get this straight.
You fell in love with his fiancée?
Before he proposed.
"Seriously, it's fine."
That makes no difference.
My guy should be the one going to the game.
Exactly.
My guy got invited first.
Your guy kissed my guy's girl.
I'm not gonna explain this again.
"Well, don't worry about it."
You don't have to.
I'm outta here.
Fine.
"So am I. You don't want to be friends, consider it done."
You know what you could use right now?
Ice cold ice cream.
Had to find some higher ground
Had some fear to get around
"Adam, it's Marjorie."
"I know that you probably hate me right now, but could you please call me?"
Please?
Last time through I hid my tracks
"So well, I could not get back."
"Yeah, yeah."
Hannah's response:
"""Nobody's perfect,"
"But this guy's a super, super jerk""."
Oh man.
My mom watches Leno.
Well if it makes you feel any better.
"Both Miley and Hannah love their ""super, super jerk""."
Well I'm glad you think this is funny.
But you're not the one who's a talk show punch line?
You're a cute punch line.
"Oh Jesse, come on!"
Oh come on Jesse.
I know it's my fault but...
"Okay this is where you say ""No it's not your fault honey."
"We're in this together""."
Let me try it again.
Jesse I know it's my fault but...
Your turn.
"Doesn't have to be ""honey""."
"Could be ""lamb chop cupcake..."""
Miley.
Oh come on.
You can do better than that.
You don't get it.
"Everybody in America knows me as the super, super jerk."
Who broke Hannah Montana's heart?
Everybody?
"Now come on, you're being a little dramatic."
I mean the people that know you and love you don't feel that way.
[Cell phone buzzing]
Really?
Last number to call and last number dialled.
- How was she?
- What does that mean?
- Did she seem suspicious or anything?
- All right.
A bit trusting.
I wouldn't let anybody into my house like that.
- That's cos you're a hard-faced bitch.
- Sorry!
"Well, you steal credit cards from vulnerable women."
- Just a moment of madness?
- No.
I fell for a cheap whore in a bar.
"Well, it had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
I'd advise you two to get a room but you already have.
"Shut up, Calum."
"Now, sit nice and try not to lick the windows."
"Hello, is that the Longbay Hotel?"
"Could you put me through to lain Risdale, please."
- Yeah.
That's him.
"- John, check the words to this."
Yo!
And I ain't chatting no black talk.
"- ""Yo"" means ""I"" in Spanish."
- Very impressive.
"There's more. ""Yo no soy marinero. "" ""I ain't no sailor. """
"""Soy Capitan. "" ""I'm Captain. """
- I've found Risdale.
"- To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
They're getting very close.
Blake!
How did you get back so soon?
Get ready to leave.
There's a ship coming up on you fast.
You've got about three minutes.
"We have the neutrotope now, nothing else matters."
- I'll get the others.
- I'll be back in a minute.
He's cutting it too fine.
"Come on Blake, get out of there."
"No, no I won't!"
- She must be taken back for trial.
- Agreed.
I won't go!
- Everything set?
"- Yes, ready."
Bring us across Vila.
They're locked on.
[EXPLOSION]
What was that?
I rigged a charge on the entry hatch.
"Right, I think we can get you all home now."
"Zen, set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
Confirmed.
Take us round the easy way this time.
Hello?
"You weren't at work today, were you, Elizabeth?"
Waiting for my call?
"Look, you've won"
I'm leaving Don't go
Finished measuring?
Anything else?
Choose the material.
I'll take the one in your hand.
Cloth-cutting.
"Murderous tailor, I've guessed your real game."
I've done nothing to offend you.
Why do you want me dead?
Sifu Tam is angry with you.
Taking revenge is a poor way to solve the problem.
Please pass on this message to Sifu Tam.
I want to be friends with him.
- Foon.
"- Yes, Sifu?"
- Get him a new pair of scissors.
- Yes.
Still dirty.
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
"More money, more money..."
Ruined another one.
Help!
"Get a grip, you coward!"
"Sister, it's you!"
I thought it was that painted face!
Nothing to worry about.
You were born without courage.
Why are you afraid of a painted face?
- I nearly died from the shock.
- Go and dry the clothes!
Give me a minute to recover.
"I told you before, you only use two fingers to squeeze."
Why do I have to squeeze with two fingers?
I know how much that stuff meant to her.
How is she doing?
"Come on, monica."
You know your mother.
I mean not good at all.
I don't even know what to say to her.
"I've been helping her with the house while taking care of my bills,"
But there's only so much i can do.
I mean she was making more than me.
i really hate to see her like this.
"Know what, dad?"
I forgot...
I need to go make a phone call.
Can you watch my bag?
"- Baby, just use my phone."
- There's probably no service.
"Sure enough, she's right."
Hmm.
Hoo.
"How was your run, regina?"
"It was good, mother."
"Well, any other time it'd be ""mama."""
"You still mad, but that's okay."
- You'll get over it.
"- Mama, i really don't wanna go through this again."
"You know, your nagging is getting real old."
"Now before you go storming off to your room like usual,"
Do you mind getting the door this time?
It's your shift.
I've already done mine.
oh god.
I don't know why you're making me come over here and do this.
"Oh, hey, Marissa, I was really sorry to read about your stepdad in the paper today."
- You read the paper?
"- Just the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the Orange County Register and The Wall Street Journal."
"This relationship is probably over now, right?"
I'll just go.
"No, no, no."
Stay.
"Um, actually, we were just talking, and um..."
What are you doing this weekend?
You got to be kidding me.
"I know, I know."
"I'm sorry, but it's the only seat left."
"- Don't worry, I promise I'll keep my hands to myself."
"- Well, it's your elbow I'm worried about."
- Why do you hate me so much?
"- No, I don't;"
I'm sorry.
- What did I do?
- It was an accident.
"- No, it was like four accidents."
"- Six, if you count each individual tampon."
- I don't know what else you want me to say.
- Nothing.
"In fact, we never need to speak to each other again."
"- Yeah, see, but I was really enjoying getting to know you."
"- Well, I wasn't."
- I was being sarcastic.
- I wasn't.
"Morning, guys."
"Your favorite physics teacher here, R.E. Greenberg, with your new lab partner assignments."
We've got Adrianna Alberghetti with Philip Raskin.
Ryan Atwood with Lindsay Gardner.
He was always joking
He'd imitate a horse when I needed cheering up
"An alcoholic, a hopeless drunk"
This is my husband.
Now he sells door to door
And this one
He's a millionaire with influence
Will he remember me?
What's wrong?
Crying?
Leave her alone
- Who asked you anything?
- What?
What did you dare say?
You heard me
You are completely crazy
I've heard that before
Don't touch me
I'm never going to
"You're beneath anything, you're disgusting"
A stupid egoist.
You're putrid.
And to think I loved you
I still owe you one
"I loved you, you hear?"
I had all your letters.
I'd find your hairpin and save it
What a joke
"Stop it, Julien..."
It hurts
Let me go
Clementine?
"Don't worry your pretty, little head about that."
Pretty?
"While Hayley and I distract Austin, you need to look for this."
It's a false wall.
A secret room.
That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.
Exactly.
"Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer,"
I get equal credit.
No double-crosses.
Deal.
"That way, Mason Wood has to make both of us members of the society."
Let's go.
Hold on.
Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.
- No.
Deciding between something I brought and something that Rick's about to buy me.
I think I know the direction you'll be leaning in.
Oh.
You really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.
Austin:
Wow.
"Come in, come in."
Let's get some drinks in you.
Ooh.
Here you go.
Ooh.
A little something to loosen your inhibitions.
"Oh, don't worry."
We're plenty loose already.
Not after I've tied you up.
What is it that you want to ask?
"You see, I think Changwook and I both want you."
"If you happen to like both of us, who would you choose?"
"You see, this situation is making us awkward."
I think it would help if things are set clear.
So who's your pick?
"I like you better, Joongrae."
I understand.
Thanks.
You should get back.
How long did you stay in Germany?
Quite a long time.
You must be fluent in German.
Just enough to get by.
She's good.
Very good.
- Were there Koreans there?
- Not really.
"It was a small tourist city, so I saw some Korean travelers."
- What are people like there?
- A bit boring.
But they are honest.
Very much so.
They express their feelings as they are.
They seem more laid back than people here.
Have you dated foreigners?
"- Men, I mean."
"- Ah, men."
Do you really want to know?
"- Well, I think..."
"- No, don't say it."
I don't care what you did there.
"Well, you have your memories."
That's the best thing to keep.
Nobody can take that away.
Right?
"- Hi, Ida."
Is it okay if we come in?
- Yeah.
Vivienne is here to take you... to show you the photograph of you and your family.
Would you like to go see it?
- I'm going.
- Good.
Let's go.
Okay.
"So this is where you were thinking about the entrance, I think."
I'll show you this one.
- Okay?
- My husband's here somewhere.
"Yep, yep, yep."
"And, uh, then over here... this is Ben and Hilda Katz."
- Look over here.
- This is called the Ben and Hilda Katz Building... because they gave the $3 million to help start it.
- I knew that.
- So there they are.
And if the foundation... are going to have people here all the time who've done things for Baycrest.
So these were the first 64 people that were chosen.
And we just opened it the week before last.
- My husband's somewhere here too.
- Not on this one yet.
No.
We're going up in the auditorium to find him.
- And this is the Heritage Museum.
- Just a minute.
And photo session is going on...
Model or their skeleton!
Look like they got sick by wearing out undergarments.
Who will buy our undergarments?
We'll have to wear them all.
"Underwear is okay, but who's going to wear the bra?"
Your father.
Dad please don't use your words.
What is happening?
"Uncle Shakespeare said, What is in the name?"
But he forgot...
What if three people share the same name?
Laxminarayan One.
Laxminarayan Two.
Laxminarayan Three.
Diamond is worth 20 crores and route is by road.
Go easily and come back with the diamond.
"Here, 2 bucks."
You'll get the diamond when you'll give him this half bill.
This diamond will bring that diamond from Pondi.
"Stop, I know you have the diamond."
We are dangerous people.
He's running.
Scoundrel.
Don't touch me.
Say Chandu loves Chandni.
"Sound so sweet, Keep saying it."
You think I'm mad!
I mean let me show it also.
I didn't even touch.
I did nothing.
"Chandu, There's someone at the window."
- This is the one.
One more shot.
One more shot.
Just one more.
Just one more.
"- You know, I'm on to you."
- What do you mean?
"Okay, you told me that I'm top dog but secretly, you think you're top dog, all right?"
Now you're just trying to out-top-dog the top dog.
Can you take these doors off child-lock so I can kill myself?
- Men working.
"Things are different now, man, all right?"
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely correct.
You are the top dog.
Here.
What are you doing?
There's no top dog crown.
Are you trying to make me look stupid?
"Look, man, this is about respect."
I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
"- Yeah, much flyer."
I respect you.
"- No, you don't."
"Because if you did, you would have told me that the small room is the top dog room."
Face to face
Just when...
Just when you thought Our chance had past
What?
I own this song.
A place to return to.
"""I'm home."""
"Yes, ""I'm home."""
Welcome home.
Two days ago we got a transfer request.
A graduate of the shaolin school of martial Arts.
currently a member of the lacrosse team.
The team requested permission to join the league.
apparently they have a new coach.
The beach volley team requests permission for an overseas tour.
Destination:
Australia.
First kneel down.
Hold the stick at an angle of 45to your body.
"Then, with one smooth movement..."
Don't rely just on force.
flow like water.
"Rin, this is fun!"
These are the basics of Shaolin Kung Fu.
Come for a sec.
What?
Standing Zen!
Don't do anything.
Alright!
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force ejects the ball like a bullet.
The lower body is also important.
Its muscles control the speed.
This is Kung Fu.
"Alright, Minmin."
Give it a try.
OK.
"What you think we're, stupid?"
Yes !
Same me to you!
"Oh, can you believe him?"
"Look at here , Daze."
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.
Be your best in my new signature dress.
"Let them know you mean business at the disco or in the boardroom , with the amazing versatility of the premier piece in my high-end line of super stylish couture ."
"Who is better than you, girl ?"
Oh man !
How much is it ?
About 300 bucks.
How do you know ?
"I know, because Stacy Cold Pepper has got one and everybody was talking about it."
Let's get us ours'.
We can't.
Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe ..."
What?
"Again , Vi ?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
We got it.
But...
He said it was an easy gig.
right?
Yea.
"Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me , Daisy."
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money, and... well, you know, kids -- They can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?
They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.
Dirk the jerk.
"And after what happened to his mother, he..."
His mother?
"Yeah, Jane, my wife."
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you -- you watch somebody die slow, waste away to nothing... it does things to a person."
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He... he wouldn't talk about her.
Not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"Well, we'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. McGregor."
"Um, you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's..."
That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
"Hendricks is in hospital, Andre and the others are dead, so let's not fuck up anymore."
- And who are you?
- I'm Mr Crawford's CEO.
The code word for this is Scylla and Charybdis.
"Now move it, soldier, we have a package to collect."
"Go, guys."
"Crawford, wake up."
Look.
Government troops.
Army checkpoint.
"Well, that's good, isn't it?"
"I'll name drop Matak, we'll get an escort back to Khartoum."
- What?
- I don't know.
- What are they doing out here?
- Patrolling?
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us.
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember?"
And your men tried to kill him at the exchange.
Maybe he just wants to return the favour?
"I say we find a different route, just to be safe."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
- What's he saying?
- Janjaweed.
Two jeeps.
Coming fast.
We press on.
We hit that checkpoint.
"If the soldiers are friendly, we'll have more firepower against the Janjaweed."
"Crawford, you drive, take it slow, but get ready to gun it on my command."
-You're a fine one to ask me how it went.
-blanche.
You're a fine one to stand there accusing me of it.
-I won't stay in this house.
-blanche!
-blanche.
"-I, I, I took the blows on my face and my body."
"AII of those deaths, the Iong parade to the graveyard."
"Father, Mother, Margaret, that dreadful way...."
"You just came home in time for funerals, stella."
And funerals are pretty compared to deaths.
How do you think all that sickness and dying was paid for?
"Death is expensive, Miss stella."
"And I, with my pitiful salary at the school...."
"Yes, accuse me."
"Stand there and stare at me, thinking I let the place go."
I let the place go?
Where were you?
-In there with your PoIack.
"-blanche, be still."
That's enough.
-stella.
"stella, you're crying?"
-Does that surprise you?
"Mitch, we gonna play at your house tomorrow?"
"No, not at my house."
My mother's still sick.
"-AII right, you bring the beer."
-Break it up down there.
-I made that spaghetti dish and ate it myself.
"-Now, honey, I told you and told you we were playing Jack's beer."
What's so funny?
"Our message is about peace, love and universal harmony."
Loser!
And about finding balance and cosmic energy through Zenovation.
- Open up your minds to a new reality.
- Losers!
- Screw harmony and peace.
- And that chi stuff.
This is just too easy.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
"And the pictures of the kids, your family, nice people."
"Hey, mind if I wear this?"
You got any tickets to the policemen ball?
"Well, guys, you ready?"
Okay.
- We're back.
- We're back.
What happened yesterday was our fault.
- Un-American.
- Un-Pennsylvanian.
- Un-Charlestownonian.
- Un-Hansonian.
This town needs a good punch in the nose.
- A kick in the teeth.
- A jab in the spleen.
Bernie's hitting us below the belt.
"Fellas, we're here to show you how to help fight back."
- And we have reinforcements.
"- Guys, come on in."
These are our boys.
Dit.
I sold a whole street once.
"When I had the business, your father was still alive."
Yeah.
He used to come home and go upstairs.
I had his supper ready for him on the table.
"When he came down, I went up... and I had a little - a little snack, a little supper- nothing much."
I was always very busy.
Do you remember Mr. Goldhar?
- Yep.
- He came every day.
[Woman] That must have been who she was talking about before.
"Oh, did I"
- I mentioned it already?
"Well, you were wondering ifhe was Goodman or..."
He was a very nice man...
Mr. Goldhar.
And he loved me - not in that way.
But
"- Oh, well, he - he put his arms around me."
He kissed me.
He loved me.
He laughed.
He did anything I told him to.
He came every day for breakfast.
"He was there at about, uh, 6:30, 7:00 for breakfast."
He says his wife is still sleeping.
She doesn't make him breakfast.
I remember
- I didn't think I would remember anything from there.
"I remember you came down, and you should have been sleeping upstairs."
You climbed - You used to climb out of your crib.
- Yeah?
* Of fixing your hair pretty slick *
* The clothes that you wear
* Baby even your kiss was never like this *
* I'm in love all over again *
* Even thought we try a separation *
* Our little romance was growing strange *

He's got ideas - big ones.
"Isn't that right, Prof?"
"Damn right, Rambo."
I see.
"In two days, you'll be begging me to come back."
Yeah?
"In two days, you'll be begging us for change!"
On the streets!
"Yes, Prof!"
Rinser!
"Right, let's go jugball."
Everyone has to watch.
"Now, that's a good chair."
Me tooth's all hurty.
It's one of my best ones and all.
Maybe it's a wisdom tooth.
Unlikely Grumio'd have any of them.
Why are you dressed like an adult?
"Because I'm a big cheese, now, baby, and don't you forget it."
"Don't you forget to lower the price of grain, then."
"Yes, yes, on my list."
Below fixing the loos but above the squeaky door.
You - we've gots to go.
Hoots!
"Good morning, everyone."
My name is Marcus Gallo.
I'm the new Head of HR.
"Under my watch, this company is going to look after everyone - from the brainy boffins in Accounts, all the way down to Lena the cleaner, starting today."
"Also starting today, guys, there's a big jugball tournament here on the jugball court."
Please come and watch Stylax and his team-mate take on me and Urbo.
Where'd you get him from?
"He works in Finance, I think."
(sighs)
"Well, unexplained things, secrets, occurrences that we're really not supposed to talk about?"
Oh.
Well...
"I believe that there are moments, experiences that someone like McGee, with his trusty computer, couldn't justify."
"When Gibbs left tonight,"
I... thought I saw it again.
Saw what?
The bounce.
"You know, I've been thinking about that."
Boss don't bounce.
"You cannot expect a person to keep things bottled up inside forever, can you?"
RYAN:
"Mm, charades."
Let's play.
Now?
(snorts)
It's as good a time as any.
(chuckles)
No.
Why not?
"Because I don't play games, Doc."
(laughs)
Like hell you don't.
"You know, people keep looking at their watch, usually means they're worried about something."
You got to run?
"Oh, I've been running."
Maybe it's time you stopped?
I wish I could.
You can.
Parker can.
You have no idea.
Congratulations.
I though this was what you always wanted.
"To get back to Norway, get out into the field again."
If you's rather stay here just until the end of hostilities then go and see your wife and children.
It's no problem.
I can...
Of course not.
The war is not over yet.
"- Thank you, Sir."
- Good man.
"- Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get a fish this colour in Norway.
- No we don't.
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss most about Norway?
The horizons.
- Whereever you look.
- Yeah.
It's been awhile.
You must come and visit.
Our house is big.
It would be awkward.
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good birdwatchers.
Certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have the war.
Yes.
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow.
You'd lose your head if it wasn't fastened on.
"You were the door to another life, where my seed might have been affirmed."
Ta-da!
I found your shoe!
"I""ve brought back to this hole a breath of life, which I am trying to use."
"We make it, carnal."
"We don""t fake you, we just take you."
"""Cause La Primera""s ese."
"Always has been, always will be."
"Ã""rale."
"Ã""rale."
"Welcome to the clica, carnal."
"Por vida, ese."
Por vida.
"Are you coming out, ese?"
Staying in.
"Are you sure you know what you're doing, ese?"
SimÃ²n.
You scared me by showing me a glimpse of what my life might have been.
That's Lourdes.
"Ã""rale."
"Hey, be careful!"
"Don't worry, homes, I ain't gonna crash."
Check that one out.
See all the people?
They were throwing rice and shit.
Look at Mama.
Pull over up here.
I gotta take a leak.
"This medal I send to you as a gift for helping me find my voice, a key to my soul which I will use."
St. Dismas is the patron saint of all those in prison.
He has protected me.
Small root beer.
Would you like fries with that?
I would.
Thank you very much.
I almost forgot.
[Whistling]
[Cash drawer opens]
[Coins clink]
I'll just be sitting outside.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your order?
[Indistinct chatter]
You ready to work?
- Where's Ryan?
- He's with his old man.
How you feeling?
"Deprived on every fucking level, but ready to fight."
How you feeling?
I feel good.
Thank you.
"I'm gonna have you see a nutritionist, okay?"
"We'll cut the weight, and you won't lose so much strength."
You talk to Lisa?
I have.
"A lot of other gyms that I can go to, man."
"I'm not letting you out of the gym, pal."
"You're too important here, okay?"
I'm gonna give you everything I give Ryan.
I promise.
"Hey, what do you think about this one..."
this girl?
Got to ask Ryan about that one.
I don't know.
Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.
"When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him."
Hey!
Anyone want to be his lawyer?
"Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!"
All rise!
The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.
Show-off.
May Doc have mercy on your soul.
"All right,"
"I wanna know who's responsible for wrecking' my town, Sheriff."
I want his hood on a platter!
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
"No, check that."
"I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot."
I'm...
"Throw him out of here, Sheriff."
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!
"Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyering' stuff."
"Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!"
Holy Porsche!
She's gotta be from my attorney's office.
"Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set."
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?
"Yeah, your job's pretty easy today."
All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.
How many of you want something to drink?
5?
10?
20?
How big's the party?
You got no right to make fun of me.
"I got a disorder, diagnosed by a legitimate doctor."
I got inside several different people.
"- Me, Mary Maude..."
- I met her.
JM...
"There are others, I don't know."
Let's get the department shrink to ride shotgun for Frank.
Are you kidding?
"Look at the way he's smiling, he's having a ball."
Tell JMJ I wanna talk to her.
"If you want to talk to JMJ, you have got to call her."
- What the hell is he doing?
- Watch and wait.
"Well, tell JMJ that I'd like to see her."
I don't talk to her.
"Whatever he's doing, it's inappropriate."
Can't you see he's playing her game?
- I only know she's in here.
- She's faking.
They don't know about me.
I am the dominant.
He'll trip her up.
- The dominant?
- That's what they call it.
"I know about the others, but they don't know about each other."
"You know JMJ, but you can't talk to her?"
Get that?
!
One of us!
"I don't get it. I'm stupid to get it Mr. Writer, sir."
"I say be an ordinary plumber, but you, you're a raving lunatic!"
That woman is deadly!
"Three husbands, three dead bodies!"
"One of us will be the fourth, can't you see that?"
Deadly?
You just want to scare me so I'll split!
So you'll have Chrissy for yourself and all her money!
Forget it!
"You can't rattle this boy, this boy's staying with Chrissy!"
- You stay and you're dead!
- Bullshit!
One of us will croak!
Scram!
Fine!
I'll read the headlines about your death!
Raving lunatic!
- Get in!
- No!
I'm leaving for Amsterdam!
Get in and I'll take you to the station.
Just don't take me anywhere near that woman.
Okay.
She's mine then.
- Can't you pass them?
- Grouch!
"You're driving beside your own funeral, Herman."
Watoh out!
"First him, doctor, first look at him."
"we got ourselves an ""X-Men"" fan."
right?
and not like this.
people die.
And no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop it.
- This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
- Logan...
Her nurse has been feeding her some grade-A bullshit.
I don't think Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence.
Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride?
Two more pills in one hour.
Give 'em to him.
Shane?
Joey.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Can't break the mold.
{\i1\cH80ffff}I tried it and it didn't work for me.
there's no living with a killing.
{\i1\cH80ffff}There's no going back from one.
it's a brand.
{\i1\cH80ffff}A brand sticks.
{\i1\cH80ffff}and tell her everything's all right.
{\i1\cH80ffff}And there aren't any more guns in the valley.
Who are you guys?
More cops?
'Cause I told the other guys everything that I... tracker.
You did your job.
Fellas.
Shit.
Knock yourselves out.
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand... new tires... and complete paperwork. if you can forget the paperwork.
they're bald.
I'll find a ride home.
No fair.
How come he can leave?
Nobody's leaving!
We just got here.
Our fun is only starting.
Let's hit that hill!
Yay!
Last one to the bottom is a rotten...
Fuck!
Ice-ball!
Goddamn it!
"If you cross my path today, Murphy,"
"I will scalp you, shit in the scalp, and slap it back on your head so everybody calls you ""shit wig"" and..."
- Hey!
"- Oh, man, don't hurt me!"
Yeah!
You better run from me!
"I'm afraid of your wife, you out-of-work pussyfart!"
"You see that, Sue?"
Everybody knows.
I can't even intimidate children anymore.
"Don't let him bother you, Frank."
He'll be in jail soon.
We can still have fun.
Smile a little!
"I'm trying, but I'm sick of all these busybodies looking at me like I have a fatal disease."
"""Oh, you poor man, how's the job hunt going?"""
"""I don't know, lady, how's your saggy tits going?"""
It's all in your head.
People love you.
"Come on, cheer up."
To the cemetary.
Your brother's grave.
My dead brother is not the problem.
Your mother is.
She might be dropping by just to say hello.
Mothers are like that.
So we're gonna go stake out a cemetary?
Until you come over with something better.
A.D.E.
What?
- After Death Experience...
- I know what it is.
My mom had one when I turned her.
Which means she saw you being turned.
By Marcus.
At the House of Chthon.
She's probably looking for me there.
"Please, please help me!"
I need to see my daughter.
I...
"Sorry, sir."
She came out of nowhere.
Not a problem.
Happens from time to time.
Is she?
Infected...
"Lane, this is Leon."
I've got a stray in the lobby who needs an immediate transportation to disposal.
"Ma'am, if you'd like to accompany these gentlemen through that door,"
I'll see to it that you receive all the attention you deserve.
"I want my daughter, where is my daughter?"
"Ma'am, we're gonna take care of you."
"Expected that boys have a lock electronics to be opened, then put it on directories to open the safe."
- Have a little risked.
- I do not know what to say.
Vault walls have a thickness three meters.
The hottest man is the key.
They found the alarm device against fire and emiþãtoarele.
They found the van.
Fire.
Where is it?
Where do you think?
Where is Jem?
"Maybe on the way here, and stopped someone set fire to houses, or to rob a liquor store."
I have no idea.
I started we take hostages?
"No, not we."
You wanted to talk with this fucker?
Speaking of the devil ...
Have you succeeded?
- Lost?
- We have a problem.
- What?
- Look.
And what if.
What?
Let me see.
- Phooey!
- Have you seen the address?
Trash it stands at four streets away from here.
"Yes, and I know where we are, Gloans."
Damn!
You'll see the bastards  on the street every day?
- I saw nothing.
"Yes, of course."
"You know, it's funny what a difference the flip of a coin will make."
"If you hadn't lost that silver dollar that night, i would've had fleurique, and you would've had josie."
"Oh, sergeant!"
"Yes, sir."
That cherry hill gang are coming over here looking for a scrap.
Cherry hill?
Yeah.
My bowery boys will be glad to hear that.
Ahem!
"Sorry, sir."
There must be some way we can give these bullies a party without getting our uniforms all torn up.
"Anyway, place a sentry around the ferry dock."
Have them give us a signal.
"Yes, sir."
"Here they come, colonel."
Keep that music going.
You all know what do do.
And remember... no knives or guns.
"Only clubs and iron bars for cherry hill, sir."
"Come on, uncle daniel, up you get."
Come on.
Up you go.
Come on.
Turn her on!
You want mr.
Daniel drew?
Yeah!
Come up and get him!
Cease firing!
Hooray!
"That'll get 'em, huh?"
There's a pube right there.
I did that to trick you.
That's 100 percent beef you're staring at.
"Wait, why not just play rock paper scissors?"
"What are we, fucking ten?"

Next will be better.
"Great, we're all on the same page then."
"Uh, the thing is, my problem isn't just the writing, it's the content."
It's frat humor.
"I mean, it should be about women."
"That's the point, right, to showcase women?"
Marty said it was just a first draft.
It's all part of the process.
"Just relax, all right?"
"Goldie, please, don't get so emotional."

"Good evening, residents of Mercy."
"Tonight, I stand before you, a man of faith, a man with a vision!"
A man with a purpose.
A man who is going to build a mosque in Mercy!
"It'll be our own mosque,"
No different than the mosque that we have in the church.
"If it's no different, then why do you need to build it?"
"Well, I had a vision."
That's how it all started.
"Well, not really a vision, more like a sign!"
Really?
- You would?
- You are so observing...
I bet you'd make a great photographer.
Home sweet home.

- It really bothers me.
All this fashion espionage.
Someone just takes our hard work... and hand it over to Vogue.
It really pisses me off!
I'm going to make it my mission to aprehend Yuri.
"If anyone can do that, you can."
A spy's work is never done.

"It is not truth, Lella is a good girl."
"In addition it does not matter, I want to me to Lella."

You love a woman for tonight?

"Yes, she did."
And did you live with her?
Yes.

So thank God for this place!
She didn't like music.
She struggled.
She found life a bit of an obstacle course.

"Actually, do you mind if I...?"
"No, please."
I may have over-vinegared.
Not for me.
You'll have your old moniker again and I'll choose a Lady for your mansion.

That witch foretold deeds worthy of my heroic ancestors.
I'll earn the favours of the lady of my head.
Lady?

So many high-born ladies were ready to care for you.
But there's only one Elisa.
You'll have to walk the rest of the way... and such a way!
"No more la French, now you're a commoner."
And you must walk like this...
I see.
Like this?
"That's it, your Grace."
Like a folk hero!
What's that?
Damned dog!
What's that?
Crazy swans... help...
Murder!
Shot in the back!
"She's high and dry, poor thing."
Whatcher doing?
"Not water, no!"
It's water she needs!
Help!
Somebody's coming!
"Horrible monster, go away!"
What are you doing?
I can see what's going on here.
You make my dad angry just like my granddad made him angry.
Why?
The situation with your dad and me is complicated.
What are you looking for in his old case files?
Just something that'll make him less angry.
"You know, I'm glad you're here."
"My dad's done so much by himself, you know?"
He really needs you.
"I'm glad he has a brother, and I'm..."
Glad I have an uncle.
Can you just... can you just promise me that you're... you're here to help him?
Gracie.
Of course.
"Yeah, I promise, okay?"
"Why don't you, uh, go make me one of those double-bacon BLT sandwiches, huh?"
Your grandfather told me all about them.
You got it.
Duval:
The name's Kevin Whitfield.
It's a junkie.
Overdose.
"Yeah, but this kid has no history of drug use."
He was going to college in the fall.
"Dad, just go through it with me."
See if I missed something.
These parents came to me.
"They said their son was better than this, and I believed them, Dad."
- I did.
- Tell me.
Please tell me you have something more than that.
His backpack.
Coffee.
Same here.
And two glasses of water.
"It's our first commercial release, so we're suspicious."
I saw the film.
And?
Nothing.
Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out.
So people know how desperate the situation is.
It's exceptional.
I didn't say I don't agree.
I totally do.
You live with Jean-René?
A house in Kremlin-Bicêtre.
With members of the collective.
The film you made in Italy...
Is it finished?
We're still debating.
Comrades find it politically questionable.
It's tense but fascinating.
I'm learning a lot.
We have an office.
"I answer the phone, tend to the prints."
It keeps me busy.
I want to go to college but I missed registration.
I may go to London.
To be a gofer on a film.
It may not work out.
What film?
Nothing like yours.
Go on.
Science fiction.
I want Pete back.
"I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room."
Fine.
I thought you were going to quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Yeah.
"Thank you, good night."
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.

Excuse me?
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, do you think there's two lines and we're all in this line and you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
You believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"Now I want all the hot dogs, please."
"Yeah, I'm buying all the hot dogs."
You don't have to do that.
"No, no, no, You don't have to do that."
That is ridiculous.
And I'm giving them to the good people.
Mattia gets all worked up.
"A brawl outside the office during working hours, stoned on who-knows-what."
- Anotherreport's too much.
- You defend him?
Me?
Never.
"But a report is useless, he has to change."
You know what Mattia VoIpe's real problem is?
He's crazy in love with you.
Not a chance!
"We were togetherfor a year, this is all I have left."
Why did you break up?
"He never says no, not even to his mom, he neverrisks anything."
I got mad and put him to the test.
I told him I'd asked to transfer.
And what did he do?
"Nothing, sir!"
- Mr. VoIpe?
- Mr. Director.
What is it?
You want to report me again?
Why don't you talk to yourmother?
.
- Why?
- Maria told me everything.
Mind your own business.
Okay.
Then behave properly during work hours.
Cocaine will never resolve personal problems.
What cocaine?
The cocaine you use when you make deliveries.
I saw you open that bag.
Me too.
"I think we're ready for business, Dennis."

"So, you must be feeling pretty excited about now."
Please sit.
- Hmm?
"- Well, I think I'm a little nervous."
"Well, good!"
Good.
Night before a confirmation hearing.
"Anything else, I would've withdrawn your name."
"- What about this Webster, sir?"
"- Ah, one second."
Anybody here hungry?
"- No, thanks."
"- No, sir, I'm not."
Thanks.
"Otto, could you whip up some Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?"
"No problem, sir."
"Ah, the kid."
Met him.
"You know this young congressman, Webster?"
"No, sir, I don't."
No matter.
He reminds me of me when I was his age.
That's bad.
"K, you need to put out word that no matter what this kid does... nobody's to give him a hard time."
"He's misguided, but he's got something."
You'll be OK.

"Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?"
"Uh, you look wonderful."
"Just where on this island is the treasure supposed to be, anyway?"
.
It says right here on the map.
"It was an entire 50 zeny, so search properly."
Who would believe such a cruddy map?
The same goes for that boat.
"Thanks to you skimping out, the engine broke."
"Now we can't even get back to the port, can we?"
.
How could you?
.
Am I going to die here...?
Just stop complaining and get searching for the treasure.
I'm so hungry...
I want some dinner pancakes...

You tell me now.
It's nothing.
I got shot 3 years ago when on duty.
"I didn't remove it, afraid it'd affect me."
It's been in there since.
I've fainted many times before.
Don't worry.
Only it was longer this time.

- You told her?
- Yes.
You were right.
"I needed to tell her, and it was unfair to her, and it was unfair to you."

"I'm gonna wanna hear, Spencer."
I just met with the Cowboys.
- Underlings?
Who cares?
He just came to finish off the relationship with Grandma.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Thank you.
Why didn't you tell us... about Uncle?
I wish I had known.
When we found out... about Uncle... we all cried.
"Looking at Nagasaki, it's hard to believe this is where the bomb was dropped."
"People do forget everything, and so quickly, too."
But I will never forget!
"Say, let's go back there once more."
"You mean, that school?"
Yes.
Let's go to Grandpa's place.
Where is Nagasaki?
We can't see it yet.
It's on the other side of that mountain.
I wonder what happened to the children?
They didn't want to meet Clark.
That's for sure.
It's all our fault.
Our... stupidity.
But Clark...
We didn't think that.
"Clark, is there any place that you would like to see in Nagasaki?"
"Yes, there is."
"So, we'll go to the hotel, and then..."
I don't need a hotel.
I'm going to stay at Aunty's place.
"Before that, there's a place I'd like to see."
The place where Uncle died.
- Mmm-hmm.
Randy?
"Psychologically, we need to connect with somebody."
- Could be.
Jill.
Because we're culturally preconditioned?
"Good answers, but too intellectual for me."
"I think it's because, as some of you already may know, while it does last, it feels fucking great."
That's why.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"I'm halfway through my meal, and you haven't even started yet."
The perfect bite.
Mmm.
You need a therapist.
"Rose, do we have to have the television on?"
Can't we have a civilized conversation?
I know I'm not as intellectually stimulating as some of you university people...
"Okay, I'm sorry."
"How was your day, Mother?"
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry.
Let's talk.
I've lived too long.
"I should be dead, not having conversations."
"You stop it, please."
Give me that!
Talk to me already!
All right.
You haven't even noticed I had my hair done differently.
"Yeah, I thought you looked different."
It looks great.
She made me realize
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I know that now.
I'm three months pregnant and you're already out trying to fuck other women!
What's gonna happen 10 years from now?
How could I ever trust anything you say again?
Jenna.
"Fuck you, man."
It's over.
- Jenna.
- Get out right now.
I'll tell you when you can come back and get your shit.
Maybe Kimmy can help you pack.
"- Jenna, we're having a baby."
- No.
"No, I am the one having this baby."
"I'm the pregnant one, not you."
And she's better off with no father than a lying asshole like you!
You're overreacting.
It was a couple kisses.
"After three years, Jenna, things happen."
"- Not to me, they don't!"
Get out!
- And go where?
Get out of here!
Go back to fucking Kim!
"What, are you gonna fucking stab me, Jenna?"
- Get out!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out!
"J ust don't even speak to me, okay?"
I can't believe you can't even be nice to me at a time like this!
Why do you even need me to be nice to you... since everybody else in the world is?
Graham. ls that you?
They said the pizza will be here in twenty minutes.
I'm not hungry.
Graham?
"No, it's me."
I'm just calling to thank you.
Thank me?
For what?
For sending Graham over here.
I don't know how you knew... but he is exactly who I needed.
Good.
How is it going?
How is Andy?
We don't-
- We're still waiting to hear if the angioplasty worked.
"By the way, I hope you understand about Sharon."
Sharon?
"You know, she just really felt like she needed to spend the night..."
"- in her own bed, you know?"
"- Sure, of course."
"Patty, you're the greatest friend."
- Go back to sleep.
- Okay.
Here.
"Now, you prefer your coffee at least two days old, right?"
I insist upon it.
You've been amazing through all this.
"No, I just don't think it has hit me yet."
"So Andy, was he working really hard or something?"
So why exactly are we going to his birthday party then?
I don't know.
"Free booze, good times, the usual?"
His parents supposed to have a fuck-off pad.
"Yeah, it's huge."
Proper country house.
Old man's a judge.
Kind of hoping she's gonna be there.

Lucky for Paul.
You'd think.
"He's been back a couple of days now and we still haven't, um..."
- Think he might've lost interest?
- In you?
"Hard to believe, right, honey?"

- It's the Hautbois family.

We won't keep you from your work...
I'm sure it's very important.

Nice.
Hello Miss.
I just wanted to deliver you a message from our friend Biberkopf:
He'll be home late.
Did he order you to do that?
Not exactly.
But I thought I might as well just see you and settle over what happened last night.
- Just what do you want?
- I already told you.
And there is nothing wrong visiting a beautiful young lady.
Nothing wrong with that?
It's a nice day and we will drive a bit around.
- Franz will join us!
- Franz?
Yes!
He'll meet us in the evening.
You know that we are friends.
Allright.
"It's an opportunity to have a talk with you, about Franz."
- Fine.
- Where is he?
"Freienwalde, Plumber-Karl is helping us out."
You wanted to tell me about Franz.
You've known him for quite a while.
I could talk for hours.
Great guy.
- A little weak but...
- Last night he cried in the hallway.
- What?
- He doesn't wanna go on like this.
"Well, your instincts are admirable, but you don't have to put aside your feelings for the sake of any of us."
I'm not saying I want to be the woman's best friend.
I'm just saying...
"I have been so busy blaming her,"
I don't think I've ever really seen her for who she is.
OK.
"So, what are you proposing?"
The truth of the matter is Holly is a part of our family now.
"I think I should embrace that, if only to set an example."
"I mean, we all have to put the past behind us where it belongs and move on."
- You think I'm crazy?
"- No, Nora."
I don't think you're crazy.
Good.
"Because if there's one person I count on to be my reality check, it's you."
Saul?
What?
It's the past.
It's not behind us.
You have to tell me what.
Tell me.
William and Holly had a daughter.
- What?
- Her name is Rebecca.
She's 20 years old.
She's here in L.A.
"I'm so sorry, Nora."
I'm so sorry.
- No one wanted to upset you.
- No one?
Who else knows?
Who else knows?
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Pff.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
"You know what, I just figured out what your costume is."
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes.
Oh!
Oh!
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story!
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...
If you look at it from my perspective...
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio, no one cares!"
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy... and it's all true!"
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"I don't know, something about me being too into myself."
"Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack."
You?
But you are so adorable.
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!
Are you going to clean it?
The Blue Diamond Hotel is right beside it.
I want to go there.
Do you see that bufalow?
"Yes, On the right."
Follow it.
It takes bath everyday in it.
What Madam?
You're just wasting time.
There's nothing in my bag.
I can see that you're a riot without a weapon.
"Show me the bag, okay go ahead."
See this is a pant.
And this is my Gun!
Where did that come from?
Put the gun down and surrender.
Yes I'll put it down but first let me think where it came from?
Give me the gun or...
I'll beat you so bad.
No Madam don't come forward.
A stupid fool like you will shoot me!
You're scaring a Jatni with spray.
"Ma'am this is my gun, actually the holi is coming that's why."
But when I saw your physique I got scared and...
I hid the gun in his bag.
Let him go.
Please Ma'am.
Let him go!
Gentleman is telling me to let him go.
Let him go.
You'll have to file an application for it.
"I obliged you, Aren't you going to oblige me?"
(both chuckle)
Good luck.
Isler needs you.
He's not gonna let you go that easily.
"Yeah, well, if he doesn't, I'm screwed."
(sighs)
Well good luck.
(sighs)
What-what are the police doing here?
"Oh, it's no big deal-- they're just here in case"
Darrell shows up before you leave.
But how does he know that we're leaving?
"Oh, a little birdie might've told him."
What?
"Look, Melody... you don't have to worry about him anymore, I promise."
"Why, what are you gonna do?"
What needs to be done.
(engine roaring)
"All right, you stay here."
You put Tucker in the car.
"I'll be right back, all right?"
"What's going on, huh?"
"They're arresting you, Darrell."
"Hey, what're you doing?"
Get off me.
LASALLE:
I did a background search.
You got outstanding warrants in Texas.
"That, plus assaulting a federal officer, you'll be going away for a long time."
"(grunting) Settle down, hands behind your back!"
"This ain't right, okay?"
You can't do this to me.
Maybe Caleb is the same.
It's only Hanna.
I wasn't asking who you were on the phone with.
Do you want the last bit of cobbler?
I can just bring it up for you.
"No, thanks."
Okay.
"- What do you mean, ""only Hanna""?"
- It's my mom.
Things are still sub-zero around here.
Did you tell her about Paige's dad?
No point.
She'll say it's my fault for choosing a disgusting lifestyle.
Paige is such a knob.
- I don't think it's all her fault.
- What do you mean?
What's going on between you and Aria?
It's nothing you have to worry about.
You were snarking at each other like you were on a reality show.
The Real Teens of Rosewood.
"Oh, tell me about Toby."
He says we have what he wanted us to have.
"It's the right message, I'm just reading it wrong."
He wants me to come to his house Saturday.
Are you going?
"If I don't, how are we gonna figure this out?"
I'm shut out with Melissa and lan.
- Where are you?
- What do you mean?
I'm right here.
Any fire truck you can hear at your house I can hear at mine.
"Oh, my God."
I
- I have felt bad about this for ten years.
"In fact, the only reason I came to this thing tonight was that I hoped you'd be here so I could tell you that."
Well.
Thank you.
That actually means a lot.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
I'm free!
And-and things really are going well?
"Oh, yeah, they really are."
I married just the greatest guy.
And now you get to meet him.
Perry!
"Sweetie, over here."
I'm so sorry I'm late.
"Oh, my God, the traffic was vicious."
"Kyle, this is my husband, Perry Pearl."
Hi.
"Sweetie, this is Kyle Lendo."
Kyle and I dated in high school.
"- Well, uh..."
"- Ooh, my competition."
"Back off, mister!"
"Shh, here she comes."
Surprise!
"Considering that I don't know any of you, yes, it is."
"Okay, so today happens to be the 20th anniversary of the first day of third grade, which means it's also the 20th anniversary of the day we met."
"So to commemorate the most important day of my life,"
I got as many people from our class as I could.
I got the actual cook from the school cafeteria to make us fish sticks and Sloppy Joes.
I never imagined it could be you!
With age a person's reflexes slow down
Don't blame yourself.
It's said...
"T o err is human, and you're not even human!"
How's that?
Good?
Who is Jin Tianyun to you?
We share a complex relationship
It's now close to the end
Let's forget all that meaningless talk!
Come!
Is it Gao Jian?
What do you call that stance?
Good!
Very good!
Stop!
"Gao Jian, will you ever obey your elders?"
Y es!
Please teach us the stances... which you used to kill that old fart
Don't you fear betraying your own school?
Of course not.
"There's only me, you and him"
"That's right, you can teach us step by step"
Nobody will know!
That's right!
Okay!
"- Good morning, sweetheart."
- Hi.
Still in love with that coat?
What coat?
seductor!
Damn it!
"Finally, you have arrived."
From where you come?
Of the university.
-Again Alvaro?
-Yes.
You are really an idiot.
You help me?
How many times you take trying to tie to him?
Two times.
Two times?
And above you have scored at Medicine to be near him.
"Without a doubt, a medical desire much, but until Alvaro finishes the doctorate..."
"Good, to his parents they do not need money."
Money.
"To the aim to the end, they only have a bar."
But you know what bar is?
It is a Sport Bar.
-He of the place?
"-Yes, that same one."
"Ah, then he rich."
I am not idiot.
"I have to him in the loose cord,"
I will not give anything to him until we marry.
"He is not handsome, but..."
"It hears, I say it to you like expert, you you have future?"
you know?
-Where it is?
-There.
"Because in spite of being a fan, you are better than many professionals."
Modestly...
When my snitches get killed.
Those fuckers give me a giant hard-on.
"Some get laid, others freeze!"
We're on the wrong team.
"No, that's his last fuck."
We'll hump again.
You sure?
Big Luc to Fat Ass.
"Mercedes wagon, local plates, 4 men on board."
It's headed your way.
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.
I nabbed him for a holdup 1 0 years ago.
A mean fucker.
I don't know the others.
Said and Jamel Attia.
I say it's for tomorrow.
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.
They'll fire at us.
We may lose them to avoid bloodshed.
What do you suggest?
"We hit 'em at night, and gun down the lot of them."
What about our ethics code?
I've wiped my ass with that for years.
They killed 9 men.
9 families call me every week hoping I'll have good news at last.
I owe it to them.
It obsesses me.
"Stay home, let Vrinks deal with it."
I've worked 2 years on this case.
It's my collar as much as anyone's.
"OK, but you'll be back-up."
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.
Who did you say?
"The new arc welder, I don't know his last name."
- What new arc welder?
"- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift."
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant.
This guy took his place.
"What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?"
"Reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual, busting his ass."
"There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik."
What is this?
"Mr. Reznik, have you recently suffered any head injuries?"
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?
No.
- Trevor.
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Why do you go out of your way to come here every night?
Is it out of the way?
An airport?
For coffee and pie?
Suppose I went to Danni's...
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.
Could I do that just in any diner?
Is someone chasing you?
Not yet.
But they will when they find out who I am.
Oh really!
Who are you?
Can you keep a secret?
To the grave.
I'm Elvis Presley.
No one hikes around here.
- Phillip.
- No.
Don't worry.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"Open up the back for me, please."
Sure.
"Heel, bud."
Jesus.
That smell is worse than the shit it covers up.
Have a good night.
You too.
Good boy.
We're S.E.A.L.S.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
"If you had taught him how to load that thing, there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge."
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We'd all be dead...
Five minutes.
"Shooters, you're gonna get a magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds."
A magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds.
All ready on the firing line!
All ready on the firing line!
"Shooters, make ready!"
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Unload!

RHAPSODY IN AUGUST
"Yeah, well, I gotta be able to sleep at night."
Just came from the federal court house.
James McGovern is pleading out.
- How much time did he get?
- 18 months.
No one should have to choose between obeying the law and watching their child die.
At least the judge postponed his surrender date for six weeks.
Then he gets to bury Kyle before he goes to prison.
"No, John maybe not."
The NTCC moved Kyle up to the top of the list.
What about Amy?
She just went to the hospital.
Kid on a motorcye cracked up doing 140 on the B.Q.E.
Kidney's a match.
"Hello, John."
Where are you going?
Home.
Something happen to the kidney?
I don't want it.
- Why not?
- Kyle McGovern's gonna die.
We'd both have a kidney if it wasn't for me.
"If I turn it down, it goes to him."
You could die waiting for the next one.
I'll take my chances.
That's the wankiest idea I've heard.
You must be shell-shocked.
"Well, what are you-"
- Wankiest?
"Foolish, ridiculous, possibly even stupid."
I think that's the best idea I've ever had.
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, doctor."
"Your medication, miss Porter."
"Thank you, Gunther."
"What book are you reading, miss?"
"Uh, it's Edgar Allan poe."
Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"The tales may be dark, i know what you're saying, but through them he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he holds up a mirror to our own lives."
You're a very thoughtful woman.
"Thank you, Gunther."
"If you ever need anything ever, you just let me know."
Isabel.
"Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
Calm yourself.
"Oh, thank god."
There's a man in there.
There's blood everywhere.
I...
I just...
Dr. lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
No.
- I think you're reaching because you don't want your sister's murderer slipping through your grasp.
"Which I totally get, by the way."
"I feel you, bro."
But our hands are well and truly tied here.
Where and when are we handing him over to the Feds?
We're still waiting for the final instructions from Quantico.
- Sometime in the next 24 hours.
- This has the cartel all over it.
- He's not wrong to think like that.
- No.
"No, he's not."
"Okay, I'm gonna ask this once and only once."
"Has anyone in this room, at any time, for whatever reason, told anyone else about our incarceration of Carlos Mejia?"
[Tense music]

[Sighs]
♪
[Pounding]
♪
- Oh.
Whoa.
- Come in.
"Sorry, I was at a client breakfast."
I came as quickly as I could.
What's up?
- [Sighs]
- What is it?
Did you tell anyone about Carlos Mejia?
- Excuse me?
"- Please, I don't have the time."
- I just need to know...
- Tell anyone what
"For God's sake, let me kill them!"
Let go of me.
Don't go there!
Come back here.
It's high tide.
You'll be caught in the seaweed.
You'll be killed.
You crazy?
Don't go to the ruins.
Come back!
They were in the marshes.
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.
- I'll look after them.
- All right.
You knew the risk you were taking bringing them here.
It's too late now.
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.
I know you are there!
You saw them!
They can set you free if they wish.
But you're the one who has to wait!
They have to come of their own free will.
I've seen how pure they are.
How innocent they are!
"I won't intervene, but I beg you to spare them!"
So be it.
Let destiny be fulfilled!
"Don't you want to play, Madame Louise?"
Last night ended in tragedy.
- What happened?
That was me.
My mouth was open.
"More importantly,"
I finally have enough bars on my phone to stalk Randy on Snapchat.
"Oh, great!"
"All of our problems are solved, except for food, money, and a place to sleep."
So negative.
Have you not seen the sneeze-guard-less bait shop salad bar?
"Speaking of pathetic, let me just check in on poor Randy."
Just another lonely night here in Texas... with all my new best friends!
- Hey!
- Ha-ha!
Hey!
I was up next for Twister!
Classic Jake.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Ha.
I'm sure he's just putting on a happy face.
That's obviously the only way to handle Jake.
"Deep down, I can tell he's genuinely upset."
I'm just genuinely happy right now.
"Ugh, this salad bar stinks."
"No, wait."
That's me again.
"Oh, my God, Max!"
The diner people put money in our PayPal account!
"They say it's from Chestnut, but he's not allowed on the Internet when we're not home."
I can't believe it.
Me neither.
The diner people are all we have in this world.
And I used to have a closet just for scarves.
Give me 10 hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
HOOK:
"Ladies, in this world we are slaves to time, and ours is running out."
"In other words, tick-tock."
(ZIPS SLEEVE)
I was hoping it would be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
That's a good girl.
"This will allow you to climb, but there are other dangers."
Thankfully you've got me to protect you.
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.

First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
HOOK:
"No, you're afraid."
Afraid to talk.
"To reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things would be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
Mothers do love Izzie.
My mother would've loved you.
"Uh, I stashed all the tequila, took the condoms out of the cookie jar."
"I also replaced all your trashy magazines with back issues of the ""Annals of Surgery"", okay?"
Does it smell musty in here?
My mom's house smells like peppermint.
- It's so homey.
- My house isn't homey?
- I feel at home.
- I was raised in a hellhole.
- This place is a palace.
"- Why isn't my house homey, George?"
I can't explain it.
It's just a feeling.
"Well, Izzie can't fix a feeling."
"She is freaking out, people."
Just tell her something I can fix.
Rebecca peed on that couch cushion.
I've been sleeping there for weeks.
"Thanks, Alex."
You're... a good friend.
You're welcome.
Keep drinking.
- Mark.
"- Hey, there you are."
- Want to get a drink?
It's four in the morning.
"- I probably, uh, shoulda called first."
"Hey, I hear your mom's coming into town."
Good times.
You'll be fine.
Just keep the talking to a minimum.
All right?
Get in the car.
What?
We're taking a little ride.
Senator.
"All right, gentlemen."
"Ah, thank you."
How are you?
Thank you for coming.
How are you?
Hi.
"We should, uh, talk to the staff about Rebecca not being able to come."
We should all be on the same page.
"- I'll get right on it, senator."
"- Hey, good to see you, senator."
"- Joe, I'm glad you could make it."
- Hey.
Yeah.
"We got those CEOs to blink, but trust me, in November, we're going to have 'em on the run."
- Senator.
"- Hey, Cathy."
- Hello.
"- Don't you worry, I promise I am going to push that through, even if I have to haul that committee into chambers myself."
Appreciate it.
Quite a turnout here.
"Thanks for hosting this, dad."
"Hey, my son, least I could do."
"You know, I would still be picking out his ties"
If he would just let me.
"Somebody needs to dress this boy, you know what I mean?"
- What's going on?
- What?
"For me, as a seven-year-old, my hero was my mum..."
"For me, as a seven-year-old, my hero was my mum... ..Detective Liz Cruickshank."
..Detective Liz Cruickshank.
"I don't want you anywhere near my house, Les."
"I don't want you anywhere near my house, Les."
We clear on that?
(SNIGGERS)
We clear on that?
(SNIGGERS)
You got something for me?
You got something for me?
"I do love it when you talk dirty to me, Lizzy."
"I do love it when you talk dirty to me, Lizzy."
"Morning, sir."
Just had a meeting...
D-d-d-d-d...
"Morning, sir."
Just had a meeting...
D-d-d-d-d...
"Sir, I just had a meeting with a fizz."
"Sir, I just had a meeting with a fizz."
There's an Italian going around town looking for a hitman.
There's an Italian going around town looking for a hitman.
Who's the target?
He doesn't know.
Who's the target?
He doesn't know.
That's what I call useless information.
That's what I call useless information.
He also said that the shooter has to be an Aussie.
He also said that the shooter has to be an Aussie.
"So, what are we talking about?"
Of course.
It took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.
"But when I did, it was a real score."
I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.
"And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed, I could see that this was a really good business."
"I made $12,000 in my second week."
I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.
All I had to do was every once in a while was tell Sandy that I loved her.
But it was perfect.
I'm tellin' ya...
"As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh, I knew Paulie would never find out."
Within a couple of weeks it got so big...
I needed some help.
So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
Nice...
It's fuckin' great.
-Nice...
Mr. Conway?
!
You bring your pay slips?
Four and a half months of dirt.
-lt's so good.
-l did it.
-Do you love it?
"-Oh, it's wonderful."
This we just had to have made special.
"Go ahead, sit in it, Belle."
The others you couldn't even sit in.
"Okay, you ready?"
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special.
Come on...
I wouldn't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex.
Just like him!
Don't say things about my father.
He was wonderful.
- Wonderful!
- And good to you.
"- You told me that, so don't blame him."
- Wonderful and good.
That's what I told you?
"Well, I lied."
I lied because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
- Then why did you marry him?
- I didn't!
He didn't marry me because he had a wife.
"- You don't mean that, Mother."
- I do mean it.
- Don't you understand?
- No.
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison.
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
"She looks so, so... ."
Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
"A few days' care, and she'll be out of it."
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And Connie just because it happened in your house, don't think any of it was your fault."
Somehow I do.
I don't know. I'm feeling a little bit weird.
You know everything's going to be okay.
I feel it.
"So, you pick out a dress yet ?"
Dress ?
"Yeah, you know, girls wear those sometimes."
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.
Couples only Saturday night.
"We already talked about this, remember ?"
Yeah.
"We talked about it, but I didn't know we decided on it."
"Well, it's Stepps."
What is there to decide on it ?
I don't know. I just thought that with the flight and everything... that maybe we should cool it for a little while.
What ?
"Well, uh, what are you saying ?"
Are you saying that you don't wanna be with me ?
You don't wanna be seen with me ?
What are you saying ?
"I'm just saying I'm confused, that's all."
Confused about what ?
Me ?
A little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.
Maybe ?
"So, hold on."
What ?
"Are we talking about Stepps and school, or are you talking about the grocery store, the sidewalk and museums ?"
"Break it down a little bit better for me, 'cause I don't get it."
When is it okay for us to be together ?
"We had California plates, but our car broke down in New Mexico, so we had to get a new car."
"I told you it wouldn't make it, Ray."
But he wouldn't listen to me.
This one will make it.
Make it where?
Philadelphia.
My mother lives there.
She's sick.
"Ray is my boyfriend, so he got stuck with the job of taking me there."
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.
Uh...
"We weren't speeding or anything, were we?"
"No, ma'am."
What the fuck did you stop us for then?
I want you to get out of the car one at a time.
"You first, ma'am."
Get your hands up.
"Hey, calm down."
"You said ""Get out, you first, man,"" right?"
"Step around to the rear of the car, and keep your hands where I can see them."
"You said ""Get out of the car."" That's all I'm doing."
What's wrong with you?
You told us to get out.
"Ray, do what the man says."
"Stay where you are, ma'am."
Now you put your hands on the car.
Spread them out.
Now spread your legs.
"Okay, same thing."
Hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
Somebody shine a light down there.
He just hit the water and... he went down.

Where's Davis?

"Maybe she was a good teacher when she was younger,"
"But now that she's older, she just doesn't care anymore."
Yeah.
"I'm a lot younger than her,"
And I don't really care anymore.
"She's jaded and burned-out, and the last thing"
"She should be doing is teaching kids that young,"
But does the school system care
That she is creating a hostile learning environment?
"No, because the school system is broken, mike!"
It's broken.
You're right.
Somebody should do something.
They should.
Where you going?
Bed.
But we're in the middle of a conversation.
Really?
I was at the end.
Night.
"Well, maybe mike could turn it off,"
"But I was too worked up to sleep,"
So I called my sister...
"I mean, when a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
I called my mom...
"When a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
"And at 3:00 in the morning, I'd had enough talk."
Hey.
What are you doing up so early?
I never came to bed.
Killed during the rebellion.

Just you and me.

Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
"-Still believe this is a dream, do you?"
-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
"Yes, yes."
But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS)
"I must be, then."
I'll miss you when I wake up.

Could I see that bill of sale?
"Thank you, son."
You consider this an actual bill of sale?
"I'm just the auctioneer, sir."
The bill of sale's been sworn to.

They haul me out of the clink only to say that you're shitting in Venom's boots.
It's not '45 or '68 any more.
"In '45, you were king of the streets."
What a result.
- The streets are still around.
- So am I. But the posters have changed.
"Well, I'm not dumb enough to get my head on a poster!"
But dumb enough to have your father clean up after you.

"It's nerve-racking being here now though, and actually seeing, Iike where you're actually playing."
"Like, I sat here the other week watching Kanye West play."
And now we're here.
I just feel a bit nervous.
"AII right, fellas, Iet's start."

"So I'm like, ""Okay, whatevs."""
Right from the start we were always very v ocal  that we couldn't follow the boy band stereotypes.
"Choreographed dance routines, and everything's the same."
Here we go!
"Go, NiaII!"
Taking the crowd with you!
Love the stag.
Keep the stag.

"Jove's sake, he's like a tree!"
Hence why he moved me up here.
What?
You can't change the rules just cos you found a tree man.
You have to check with me first.
"No, it's my sport."
I invented it.
I've been playing it for ages!
It's my sport.
Is this still the meeting?
"No, ignore that."
"Basically, my point was..."
"Hello, I'm Marcus."
I'm gonna do some really good stuff around here for you.
So...
Like what?
"Like, well... give you comfier chairs and unblock the toilets... and oil that squeaky door."
"Oh, thank you."
"Yes, exactly."
"For too long, this company has put profits above people."
Yeah.
"If there's anything you need at any point, just ask and I will deliver."
Thank you very much.
"Could I go and find a big man for my jugball side, please?"
Yeah.
"Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK, fine."
"Wicked, thanks."
It's terrible!
I can't eat anything.
"You don't know any dentists, do you?"
"Davus here could extract the bad tooth, if you want."

You shouldn't be in here
- Are these yours?
"- No, my brother's"
Here
Thanks

Your ex's?
They were my mother's
Turn around
That stuff really worked.
The pain has gone completely
"OK, you can turn around"
"It suits me, doesn't it?"
Are you closed?
The power is down.
What else can I do?

Okay.
I must have passed out after I reenlisted.
- What?
- I said I passed out.
- Why do you think I was lying here?

You didn't have any idea what you were doing last night.
- How could you?
- But I did.

Klinger.
Klinger.
"Klinger, come here."
Get-Get up.
Look-Look.
You're gonna get over Laverne in a little while... but that's no reason to throw away the best years of your life.
- I haven't.
- What do you mean?
"Well, it's not official until I raise my right hand and Col. Potter swears me in."
- I'm Justin.

"Uh, Felix was due back yesterday, but he ended up getting stuck abroad."
"- In Chile, of all places."
- Chile?
"Y-Yes, I know, it's bizarre."
"Uh, he's been volunteering on a hospital project, having a fantastic time, by all accounts"
"The birthday bash was meant to be a surprise, and... well, then, his flight got cancelled."
"I've been ringing around putting people off, but I haven't done a very good job of it evidently."
"So, there's no party?"
I'm really sorry.
"But look, there-there's plenty to drink, plenty to eat, um, places to crash."
"Youre more than welcome to hang out here tonight, in fact I hope that you will."
I know that Felix would approve.
"Come on, uh, let's do this."
"Uh, Luke, it is, uh, Luke, right?"
"Yeah, that's right."

"Grab six glasses, my friend."
I'm cracking open the bubbly.
"Let's have a party, then."
- He is horny.
- He's okay.
What's in a name?
"One must serve tea, after all!"
Don't lie!
Shut up!
It's because of you that he got into trouble.
Where'd he get the 5000 Rupees he paid your surety from?
Speak the truth!
Where did the 5000 Rupees come from?
I wish I had.
They caught me putting back the money!
You should've told them that you're putting the money back!
They didn't let me speak!
They chased me and I ran!
But this job is not for you!
"Ajob is a job, after all!"
I only have to earn my living.
Yes.
I miss the respect I got as a chef.
Forget it!
I was sick of the hotel-life anyway.
I'm thinking of joining the movies now.
"Get me a role, will you?"
"If I become a star, I will soon join politics."
I could even become a minister soon after.
"You want to act, don't you?"
Of course!
"""Killing two birds with one stone"""
Wonderful!
That's a great title for a film!
"I play the stone, all right."
Who are the birds?
You will play both the roles.
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
(BABY cries)
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
"Please, you have to tell him."
"It's okay, the baby's fine."
Not the baby.
Okay.
He killed Sean.
"-Honey, the police know."
-They don't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.
(DOOR OPENS)
(panting)
Please...
No... (MUFFLED screaming)
(sighs DEEPLY)
"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
"Well, not completely."
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post-traumatic stress.
Or maybe a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
"I wanna tell how I came to know Mr. Catchings, the man I killed."
I wanna tell this so my son will know.
Mr. Catchings was the overseer on the cotton plantation in Georgia...
... wherel slaved with my wife and children...
... 1 9 yearsago.
I don't need to say how bad life was to a slave.
We worked from sunup to dark.
We got whip.
We got sold.
We ain't had no hope.
But this is what I need my son to know about what I did.
When our little boy was 7 year old...
... hismama...
... wasforcedintocarnalrelations with Mr. Catchings.
What Mr. Catchings told her was that if she didn't...
... he'dselltheboy awayfrom us.
Seven years old.
He'd sell him away from his mama and daddy.
My wife...
... couldn'tbearthethoughtofthat.
So she went to his bed.
When she found out she was in a family way...
... shewasso afraid it would be that man's baby.
She lost her mind.
Walked into the river.
Drowned herself.
I would have killed Mr. Catchings then.
But me and the children was loaded on wagon in chains...
"... thatsameday,soldtoAlabama."
It took a lot of spirit out of me.
And I hope my son understands why now.
So you see...
"As long as you'r e all on the other side of it, yes."
What'd he say?
He said not to worry about it.
Feel like doing some tape work?
"Yeah, in a minute, but I'm gonna go see Rebecca first."
-
- Elevator woman?
-
- It's the menschy thing to do.
It is.
"I could blow her off, but -- -"
- But you'r e not that guy.
-
- I'm not that guy.
-
- This would be a good time to talk to him.
-
- Leave me alone.
'Cause you can see he's by himself in his office.
What makes you think Casey's inter ested in advising me on how I can get Gordon not to br eak up with me?
-
"- He's not, but he'll do it anyway."
-
- Why?
'Cause he's secr etly in love with you.
-
- He's not.
-
- He's only pr etending he's not.
"We've been through this, you and I."
"He's pr etending he's pr etending he's not so I think he is, but he's not, but he thinks he is, which doesn't matter, anyway, because I'm in love with Gordon."
-
"No, I really think that it would be good for me to know why you cannot live without this other woman."
"Well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum."
"She said, ""Either we get married or we break up."""
So we got married.
Wow.
You caved.
It's complicated.
Really?
What?
You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
You marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
"I mean, shit, I don't know."
[SIGHS]
You're really hot.
And I am obviously attracted to you.
So I think the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper and call you and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
Hi.
Hi.
What's going on?
[HAMMERING]
Javier.
"Javier, I thought we talked about tarping the furniture."
[PHONE RINGS]
City Supper.
"Hi, this is Gigi."
Is Alex there?
Hold on.
- Alex?
- Yo.
- Drinks are good?
MAN:
"Yeah, one more."
"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gimp?"
"Sorry, what was that?"
- I can't hear you.
- Leave him alone.
"Shut your trap, ugly!"
Gemma.
Gemma.
"Oh, no."
This is all your fault.
Think about it.
When exactly did Felix string himself up?
The night after the party?
No.
The night before his big brother came home.
"Truth, Felix..."
Who were you afraid of?
Who made you so fucking scared that you'd rather die?
Than have him find out what happened.
"Show me with your eyes, Felix."
Show him.
"What's this about, brother?"
It was meant to be a fucking joke.
A little prank... to teach my lazy arse boyfriend a lesson
"I was drunk, Felix was willing."
A little too willing.
That's what this is about.
Isn't it?
He hanged himself!
My dad's company went down the pan a few months ago.
"Not that you'd give a toss, Justin!"
But I thought that just maybe the Hautbois family could help out.
"I sent Felix an email... very polite... wondering if, uh, he could talk to his family about refloating my dad's company."
"It was awful and it was terrible and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back.
"Although the Charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
"No, I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I woke up.
"Yeah, that's right."
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy.
Mercy?
Please.
"Said Puss, with his last dying breath."
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower."
"Oh, my goodness."
Why would I do that?
"And right behind you, there was danger."
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed.
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
It was packing heat and it wanted revenge!
I want revenge!
The donkey... ran.
I was giving the matter my serious consideration.
"Then when I saw him sulking, Jesus!"
"He was very good-looking, though."
Very handsome.
"Not really, Mary."
Not when you got up close to him.
Beauty's only skin deep.
"It wasn't even that deep, Mary."
He'd loads of little spots on his chin.
"Tiny, little ones, now."
Millions of them!
Only noticed 'em when you were right up against them... then you want to throw up.
He was thick as well.
"Come here, Jackie."
Was he passionate?
No!
But he thought he was.
You know what I mean?
"He was just a big, thick monkey."
"Looking for somewhere to stick his banana, what?"
Ha!
Yvonne Burgess!
He stuck his tongue in me ear once... and I'm not joking yous.
He was trying to get it out the other one.
Don't know what he thought I had in there.
"His sense of direction wasn't the best, either."
- Know what I mean?
- Jackie O'Keefe!
"You're bleedin' disgusting, you are!"
"Any news, Sharon?"
No.
Not really.
Look.
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.
Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions.
Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things.
"The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home."
"You bet it does, mister."
"Save your voices, gentlemen."
They're coming here to your rescue.
You tormenting fiend.
"- You're so sure, aren't you?"
- Quite sure.
It is my plan.
Two come to rescue one... then the others follow.
Lay it on me.
Chicken and mung bean noodle salad.
[Giggling] [Chuckling]
"""Mung beans."" [Laughs]"
They do it to me every time.
"Well, I can't wait to see what the oyster sauce does."
"Oh, that's a really ancient reference."
- Here.
- [Sighs]
Alex.
What are you thinking?
I don't wanna go home tonight.
I think you probably have to.
No.
All I have to do is decide to pay the consequences.
- And?
"We'd like to eat, sometime this year!"
"Jude, how did the batting cages go?"
"Do we need to call the Padres, see if they need another big hit in their lineup?"
- Huh?
- I don't think so.
"Oh, come on!"
Planning my retirement.
- Bread me.
- Oh!
Guys!
"So we, uh, make an appointment yet for the hand surgeon?"
"- Uh, no."
- Why not?
"Well, I talked it all over with your father."
Is this about money or something?
Isn't that what the settlement from Vico is for?
- Fix my freaking hand?
"- No, Brandon, it's not about money."
"We just, um... we just feel that it's a little too risky, Brandon."
"And, uh... your father and I are saying no."
I don't get this.
"It's my hand, my money, my life."
And I wanna play piano again.
"Like, really play."
Why is this so hard to understand?
I want the surgery.
"Brandon, we are eating dinner."
Can we please discuss this later?
"Yeah, well, I'm not hungry."
- So you talked to Mike?
- This afternoon.
And you just... decided?
There are certain moments that define your entire life.
Moments when a shock goes through your body.
"And although you don't understand it yet, you know... from this point forward, nothing will ever be the same again."
News flash:
It ain't real.
"On the outside you might be Soccer Mom of the Year, but on the inside... it's all you can do to hold it together."
Keep up the image.
"All across America, families are hiding behind the same mask... of baseball practice, Girl Scout cookies, Harry Potter sequels... and $15 Yu-Gi-Oh!"
Cards.
"Truth is, we're all living in fear and hiding behind our SUVs."
"One of these days, the other shoe's gonna drop, honey."
It's going to drop.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Here we go.
"We""re all set."
"- Do you have a pen, please?"
"- Yes, I do."
Here you go.
How are we feeling?
- It hurts.
- Yeah.
"- What time is the soccer game, honey?"
- About 2:00 on Saturday.
- Who are you playing?
- The Cougars.
"If we beat them, we""re in the playoffs."
"Mom, can I go to the park?"
What?
Yeah.
"Oh, my!"
Look at you.
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go... and... all I could see... was black... and all I could feel was the darkness above me... and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
"And then I heard this voice, like somebody whispering in my ear."
"""Wake up, number 37""."
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright... flash.
Lightning.
Something... encircles me.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch... catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
We are moving.
What do you mean?
The factory is cutting back.
There is no work for Rolf.
He got offered a position as a mechanic in Notodden.
And I got a job at the bag factory there.
What does Lise say to this?
Does she want to go?
- We need money.
"- Yes of course, I'm sorry."
We leave this Friday.
- Friday?
What about the concert?
"- No, it..."
We were supposed to go together.
"I'm going to see if we can postpone it, so that Lise can go to the concert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, I'm just being stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about Friday?
Do you know anyone who can postpone the shipment?
- Yes.
"Do it by tomorrow, then we'll postpone until Sunday."
"- Excuse me, Sir."
- Tronstad.
- Have you got a minute?
"- Yes, what can I do for you?"
How sure are we?
How far down the line are they with the bomb?
Any new information I haven't got?
"Well, we're never sure."
I know my way around.
"We're not committing to an offer yet, but if you have a number, we'll listen."
"Mr. Canning, are you with us?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was just texting my lawyer."
"It's funny, isn't it, lawyers having lawyers?"
"And my lawyer probably has a lawyer, too."
"We should all be getting progressively smaller, like matryoshka dolls."
Yes.
"So are we negotiating,"
- or what are we doing?
"- No, we're negotiating."
I-I think I have an offer for you.
A one-time offer.
- Zero?
Really?
"- Yeah, unfortunately you have five minutes to decide whether to take it."
I see.
"And if we don't, you have a bomb or something?"
Sort of.
Hi.
We're all here.
Where are you?
Just changing.
I'll be right in.
"The rash is back, Michael."
I know.
I'm trying the ointment three times a day.
You have to stop eating so much spicy food.
Yes.
No more Thai food for you.
"Oh, please, it's just poop."
"You shovel the stuff all day, buddy."
I have to find the way to touch the hearts of people.
"What does your heart say, sire?"
Carlos?
Mr. Lloyd?
But look at it as well.
It's beautiful.
It comes from the solar storm.
"Sire, there are no flights."
"No, I understand, Carlos."
But we have an escape plan.
Explain yourself.
The Sea Mermaids.
The Sirens of what?
And action.
No action.
Look.
"Sir, please."
Second shot.
"Sire, I can not take the responsibility of this farce."
"I understand, Ludovic."
Now focus on her femininity.
It is madness.
We can not do it.
"- I agree, but it was decided."
"We have no other choice, now or never again."
"But Sire, we can not leave without protocol and security."
"In fact, Sire, it is undeniable that there are dangers."
"The dangers are everywhere, always."
- But Mr. Lloyd will not come with us.
"Mr. Lloyd is the architect of our escape, Louise."
It is very creative.
"- He comes with us, with the camera."
Lieutenant?
"Aw, holy shit."
Yeah.
I'll be right there.
There's been another murder.
Milwaukee.
Why don't you just come in here and sit?
How long was this one dead before they found her?
What's she doing here?
Not even an hour.
The husband came home with the kids.
"Would you come with me, please?"
- What?
- Come on.
What's going on with this girl?
I happen to like her.
Is it any of your business?
"Yeah, it's my business because it's my ass."
Mitchell's talking about... putting another team on the case.
Mitchell's what?
Who the hell's he going to put on this case... that's not already working on it?
"I mean, we followed every goddamn lead."
We got enough evidence to put the guy away for life.
We've got one fucking problem... we have no idea who did it.
And she is the only one that saw that killer.
That's why I keep coming back to her.
"I'm telling you, she's the key."
To the case or to you?
Ridge...
I bought her flowers.
I bought her fucking flowers.
Me.

"- Come on, Allison."
- Rodney.
Allison!
This was supposed to be a birthday party.
"Just playing ""photography"":"
"Turn off the lights, see what develops."
Don't be fresh.
Just leave immediately.
- All of you!
- I just caught her under the mistletoe.
Will you please leave?
"Happy birthday, Allison."
"Come on, Betty."
I'm sorry.
Thanks anyway.
"Thanks, Allison."
Come out here.
"Allison, I said come out here."
I knew this would happen if you invited Betty.
- Wasn't her fault.
- And you making love...
"We were kissing, one kiss, not making love."
"The house in darkness, and couples necking all over."
"I know, but everyone wanted to dance in the dark."
And I couldn't very well... .
"Mother, at every party in this town, they turn out the lights."
I don't want you to be like everybody.
I want you to rise above Peyton Place.
"It's my home, my town."
She didn't put poison in my cup.
"Well, Mrs Lightman didn't mention meeting you."
How come you've said nothing about it till now?
It's the truth.
"That woman poisoned you, so why on earth would you want to cover for her?"
She didn't do it.
Right.
Fair enough.
"I'm done here, George."
I'll stay here with Henry.
No!
Just leave me alone... all of you!
"Iris has motive, opportunity, previous, and what's more she's lied to us."
We've easily got enough.
"You've met her, Father."
Do you think she did it?
No.
But I don't know who did.
Why is Henry behaving so strangely towards me?
I don't know that either.
But let him rest.
Haven't you got an appointment this lunchtime?
"Mrs McCarthy, sorry I'm a bit late."
But I thought you were...
Inspector Mallory has arrested Iris Lightman.
And as Henry wants to be left alone...
The inspector's also arranged a car to drop us off in Cheltenham.
Oh!
"Oh, they're beautiful!"
That is very...
I'll just go and get myself ready.
There's no need.
"Seigaku regular, second year student, Kaidou Kaoru."
You'd better not regret.
You will lose.
What did you say.
Well he looks quite cute.
He's really good!
"You alright, senpai?"
Such beautiful spinning ball...
It's my first time seeing something like that.
"Hey, hey, hey, ah Kaidou?"
Who's he playing with?
That must be the transfer student Ryuzaki-sensei was talking about.
"Heh, you can even spin the ball into such an angle."
Snake shot.
Game Kaidou.
One love.
Court change.
So it'll be like this.
"If it continues like this, he will..."
My reaction is getting slower.
I can't be losing to this chibi?
This is a match of perseverance.
I won't lose.
Heh...
This person even knows the Snake.
"That is a Buggy Whip shot, right."
It's quite difficult to use since this is my first time trying it.
First time?
"Senpai, you sure are sweating a lot."
You'll wet that uniform.
The weather's so hot yet you're dressed so weirdly.
It's not over.
That chip allows you to see the future.
"Yeah, I can see the attraction."
"You have to tell me what's going on, Artie."
"Well, he may have figured it out already."
Seriously?
"I mean, it's Pete we're talking about."
I can't get ahold of him.
His cell keeps going to voice mail.
- Alice has obviously the Farnsworth.
- Dude...
He's in a big hotel.
There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno.
He said that this chip saved his life.
- And you stole it?
- It's what we do.
"Pete Lattimer, white courtesy telephone."
"Jillian, take the money and run, don't walk."
Find a beach.
Never look back.
I am gonna go get your husband.
"Wait, hold on."
You're not arresting us?
You're letting us go?
"What happens in Vegas, okay?"
Just get outta here.
It looks like you were telling the truth.
Don't hurt Jillian.
Do you know what?
Hurting is half the fun.
You wanna know what's more fun?
The other half.
Who are you?
"Sinaté, I'm preparing a little trip."
"Hey, you, what about your papers?"
I don't have any.
"Hey, get up!"
Come on!
"You, there!"
Get up!
Your ID?
"The guy asked him for a ""hit""."
"As the baker didn't understand, the Sarakollé showed him a loaf of bread..."
Then the baker and his wife started to laugh.
That's funny!
"Our Sarakollé fathers... in Europe, make fun of white people..."
Really funny!
Leave that!
What have I done now?
You're provoking me!
"Come on, M'Batoma, let's go to the room."
Founé!
See the children off to bed!
Is this your little girl?
Time to go to bed.
"Excuse me, Balla... it's better to be alone."
Women are indiscreet.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
"After returning from Europe, my husband won't let me work."
What about your degrees?
Young men are jealous.
In a week you'll have your car.
I'll go and see Bathily for your coverage.
You'll have all the privileges of your rank.
I have some friends here too.
Look.
"See that man over there, standing next to Matt by the float?"
His name's Frank.
He's very handsome.
And he's also quite handy.
"And he noticed that the axle is kind of rusted, which is very dangerous."
So all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure and...
No!
[MATT YELLING]
"- Hey, pick this trailer up!"
"Guys, lift it!"
- Give me a hand.
MAN:
"Dude, come on."
"- Come on, lift."
[MATT GRUNTING]
MAN:
Come on!
"- Caroline, call an ambulance."
- Okay.
Why are you doing this?
I'm showing you how easy it is to hurt people.
You're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
- Hand it over and the fun will stop.
- Damon's not gonna give it to me.
And I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you.
He'll kill you before he gives it up.
"Is that before or after I kill your brother, Jeremy?"
ELENA:
Jeremy?
Jeremy!
You questioning my professional competence?
He sure looks bad.
"He's dying, poor old thing."
- Can't even eat anymore.
- What seems to be wrong?
"I'm not the best doctor in the world, but I'm the best one without a license."
"My diagnosis is plague, tuberculosis, old age and no hope."
He's tired.
Bone tired.
SOLDIER:
The captain's in there!
Check the damage in the dispensary!
"Everything's all right here, colonel!"
"A near miss, but nobody hurt."
- I think they've stopped.
"- Yes, sir."
This is the usual procedure.
About every other night.
Harassment.
It's pretty good shooting.
"Commo bunker, the dispensary, the team house."
It's a sure thing that they have eyes inside our camp.
MacDANIEL:
Check your gear.
Commo bunker was hit.
"Lieutenant Green, form a recon patrol, ASAP!"
GREEN:
"Petersen, come with me."
MacDANIEL:
Who is it?
"Lt's the captain, sir."
Better move him out of there.
The universe is cold and unfeeling.
The only constant is chaos.
Was that place out of chocolate-chip pancakes again?
We were all almost killed by a truck.
Ay!
Idios mío!
"Are you okay, papi?"
"This was all Phil's fault, wasn't it?"
He's always blaring that damn new wave music!
No.
He swerved to avoid it.
Saved my life.
But the game of life is rigged.
Death always win.
"Okay, I know what you need right now..."
A trip to the ice-cream shop.
He doesn't need ice cream.
He needs to talk about what just happened to him.
"Well, I could go for some ice cream."
I know how to fix my son.
"So, this is fixed."
Go around.
"Normally, I'd be avoiding these cracks out of respect of your back, mom, but after today, it seems pointless."
- That's it.
Get in.
"- No, no."
"No, Jay, he's afraid!"
It's only gonna get worse.
In.
Trust me.
"Five minutes in here, he'll be happy as a clam."
Aah!
"- No, no."
"- Yes, we are."
"- No, we aren't."
We are.
"All the girls came to get me, that's cool."
Where's Sarah?
"- Kitty, he's sitting in the back with you."
"- No, seriously, thanks for bringing the whole family."
"I mean, my day wasn't bad enough."
They were worried about you.
"Oh, you had the do the right thing, right?"
"Because Kevin always does the right thing, except sleep with women."
"Justin, could you shut up for ten seconds?"
"If you didn't want my help, why'd you ask?"
'Cause I was in jail.
I figured I should call the family lawyer.
"I mean, that's what you are, right?"
If your father could see this behavior!
He'd what?
Judge me?
Tell me to get a job?
He'd be so diappointed!
Disappointed?
Who the hell is he to be disappointed?
He's the disappointment!
What does that mean?
Forget it.
"Your father loved you more than anything on Earth, you little spoiled brat!"
- You know what love means in this family?
It means you suck!
- Get in the car!
It means nothing you do will be good enough!
"-lt's a risky exercise, man."
Take care!
- Do not be afraid.
Stepa will survive my attack.
"I'm not anxious about him, I worry about you."
You may get bruised.
Nowwhat?
"Well, did you take this prisoner?"
-You really know some tricks!
- ls yourwar over?
-Over.
"- l'll teach you how to use all these tricks against me, an ex-con asshole!"
It is not a real trick.
A pal taught me this move in prison.

Stand up!

-Are you teaching the young ones again?
"-Yes, we are, comrade corporal."
"Well, listen to the battle order."
Tomorrow at 02:40 Odintsov's battalion will perform a battle recon mission at our hill.
Ourtask is to get as close as possible and disclose all alien firing positions.
-ls it clear?
"-Yes, completely."
Malakhov!
You are assigned to Sergeant Pozdneeva.
-What for?
I am saying that I can help you.
Have you found a clue?
Is that...?
It can't be.
This was left at the scene of the fire.
I believe that this scrap of cloth is from the cloak of Professor Moriarty.
Moriarty?
An odd little man who fancies himself a criminal genius.
"So, he stole the engine..."
Dear...!
"Please help them, Mr. Holmes."
Ouch!
Ouch!
What the devil is this?
An engine?
!
Who would dare drop such a filthy old thing out of the sky?
!
That's Moriarty's aircraft Pteranodon!
Did he intentionally drop it on me?
After him!
Give chase!
Go!
What a wonderful engine!
"With this, there's no doubt that I will win the world championship."
I knew that we couldn't win with the engine that the Professor built.
Did you say something?
Uh...well.
Nothing.
Out to sea?
Where are they heading?
"""The judging committee has approved the entry of a mysterious aviator..."""
"Paul, can I borrow you?"
I need you to check something for me.
"Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?"
You're in this up to your neck.
"We're watching all the ports, so they have nowhere to go."
I don't know where they are.
"That's bollocks, and you know it."
"- Sarge, can I...?"
"- Tennison, we've got this."
No.
Go on.
"If you want to help David, you need to tell us where he is."
Did David tell you about Julie-Ann?
She was 17.
"Someone strangled her and dumped her with the rubbish, like she didn't matter."
Where was he on the evening of Sunday 13th May?
- I don't know.
- It was raining that night.
"Did he come home, soaked to the skin?"
He was home!
How's he been acting since?
You're his mum.
Mums always know when something's not right.
I found... a photo of them both.
Him and Julie-Ann.
"She mattered to David, didn't she?"
Did he tell you about her?
Did you know she was pregnant?
- Was the child David's?
- God...
God.
Where can we find him?
"But we can deal with you, can't we?"
Idiots!
Bring me the wine!
Bring the wine!
Drink!
Look!

Last night...
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided... to announce his name in public
"Well, call me Sister and I'll return it to you."
Yes or no?
- Give it to me!
- Call me Sister!
How can you bite me!
Let go!
"Xiamu,"
I have a question for you.
"You still remember, don't you?"
The last time you saw your mother face?
Good!
"You may cry, scream and hit me!"
You're not a dummy anymore!
I knew you are scared.
"Every night you scared, aren't you?"
But have you even thought about... if the way you are now is what people want to see?
"As of today,"
Sister will accompany you.
You cannot just stay in this house.
You have to try going out.
"To learn about this world again, to feel the sunshine, to feel the wind."
"To feel the crowd,"
to feel how people care about you!
When did you come?
You want to play?
Yes.
- Who is this kid?
- He is my private tutor student.
Superb!
Right?
Sort of.
He is quite good.
I want Danny to spend more time with my son.
He made plans with him and now he's trying to pull out.
"And guys ""pulling out"" is why I have a kid in my first place."
"Okay, fine, I'll do it."
But it's not fair.
You asked me right in the middle of sex.
"I was like... ""Ah, ah, ah... oh, okay, I'll take your son to Dave  Busters."
"Okay, quick announcement."
It's a new year and I wanted to shake things up a little bit.
So I decided to dye my hair red
- But then I chickened out.
"- Thank God, because red hair is the worst."
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
Ta-da!
You like it?
I love it.
I love it.
It is beautiful.
It is great.
Like a bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
It's like your whole head's on fire!
"Love you, fire head!"
Now all we have to do is fill in the gaps.
I'm buying it.
Down payment.
"Call it rent, call it what you like, but I am not leaving London."
- Hmm!
- Sorry.
Bad night.
"Buckley, Parfitt, meeting now."
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"We don't even have to look either, because we're never gonna miss it that distance."
"It's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
- You think so?
- Totally.
Cool.
- Don't aim too high.
- Why not?
We don't want to that little bird.
"Oh, yea... good thinkin'."
Are you ready?
- Ready.
- Let's do it.
Who wants a snack?
Be careful they're hot.
Uhm... no thank you.
- Don't you like cookies?
"- Yeah, but..."
I feel kind of bad now.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are those oatmeal?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in this?"
Why are you looking at us funny?
"No, no, no..."
It just that you girls aren't what I expect it.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you have any milk?
"I hate to interrupt or anything, but... don't you think you girls are better be load?"
Don't overstep.
"Rebecca,there he is."
Walk me to him.
"- Doc,stay here.Call Tanner."
- You got it.
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser,just hang on.We're gonna get you off that thing."
"No,you're not."
Let me help you.You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh,I know.Just can't see from up there."
"So what I told you on the phone,that help you catch him?"
Windward elementary.
- So I was right.
- Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb,""Twin Tree"" clue,you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'Il be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news,just give it to me straight."
He modified it.I'm gonna have to improvise.
Alright.
What do you got to drink around here?
You don't have much time.
Soon they will come to harm you.
And I will not be able to stop them.
Unless you are able to give me something to placate them.
Some... piece of information...
Which I can use to protect you from them.
I already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperon.
"Steadily, steadily."
"Down, down, carefully..."
You're all right Indy?
"Gently boys, gently, gently!"
I told you it would be all right!
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
Oups!
What is this stuff René?
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
"Well, I have to be going now René."
I like you René.
Very much.
Perhaps we meet someday under better circumstances.
We meet again freulin.
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now...
You must be very happy.
Instead...
Why are you upset like this about this random girl?
"I know, my fault."
Sorry.
"Now, please smile for me."
I'm telling you again...
Sadhana is deeply in love with you.
When you were hospitalised...
I know.
I will talk to her.
What I meant is...
More than the one we love...
The one whom we love...
The one who loves us...
"No, no..."
It's okay.
"Leave it, mom."
I get the point.
"Have a seat, Sadhana."
Will you like to have anything?
Don't suddenly flip into a totally different person.
Be normal.
Only that suits you.
Okay.
I have to tell you the truth.
"Since you were coming, I didn't even use room freshener."
Okay.
Let me get to the point.
"If you still love her, I totally understand."
Don't take any decision just because your parents are forcing you.
You don't have to tell me 'you like me' just because someone is asking you to.
"But I'm not referring to you, Moonsook."
You're different from your films.
"Sorry, but you're actually just another Korean man."
What are you sorry about?
"No, I take that back."
My point is you are a Korean man.
"Hey, I'm going back to our room."
I'll be back shortly.
Not coming with me?
That was a hit-by-pitched ball.
Stricter rules will apply to this.
"If you let the ball hit you when you could've dodged it, it's either a ball or a strike."
Like a regular strike or ball.
"Even if you get hit, it may not be a hit-by-pitched ball."
- Doesn't apply to intentional hits.
"- Yes, that's right."
He's in the bathroom.
Want to get some fresh air?
"Yeah, sure."
Wait.
This way.
I don't think we can go any farther.
Shoes are all wet.
- You know what?
- Yes?
"As I get older, I like the west coast."
It's where the sun sets.
And also where the stars rise.
That's right.
Why are you laughing?
Come on.
"Ah, I got a question."
"Geez, man'"
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
"She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta k--"
- He's gotta kiss her.
- And she's only got three days'
Just look at her'

My nerves are shot' This is a catastrophe'

I'm gonna march meself straight home right now... and tell him just like I should have done the minute--
"And don't you shake your head at me, young lady."
Maybe there's still time.
Ifwe could get that witch... to give you backyour voice... you could go home with all the normal fish and just be--
Just be--
Just be miserable for the rest ofyour life.
"All right, all right."
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
"Boy, what a soft shell I'm turning out to be."
"Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya."
Ifyou wanna be a human... the first thing ya gotta do is dress like one.
"Now, let me see."

No more dithering.

'Cause that's what you're doing.

Why would you bring a dinosaur back to life?
- What's the movie?
- You know what's gonna happen.
"Electricity's gonna go out, and then all hell's"
- gonna break loose.
"- Yeah, that's exactly what"
"- happens, but say the movie."
"- Some of those dinosaurs are really smart, like, I believe a raptor could"
- use its claws to open a door.
Really likes improv.
- Anyway.
- One summer mommy had to work for ones.
OK.
"Well, look, I basically, since I got Trent back to"
"Tampa, he agreed to give me this."
Oh.
"Hey, what's that junky old piece of crap?"
- My grandma's wedding ring.
- It's so pretty!
- Thank you so much for doing that for me.
- I didn't just do it for you.
I did it for my best friend.
Did you just call me your best friend?
"- Yes, I did."
- I don't think I want that anymore.
You need to try that.
"Look, I already know you're my best friend even though that pissed me off quite a bit."
But I need to know if you'd be willing to be my best man.
Hey.
Of course.
Baby bird.
"Let's get married, huh?"
"Well, summer, fall but definitely not this season."
"Hey, buddy."
***
"Oh my god, you're so annoying!"
"OK, Shelly, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to my face right after?"
"Oh, no, sweetie..."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
There's still some ladies in Detroit who think they slept with a chunky-eyed Isaiah Thomas.
Me too.
If you can go slightly backward shake it to pass.
"That I can not befriend, retreat."
Running the beach not up to anyone.
Maybe move to the other side.
Do not have this side.
-And what have we got here.
Then they will have to return everything.
I am with children it's kind of dangerous.
I know.
-And we need to get home.
"I understand, very fair."
"But understand my side, champion."
One day I will have to protect my thing.
Because someone will want to take it from me.
"When I see, the whole world will see."
And in the background of consciousness I have a cruel reminder.
Once I stepped for a penguin.
"He looked at me, is gone."
"Goodbye, girls, hello empty beach."
-Got it.
"Yes, more ..."
So get out my face!
My mother says that every obstacle is an opportunity.
What?
"Dude, can apologize, or I'll break your nose!"
-He did not want to do this.
-All right.
And I still know.
"- ""SvenPense."""
"-Erik, no."
"His chubby flabby, out of my way."
Guys!
"We found the perfect spot for the mosque, but it's going to get torn down."
"Ann, you have to stop it!"
"I don't know, Amaar!"
It seems like an awful lot of work.
It's the old schoolhouse at the edge of town.
"Yeah, it's probably rubble by now."
"No, Rayyan's keeping it safe for now, but you have to save it."
Amaar!
"We are in big trouble, which actually proves my point, but that's not the issue right now."
- What are you talking about?
- Mayor.
"Baber, Amaar, you two responsible for that van outside, right?"
"Huh, yeah, I guess so."
Why?
Oh!
"Cuff me, I won't resist."
"Just don't tase me, bro!"
Why would I cuff you for parking in a handicap spot?
Illegal parking?
"Oh, good!"
Because I thought
You were here because of the bomb in the back of the van.
- Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
- Wha..
"- Well, now you're under arrest."
- You can't arrest him!
-
- I'm afraid the law says otherwise.
"- Oh, come on, Paul!"
What?
"Dreaming about him like that,"
It's got to mean something.
What are you talking about?
"(karen:)come on, two nights in a row?"
Dreams are our subconscious working out
"What we can't, or won't, awake."
So mom used to tell me.
The last time we saw da veiga
He was chasing us through the jungle with a pistol.
What's to work out?
"(karen:)you're not sure he survived,"
Are you?
"(syd:)nigel, run!"
[struggling]
[explosion]
"(nigel:)syd, syd."
(karen:)are you okay?
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Um...
Did you set up our first meeting?
"Yeah, gareth watson,"
The druid expert
At bristol polytechnic.
He sent this fax confirming.
Meet him in his office.
[âª]
You're not really taking any of her
"Pop psychology mumbo jumbo to heart, are you?"
"Keep the change, thanks."
"I must admit,"
We're still a little unclear
-I'm miserable.
I'm so hungry the only thing that got me through the last 20 miles.
Was thinking about shoveling in.
That big old bowl of mac and cheese and bacon.
She normally doesn't eat it.
You ate it all?
"Yes, but he dropped some on the floor and I threw it in the trash."
-But it's right on top so...
-Uh...
I ate that too.
This is the worst day ever.
I lost my Jesse and now I'm gonna be stuck.
At Malibu Community College without you.
And the only reason I'm going to get any mac and cheese and bacon.
Is if dad regurgitates it like a mama robin.
Hey darling don't worry.
I'm gonna fix this.
How about I make you a nice omelet?
What would you like in it?
My Jesse and an acceptance letter to Stanford.
And maybe some chives and salted mushrooms.
Coming right up.
-Miley?
-What?
Look you're not gonna go to Malibu Community College alone.
[Sobbing] You're right.
I'll be with Jackson!
"No, no."
You're not gonna be with Jackson.
You're gonna be with me.
What?
"Yeah, I mean, if you can't go to Stanford until next year."
Not quite sure I get your meaning.
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.
"- It's killing me, literally."
I'm dying.
"- Here, have a cookie."
"No, I'm cool."
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.
We used to sleep together all the time.
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.
"It wasn't all the time, but it happened."
I know I'm not just making this up.
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?
"Honestly, we may not have the best insight."
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
He's right.
The signals are totally different.
"Like, here."
"Here's ""I wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two, three."
"That's it, three seconds or more, it's on."
"And here's ""I don't wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two..."
"- Nope, thanks for playing, move along."
- It's that simple.
-Look at the neutral strip in this direction.
-Why isn't he making any shots?
- He does not shoot because he is an ace.
"- OK, he will not hide from us."
We'll get him afterthe sun moves to the right position.
-There are about 20 minutes left.
-And what?
-The sun will get a little bit lower.
-And what?
-Have patience and you'll see.
"- Listen, let me get out with the cap on."
Wearing this cap?
Stay quiet.
He will not hit me.
"And if he makes a shot, you'll fire."
Remain seated.
He knows your cap.
-Why am I sweating in it?
- l dunno.
What are you doing?
Were you fond of playing with sun reflections in your childhood?
Surely.
So I recall my childhood.
At about one the reflection will get directly into his eyes.
And we'll see what he does.
"If he shoots,"
He'll think I'm dead.
Why did you become so silent?
Hey!
Go on talking.
I feel merrierthat way.
It is this buffoon again!
333...
A number that ends with 333.
Details of this number?
You said the the victim of the accident got calls from a number?
Is it the same number?
Let me check.
Yes.
It's the same number.
"The number we got from the lodge, Manoj's number, and this number."
There's some connection definitely.
Sir.
"Moorthy, how are you?"
- I'm fine.
Did our car met with an accident?
Why do you ask?
"The cops are torturing me, Sir."
"They are accusing me of that accident, that I drove the car."
What did you say?
That I am no longer working for you.
I told them that the lady with you drives your car.
How did you...
Why did you blabber all that?
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir!
Fool!
"Manoj, tell us the truth at least now."
Who was with you?
What actually happened?
Who is it?
The same cops who came yesterday.
Tell me what happened.
I did tell you that nothing happened.
- Yes.
Have you got something to tell me?
"Yes, I would advise you to get out of here."
- How many of them were there?
- Eight.
- Too bad that Carrasco wasn't there.
- That girl out there is also one of them.
"- Coronel, I'm in the militia."
- Calm down.
You mustn't get excited.
I know him.
It's true.
He was here before the guerrilleros occupied the hospital.
His name is Gutiérrez.
"- You were lucky, my friend."
"- Yes, but if you hadn't come..."
You're not supposed to talk so much.
Be quiet.
This is José Grenada.
He worked on the dam.
They seem to treat their prisoners quite well.
Did you hear them talk about their leader Carrasco on your way here?
Think carefully.
You must have heard something.
Very well.
I will never tell a bastard like you anything.
Never!
What are you waiting for?
Keep calm.
Don't panic.
Nothing's happened.
What have you done?
- That was a cheap shot.
- What are you...
"You know, excuses are like assholes."
"Everybody's got one, and they all stink."
"- Oh, yeah?"
You wanna go at it right now?
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
You wanna settle this now?
Let's do it right here.
Let's settle this son of a bitch right here.
"Hey, hey."
Take it easy here.
Jesus.
"Show a little class, will ya?"
Geez.
"Look, I'm an old man."
I don't fight no more.
I let my daughter do my fighting for me.
"And maybe in a couple years, when this little graham cracker... might have the stuff to compete, maybe we'll see."
Wait.
"You know what, asshole?"
Why don't you go to hell?
"- Dee, stay out of this."
- No.
This guy has been all over us since we walked in.
"I tell you what, jerk."
Why don't you take you big mouth... and go someplace else with it?
"Listen, little buttercup, I'm just bustin' your old man's balls."
- You don't have to get your panties in an uproar.
"- Oh, my God."
Are you standing there?
"Come on, move."
You can't possibly be.
Yes.
The new owner of the Standish Tavern.
Banks are delighted to sell paper on imminent foreclosures.
Foreclosure?
You don't have to thank me.
I knew that you'd just about die with embarrassment.
I just dropped by to make final arrangements.
I can't leave without ensuring that my interests...
... arelookedafter by someone I can trust.
"Oh, no."
Never.
I will never work for you.
"Fine, if that's your attitude."
I'll find another bartender.
Bartender?
Then who's the manager?
I came. I saw. I conquered.
Wait.
Just tell me one thing.
Why?
Why here?
Why me?
"Somebody's got to keep you sharp, son."
We're business people.
And we're the best at what we do.
Don't ever forget that.
"Yes, indeed."
Previously on Vanished...
Jeffrey's home.
Please never call here again.
- Where may I find him?
I heard there was a pipe burst in the new underground parking garage.
The one they're building for the docs?
I heard the place is filling up with water.
"It'll set construction back six weeks, probably more, with winter coming on."
"Doc, I hope you've got yourself a really big ice scraper... 'cause winter could start any time now, and up here, the winters are long."
- It's not like Boston.
"- Up here, very little is like Boston, I find."
That's the way we like it.
There's a crack in the parking lot.
You know what?
"I got one of those, too."
In the back of my pants.
"Hold on, Doc."
"You got to fill out a maintenance form, 44-B."
"Johnny should have one here somewhere, but..."
You know what?
You better take a seat.
This will just take a minute.
My name is Stegman.
"Dr. Stegman, Chief of Neurosciences."
"Pleased to meet you, Doc."
Earl Swinton.
I don't know where he keeps these things.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Hell.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
Is somebody there?
Who are you?
What are you?
Who's there?
Adam!
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I was trying to save the Bank.
I was trying to fix it but Dad made so much mess.
I fucking hated him.
That's why I hated you.
"Ok, gents, let's go."
You coming?
Of course I'm coming.
Police!
Good evening!
We are the police.
Please stay calm and remain where you are.
Move away from the art
Where is the lady of the house?
"Stand aside, police!"
We have a warrant for the art.
"We are the police, stay where you are."
Thank you for your cooperation.
What's going on?
"Madame Clios... by order of Interpol, all the art is seized and you are to stay exactly where you are."
Fucking awful night.
"What doesn't kill you, et cetera..."
Monsieur!
What now?
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees

"You know, check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something."
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
Guess which ones.
No.
"So, there was only one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
I knew him.
How did he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
That's where...
Right where the chick got swirleyed to death.
Exactly.
"So, what?"
This ghost is possessing nerds?
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.
"- Thanks, Sam."
- Great school.
I don't care.
"Three years, and I'm out of here."
I'm going to Michigan State.
They got the best vet program in the country.
You like animals?
They're a lot nicer than people.

One of our viewers has sent us this picture... through MMS.
Look at the ugly facet of the police...
Mr. Pradhan.
You here?
Are you here with the token?
Token?
I'm here to show you your qualities.
Take look.
Take look how ACP Ayushman Thakur... is openly assaulting an injured man... in a quiet housing-society.
The people demand an answer from the police.
Because if the protector turns cruel... then whom will the people go to?
The police are often accused...
Mr. Pradhan those with name...
"She did excellent in school, the Sisters said."
"Got good grades, was in every club."
"She was quitting drugs, you know."
She promised our priest.
What else you got there?
is that a diary?
Do either of you have children?
"Yeah, I got a boy."
"Are you close to him, detective?"
-Not at present.
-Something happens that's not right...
... youknow.
You know about your kids.
"-Yeah, I guess you do."
-l knew.
Even before I read this...
"... Iknewshewas involvedwith someone who hurt her, some married bastard."
"She tried 20 times to split up with him, but..."
... shewasweakbecauseofthedrugs.
"This time, she promised Father Kelleher."
"She was ready this time, and this bastard took her chance away."
Can we see this?
MCBRlDE:
"Here, read this."
It says it right here.
"""Mike says if I leave him, he'll kill me."
"He says if I'm going to call his wife again, he's going to kill me. """
She read to me from this.
She gave this to me.
"Look, listen."
"""l am definitely going to quit drugs."
"I am definitely going to change my life with Father Kelleher's help. """
"Oh, man."
"I freaked out and thought I was gonna have to get my tendon resoldered, but it didn't happen."
- You can't fool around with that stuff.
- No.
Didn't mean to.
- I think this was a reshoot day.
- No.
Didn't we...?
Didn't we reshoot the...?
"Oh, it's a different moment in the van."
It's when I'm looking out the window at Tris on the car.
"- Yeah, that was a reshoot."
- That was a reshoot.
Because I remember...
Remember Raf and I were giving each other a hard time this day.
Do you remember?
It was the reshoots and I was a little scared.
"I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."
"He's really getting angry."" I think I was making fun of his accent."
That's the way to get him mad.
Michael would make fun of Raf.
He'd be like:
"""Oh, later on, Rafi Gavron."""
Rafi's from London.
"You can't tell by the movie, but he's English."
"Oh, and Ari this is the best deli."
Remember?
- I wasn't in this scene.
I came to visit.
"- Yeah, but you came to visit us."
"We got Tony, our script supervisor, a cake because it was his birthday."
Of course.
All outbound buses were told to stand down.
And you don't know when we're gonna be allowed to stand up again?
"Soon, I hope."
I hate missing dinner.
Yeah.
"Me, too."
There's our little graduate.
"My God, look at that gown."
You look just like the Statue of Liberty.
- All big and stony?
- No.
You look amazing.
You look very GQ.
Thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna.
Don't you love how he can pronounce it now?
Very cosmopolitan.
He got it for the rehearsal dinner.
It's his first real suit.
And not my last.
I look hot.
"You know that Emily's out there, right?"
Why?
- It's a long story.
Just do me a favor.
- Sure.
Keep an eye on my parents.
Make sure they don't disrupt anything.
My mother doesn't behead anyone.
My father doesn't snore too loudly.
- They won't do anything like that.
- Haven't you met them?
- Why would they do that?

He gave Hannah a kiss.

Did you hear about this?
When asked why she got both chocolate and vanilla.
She said she wanted the best of both swirls.
Did you hear about this?

Is that a problem?
Just wait.

Lunch.
"- So what do you got today, Mel?"
"Liverwurst and Swiss, I think."
"Oh, yeah."
There's liverwurst and Swiss.
Yeah.
"All three of 'em, liverwurst and Swiss."
You wanna swap?
I got a bacon and avocado... and a tuna fish and tomato on a kaiser roll
I'll give you the liverwurst and Swiss for the tuna fish and tomato... and I'll throw in a piece of chocolate cake.
"No, you keep the chocolate cake."
"Besides, I got a piece of, lemon meringue pie anyway."
"Well, I gotta get rid of one of these sandwiches."
Toss it down the shaft.
"Oh, we have a... wastepaper basket here."
I'll throw it out.
Ah.
"Thanks a lot, fella."
That's nice of you.
Thank you.
"- Hi, honey."
"- Hi, sweetheart."
Happy birthday.
"Well, how was your day?"
"Fine, fine."
No... surprises.
I just hope it stays that way.
"Well, honey, you're really gonna be surprised, because there's no surprise party."
"- Just five friends and a nice, quiet dinner."
- Good.
Come on.
Take off your coat.
My name's Danny Ferman.
I'm one of the attorneys representing Malcolm Miller.
"Look, if this is about that juror, the cops already turned this place inside out."
"Okay, so I assume they checked the camera footage already."
Fakes.
Just there to scare anyone looking to cause trouble.
Like you.
Were you working the night of the assault?
You were here?
Yes.
And I've already been interviewed.
"Okay, what did you tell the cops?"
- That I don't remember seeing him.
"Bar was a little crazier than usual, but..."
My girlfriend was having a little birthday thing.
Girlfriend?
So you're...
Gay guys are the best tippers.
"Yeah, I mean, not that..."
"You know, it doesn't matter."
Anyway.
Anyway.
"Birthday, okay."
"Cake, presents, the whole thing?"
Yeah.
She needs a lot of attention.
"Did you happen to take any photo, videos or..."
Look at this.
Okay.
Recognize him?
No.
Could you send me this file?
She'd drink her children's blood from her lover's skull and not feel a stomachache.
"alfred, go home."
"Put it into verse, I'II publish it."
Then you'II get paid.
Thanks to you I can't go to the baroness's party.
"- In fact, I'II have to leave Paris."
- No more advances.
"I don't need your money, old sow."
I've had an invitation to the country.
"From a duchess, no less."
Good day.
(strains of piano music)
(coughs)
This summer dust is ruinous to my lungs.
I hope the air will be better in Angers.
The Duchess d'Antan has invited you too?
"- well, yes."
- How delightful.
"please continue, dear fellow."
"- Good day, Countess."
- (gasps) George!
- I'm sorry I frightened you.
- (baby cries)
I had the most fearful dream.
BIandine was a terrible creature with fly's wings that was draining my Iife from me.
They are deadly little charmers.
Chromatic gIissando.
The wings of a butterfly.
Or the wrath of God.
(baby cries)
"He wakes the baby, then complains about the crying."
- How is Franz?
You know that.
I won't get a fair trial.
I'm not going to no prison.
"Lila, Chief Dixon said the cops that are after you..."
Dale Dixon?
Yeah.
He was the one that was by the house.
"You used to know him, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I used to know him."
"Ronnie, I didn't come all this way not to see my baby."
"Now, they'll be watching our house."
So you got to take me someplace outside of town.
"Oh, Lila."
And then tonight you're gonna have to bring my baby out to see me.
And then tomorrow I'll be gone.
"Ronnie, please."
I'm your sister.
I need your help.
"Okay, Lila."
Okay.
RONNIE:
A friend of mine's grand-mamma died a couple of months ago.
She had a house off the highway past the bait shop.
There's no one living there now.
"I'm going to be out there all night, honey, so don't wait up for me."
Are Dud and John going to be with you?
"No, they're not gonna be with me."
We don't need 19 goddamn people in a car to watch a house.
I don't mean you're incapable of watching the house.
"Hey, just 'cause I'm not from L.A."
don't mean I can't watch a goddamn house.
Okay?
The internal bleeding dance!
- I could sure use some help too.
"- You got it, partner!"
- Move!
I want the fat one!
"- They're all fat, Biatch!"
"Say mister, you got any other leads on where I can get some more bullets?"
"The other place got into a crime scene, long story."
"Just do some thinkin' on it, okay?"
Are you expectin' anybody else?
Are you sure?
It might be back up for Donnie's crew.
"Maybe they're supposed to call in, you know, like we do."
Why didn't they just come right in like everybody else has?
"I don't know, who the hell he is, I'm out of bullets again."
I'll get it.
What?
Wait but...
what if Donnie's other guys?
- I know what they'll do.
- I thought you wanted us to kill you.
You jealous?
- Kinda.
- Now take the fire escape.
I'll stall.
Otherwise they're gonna kill us all today after see what happened in here.
Go!
- You should come too!
"- No, no, I shouldn't."
This way I buy you some time.
Go!
Please.
Poor guy.
Anybody told Meuller?
No.
None of the guys wanted to break it to him.
Wait till he hears it.
"Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be Pete."
"For the last time, are you coming in with us or not?"
"I told ya no, and I mean no."
"Oh, you're stir-nuts."
He don't know what he's saying.
"Aw, come on, Frank, get wise to yourself."
"Lay off, Red."
Will you lay off?
Stacey's on the outside.
I'm sure he's working for me.
I'll take my chance that way.
"Tough luck, kid."
[MACHINERY RATTLING]
Jiggers.
"Meuller, you can't beat this joint!"
You have no chance!
Let me go!
"Meuller, why ain't you at work?"
Get back to your machine.
[SPITS]
Get over agin that wall.
I'm gonna bury you in the Hole.
You hear what I told ya?
Get over agin that wall.
So you're the guy that wouldn't let Lassiter go to the hospital?
"I'll put you where he is, if you don't keep away from me."
And you're the guy that made him fall and busted his back!
You're not wearing them?
"Difficult, considering... was it you?"
Earrings?
Tip of the iceberg...
Why tonight?
"Because, to have a fiancé who is 50% shit is too much."
Why me?
Because tonight...
I'm loaded!
"And you, do you know how to weigh or measure love?"
What are you staring at?
Your buttons.
They're all... wrong.
"I mean, you're beautiful."
Takes a lot of work.
"Courtesans yes, maids no!"
- Got a taste for it?
- Haven't we eaten?
- Was it you?
"- No, it's me."
Then strip.
"So, are you disturbing the peace?"
It's only André.
on the table!
"Time's up, oldtimer!"
You'll never make another omlet from bad eggs then snitch like you did to my father!
"These empire chairs, bit shoddy aren't they?"
Just like all empires!
Anybody moves and he gets it deeper.
You little punk!
I'll crush you as I...
"You started living the high life too soon, Joseph Venom."
"Mr. Thomason, you're under arrest."
Please stand up.
"Couldn't leave it alone, could you, Caine ?"
"Hang on a second, gentlemen."
Now I am conducting an investigation in this room.
Say good-bye to Mr. Thomason.
He's our suspect now.
Fed trumps county.
Get him out of here.
Thomason was leading us to his contacts.
- We were closing in.
- Closing in on what ?
I can't discuss it.
This would be a good time for you to start.
This isn't just smoke and mirrors.
"There are people in our country, this very state in fact, who want to do us harm."
Answer my question.
Haven't you heard of the greater good ?
Was my brother Raymond involved in this ?
And I want the truth.
Raymond's dead.
Now we both know that's not true.
You keep digging... and it will be.
I did some checking of my own.
Bob Keaton's release was approved by federal authorities.
"He was a Fed, wasn't he ?"
"Yelina, Bob Keaton was a DEA agent."
And Raymond ?
I need to know.
I have the right to know.
"Horatio, is he still... is he still alive ?"
It's possible.
- What's your problem?
- You think I have lost it?
Think about it.
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?
I mean why is Zak coming after a boring banker?
Hold on a second!
Who's boring?
"I'm a crowd puller, okay?"
- Everybody knows that.
It's nothing new.
"- Shiv, this is not funny!"
What is not funny?
I'm not being funny!
What are you saying?
All of this is connected.
Okay?
"In fact, even the comet..."
"All of this has happened before, Shiv."
You have to believe this.
I have to believe this!
"What...what...what are you saying, baby?"
"You are an educated, English speaking, modern girl who lives in Europe."
You make chocolates!
Why are you saying such strange things?
"What do I do, I don't have any proof."
"- Hey baby, what are you doing?"
- Just a second!
"Baby, you cannot use sex to make me believe."
I'm reminding you of your birthmark.
"Just think, why do you have it?"
This is where Zak had attacked you.
Is he telling the truth?
Is Tucker not my son?
"You gotta believe me, I never meant to hurt you."
What is that supposed to mean?
Why did you lie to me?
(struggling)
I'm so sorry.
Melody!
"Look, put him in interrogation until NOPD comes."
Let him go.
Do what?
"Look, I said just let him go, damn it."
I probably would have done the same thing if I were him.
Lasalle...
"Look, just do it!"
Stay the hell away from my kid.
Get out of here before I change my mind.
PRIDE:
You believe him?
I don't know what to believe.
"Melody did seem pretty clear about it, though."
"I mean, she kept saying she was sorry."
"I mean, how could she do it, King?"
Bring a little boy into my life and tell me I'm his father...
when I'm not?
"I don't know, Chris."
Something you gotta ask her.
"Well, it won't change anything, so what's the point?"
"The point is, you deserve to know."
"It doesn't matter, all right, it is what it is."
Christopher.
It's not something you can pretend didn't happen.
And I'm proud of you.
All right.
And that's that.
Court dismissed.
"Well, I told you."
Keep your mouth shut or you'll be sorry.
"Jim, come here."
"Come here and let a guy talk to you, will you?"
What brought you back?
What's the difference?
"We're back, ain't we?"
"Charlie, I think you'd better go up and get fixed up."
"Go ahead, kid."
"Sit down, Jim."
Sit down.
I'm not going to ask you why you beat it.
I can guess that easy.
"Well, we'll let that go."
"I wanna ask, I want you to tell me the truth."
What's the matter?
Don't you like the way we treat you?
Don't you like us?
What is it?
Let's have it.
Give us a break.
There must be something you like to do.
Patsy wants to help you do it.
You're the mayor of this place.
You don't act like it.
"Well, I didn't ask for the job."
"Listen, kid."
I'm gonna tell you something and it's just between us.
"He suffers a little from being too arrogant, both in his writing and as a person."
Oh.
Match made in heaven.
I don't know if I can continue to accommodate you here.
Why is that?
Because you're a pain in the ass.
I have to go to the city today.
What for?
See my agent.
- Henry?
- Henry?
No.
Henry's not been with me for 10 years.
Why not?
Because he's a cocksucker and a little piece of shit.
"Oh, fuck!"
"Jesus, God Almighty."
Fucking thing.
Look at this.
Is this a meeting about something new?
Hmm?
"Well, potentially."
It's complicated.
We're hoping for some money from a sale of movie rights.
Is that woman still your editor?
No.
She's an asshole with no loyalty as well.
- What about...
- Are you here only to put me on the spot?
None of this is worth revisiting to me.
I've been betrayed by a lot of small-minded and worthless people.
Do I need them to accomplish anything?
"She is an attorney S. Mazerat, Sophie and she slept with him."
Counterterrorism has his record?
To call them?
-Absolutely not!
Not a word.
Tomorrow we will try and arrest Shack know that it is connected with Riffautom.
"Not a word, especially not Hervilleu."
Thomas Riffaut is ours.
Laura!
That fucking asshole Sophie Mazerat!
See you tomorrow!
-Until tomorrow!
Do you have any plans?
Are you for dinner?
"Gilo, hold me!"
Drop me to Vincent!
"Let go, you do not create problems."
"Just want to hurt you, huh?"
You're in bed?
-I waited.
"I wanted to call you, but I eventually escorted Gilo."
"I go into the shower, I corpse."
Subtitles by Deptford
Previously on Teen Wolf
Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
"Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash."
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"
"Andjunk, dope!"
And they leave the gambling to last.
I want to run my family without you on my back.
I want those Rosatos dead!
-No.
-Morte.
I have business that's important with Hyman Roth.
I don't want it disturbed.
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew before your own blood.
You know my father did business with Hyman Roth.
He respected him.
"Your father did business with Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth, but he never trusted Hyman Roth or his Sicilian messenger boy, Johnny Ola."
You'll have to excuse me.
"I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk!"
"I want everybody here to know, there's not going to be no trouble from me!"
Don Corleone.
"Cicci, the door..."
You want him to leave now?
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.
The old man had too much wine.
It's late.
How's the baby?
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?
"Yes, it does, Michael."
Kay?
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.
"It couldn't be helped, though."
It made me think of what you once told me.
""" In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. """
Don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute.
Let's see that.
- What do you think of that?
"- You know, you're in a hurry and..."
"Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone."
Just a minute.
I'll answer it for you.
It will only take about five minutes.
Let us have your pants.
- Hello.
"- Hello, John."
Will you hurry?
Tell him the minister is here.
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.
"All right, I'll tell him."
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.
- Good.
"- You see, there's plenty of material."
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
"- No, you don't."
"Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes."
- You want two cuffs on them?
"- Yeah, one on each leg."
And hurry up.
Tell him I got to have them back right away.
"While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport."
Good.
- Sit up for me.
Tonight you will face your final test.
- Mr. Porter.
- Mr. Avery.
- I took a look at it.
- And?
- It's chockfull of laudanum and what I think is Indian root.
And it appears to have trace amounts... of aconite.
- Aconite?
- Monkshood.
Wolf's bane.
"A poison, Mr. Porter."
"Not enough to kill you, but certainly enough to have rather unpleasant effects... on your mind."
- Congratulations.
You found us.
One final test... for your commitment.
Who do you see?
- Margaret.
- And why do you think she's here?
"- She whispered lies into my mind, sowed doubts within me."
She tried to turn me against you.
"- No, Isabel."
- She must be punished.
- Please.
- You will be my star.
Cleanse her with the lash.
Her screams will be her sacrament of reconciliation.
"- Isabel, please!"
Please!
Help me!
Please help!
I want you to take the gown out of your bag and put it on.
-This isn't appropriate for public.
-You don't understand naked.
Naked is inner.
I am here with you.
There is no shame.
There is no separation.
And I'm not ill.
"Yes, you are ill, Gloria."
And I have no need for a green synthetic nightie used to conceal the essence of my supple skin and my aching soul in the barren desert that is this land.
I'm moving in with my son in Costa Mesa.
He thinks I'm lonely.
"Truth is, he's lonely."
Sweet kid.
Just can't seem to connect.
Me and my wife lived here 40 years.
"It's lovely, really."
It's really lovely.
You seem like a very nice person.
I hope you take the place.
-Come on.
-Come on!
You're nothing!
Come on!
Pussy!
Fucking pussy!
I don't know about trust.
Maybe she just needed a nap or something.
Believe me.
She's been belligerent with everybody else.
I dealt with her last year.
"I just listened to her, really."
"God bless einstein,"
But i had to boost his theory just a little.
Case in point.
"Well, look like i won't be using that tesseracter."
This is confusing for me.
"So much about me was lost,"
So much forgotten.
"Well, then, why don't you tell me"
What you do remember?
"I remember it made me happy to be here,"
"On this ship,"
With you.
"On the other hand,"
"Andromeda, rommie, doyle... i don't even know what to call myself."
I'll tell you what.
Why don't i just call you... friend.
[Footsteps]
Shall we paddle?
I'd rather not.
I'm going to.
Oh!
[Laughs]
Is it cold?
"Hey, Ursula, stop it!"
Oh!
[Laughs]
"No, please, I beg you, don't."
[Man on radio]:
"White, Dover, Thames, Humber, Heligoland."
"South-to-southwest gales spreading from the west, with rain and moderate or poor visibility."
Storms are imminent.
Talking menschkeit.
Stuff between men.
"The """"there"""" that's there."
The thousand telephone calls.
The bouquets and the brickbats.
The space between a handshake.
You know.
Stuff that goes with you to your grave.
There's space between a handshake for right and wrong?
Why are you pressing me?
I'm looking for an answer.
You want an answer?
"Okay, Pappy."
Think of it as colors.
There's black and there's white.
And in between is mostly gray.
That's us.
Gray's tough because it's not as simple as black and white.
"And for the media, certainly not as interesting."
But it's who we are.
What are you gonna do now?
"You mean """"we. """""
We'll fight the sons of bitches.
We're gonna come out swinging.
"We're gonna tell them, """"Hey!"
We're only human.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Frank Anselmo is dead.
He was a friend...
"... butthelast of the clubhouse bosses is gone. """""
We're gonna clean up the Augean stables.
We'll go to Miami...
"""Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Belfast, Liverpool, Slough."""
Operator.
That wasn't the right code.
What?
What I just called in.
It wasn't the right code.
Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.
What?
Fuck!
They got to the emergency phones.
Just let me think.
"No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?"
"No, they don't."
"-There has to be a safety measure, right?"
-No.
-Something or someone?
-There's nothing.
Someone who cancels the broadcast when something like this happens.
There's no one.
"There has to be some kind of back-up, like an emergency back-up..."
Something like this doesn't happen.
"Seventy years, the code's never been breached."
Somebody has to be out there who can...
"Katherine, there's nothing but the goddamn numbers!"
(PHONE ringing)
"If we do ourjob, we get out of here alive."
I promise.
-OPERATOR:
"You kill her for me, I let you live."
-(sighs)
No.
We've gone to a lot of trouble here with these broadcasts.
I volunteered you guys.
–You can't be serious.
–Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
–What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
Great.
I've got your assignments.
"Briefing room, five minutes."
Is everything okay with Kayla?
When was the last time you saw your roommate?
–Last night around 6:00.
–She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
–Vic.
I got great news.
–What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
On the contrary.
Come with me.
We will take the air in the garden.
I'm taking care of her.
We woke up painful memories to you.
You are very alone in this house.
Don't you have relatives?
No.
Friends?
"I'm here, now."
I am very careful.
Attentive to your eyes.
My eyes?
"Yes, they are so young, so clear."
"And yet, I guess all they have seen recently that they should not have seen."
Smile at me.
I am convinced you will soon find your brother.
Believe me.
"What can I say, Sir?"
Your words are helping me in an unexpected way.
Probably you already suffered greatly in your own flesh.
The suffering of others can not but interest a man like me.
Your dedication affects me greatly.
"It is limitless, know it."
"Nanteuil, we will take our leave."
"Don't bother to lead us out, Miss."
We'll let you know soon.
"Goodbye, sir."
Goodbye.
Count on me.
And good luck.
He is ...well...
They were tight for space.
"You see, we got about 210 cubic feet, so we can move around."
"If you ever go up there again, will you take me along?"
Ha-ha-ha.
What for?
First missionary on Mars.
"Tell me, was it public relations you did for the Gestapo or community relations?"
-I'm Swiss.
"-Yes, of course."
"And you never went bowling with Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh?"
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
-It's a red brick wing.
-Saint Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
He has black hair.
He's very intense looking.
Who's that?
-Damien Karras.
-Karras?
"That's his office, back of Saint Mike's."
He's our-
- Our psychiatric counselor.
"He had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Cunting Hun.
"Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig."
Stop it!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Look at her
"Pablo, my god Pablito"
And what is this?
A surprise - yes?
This is Angela
- Hello
But what is it?
"A surprise, you'll see it inside"
He used to write every month but now it's been over a year
Without any news from him
Did you marry?
Don't tell me you got married without noticing me
Not until we have a flat
Catalina
- Hello son
Hello Angela
Is this you as a baby?
Very cute
Do you like moscatel?
"Yes, she likes it"
But don't serve us anything we're leaving right away
"Yes, I like it"
The police has been looking for you
When?
Like 20 days ago
"Is that true, grandma?"
"yes, like 20 days ago or so"
But you're not robbing again are you?
"No way, that's just police routine"
Yeah.
- Change your mind?
- Enough of this.
"You want to deal, you deal with me."
You leave Lucy out of it.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
You see?
I can be reasonable.
"Of course, I still have a job to do, and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or-"
I know.
Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"If she knows all this about you, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.There's a reason why the feds want you to testify.
I say we hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, if we go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
"No, sir, it's from that solar system ahead."
Any interference?
Resistance?
"No, sir, just scanning beams."
It's on an unusual wavelength.
Mr. Spock?
It would appear someone is curious about us.
"Mr. Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
"Yes, sir."
"We're closing, sir."
"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
"There's no hostility, sir."
"They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, just increasing in intensity."
Steady.
Regular.
"It's growing stronger, sir."
- Captain!
"- Yes, what is it?"
"The alien, it's slowing down."
"Warp 5, 4, 2."
"It's going sublight, sir."
Sir...
- It stopped dead in space.
- He may be turning to fight.
"No, sir."
They're just dead out there.
Are you sure?
"Yes, sir."
Unmoving.
Then we've got him.
Go to red alert.
Prepare to fire phaser banks.
"No image, no arrests, no Internet profile."
- No way to see what he looks like.
- So I could go undercover as him.
"- Could be pretty risky, Bos."
- But worth it.
This is more than just a gambling ring.
I can tell you he's scheduled for some casino time after his 8:00 massage.
Looks like one of us is gonna have to rub down a bad guy.
Good idea.
Massage?
No.
No.
Don't look at me.
I'm the cruise director.
I've already given up my cover.
I'm a dude.
You guys suck.
That's nice.
"Just a little higher up the thigh, honey."
There we go.
"Just a little higher, babe."
"There it is, sweet cheeks."
Why don't you just relax and enjoy the pressure points?
How's about you shut up and give me the happy ending?
Okay.
I'll give you a happy ending.
Once upon a time...
The end.
Bingo.
- You're back.
- I am.
I felt a little underdressed.
So get out.
See the world.
Learn some new things.
I don't want to disappoint Simon.
He raised me after my parents died.
Helped me earn my Ph.D.
And I owe him so much.
But sometimes he can be so...
Demanding?
Hm.
More like tyrannical.
Kelly...
It's your life.
It should be your decision.
I wish I had as much confidence in me as you do.
"I shouldn't admit this, but when we were in Thera,"
I had the most awful crush on you.
Me?
Really?
Perfect timing.
That's odd.
What?
"Well, the Ark of Solon was made around the 6th Century B.C., in Athens during the Iron Age."
"But according to this, the tool that dented it was made from tin, and judging by these trace elements, it came from the mines in Cornwall during pre-Roman times."
Cornwall?
Isn't that near Exeter?
Yes.
"Why, does it mean something?"
I'd better get to the academy.
May I go with you?
Yeah.
So why do you think your grandfather's so hostile about Atlantis?
I was drafted behind my back.
"- So, can I be discharged?"
- Discharged?
- You're gonna be impeached.
- [Both Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues] - [Hawkeye] Exactly what you need.
"- Tell me, Lieutenant Hutchinson."
- ##[Jukebox.
Swing]
- How does it feel to be a member of the ruling class?
- It feels terrific.
"That's speaking unofficially, of course."
"If anyone says you're not a real lieutenant, they'll have to answer to me."
- [All Chattering]
- Just think.
"Even if I didn't know it... for a couple of hours there, I was the leader of the entire free world."
It just goes to prove the American Dream is not dead.
Any boy can grow up to be first lady.
"## [""Harbor Lights""]"
Will you excuse me for a moment please?
- [Scratch] - ## [Stops]
Any requests?
It's my nickel.
'Hello?
' Hello?
'Kessler?
' I was right. it is him.
'Are you positive?
' Yes.
I think he might be on to me.
'Did he recognise you?
"Is that right, Denny?"
I'm Pica now.
"Some days yes, other days no."
(Mouthes) Pica.
"The police have your DNA on the knife, the victim's blood on your clothes."
Witnesses saw you running from the lane.
They may have.
But I didn't do it.
He was alive when I found him.
"I took the knife out, but he died."
OK.
"Alright, we'll look into it further and get back to you."
You can't possibly believe him.
We've got our instructions.
Got your baggy eyes spot-on.
"Thanks, mate."
"Who is he, for Christ's sake?"
He is Pica.
What do we know about his prior?
Statutory rape. 15-year-old girl.
He was 19.
Girl.
Interesting.
You reckon it was a stitch-up?
"Well, come on."
"He looks like he did it, he sounds like he did it, he's homeless, he's got a serious prior."
It's the easiest stitch-up in the world.
Jails are full of guys who are there because they look like him.
You know?
No.
So you guys have sorted things out?
We haven't sorted out a bloody thing.
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
- Reagan --
- I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett.
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was -- he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
You're spending millions on him.
- Cunning!
He's using Jai
Jai knows where he's headed.
"He's focussed, he's ambitious"
What do you want to do with your life?
What I want to do?
I want to beat you
"For me, that will be a happy day."
- Don't get sentimental
Who can beat you?
"My loan, please."
Get lost
You won't marry me without a dowry?
Goodness!
Help me... someone help
What's going on?
- Let's take a look
She's the one who fooled Om
"Watch, I'll give her a taste of fun!"
Right at the wedding altar!
How dare you ask for dowry?
"What happened, lady?"
I had To run away from my wedding
My fiance's father is greedy!
"At the eleventh hour, he demanded a million from my father!"
"No, only 800,000 800,000...?"
"- Okay, 400,000 will do"
"And the sad part is, he kept mum"
"Don't cry, come with me."
Oh no... no...
Come with me.
We are going nowhere.
"Until we've got fingers again, obviously."
Great!
You've done a really good job.
It's very... secure.
Thanks.
"And don't worry, it unlocks just as easily as it locks."
"Oh, no."
Ah...
Kidding.
I'm kidding.
I was just...
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- He doesn't say much.
- That's Steve.
He takes a while to warm up to new people.
"So, who are you exactly?"
I'm you.
I thought you looked familiar.
"12 years ago, I was the kid no-one believed."
I'm...
I saw something too.
"An animal, a creature, really."
"I was walking where I'd walked 100 times before and for some reason that day, there it was."
I've never seen anything like it before or since.
You never saw it again?
But I knew what I'd seen.
"For a while, I tried to convince other people I'd seen it, too."
I don't need to tell you how that went.
My parents practically measured me for my own strait jacket.
I know how it feels when the people you rely on most don't believe you.
- Attaboy.
- When we got married... it was supposed to be for better or worse.
"Only I gave the better, and you gave the worse."
What are you gonna do about it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it.
Laverne!
I'm washing my hands of both of you!
You're rotten to the core!
You deserve each other!
"Sign it ""John Hancock."" It's my Declaration of Independence."
Okay!
That's wonderful.
At last you're a free man.
- You got your whole life ahead of you.
- I'm a free man!
- Right.
- I'm also an idiot.
- What do you mean?
"- There's just one hitch, and it lasts six years."
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I went to the colonel and had him swear me in.
"You mean, after all he said..."
Colonel Potter swore you in anyway?
"Yeah, yeah."
He even welcomed me aboard.
"Oh, I'm so stupid!"
What have I done?
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be all right.
You just relax and let hotter heads prevail.
I don't believe this.
I got knocked up.
So my man proposed to me.
No.
Why did you have to quit too?
I'm pregnant.
He doesn't want me to work.
You can still work even if you're pregnant.
"If I was pregnant, I would still work."
You don't understand.
"I am having a baby, and it will affect the baby."
"If you play that card, there's nothing more to say."
Why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
You told me we would work side by side forever.
Yeah I did say that.
I'm sorry.
But you understand right?
I don't.
You can't do this to me.
Are you really mad?
You have no right to be mad!
Why can't I?
No.
Listen and stop worrying.
Your jobs won't disappear.
"I'll find a new person to take my place, okay?"
Why so mad?
Because nobody can replace you.
You can find someone better.
But I don't want it.
It's not you.
"For me, there is no Je 2."
- Ha-ha-ha.
"- Come on, Slug, let's get our dough back."
"I'm sorry, but you can't take the dog inside."
- Fido wouldn't make a bit of trouble.
"- Sorry, but it's against the rules."
I'll have you understand I'm not a madam.
"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
I'm sorry.
- Take your hands off me.
- What's the trouble here?
- The lady has a dog.
- You needn't have been so rude about it.
"Poor Fido, did he hurt-um?"
- May I take your dog?
- No.
I'll give him back to you after the performance.
You're sure you'll take good care of him?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
That's the second complaint I've had in five minutes.
- I must be slowing up.
- I think we can get along without you.
"- Aw, you hurt me."
- Turn in your uniform.
"Listen, Fido, this guy's got a wooden leg."
Try it sometime.
I dub you lieutenant.
[CHATTERING]
Uh-huh.
Did it again.
That's four pairs in a row.
"If this keeps up, I'm gonna buy you a fur coat."
"Doctor, I assure you, if anybody's playing jokes, it's Judy here."
"Come on, Judy."
Don't touch that chimp.
"Look, fellas, this animal's the property of the United States government."
(JACK):
"Captain, you are wrong."
"Doctor, will you let us prove it to you?"
"Ok, convince us."
"Hey, Judy."
"Judy, it's Mike and Jack."
She has a stubborn streak.
"Judy, don't you have something to say to us?"
(SQUEAKS)
"Judy, this is getting silly."
"Now, say something."
"Look, I will ask her to give me a kiss."
"Now, if she does so, will that prove to you that space helmet or not, she is our chimp?"
Not necessarily.
"And let me warn you,"
Sally is reputed to be a very aggressive chimp.
- Don't get too close to her.
- I'll take my chances.
"Ok, Judy, now look, you've had a lot of fun, but the game is over."
Now you lean over here and you give your old friend Jack a great big kiss.
"Now, come on."
Pucker up.
(SCREECHING)
"Jack, you all right?"
"No, no, Sally, don't do that."
I told you not to get too close.
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
- Chopin will provide an accompaniment.
- Delighted.
We'll play the parts and you will enjoy this tribute from your grateful geniuses.
The style's a bit precious.
Do you mind if I rewrite it?
- Not at all.
We'll have a horse sent in.
- (MARIE GIGGLES)
What is the subject of your play?
- Noah and the flood.
- (LAUGHS) How appropriate!
GEORGE:
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never end?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
I hate those things.
Can I see that?
You don't remember them because you didn't write them!
I can't remember them because they're shit!
(ARGUING)
"Ah, children."
You are wanted in the theatre.
Now!
There you are!
You must hurry.
Hurry up!
Get into your costumes!
I am as excited as if it were an opening night at the Comedie Francaise.
- You rode over in all this rain!
- A new play!
This is a real treat!
And you won't be going anywhere.
We'll see about the television.
All right?
"I'm very pleased that you like Dr. Travers, darling."
I did too.
"Well, he said he'd stop by in a couple of days to see how I'm feeling."
Good.
"And I will tell you exactly what he's going to say, that your husband is taking very good care of you."
I'll be right back.
- What did you do?
- Oh.
The antibiotics Dr. Travers gave me.
Let me help you.
He should've given me clumsy pills instead.
Better take this before I forget.
"- Gerard, I'll be coming down for breakfast at 7:15 tomorrow morning."
Tell Mrs. Gunnerson it will be the usual.
That's right.
Thank you.
Good night.
"Oh, here, darling."
"Oh, thank you."
To my beautiful wife.
Alexis.
"It's late, very late."
There's nothing more that you can do tonight.
Let's go home.
"I want to stay here, Dex."
You're tired.
You can come back tomorrow.
"Yes, I know, but I want to stay and talk to Galen's doctors."
Even if it means spending the night?
I'm in the middle of it.
We'll take care of it.
We'll manage.
We'll get it done.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
Fine.
Bye.
I do like my drink.
It goes hand in hand with playing.
It's a given.
A morning break drink.
"Before that, three spritzers just so I can talk."
"Then, with the morning break drink, 10 spritzers."
"And afterwards a few shots, because everything's gone so well."
But I'm predisposed because my whole family drinks.
Is dinner ready?
This is our basement den.
We don't use it as often as before.
- We used to celebrate birthdays here.
- We don't celebrate here anymore.
"My son was a musician, he'd play for us."
"On birthdays, Christmas, New Year's."
We always had such a good time.
We had Mardi Gras parties.
"We had Mardi Gras parties, but... that's all over."
"Yup, pretty much."
"The carpets here, actually..."
I'm no fan...
"I'm no fan of carpets, but my wife..."
"It doesn't fit upstairs, but it cost a lot, so I put it down here."
- Nowadays...
Do you just carry that thing around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason
"So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
I'ma turtleperson.
a cat person or a dog person.
I'ma turtleperson.
Justkeepit light.
I'ma turtleperson.
Justkeepit light.
"You know, tell the truth."
Justkeepit light.
"You know, tell the truth."
Theawfultruth!
"You know, tell the truth."
"- Good morning, Miss."
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
"Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?"
Walk march!
Forward!
"Party, halt!"
"Sgt. Ballantine, take charge."
"Go inside, dear."
I'll be right with you.
"All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon."
"- Naik, what about this?"
"- He just came back, Sergeant sahib."
"Come here, you."
"Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this."
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
"- Please, sahib."
"You stole the elephant, didn't you?"
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
"Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?"
"- Yes, sahib."
- That's all!
Take him away!
"You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!"
"Wait a minute, Mac."
- You slept with Jack?
- You slept with Vanessa?
Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.
Jack?
Blair?
Really?
That's calculating.Even for you.
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.
You call that comfort?
More like collusion.
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.
I'm standing right here.
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.
And you were in jail?
I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.
Wh-what was he doing there?
"No,no,no."
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
Okay?
"You guys just stop it,okay?"
She's trying to create
A divide between us.
This is exactly what she wants.
We can't let that happen.
You want to know something?
I don't think it's her that created the divide.
I think it was you.
"You're the reason we're on ""gossip girl"" in the first place."
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.
Okay that's enough.
We all did what she said we did.
- You can't blame Serena for this.
- Course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers."
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
"What do you mean, a runner?"
"Just took off, all of a sudden."
- Find him for me.
- And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time, no guns."
"- John, I've finally cracked it."
It's churros.
- What are you talking about?
The Spanish doughnuts you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out.
- Churros.
- Good.
"Once again last night, the wife got a call at 10:30."
- The husband saying good night.
- Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
"We need to get in, get the phone number, without her knowing."
How?
We need a woman.
"Like Mr Ray Charles says, we've got a woman."
- You must be joking if you think...
- How many other birds do you know?
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
"No, you haven't struck a nerve."
"Oh, for God's sakes, Adam, I knew the man briefly."
Is that it?
Or is it because it's me asking?
It's obvious Blake's told you he's disinherited me.
I assume he's also turned you against me.
"Adam, darling, it has nothing to do with you."
I did know Garrett Boydston a long time ago.
That part of my life is over.
That book is closed.
And I never re-read an old book.
Sorry.
Mary had a little lamb
"Little lamb, little lamb"
Mary had a little lamb...
Claudia.
What are you doing here?
"We're having fun, Mommy."
"- It's true, Sammy Jo."
I was just in the neighbourhood.
And I thought I'd stop by and see a little boy that I love very much.
"Oh, do you now?"
"Well, don't try and get too close to my son, you hear?"
"Danny, go see Marie and go play downstairs for a while."
But you'll come back again.
- Promise?
"- Oh, I promise."
"The fact is, Sammy Jo, that we're already close."
We got that way when I was married to Steven.
- While you were-
- I was what?
Too busy bumming around to take care of your own baby.
- You'll have to stall him.
- Me?
"I don't work here anymore, Andy, it has to be you."
You can do this.
All right.
"Uh, hey, Tom."
- What's up?
- Keith asked me to tell you to submit your debrief in writing this time.
He always debriefs me in person.
"Yeah, but he and Rebecca"
Are still going over case files.
"I guess it's taking them longer than they thought, huh?"
"Okay, thanks."
"Uh, tom."
"I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air."
There's no air that needs clearing.
We have nothing to talk about Andy.
"Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Sorry, who are you again?"
Mariana.
Been here two weeks.
"Uh, look,"
I don't think Andy told you the truth about director Mullins.
What are you talking about?
Something really weird is going on.
I've been trying to reach him for the last 45 minutes.
Ben.
Where are you?
I need more time.
"Right, so CTU can track me."
So I can get the list and you can get the money.
"Ben, I am trying to help you here, but you have got to give me some room."
- I am listening.
"We are after talented musicians at schools, especially after Candan..."
- Ercetin's popularity.
- Yes.
And we have come across your thing your name.
"You are very kind, Mr. Ceyhan."
"Of course, we can meet."
Is it necessary to meet today?
"Well, right away if possible."
The studio is free at the moment.
We could do some recording...
My partners are here too.
"So, we could sign a contract too."
"Well, if you say today is necessary."
I am listening to you.
Then ...
let me give you the address.
"Okay, I am writing it down."
"It's IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek, Bemol Records, Cevat Ceyhan."
Which bazaar did you say?
"Ma'am, it's the IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek."
"There aren't any mistakes with the address, right?"
Of course not.
What kind of a mistake can there be?
"Alright, sir."
"So, that's your place."
Come on.
We are waiting for you.
My accent always works within the music sector.
"Oh God, my voice is gone."
God damn it.
Hello?
Okay.
It's...
Order an abdominal M.R.I. and a urine catecholamine.
It's just a hunch.
Okay.
Oh.
I almost killed you with an educational rattle.
Sorry.
I didn't knock in case you were sleeping.
I just came to get Cooper's clothes.
"Yeah, and to check up on me, make sure I'm not crazy."
I know the drill.
"What, you want to hold the baby?"
Do I look like someone who wants to hold a baby?
I'm wearing silk.
Are you breast-feeding?
No.
"No, I'm not."
"You know, a lot of women don't breast-feed."
I don't need to breast-feed.
L...
like I should feel bad about it?
I...
"I am so sick of people trying to make me feel like what I feel isn't what I should feel, if that makes any sense."
No.
"No, Charlotte, I'm not breast-feeding, okay?"
What you do with your boobs is your business.
"I only ask because you look like you need a martini, and if you're not breast-feeding, you can have a martini."
You want a martini?
Yeah.
Please.
Naomi.
Eva has never gotten over it.
She has worked like mad.
I've hardly seen her.
"-Never miss home, Aksel?"
-No.
It's been 20 years.
Things look different now.
And Eve?
It's been 20 years for her too.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
"Hello, my friend."
I have been in contact with the ministry.
I thought it should exist willingness to find a political solution.
There is a whole community.
Hundreds of people.
There is not a single company that will take us with pliers!
I do not think it's going to go this time.
Do not say that.
I've failed them.
I've failed everyone.
Me you...
"-No, You have not."
"-Yes, That was your."
"Solar Tech was your life's work, and I threw it away."
I love this place.
The people here are ...
I have lived here more than half my life.
All would have been affected.
"So what you're saying, is that you practically bankrupt?"
"No, what I am saying is that I believe in miracles."
"If it's what it takes to save the situation,  so I believe in anything."
- That guy is such an asshole.
- Don't blame it on him.
You're not makin' any progress.
I'm goin' to get the jump rope.
- Men are such pricks.
"- Oh, tell me about it."
I bet you're real tired of them pushing you around.
"Oh, God, you have no idea."
If only there was a way that you could be... physically tough enough to intimidate men.
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
Let's just say I provide a much-needed service around this place.
"Step into the shadows and, uh, we'll talk."
Yeah?
"Mac and Dennis, dude."
Open the door.
- What?
- It's Mac and Dennis.
Open the door.
"Open the door, bro."
"All right, guys."
Hang on a second.
"It's like, uh..."
It's like 11:00 in the morning here.
- We don't care.
Open the door.
"- Surprise, bitch."
You're hittin' me with that?
"Charlie, let's be honest."
Punching boards isn't your thing.
- But that's okay.
"- Yes, that's okay, because for you... it's not gonna be about inflicting punishment... it's gonna be about having punishment inflicted upon you."
- You gotta talk to me.
- What does Dr. Beckett say?
- He says I'm hilarious.
"Thursdays at 4, highlight of his week."
He should be paying me.
"- Okay, I..."
- I...
Just please.
"Please, just..."
I didn't know that he had stopped coming to see you.
"I'm really scared, and I'm really confused because Eddie has so much going for him."
- He's so loved.
"- Julia, depression is not circumstantial."
It's got nothing to do with what you did or you didn't do.
Eddie is not choosing to feel this way.
I know.
I know.
And she could reach around a wall and smack you in the head before you...
And the arm would...
All you'd hear is this:
Ernest Hemingway blew his head off with a shotgun.
"Click, bang."
Thank you.
Can we get the check?
"His wife, Mary, said he was simply cleaning the gun."
And I think that's some housekeeping gone awry.
"Hey, how are you?"
- Haven't seen you here in a while.
- Yeah.
"Had he hung himself, would it have been that he was just cleaning the rope?"
- How's he doing?
- Fine.
Oh!
[groans]
"Boy, if Dad could see you now."
I am doing what he asked me to do.
I'm trying to help you.
I know you want the bonds.
- I can give them to you.
- And why would you do that?
Were you not listening?
That blood could satisfy your need to kill.
And what if I like to kill?
Do you?
"Look, what's the catch?"
You let Freddie go.
And I get to come with you and help you through this.
Are you out of your mind?
You seriously trust that Carlos won't just eat you the first chance he gets?
I don't trust him.
I trust you.
"I know you'll protect me, Scott."
[rock music plays]
"[Eddie] How did you get Seth to give you the plans, anyway?"
[Richie] Let's just say I convinced him.
[exhales]
"It's a little fancy, don't you think?"
I'm workin'.
[Richie sighs]
"Hey, listen."
I'm sorry I had to twist your arm about all this.
"What, are you kiddin'?"
I'm back!
"But if you ever try anything like that again, I'll kill ya."
"In all of them, you attack him first."
But I had to!
He's a psychopath!
"- I killed him, and..."
- Go on.
"I mean, not him, but it's hard to explain."
That man is going to attack me again!
"I don't mean to offend you or make you uncomfortable, but, oh,"
- do you know what a nigga moment is?
- Of course.
"Thank God for them, or I wouldn't have a job."
"But an n-word moment, as you put it, does not excuse you from obeying the law."
"So if this is an n-word moment, Mr. Freeman, my advice is, do not be an n-word."
"Oh, hi, guys."
What are you doing up?
"I, uh, got into a little fender bender."
"I'm okay... just a little, uh..."
"Granddad, you got your ass beat again!"
"I mean, anybody can lose once or twice, but granddad stay losing!"
What?
!
You know what happened?
!
Do we know what happened?
!
Everybody knows what happened!
I caught the last half of it on the live stream!
"Oh, no!"
Why me?
!
Why?
!
The cosmetics in the bathroom cupboard and the electric toothbrush.
The first time those items appeared round here was last January.
"We got together at a Christmas do, I semi-moved in the next month."
"So, where do you sleep every Tuesday night and alternate weekend?"
I kept my place on.
Expensive.
I want to keep my independence.
Really?
Is that true?
"I'm sorry, I really do need to get back."
Will you tell him that we met?
Will you?
Are you kidding?
It'd freak him out.
"Best both keep quiet, then."
Pretend like this never happened.
I like that plan.
"Oh, do me one favour?"
Anything.
Change those sheets.
What do you think about having them over?
Who?
The neighbours.
We could make it a thing.
"Drinks, nibbles."
Do we have to?
I think we should get to know them better.
Find out what they're really like.
"Morning, Mr Sellers."
"Good morning, Michael."
We're having everyone over ours Friday evening.
A few glasses of wine.
"I'm used to it, but you?"
Are you saying you don't want to see me?
I'm saying that I'm scared of losing you.
The people I love all end up turning their back on me.
I won't be able to bear it if you do.
I don't fucking care if the judge can't find me a new home.
I'll manage.
Where will you sleep?
Under a bridge or on a bench.
"Anyway, it's cool you called me."
You'll sleep on a bench.
Or in a squat.
But it's dodgy.
There are always problems.
Sleep at my place.
We'll find a solution tomorrow.
Your place?
Just for tonight.
And don't tell anyone.
I'm not supposed to put you up.
Can I finish my pizza or should we go now?
"Go ahead, finish it."
I'll go and pay.
Your bathroom's so clean.
Don't you ever wash?
Help me with the sheet.
What are those marks?
Nothing.
You live alone?
- Yes.
"- You don't have a girlfriend, a wife?"
- I'm divorced.
"Well, I had a great day."
"I haven't learned a thing about comedy, and August and I had a huge fight."
"Oh well, how would you like a nice doughnut?"
"from this bag labeled ""donuts""."
Ahh!
You touched doggy doody!
Since when is doggy doody made in Taiwan?
They have dogs in Taiwan.. big ones.
"Funny, right?"
- I don't know.
"You know,"
I don't think I'm ever gonna see my coat again.
"Okay, Harry, why don't you sit down, you'll feel a lot better?"
Right here.
Excuse me.
Damn!
"You know, at least I can take comfort in knowing that I treated my coat well."
Such as yesterday.
It was hot on the bus.
I took it off and folded it neatly and placed it under the shade of my seat.
What?
You left it on the bus.
No-o-o!
You know they have a lost and found Harry.
Oh you mean I might see my coat again?
Oh I am so happy.
"Dick, I've been thinking about this ""humour"" thing."
Why don't you try what those guys on TV do?
Everybody says they're funny?
"- Oh, yeah, those guys!"
You know..
The McLaughlin group?
"Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?"
"All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too."
"As long as I'm alive, you live."
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
"He says to keep order, be confident, and wait."
"Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language."
That's enough.
Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on.
Get on back.
"Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?"
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down.
Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
"- Yes, sahib, gold!"
"Look at it, mates!"
Gold!
That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
"- Sit down, you fool!"
See that hand sticking out?
"I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!"
Who's a blinking idiot now?
"We're rich, mates."
Come on!
"All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer."
It's port wine.
From Portugal.
Wine?
You were supposed to get decorations for the class.
Sorry.
I tried to go this morning but there was this huge line at Portuguese Party City.
- Really?
- No.
There's no Portuguese Party City.
There's no Portuguese anything.
How'd we end up with Portugal?
I was working during the sign up.
"By the time I got there, the only country left was Portugal."
There's a Portuguese family in the class and even they picked Jamaica.
"Ritchie, come on."
"We're late, we're late."
- I don't wanna be late for this thing.
- What should I wear?
We're supposed to dress like our country.
Oh.
"Well, wear anything."
Stand next to the kid dressed as Spain.
- Everyone will buy it.
- Okay.
You think they eat Raisin Bran in Portugal?
"Yes, but in Portugal, they call it..."
[PORTUGUESE ACCENT] ...Raisin Bran.
[CHRISTINE GRO ANS]
- I don't wanna do this.
"- Well, why'd you sign up for it?"
"Oh, Richard, you don't know this school."
"They've got a million events a week and you gotta volunteer and if you don't, they ostracize you."
"Yes, dear?"
It's Mrs. Richards.
A fatal accident?
She's had some money stolen.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty,"
I tell Polly.
"That's all right, but don't tell anyone else, not even me!"
You know nothing!
- Basil?
"- Yes, dear?"
You've got to help me handle this.
She's in a frightful state.
I can't get a word in edgewise.
She's had £85 taken from her room.
"I said we'll search everyone, but she insists we send for the police."
What do we do with someone like that?
She just keeps on!
"Mrs. Richards, how very nice to see you!"
Are you enjoying your stay?
There's no need to shout.
I have my hearing aid on.
"Mrs. Richards, I've explained to my husband..."
I've just been up to my room.
"£85 has been taken from my bag, which I had hidden under the mattress."
"Oh, yes?"
It's a disgrace!
I haven't been here a day.
- What sort of staff do you employ?
- Mrs. Richards...
"If you knew anything at all about running a hotel, this sort of thing wouldn't happen!"
"Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"
What?
Yihong Brothel?
I must get that ill-gotten money
Have some tea!
"My lord, aren't you wasting this good wine?"
What a pity?
Not at all!
Nothing like Chinese dates soaked in wine
It's like paradise!
Such a big man and he's still sucking breasts
Looks like it's so pleasurable
Heavenly!
Look at the way he waggles his tongue
This is so embarrassing
What's so embarrassing about that?
Don't come if you're broke
This is so wonderful!
"Master Zhou, you've had your pleasure!"
"Let's play the money game, how's that?"
Good!
Come!
Come!
All of you!
Let's get everybody out!
These are all for you!
Coming!
Coming!
Only those fast enough will get reward!
Let's start the game!
You can have it if you get it
"If you drop it, it's not yours!"
You dropped it!
Stupid!
"I'm sure you are, Jake."
"You ask me to take point, and then you kind of undercut my authority in there."
"Yeah, I'm sorry about that."
We could've closed it clean for 1.75.
I know.
So now we just sit it out?
"Liz has cancer, Jake."
What?
Found out last night.
Is it serious?
Mm-hmm.
"Burton, I'm so sorry."
"You know, you should have told me about this before the meeting."
"I--I am trying to get vortex as our client, and I--I really don't want to do a deal with them that can turn out badly."
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
The U.S. attorney wants names from kalaya.
What does kalaya get?
Protection from the thai penal system.
Come on.
She'll be dead in the streets.
Yeah.
That's why I didn't take the deal.
I lined up a couple of prospective foster parents.
Do you think we have any kind of a shot in here today?
"Probably not, Ms. Agnes."
Hmm.
Liz:
How did it go today?
"Well, they want you to get life insurance."
Heh!
I can't do it.
"Kim Seon Joo, did I order the curry?"
I don't think I heard.
I clearly heard you order the curry.
Me too.
Weird...
"Maybe you were thinking of pork cutlet in your head when you ordered the curry, you may have accidentally said curry instead of pork cutlet."
"No, I didn't."
"Team Manager, you can switch with me."
It doesn't matter to me.
I like curry too.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
"She said she was buying, and she's just leaving."
I'll pay.
I'll pay.
But why is she getting so angry?
"She's not the type to get so worked up, it's weird."
What's there to get angry about?
I was mistaken.
Tell them to enjoy and that I'm sorry.
"It's okay, things like that can happen."
Enjoy.
How can I help you?
Excuse me.
We can make it for you as well.
Turkey sandwich and a coffee.
All right.
Stay seated!
Stay right there.
"I can take this off, right Doctor Kang?"
"Yes, please."
Now you're finally worth looking at.
- There was a shipwreck.
And the captain thought he saw the ghosts.
Le Bosco was also acting strangely
- And at dawn
- What happened at dawn?
They were in the marshes near the haunted ruins at dawn.
And now -
There they are.
How do you know all of this?
I just know.
What if they're still alive?
"For God's sake, shut up"
The captain has shut himself in his house.
He's afraid.
You're all crazy!
You know what's hidden away in the ruins.
If they made it there
Two girls.
Wounded and exhausted!
I think they must have drowned!
I hope so
If they are hiding in the ruins and they free
Don't mention his name!
We don't really know what's hiding in the ruins.
Yeah.
But if they manage to get that far... what will happen?
All I know is that no one has been there for at least a century.
Shut up!
You don't know what you're talking about.
- Do you understand?
- Help!
Stop it!
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
So I'll come back next week?
Excellent.
My pleasure.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.
Dr. Roncero's office.
"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephantsized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
Definitely not.
Day after tomorrow is your engagement.
Go.
Get ready.
What are you talking?
Do you know how badly you cheated me?
The lies you told me.
Cheating?
Lying?
For this simple matter.
Is this a simple matter.
If you know what really happened...
What happened?
I said that I joined the job for you.
I didn't like it.
"So, I quit the job."
You got the information from some idiot.
You got hurt.
Is that all?
Not only that.
Didn't you call my love silly?
"If you keep shouting at me, anyone would say that."
You were no less.
I was after you to make you say I love you.
You said that at the time of our separation.
How would I feel?
Frustrated.
What are you staring at me?
You were trying to make me remember something.
You wanted to say something.
C'mon talk.
You said you don't remember your past.
And your... pathetic tantrums threaten us all.
Hmm?
This is not me accepting.
This room here on the left will be your room.
"On the right, take note, is the bathroom, if you need to wee-wee or something else."
"Now, this here is your room."
Isn't that fantastic?
I think there is a game of Buckaroo downstairs.
One of the other guests must have left it behind.
- Bucka-fucking-roo?
- Yes.
It's a fantastic game for two to eight players.
"Oh, for... forget it."
I was just trying to think of things to keep you occupied.
I can keep myself occupied.
"Oh, God, you're a teenage boy."
Of course you can.
- Hello!
- Shit a brick!
Don't you knock?
"Oh, no, I don't have to."
Being dead has some perks.
Not with me.
I don't want ghosts popping up all over the place.
It freaks me out.
You're a 46-year-old vampire who dresses like a child.
Don't call her freaky.
Up.
"Anyway, just, er... came to see how you boys are getting on."
Uh.
Badly.
Ah.
"You know, i..."
I wasjust feeling good that day.
Yeah.
"I, uh..."
I don't know what to say.
"I'm at a loss, boy."
I'm at a total loss.
"I mean, here you are, supposedly injured, all right?"
You're collecting your lieutenant's salary and full disability.
I didn't even want to do this.
Matt had to talk me into it.
You know how stupid I felt?
"The lower back, it's an enigma."
"Pat, I'm gonna be straight with you."
"Obviously I have alternatives to pursue, but I'm not gonna... because - cause I don't want this getting out."
All right?
It makes everybody look bad.
"But from now on, you are back on full patrol."
Here.
Get started with this.
- A missing person's case?
"- Yeah, a bookie."
Jerry Green.
No one's seen him for about a week.
Huh.
Jeez.
- What happened to him?
"- I don't know, Pat."
That's what you're supposed to find out.
Right.
All right.
We talked earlier about the fact there's a shortage of wading pools.
I want you out of here.
"And from now on, I don't want anybody going to his tavern,"
I don't want anybody eating his food.
"Spit that out, Johnson."
"I brought this from home, sir."
I said spit it out.
I think he meant into a napkin.
- I'm going to go.
- Good.
And take these lousy sandwiches with you.
"Those are my gym clothes, sir."
I'm really glad we could have dinner.
"Me, too."
You okay?
You seem a little nervous.
"No,"
I'm not nervous.
Just a little hopped up from the pepper shrimp.
"Alex, I get it."
You're afraid someone will see us together and tell your father.
I'm not afraid.
It's just there's nothing to tell him.
Okay.
"But I can tell my friends about you, right?"
Tell them what exactly?
"What, are you kidding?"
I kissed one of Manhattan's Ten Most Eligible Singles.
"That's only happened to me, like, three or four times."
"Hey, let's walk this way."
What?
I think I see the mail-room guy from my office.
"Sorry, I just feel like everyone's staring at us."
"- Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid... that's...
Embarrassing.
- Your Highness.
- Let's go.
Oh.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
- What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
- Cool?
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band... and rides a motorcycle without a helmet... and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh, enough that he deals a little bit on the side."
"And he can never, ever be true to one woman."
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
- Why would we care how...
"- Usually, it's like this."
- After you.
- Oh.
Thank you.

I've been out of my mind.
I had to get out just to keep f rom going crazy.
- l just saw him.
- Tonight?
- About 10:00.
- Where?
We have a special treat f or you tonight.
"As a f avour, the lady who was our star attraction has agreed to give us the song she made the sensation of the South."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Coral Chandler."
I see what Johnny meant.
"You and Johnny, you were together all the time, weren't you?"
We f ought together.
And spent your leaves together.
"London, Paris, Rome."
"Me with a gal, him without one."
Just a picture of you in his eyes.
Where is he?
"Won't you tell me, where did you see him?"
- Let's dance.
"- Please, I want to know."
I wanted her in my arms when I told her.
My right hand on her spine would feel the shock.
She'd tested pure so far.
But so did another girl I knew.
Right up to the dollar point.
And it wasn't 4 million.
- Still wear the same perf ume?
- Tell me where you saw him.
"- ""She wears jasmine, "" he said."
- Please.
He called you Dusty. lt was a name he had between the two of you.
"Well, why..."
- Why don't we think about it?
"- Okay, I will."
I just did.
I want to do it!
"I'm so sorry, but I could really use the money,"
- and I think it could be fun.
- There you go.
A star is born!
D-d-don't worry.
It's not gonna change a thing.
"My job with you always comes first, I promise."
"Come on, we've got a million things to do."
We gotta talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
I hope your afternoon is free...
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
I like the other one better.
The one on the trolley cars.
What do you think?
I don't know.
"My god, it's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that."
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
I can't believe it either.
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember, your predecessor, Marissa Kessler."
Murder victim.
Multiple stab wounds.
Does that ring a bell?
"Sorry, sorry."
"All right, Randy and the Captain are probably already there."
- Where's the cook?
- Eating at Rosie's!
[ All Chanting ] Kill the cook.
Kill the cook!
Kill the cook!
See what you've done?
"Father, you'd better talk to them."
- Not without a whip and a chair.
- I don't blame you.
This place is a cat's whisker from loco.
- [ Chanting Continues ]
- I'll take care of this.

My associate and I have been planning a big surprise dinner party for tomorrow night.
"Oh, yeah?"
What kind of a party?
That's the surprise.
But I guarantee you... it will be spectacularly unforgettable.
Well it better be!
It better be!
What kind of a lamebrain scheme are you two hatching?
"- Oh-ho, Colonel, that would spoil the surprise."
"- Let's go, Beej."
This I gotta see.
Don't forget-- unforgettable.
"- You don't have a thing in mind, do you?"
- Even less than that.
David?
This is the best you could come up with?
This shit?
This is shit.
Read the deposition of the LaVamere lady.
She was putting on a sex show.
- How long did this go on for?
- It was hours.
- How many hours?
- Three or four.
Which one?
Three or four?
"Three, I guess."
"In her defense, she was drunk."
"To be honest, once she finished fucking and sucking those two assholes... she was carried into another room, and boys were going in and out of there... but I don't know if she was fucking them."
"When she came out, she was covered in cum."
It was awful.
"Excuse me, Counselor."
"I, um..."
- May I?
- Of course.
"Just to clarify, why exactly was Mrs. Laine Hanson..."
Strike that.
"Laine Billings involved in this, uh... appalling and disgusting behavior?"

"I'm still in shock, boss."
"I'm in so much trouble, Larry."
No man becomes wise without stepping on the soil of fools.
Right.
Right!
But I never claimed to be a -
That's good.
Where did you get that?
Is that from the Bible?
It's from this play I wrote in eighth grade about Evel Knievel.
- Oh.
You're right.
Did you read about the nuns?
The ones who were raped by missionaries in Africa.
The priests themselves!
It's horrible!
"If you can't trust a missionary, what's to become of us?"
- They used to rape the local women.
- Really?
"Because of AIDS, they started raping the nuns."
"Oh, my God!"
And I had the missionaries on a pedestal.
I'm sure not all of them are rapists.
- I hope not.
"- No, some are pedophiles."
- What's that?
- Everybody loves fucking...
"Shut up, Antonio."
You're such a brute.

"Anyway, do you want to know what was in my happy meal?"
You want to know what prize I grew up with?
Being raised by a single mom.
You know what?
I don't need red hair today.
I don't need that
"- distraction, please."
"- Hey man, why are you freaking out?"
I'm not freaking out This isn't freaking out.

We're in Detroit doing a fundraiser.
You proceed.
- Nothing else. I've said it all.
What happened?
-Her complaint is that he teased  and whistled at her.
-l didn't!
Did you whistle?
- Actually...
"Did you whistle, or not?"
"- Yes, I did."
But not to her.
I swear.
- Then why?
I am a music buff. I like to fiddle with instruments.
He also broke into a song on seeing me.
What was that?
"""Me and you in a locked house"" ""And..."""
"""And... the keys not to be found"""
Constable...
Lock him up.
Tomorrow is court-day.
Make sure the keys to the lock-up don't vanish.
You can file your complaint.
I would like to tell you something.
"Yes, tell me."
It's our duty to arrest and teach a lesson to such third class loafers.
And we do it.
"But, there are some duties ofwomen too."
Like what?
I don't get it.
Just look at yourself.
Ifyou roam about in these kind of dresses... ..do you think instead ofwhistles you will hear the temple bell?
What's wrong with this dress?
- Who's staying with mcgee?
- I can.
If you want tony to check out the other real estate women.
Fine with me.
"Tony,stay with mcgee."

Behold the majesty of the sun.
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.
They don't pay Fanucci.
"If they don't pay Fanucci, then somebody else collects for Maranzalla!"
We'll all be better off if we pay him.
Don't worry.
Now what I say stays in this room.
"If you both like, why not give me $50 each to pay Fanucci?"
I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.
"If Fanucci says $200 he means it, Vito!"
I'll reason with him.
Leave everything to me.
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.
He'll ask for the money.
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants.
Don't argue with him.
Then I'll go and get him to agree.
"Don't argue with him, since he's so tough."
How can you get him to take less?
That's my business.
Just remember that I did you a favor.
Is it a deal?
Yes.
His family's out of the house.
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.
"Vito, here's my 50 dollars."
Buona fortuna.
Are you sure he's going to go for it?
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
It looks like there's - $ 100 under my hat.

Hey.
Um...
Have you seen Stefan?
I need to find him.
"No, not lately."
"Listen, do you have a second?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
What's going on?
"- Well, it's Anna."
I've left her all these messages and she hasn't gotten back to me.
- Not even a text.
- Anna?
I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
"Yeah, we're more than friends."
"Look, something could be seriously wrong."
"And if you know anything, you gotta tell me."
"I haven't talked to her, Jer."
Are you lying to me right now?
- Why would you say that?
- That's what you do.
You lie.
You lie about everything.
And no sor of music would tempt you out?
Not at all.
Not even if it was Tiger Feet by Mud?
"Well, that would tempt me out, yes."
Or Fox On The Run by Sweet or anything from the '60s or 'the 70s.
"Pretty much anything I'll go and dance to, actually."
I hate being in the kitchen at parties.
I'm no good at it.

"Two, two, testing."
"That's not it, is it?"

"For the festive season, I'll do the sound effects of Santa arriving at the top of the house and then coming down the chimney to put the presents under the tree."

""" This body of mine have I received for my parents... ..And to keep it safe from harm is my first filial duty..."""
Don't you know?
Matsukichi!
You are not just some clerk sitting on a reception to have irezumi.
You are disinherited!
O-Waka-chan.
Matsuki-chan!
What happened?
I've just been said by my father that I'm disinherited.
But...
Matsuki-san...
You are his only son.
Aren't you?
It doesn't matter.
I was being forced to...
"From now on, finally I'll become a firefighter."
You were like this since you were a child.
Matsuki-san.
But... if that happens...
I...
I want to see you Matsuki-san.
I want to see you as soon as possible.
Don't worry.
You must be Ms.Cole?
Missus.
Ah!
Splendid.
Please take a seat.
Husband in forces?
He volunteers as an air-raid warden.
But he wasn't fit for conscription.
He fought in the war in Spain.
Splendid!
That's splendid.
"Now, about the job."
We need to cultivate a more convincing female angle in our output.
"Mr.Buckley here, has been appointed to the department as a Special Advisor."
"Not ""Special"" enough to get paid, obviously."
"He seems to think, you are what we need."
"I said, ""Might be""."
She can't be worse than the chaps you got.
Did you write...this?
Hm..hmm.
This rapta-rama chips?
I...
I was the secretary at the copy-writing department.
But...all the copywriters got called up.
"""So-be-fee."
"It ain't beef, but it ain't bad!"" Yes, sometimes, you have to make do of what you got."
Ah!
Splendid.
Ministry wages start at £3 and £10.
And obviously we can't pay you as much as the chaps.... so shall we say £2 a week?
Thank you.
You a cinema goer?
"No, that's avoiding a fight and getting to the tv faster."
I didn't think you were ever gonna do anything.
"As long as I've known you,"
You've been all talk and no action.
You found a rat's foot in a can of chili and never got around
To writing a letter.
I was just so mad at ms.
Rinsky!
Why are you talking about ms.
Rinsky?
"It's nothing, honey."
Everything's fine.
"Well, I love ms."
Rinsky.
She's great.
She gives us candy when we get the answers right.
Yeah.
I know you like ms.
"Rinsky, but she's not perfect."
"Don't forget, you got a ""d"" on that test."
"Yeah, I'm thinking"
That might be 'cause I only answered three questions.
How many questions were there?
45.
Brick!
She said we could have free reading time
"When we finished the test, so I finished in five minutes."
"You're lucky you got a ""d."""
I know.
Ms. Rinsky's the best.
"So Axl and Sue decided, whatever it took,"
They were gonna help aunt Edie find that time capsule...
Doesn't chemistry mean anything?
"Try to understand, please."
- Relax!
- I'll kill her.
Move...
Move...
Stay there.
I swear I'm going to kill her.
"What have you done, Shiv?"
He will kill you.
"Wait, did you kidnap me or did I kidnap you?"
I don't understand.
- Oh my!
- What happened?
Uncle and auntie.
- What?
"- Hello, uncle."
"I seek your blessings, aunty."
How are you doing?
Did you see what she was about to do?
"Ultimately, I had to explain it to her that she cannot marry him."
"And auntie, after using my body, how could she..."
"Don't be stupid, Shiv."
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Just a second, aunty."
You didn't jump into the pool but you jumped into the sea!
You know you are the first heroine..
..to go and plank herself in the villain's den?
And I am looking for you like a hero turned monkey...
And that b**tard is coming after my tail with a match in his hand.
Shiv...
"Just-just give a good look at the dog, will ya?"
- Just give him one good look.
-I don't wanna look.
"A good look or a bad look,"
I'm taking him back to the pound!
- Now get out of my way.
-Come on.
"Just-just give him a look, will you, Ralph?"
You know what?
"I know why you're afraid to give him a look-- you're afraid that if you look into these brown, soulful, trusting eyes, that it'll do something to your heart."
Just look.
"Look into those eyes, Ralph."
"Look, look, look."
"Put him back in the box, Norton!"
-(pleading indistinctly)
-Put him back in the box or I'm gonna do something to you!
Get out of the way!
Open that door.
Open the door.
"Ralph Kramden, you've just lost your membership card to the human race."
I still say it's the best appetizer I ever tasted!
"- Pardon me, sir."
"-Yes, sir?"
I'd like to return a dog that my wife got here yesterday.
Let me see now.
It's a good dog.
"You, uh, say your wife picked him up here yesterday?"
- Yeah.
-What's your name?
Kramden.
K-R-A-M-D-E-N.

Captain hunt.
There's one thing wrong with your ultimatum-
We can outmaneuver you in every way.
"Beka, seal the cockpit."
"Here we are,"
The revolt of the androids.
You knew it was coming.
I never got the memo.
"Harper... i was expecting a hangover, just not so soon."
"There's so much pain, harper,"
Just like in my nightmares.
"Yeah, listen, about that... we'll talk about it later."
"Right now,"
Dylan and your friends onandromedaneed us.
Argent?
He's gone there?
I believe so.
"And, harper,"
"When he kissed me, i knew"
"It wasn't love, like he said."
That's a mighty human thing to feel.
"But there's something else, harper."
"He also called me ""andromeda,"""
"And for the first time in my life, i knew... i know who i am."
"I am a warship,"
And i don't like running away from a fight.
Looks like you're going to get your chance.
Behind you.
"Back off, boys."
Beautiful but bad.
"My god, i am such a genius."
"It's still my job to protect you, harper."
Play it.
- Will you have a cigarette?
"- No, thank you."
"- Will that be all, sir?"
"- Yes, that's all."
Thank you.
You do that again and I'll take you across my knee.
"Well, are you ready?"
Thanks.
"Well, thanks very much for lunching with me."
- I'll call for you in about an hour.
- Thank you too.
- I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
"- Oh, just a moment!"
- What do you want?
I'm in a hurry.
I wouldn't annoy Miss Lowman again if I were you.
What right have you to interfere?
Are you a relative?
- No.
"- Then I have just as much right... to speak to her as you have, old boy."
"Nevertheless, I'm warning you."
"If you interfere with her, you'll get into trouble."
"Oh, I see then."
You're one of these government fellows.
Clever aren't you?
"Well, just keep away from her."
We Woosters never get enmeshed in the official dragnet.
- No?
"- Oh, no."
- Fine.
He said regards to you.
How are your children?
- They are fine?
What about you?
I am fine too.
What can I do for you?
"Indeed, I asked Seyed Abdulhossein to build Ali Asghar's cradle."
It's time to bring it.
- Seyed Abdulhossein?
You mean Tangak?
"- Yes, I am."
Why did you ask Seyed Abdulhossein?
Why Tangak?
Because he has a good faith.
He is well-wisher_
"You understand, Bashirou's mommy."
"It will be better, if an immature boy bring the cradle."
"- Yes, I see."
"- At first, I was going to ask Bashirou to bring it but"
- Zaer said it's better to talk to you before him to see whether you are - satisfied or not?
It's his wage.
- How should I oonsent myself to send Bashirou to Tangak?
"- Bashirou's mom, it's been a year since that happening."
"I had a goodwill,"
- I wanted to give some money to
"- Yes, I understand,"
"If your generosity but even if ifs been passed 100 years since that accident, you have no idea about Tangak's people, Zahireh_"
Zahireh!
I will go and talk to Mr. Zaer Kheder myself.
T's not related to Zaer Kheder_ It's Zahireh's order.

He used to make me and brother fight in the backyard every day.
He would come home and drink a beer and watch us beat the shit out of each other.
And one day we just decided--
Why fight each other?
Why fight for free?
So we just left.
What else is going on in that head of yours?
I don't know.
I just can't help thinking that I should have been there for him.
I should have been there for Frankie.
What could you have done?
just been there.
I wake up Why the hell didn't I go with him?
I should have fucking went with him.
And then maybe that would have been you too.
Yeah.
But it haunts me.
I hear him calling my name just like when we were kids.
And I'm not there.
I loved my brother Frankie. especially around the old man.
Have you forgiven him?
I just--
I'm not afraid of him anymore.
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna stay here?
Would you stay here for me?
what's up?
I understand.
Saturday?
Okay.
yeah.

You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.

I do that sometimes.
"You know, for a treat."
"Oh, fuck, just get on with it then."
- Are you going yet?
"- I can't, you're putting me off."
"- Shit, who's that?"
- Northwood?
- Who is it?
- It's obviously me.
What is happening in here?
- Has Charlotte sorted it?
- No.
I've sorted it though.
- What have you done?
- My mum's gonna pick us up.
What?
"- Oh, this is tragic."
- Called your mom!
Your mum is coming to rescue us from the toilet of an under-18 disco because we're being bullied by 12-year-olds?
No-one must ever know about this.
"Si, go outside and take your beating from this child, and then we can leave."
I'd have taken him down if it weren't for Northwood.
How were you going to take him down?
Spunk in his eyes?
"Oh, shit."
What if Carli finds out about me and that girl?
"Oh, no!"
I'm picking entire bloody structure either.
"Could you get from the high over there, please?"

Only if he stands a chance?
Maybe he does.
Maybe she likes him because he is the sort who let her fix the propeller.

Go to the shop and bring back some beer.
Beer!
Why is he the one happy about it?
Bring back some soju too.
"You take care of it on your own, I don't want to get involved."
Then shall I tell them everything?
That there's someone else inside the body?
"If you do, I bet you'll get dragged to the hospital right away."
"If you don't want to get caught, then cooperate."
I'm sure we'll get caught.
I'm sure it'll show as more time passes.
"If it starts to get obvious, then you have to try to hide it!"
Hide what?
Uh oh...
See?
It's already starting.
What are the 2 of you hiding?
Kids don't have to know.
Don't get involved in an adult's conversation.
"Let's go, Yoon Jae."
"You, kid don't have to know!"
She said a kid doesn't have to know.
Come have a seat over here.
-Da Ra!
Da Ran!
"-Yes, mom."
Be good.
What?
If it's uncomfortable...
Do you want me to get you a pair of socks?
That's okay.
This is comfortable.
You can't smoke here.
Did she talk to you that day?
Yes.
"Or rather, I talked."
About what?
My own business.
Did she mention me?
"To be honest, Lydia hadn't mentioned you in a long time."
This is all my fault.
No.
It was my fault.
This song gave me goose bumps.
"Marco, I've always wanted to ask you."
"Why did you cry the night I met you, after you killed the snake?"
It brought back a lot of memories.
What memories?
"Years ago, I had to kill another snake."
We were in Africa.
She had the same phobia as you.
"She was waiting outside the tent, terrified,"
"defenseless, and totally naked."
She saw the snake while we were sleeping.
Was she the one for whom you slept on the couch?
I hate that woman.
- I haven't seen her in years.
- Even worse.
What can I do to make you forget her?
Exactly what you're doing.
You were fast asleep so we didn't wake you.
Is Dr.Vega here?
He'll be in his office.
I saw him arrive.
I didn't know you smoke.
Me either.
"How many times have we risked our lives together, and I still don't know..."
What time period I'm from?
Yes.
It's so long ago I don't even remember it.

Where did you serve in the War?
"-With Generals Gil y Yuste, intelligence services in Álava, Your Excellency."
Good reference.
Do you understand the importance of these negotiations?
"Yes, Your Excellency."
"Well then, I am in your hands, because I get by with my English, but my German..."
Damn devil's language.
"You can be at ease, Your Excellency."
At ease?
With Hitler?
Impossible.
He's so high-strung.
How could a corporal have come so far?
20 SS?
"Well the plan is fucked, because we only have four more men here."
There's only 8 of you?
And the civil guard?
There are two more crates outside.
Did you tell them?
"He knows, too?"
"You know, too?"
I'm done for.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Big deal.
Have you considered how he feels?
A guy raises three kids and 30 years later he finds out he's not their father.
"Stop being his lackey, Ricky."
It's his fault that my mom's dead.
"He paid the surgeon $3,000 under the table"
- to make sure she'd be okay.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- The Arab took a bribe.
- How do you know?
He told me-
- You believe all his 1001 Nights stories?
He's waiting outside.
Really?
Why doesn't he come in?

Wait!
Natanel!
See?
I told you not to come.

Mama and me are going on a vacation tomorrow.
A vacation?
I don't believe it.
Mm.
Believe it.
For years she's been harping me I should take her somewhere.
"Finally, she said,"
"""You don't take me on vacation, I find myself a younger man."""
"Yeah, big deal."
"At our age, an old man is a younger man."
"So, a vacation - what'll it hurt?"
"So, we're going."
It sounds like she's really got you worried.
Worried?
"What, me?"
Never.
"Of course, she's been acting very nice to old man Burnestein lately."
Where are you gonna go on this vacation?
Did all that happen when you came to get the keys?
No.
We go back a long time.
I fucked it up.
And?
It's getting too complicated.
I've decided to move out.
"Don't worry, I'll cover you for the rent."
But that's unfair.
I didn't know about you and Anna.
- You're not to blame.
- Can I stay here tonight?
I can't sleep if I have to be alone.
No hanky-panky.
Scout's honour!
"I have to go, Sophie."
Sophie's sweet caress showed me I had to break the vicious circle.
"If not, -"
- Johan and I would end up like Pierre and Sophie.
"Lonely, bitter,   spitting harsh words at each other."
I understand.
Forever seeking comfort in strangers.
(cheerful pop music)
(bluesy rock guitar)
So much for wanting to break the vicious circle.
"If Camilla was a trap, he'd walked right into it."
Told you his odds were low.
"I was never, ever going to expose myself like this again."
(nightmare music)
(Anna sobbing)
Are you OK?
Come on.
It's their atlas.
Do sit down.
"We are looking for a new home, and can only retain Thomas and Betsy."
We're sorry to have to leave you all.
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.
My only real concern is how long it will take them to move out.
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.
He has his own barouche.
- You have two brothers?
- Yes.
Edward is the elder.
He's travelling up from Plymouth and will break his journey here.
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John...
This is your home now.
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?
One can presume she wants to count it.
What are you doing?
Gifts for the servants.
Where is Margaret?
She's taken to hiding.
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.
I have.
I've said yes and no.
"Good morning, Fanny."
"Good morning, Miss Marianne."
How did you find the silver?
"There's nothing special, right?"
No.
Nothing as of yet but.
- But...

The Legend of the Blue Sea
Do you know what I hate the most?
Leaving without saying goodbye.
"That's why I came, to say goodbye before leaving."
There's no other reason.
"Anyway, I've done what I've come to do, so I'm leaving."
Drink it.
I should've killed that bastard.
"- What are you going on about, Louise?"
"- It's only a song, Bosco."
A story about wreckers.
There are no wreckers nowadays.
It's just a song.
As long as it's just a song.
I don't want to hear your damn song!
It makes me sick!
Bloody hell!
There's a curse on this village.
The demons are free.
What did you see?
Tell me!
There were two ghosts.
They were staggering about.
"Pale and covered in blood, with crazed eyes."
- There were two women.
- Where did you see them?
"Over there, by the ship cemetery, near the haunted ruins."
"Come with me, you two."
Hurry
The devil has been set free!
God help us.
He has been imprisoned in the ruins for centuries.
Now he is free.
Misfortune is upon us!
I can sense that he's still in the ruins!
Maybe now his long wait will be over.
They're here.
We must drive them out.
They won't come out alive!
"You're hiding something, please co-operate."
Co-operate?
What do I've?
"Nothing, let him come and take it."
Would I be like this if I had Rs.20 crores?
Leave me sir.
"Sir, he has two bank accounts, both are empty."
What's this trouble sir?
"If I don't get tea, my boss will dismiss me sir."
I'm going sir.
A link is missing.
He won't lie...no way.
Why did he send his photo then?
"He's a thief, why should he tell truth?"
"He can lie to us, right?"
May be the peon is lying.
Thank God!
"My money...crores of my money, where is it sir?"
You said you'd no money.
"Not mine, it's Minister's."
Why didn't you tell the truth earlier?
How can I sir?
"I'm a proxy, trusted proxy of Minister."
He punched me and took everything.
Who is he?
How does he look?
Rajinikanth...superstar Rajinikanth punched me and took everything.
"I swear on my mother, it was Rajinikanth!"
My money...my money...
where's my money?
"Mother promise, superstar Rajinikanth took it away."
Bloody crap!
Linda Farrell.
- Why do you smell like dope?
- I've been with a patient.
- We're hooked up to Mount Sinai?
- Beating the crap out of them.
- What are you doing?
- Playing Doom II.
- How long does it take to play?
- Months.
I've done thoracotomies that were less bloody.
He doesn't understand the educational value.
"Die, bastard."
Die.
Come on!
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.
I knew you'd come.
"- Sweetie, of course we would."
- I want to go home.
Your daughter will be in the hospital at least several days.
Excuse me.
- Will both of you stay with me?
"- Of course, sweetheart."
"And, Daddy will you come back to live with us?"
- Well....
- We'll talk about that later.
How could you let her ride her bike in the rain?
- Don't blame me for this.
- Who else let her do it?
I'm doing the best I can.
If you spent more time with her and less at the office with Sarah--
The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
I think you should...
"Less talk, more action."
"Oh, this machine almost drives itself."
"Stay here, son."
"Come on, we have to find course for the dinosaur or we're useless."
"Cody, what did you do to our robots?"
"If you need them to do you want, you have to ask nicely."
"Cody, get off this channel."
It's for emergency responders only.
"Hide down, Kade."
Cody spotted the dinosaur first.
"For now, he's on the team."
Fine by me.
"Got any ideas, Cody?"
Not exactly.
But I know someone who will.
Hello.
Cody?
The Dinosaur Exhibit.
"Fine, now you're interested."
"How is that going, Graham?"
I'm almost there.
Just a little more to the right.
Preparing to lift the payload.
"Good to go, Dani."
You really think this will hold the tyrannosaur?
We'll find out.
"Keep him busy, Dad."
Dani is on her way.
"Now, how are we supposed to get that thing over here?"
Thought you'd never ask.
Incoming air support.
They're putting the fig leaves on the statues.
- Mr. President.
- Bob.
"I don't know whatto say, sir."
"As soon as we learned from the secretservice you were en route, the directorwas notified."
- He should be here any minute.
- Oh?
Where the hell is he?
"Uh, well, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir."
"So, let's go."
"He told me to take you to his conference room, sir."
"No, his office."
I wanta very private conversation with him.
- I don'twanna be bugged.
"- Then, his office will be fine, sir."
Okay.
Hi.
"How's the job going, Bob?"
"Frankly, itstinks, sir."
I have no access.
We'll see to that.
"He's nervous, sir."
He's heard you're looking for a new director.
He certainly isn'tacting like it.
That's Helms.
He's the epitome of Sangfroid.
Aworld-class poker player.
Yeah?
"Well, I own the fucking casino."
"I'm honored, Dick, thatyou've come all the way out here to Virginia... to visit us at last."
"- My friends call me ""Mr. President."""
- And so shall I.
So what?
So what?
So what?
Non ce l'hai un po 'di roba?
"Your lovely brothers Simon and Edgar, for example?"
"Are too high, we do not reach."
"- Yes, at 5 am, Edgar is the white Rue Lénine a Charenteuil ..."
- It's on us.
None of the stuff?
"Company ""Avvenire and Health"", at 12th"
"Do not fear, not sanguinerà forever."
I am in the habit!
Stop!
"Company ""The future and health""."
The joke that we do that will put a new license plate:
"""Past and cancer."""
"Come on, parties, burn!"
Even you.
"My brother Leon, then Mickey Venini and Edgar ..."
It is doing this Venini?
It is a panzone Cosetta with or with the things?
I see no uniforms!
It is the director of the company buildings.
I am in business with him.
Your business shit!
Ti cages and you believe in the system?
"You saying, you do not have dignity!"
Affecting the family business?
Are you sick of paranoia!
I want the recipe.
"It's too complicated for you, will never understand."
What I can not understand?
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser, just hang on."
We're gonna get you off that thing.
"No, you're not."
Let me help you.
You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh, I know."
Just can't see from up there.
"So what I told you on the phone, that help you catch him?"
Windward Elementary.
So I was right.
Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb, ""Twin Tree"" clue, you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'll be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news, just give it to me straight."
He modified it.
I'm gonna have to improvise.
Modified it how?
How?
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
-You could do it yourself.
"-No, I couldn't."
"I'd need Church approval, and that's rarely given."
Could you see her?
"Yes, I could."
I could see her as a psychiatrist--
Not a psychiatrist!
She needs a priest!
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you !
Are you gonna send me back to them?
"Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
You don't understand--
Can't you help her?
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I am the devil.
Now kindly undo these straps.
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
- You should be afraid.
I can't allow you...
I don't care about the timeline.
You're taking me back now.
"Look, Sara, I'm sure there's a valid reason why Rip didn't..."
Stay out of this!
"What the hell, Rip?"
"Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance to sleep it off."
"Not to dismiss what just happened, but we do have to find Savage, assuming that Kendra and Carter are still on his timeship."
- He could...
- Be anywhere in time and space.
"Oh, well that narrows it down a lot."
Sorry.
Was this always over here?
"No, it lives over..."
- Did you put it there?
"- Nah, man."
- Did you?
"- Dude, it's just a helmet."
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?
"Temporal changes can, on occasion, reverberate through the timeline, physically moving an object from one place to another."
- Gideon?
"- Yes, Captain."
"Plot a course for Saint-Lô, France, 1944."
Why then?
Because that's where Kendra is.
How is that possible?
She sent us a message through time.
"Go ahead, say it."
Astonishing.
Oh.
"Second, you're lookout only."
You're not goin' inside.
Can't he be lookout?
It's fine.
"Actually, yeah, can he be lookout?"
I'm not done.
"Last, you need to respect my leadership skills."
"I'm the leader, okay, and you need to treat me accordingly."
"You realize that real leaders don't tell others they have leadership skills, but you got-"
"- You sure about that, man?"
"I mean, this is my heist, right?"
This is just a robbery.
"Look, this is your heist, you're the leader and I respect your leadership skills."
"Too late, homie."
All right.
All right.
You can come along on the heist.
It's not a heist.
Thank you.
"Hey, all right."
"Yeah, okay."
Thank you.
Yeah.
It means a lot.
You guys hear me okay?
Yep.
Clear up here.
All right.
Be back in a minute.
"All right, guys, let me show you how the big boys do it."
I'm buyin' boobs.
What are you gonna get?
"Not hang him to ""death""."
"Now, he has been hung."
"So, you should set him free now."
That's cavil at words!
"Your Honour, law is law."
Not even one letter should be amended.
"Now, I can't help you."
Your Honour!
Think before you speak.
"Otherwise, you will lose the face of British government."
And you may be charged with murdering.
I want an urgent meeting first.
"Alright, back to your work."
You are all nuts!
Get lost.
It's my time!
The final decision of the court has been reached.
The penalty has been carried out.
Ho Foon is free now.
Bravo!
I'm free.
"Ho Chung, you are under arrest, you are charged with murder."
Brother Foon.
Lotus.
"My dear baby, your sudden appearance... makes me feel excited..."
Closer...
I am ready.
Alright?
"We are going to take the bridal pictures, we should be a bit serious, is that right, hubby?"
"Well, look at me!"
More serious!
Bravo!
Are you building a case to keep Brandon away from me?
No.
What are you... ?
Then why are you pumping Dani for information?
"You know I fell off the wagon, why not just come to me, Stef?"
I wasn't pumping Dani for...
"You didn't just drink, Mike, you got into a fight."
- You had blood on your hands.
- So what?
You afraid I'm gonna hurt Brandon or something?
"No, Mike, I'm worried about you."
I'm fine.
Ok?
- I'm getting it together.
- Where'd the blood come from?
It's stupid.
I got into a fight.
At the bar.
"Some guy was bothering the waitress, and..."
I must have broke his nose.
It was bleeding like crazy.
So you did...
So you didn't see Ana that night?
Is that what this is about?
You think it was her blood?
"You were so mad at her, Mike."
"Which is why I stayed away, just like we talked about."
"Yeah, you didn't talk to her?"
You didn't see her at all?
You didn't try and scare her off so she wouldn't turn Brandon in... ?
"Stef, I swear."
"I did not talk to Ana,"
Lance Corporal James Finn.
Stationed at Quantico.
Went UA when his unit was shipped to Iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
DUCKY:
"It won't be far, McGee."
"Had the trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay, I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to sketch itself.
Ow!
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney, Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes, Doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene, or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh, you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Although the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"Oh, geez!"
Hello.
Sorry...
Nicrophorus americanus.
"Also known as ""the carrion beetle."""
"In here, you little monkey."
Yes.
A reminder that Shakespeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
Kike.
Did you hurt my baby?
"No, I..."
You son of a bitch.
"What did you do, where is he?"
Where is he?
I don't know!
You're going to find him.
"As God is my witness, you are going to find him."
"Yes... yes, you!"
"I'll call the police, I swear to God."
I swear to God I will throw you back in that cage
If you don't bring my baby home.
"Baby, how the fuck am I supposed to know"
Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck.
"I don't give a fuck, you will figure it out."
"Go, go, go!"
"Okay, okay."
"Fuck, I'm ready to go inside and get in shape."
I think my baby girl is in for a treat tonight.
"(Man) Yo, that's the shorty that wanted me to wifey it up,"
But she let the next nigga hit it.
"I was like, ""How you want me to wifey it up"""
"And you let dude hit?"""
"Shit, that's why you can't trust these bitches, man."
"(Pete) Can't trust niggas, neither, man."
"Yo, she even got the name ""Danny"" tattooed on her pussy,"
"But I don't know if it was for me,"
"'Cause that nigga's named Danny, too."
(Laughing)
- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
I just run into things.
You don't really feel them till you get offstage.
Hey... can you put that on pause?
Yes?
No?
Yeah!
Of course.
"First, it sounds loud but then after a half hour it's not so loud, you know?"
"And after, like, three quarter of an hour, it's not loud enough, you know?"
"I think the lyrics to some of that stuff that ""Are you with..."""
It was so smart... so fucking smart...
It's nice just rocking.
But it's rock and smart.
That's to me like at the...
"Great time...man, that's just so good to see someone doing that."
"If that's not what it is all about, I don't know what it is."
Hello.
I know in speaking English but I like the group.
"Thank you the pictures, thank you everyday."
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
Head's up!
Dave!
Dave!
Dave!
Yeah!
"1, 2, 3..."
Nail it!
The chair!
What do you guys shooting at?
"Exit sign, why?"
"Come on, Buzz..."
"Dude, please, just one..."
You'll get hurt.
"Tell that to the governor, will you?"
"Hey, give me that."
"Never mind, Ponch."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Will be with you in a minute, okay?"
You can't write her a citation.
I can write her three citations for what she did.
You can't write her.
She's angry.
She's angry at us.
She's angry at the itsy-bit...
The signs.
She's angry with the state.
"She won't sign the ticket, she just..."
She won't accept it.
"Hey, the kid, huh?"
I can tell.
Okay?
- I'll hook her up and take her down.
- Take her down.
What you gonna do?
Tow her in?
That's gonna do a lot to beef up your arrest record.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Until we have time to do something about those signs maybe you can be a little more careful, okay?"
"Now, if you could just slide over."
"Nice Officer Poncherello will help you turn around, okay?"
You be careful now.
We don't want to get hurt.
She gave me a cookie.
But it's for you.
Only place I didn't try was the men's room.
- You try Munch's cell?
- Yeah.
No answer.
"You know, Dr. Swan had to make sure Kyle and the donor were okay."
Maybe there's a problem.
Come on.
What the hell is going on here?
"Casey, take Ms. Solwey out to the car."
Leave her out of this!
We didn't drag her into this.
"John, relax."
Relax.
Why'd you bring her here?
Amy's next on the transplant list.
That kidney would've been hers anyway.
"You're doing what we're trying to stop, John."
That kidney was bought and sold.
So let's just throw it away.
She dies.
I know that you care about her.
But you can't do this.
- If that was your son in there...
- It's not my son in there.
We're not talking about my son.
"When you collar James McGovern, you tell him your son's life is worth more than Kyle's."
"I gotta collar you, John."
You arranged this.
Novak saw you here.
You don't think Swan gonna give you up to get himself a better deal?
Why would I do that?
Did he ask you to put that kidney in Amy Solwey?
Give me 10 000 won.
How can there be a woman like you?
I'm not paying you.
You're not?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Wow!
Look at all these checks.
You don't need to tip.
Then...
I'm taking exactly 10 000 Won.
"I wish there was a subway station nearby, so I can change my clothes."
My hand phone!
I'm waiting for a phone call.
You...
Are you jealous?
Always asking me about my sponsor.
"If you're talking about money, I also have a lot of money."
I can surpass that old man completely.
The police have been secretly taking good care of him.
And he gives them a lot of bribes.
Bribes?
"The construction will receive bribes, we need some connection from inside, all the staff members take bribes."
Did you see it?
Did you see them taking money?
Hello.
There is a lady here asking for you to come to the parking lot.
She said her hand phone is in your car.
"Ah, she's crazy."
I don't know that woman.
I was the 10 000 Won person from earlier.
- What?
A fishy fin?
"- No, a Mickey Finn."
"Oh, Mumsie."
You and these Mickey Finns.
I'll have no peace until I get one from the nursing home.
What did you say?
The doctors use them on the violent patients.
Why didn't you say?
Why didn't I think of it?
- Get me some.
Plenty of them.
"- Mumsie, I was only joking."
Wait!
Sit down.
"Ethel, I have something very important to tell you."
You know how much my reputation as a writer and as a woman means to me.
"You're loved and respected the whole world over, Mumsie."
"Till now, yes."
"Ethel, many years ago, your father was in China."
Money was short.
"I was young, beautiful."
"It was easy, and so was..."
I fell by the wayside.
"So, you slipped, darling."
So do tons of people.
You found your feet again.
"For some months, I lost my head completely."
"Ethel, suppose someone found out and was threatening to expose me to the world."
What would you say?
I...
"I'd want to kill him, Mumsie."
"""without my Blue Ivy, girl."
"""'Cause I ain't trying to get leg burn."
"Boom, boom, hey!"""
"And, Black women, some of y'all do this."
What the hell is this?
It's like y'all trying to pull a conversation out the sky.
"You know like, ""Hey, my name's Tammy."
"""I work at Walgreens,"
"""and I make 7.25 an hour."
"Ain't nobody got time for that, hey."""
You seen this person before.
You be at the McDonald's.
"You be like, ""Excuse me."""
"Let me get a Big Mac, McChicken sandwich."""
"She come out with an attitude, just dancing."
"""Pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh!"
"""We ain't got no Big Macs, no McChicken sandwiches."
"""So Big Mac your ass out the front door."
"""Big Mac your ass out the front door."
"Surfboard, surfboard, graining on that wood."""
"Look at some of the white people like,"
"""Yeah, I fired somebody like that earlier this week."
"Won't have to worry about LaQuifa anymore."""
"White people and people in the corporate world,"
I love to see how y'all react to folks that come in the office with dreadlocks.
It's so funny.
'Cause y'all get nervous.
"As soon as you see 'em, you be..."
"""Uh..."
"Hello."""
"That means, ""What the hell are you doing here?"""
"""Uh..."
"I'm faster than you I've got more than ten ""daughters"""
What?
"I'm a ""ma ma san"""
"I love my ""daughters"""
Going shopping?
"Yes, chicken is cheap today"
Si Sun
Mr. Kwong
Buying vegetables?
Yes
How's Uncle Kwai?
He has to work late and won't be coming back tonight
Really?
I won't bother you then
Goodbye
You don't need to buy vegetables?
I've bought them
Who's that guy?
He looks handsome ls he your boyfriend?
You're doing better than me
"No, tell me or else I'll tell your husband"
So late?
I'm studying English
Drink it ls it chicken soup?
Where are all these lD cards from?
They're for you I've won them
There are so many women in Hong Kong who sell their id cards for the sake of gambling
"One day when I win the fight, I'll have everything not to mention id card"
I don't want it
Look at how bad this woman looks
She's a shame to our city
Put her to sleep
"-That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't wanna be the freak for once, Dean."
I wanna be normal.
"So taking a beating, that's normal?"
Any word from Dad?
[CELL PHONE BEEPS]
He called this morning.
"He said he's going to be another week, at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
[STUDENTS CHATTERING]
"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
"Um, I'll wait for you outside."
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
"You know this assignment was nonfiction, right?"
"Yes, Mr. Wyatt."
"So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh?"
"Why would you write something like this, Sam?"
It doesn't matter.
"As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving."
-So you can flunk me if you want to.
-I'm not flunking you.
I'm giving you an A.
Aside from the werewolf is that really how you describe your family?
Yeah.
Did he hang himself?
No... he goofed it up.
He...
The rain.
What's up with you?
Soft in the head?
Did you get lost?
Yes.
"Here, with you."
"It's not like in the movies or in books, where everything is precise, thought-out, organized... with a clear-cut goal."
"Everything's chaos, chance... pain... disorder..."
"Still, my way of putting things in order is to get them, one by one, my mother's lovers."
There's one left.
Do you want me to tell?
No.
What for?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There's only a war.
Listen.
I can't hear anything.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
"You're gliding too high, friend."
You're gonna crawl back.
I won't cushion your descent.
You're overdosing.
"If I were human, I'd waste you here and now."
I'm not going to be human.
I won't go back on my word.
"I wouldn't want to hurry you, but theaters run on precise timetables."
Go betweens too.
"Come on, then."
You know I didn't mean it.
You can go.
"All sorted, Sir H."
Ready to record when you are.
"Thank you, Lionel."
Now.
This... hears everything and forgives nothing.
It is a cruel mistress.
We can have no mistakes.
Perfection only will do.
"Complete clarity, total concentration!"
"And of course, a lovely, happy sound."
"Pauline, go and phone the coffee order through."
Right.
What was I supposed to say?
"Yeah, you're right, fatso, we have it away every Tuesday?"
Bloody idiot.
Is he a drinker?
Huh.
You don't want to bother with him.
I do want to bother with him.
Pauline!
Do you want this hand cream?
Atrixo?
"Lovely, thanks."
"No, don't be like that, Enid."
"Honestly, in bed, between you and Moira, well, no contest."
"You might want to switch off the intercom, Malcolm."
Oh...
"Oh, good."
A critique on my sex life has gone through to everyone in planning.
"Bye, dad."
"Hey, I already know where I'm going to hang this."
Dad?
Yeah.
"What, Sarah?"
What is it?
I don't think I wanna go.
"Hey, what is this?"
What're you trying to do here?
I just came to say hello.
No need to get testy.
You and I both know I cannot change Sarah's path.
I can't influence her to make a different decision.
"I can't this, I can't that."
"It's all about you, isn't it?"
What?
Wonder why that is.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"Where's Sarah in this equation, Tom?"
You're not making the choice.
She is.
"Come on, that is pure semantics, and you know it."
The only reason that she's changing her mind is because I'm a different person.
"So, you know what?"
"Actually, yes, it has everything to do with me."
"Hey, dad, what's going on?"
Nothing.
"Oh, I was just describing to the officer about my wallet, my lost wallet."
"So, thank you, officer."
"Well, we'll be sure to put every resource we have on this, just for you."
Let's go.
Marjorie?
"Why you put up ""Sold""?"
Because it is sold to another party.
"A shoe company, Axel."
"They wanted a bigger area, but--"
No.
You cannot.
Now you listen to me.
I warned you I couldn't wait.
"I'd be a fool to, particularly after that check bounced."
Like I told the church committee--
"Wait, wait."
Bounced?
What check bounced?
"That personal check for 50,000 from Somers."
"I wanted to tell you about it the day I talked to you, but she didn't want me to."
She?
Your friend from Beverly Hills.
"Axel, I know Miss Morrow's done quite a good promotion job."
At least she sure did sweep everybody around here off their feet.
"If you got something inside, say it."
Don't make up the words.
I tried to get hold of her all day.
Best I could do was a lot of messages she was tied up someplace.
"Tied up, my foot."
My wife saw her car parked at a bar down the highway not more than two hours ago.
- Where?
- Outside a motel.
The Windmill Inn.
## [loud jazz]
Lars!
Lars!
Come here quick!
Come on in.
"Hey, you want a beer?"
Or an apple martini?
"Oh, that's funny."
[ALEX LAUGHS]
Have you told your parents?
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.
By pretending to be gay?
"No, by being more gay-friendly."
"Or, in real estate terms, ""gay-adjacent."""
Nice.
I'm gonna use that.
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.
I don't know.
"Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you I think you can pull it off."
"It's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag."
I have slept with her.
"It's just she, you know..."
Won't sleep with you anymore.
"Pretty much, yeah."
What do you think?
"I think you got a problem because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man."
Holy shit.
Observe your breath.
"Inhale, belly rise."
"And exhale, belly fall."
Bring your hands together in front of your chest.
Bow your head in gratitude.
- Namaste.
- Namaste.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Do you want to go get a drink?
"- No, I'd better not."
- Want to grab a bite to eat?
"- No, I'm not hungry."
- Want me to take you home?
- Okay.
"- Good to see you, Henry."
"- But Greg, you said..."
"Bye, Henry."
"- Candy, don't leave."
- That was great.
I thought you were gonna stay.
"Well, we're done."
Is my shoe here?
"Well, Candy, I still have feelings for you."
But I dumped you for another man.
How could you still have feelings for me?
"- Besides, I'm still sort of with Paul."
- I thought that was over.
"Well, he was cheating on me."
I guess I wanted to feel better about myself before I see him tomorrow night.
That's why you're here?
"Well, yeah."
"Look, you were always such a nice guy, but let's face it, we have nothing in common except sex and the fact that you idolize me."
I really do care for you.
Really.
I just can't wind up with you.
Can I call you sometime?
What for?
"- Rose, are you going, or what?"
-So of course you'll take it.
-I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
-Michael.
-Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
-About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
-And what were they?
"Well, Michael, I've lied for so long."
"I was everything you said, specially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you could've never wanted me.
-I had no right to say those things.
"-Yes, you did."
-And I'm here to tell you the truth.
-You don't owe me explanations.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide... but because she hated me.
She won't answer my letters or phone calls.
Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
-She told me Allison and Norman...
-I know about the phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"And, without thinking, when Allison returned I told her some terrible things."
-What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- How about your legs?
- No.
I can't feel them.
"Gallant, need a hand here."
We' re talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?
I'm on Psych rotation.
I really shouldn't be helping you.
"- Haleh, this is a dead body."
- You ought to go to med school.
Can't take her to the morgue yet.
We' re waiting on family.
Why am I not exploding?
No movement below the umbilicus.
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?
You might have bruising to your spinal cord.
"I need 30 mgs per kilo of methylprednisolone, IV bolus."
- Where the hell's X-ray?
- Behind you.
Start with the chest.
- Please.
I need Ricky.
"- Stay with us, Alma."
"Entry wound, left mid-sternocleidomastoid with a large hematoma."
There's blood behind the ear as well.
Be nice to hear about that ultrasound.
Morrison's is dry.
The pericolic gutters look good.
- Bladder is-
I even tracked down Mrs. Klinger.
"FYI, if you want some vodka, get it now."
"And, uh... here is... a first edition of Charlotte's Web, which I believe was your favorite book from that year."
Can I see you for a moment?
Excuse us.
I can't take it anymore.
"I know you love me, I do, but I am drowning in it."
"Sweetie, I think we-"
Shh!
Who does this?
It's like...
"On our birthdays, I got you a sweater."
You had a plane skywriting for me-
"Seriously, this just-"
Shh!
And it's not just the big days.
It's every day.
Cute little notes under my pillow.
And in the refrigerator.
And in my diaphragm case.
"Oh, I-"
It is too much.
And I don't think there is a woman in the world who would disagree with me!
"God, I would."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, but..."
I
- I'm sorry.
It's-but
"- Everything you just said sounded really, really nice."
"I mean, seriously, if I had someone doing amazing, travagant things for me every day, I"
- I think I'd just shut up.
I travels promptly if I notice that I embarrass you in anything.
I travels promptly if I notice that I embarrass you in anything.
You think of yourself only.
"And...and you do not think about the colds, the big famishing winter coming."
- And...the wind will blow.
- And the partisans come then.
"-There is a knife in their belt, there is a knife in their mouth."
- And what there will be with our Gyula?
- Daddy...
- My sweet good Lajos.
Will be so good...major lord?
Yeah.
"To dream better one neither maybe, dear Tót."
"If a snake gobbles up himself, /what is a curio/ remain his after a snake greatness space?"
- Hello Lajos.
- Here the fire chief!
- Hurray the fire chief!
- Daddy do not bellow!
- Hurray fire chief!
- Shut up!
And the major lord!
Hurray major lord!
It is not necessary to support me.
Stop!
Airplane!
Get down!
He sleeps.
Go away.
Go children.
Go.
You.
Major lord!
Unbelievable.
That was one of the things that he had:
enormous trust in young people.
Lou put me in charge and gave me his checkbook.
"And he said, you know, ""You distribute the fees."""
And I grew a beard because I wanted to look older.
I'm serious.
How old were you when Lou died?
- I was 11.
- That's what I thought.
"- I was 11, yeah."
- Did you know him well?
- I have a sense for him.
- Right.
"And I saw him, you know, once a week, maybe."
"- That's all, though?"
"- That's about all, yeah."
"- Did you ever travel with him, or..."
"- No, no."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you, because you spent a lot of time with him."
"- Oh, yeah, me and my family did."
- Your family did too?
"He used to spend Christmas with us, yeah."
- He spent Christmas with you?
"- He loved Christmas, yeah."
He absolutely loved it.
"I can remember him lying on our bed watching cartoons with the kids... and then falling asleep, you know?"
"They'd just say,"
"""Lou's sound asleep, Daddy."""
"That's when we'll leave... ""You know, leave him be."
"He's tired."""
"Lou was very willful, you see?"
- Can we take that as a yes?
- No.
Everything eventually registers.
He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.
- Days?
- Days.
"Hey, is Jackson in the house?"
Let me hear you say...
- A new toy.
- Shameless.
- How's it going?
- I hate these books.
Hate them.
No.
See that?
They're trying to escape.
"They hate me, too."
Your books don't hate you.
"Rory, my brain is full."
It has reached capacity.
It's Shea Stadium when the Beatles played.
"It's cramped, girls are screaming, and George is fighting with Ringo."
- You have a very active head.
- I cannot ingest any more information.
- Take a break.
- I don't have time.
"Close your eyes, clear your head."
Clearing my head just means that... all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out.
"In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff."
It's a very vicious circle.
I'll make some coffee.
- I hate finals.
That's the reason why they hate me.
Petreius:
Why do you stay with me?
Why don't you simply leave me to my solitude?
"Because I love you, like my own son."
You love me?
Like your son?
"I love you, too!"
Where are you?
I can live with the election of Claudius Tiberius but he must restore all our privileges.
Don't worry.
Claudius will do anything we want.
But we still didn't solve one problem:...
Who is going to kill Caligula?
And how will it happen?
I'll take care of this problem.
I know who is going to kill Caligula.
Who will kill that monster!
Checkmate.
What news of marathon?
Will Greece be saved?
The Persian sun will pass.
my brave heart.
"Stop it, Daddy, stop it."
"Hey, Dad, come on upstairs and we can play my new electronic game I bought."
"Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy."
"Oh, come on."
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?
"- Well, I just don't."
mom could play with us.
With your best friends as an escort.
- Why is he here?
- Ogawa?
That guy makes me itch.
"Well, the Japanese want their tsuba back."
"With the sword gone, it's all that's left of a national treasure."
Don't worry.
They're leaving tonight for Japan.
"By tomorrow, the tsuba will be on the other side of the planet."
"By the way, just to ask it, who did give you that file on Artie?"
That's my secret to keep.
"Cooper, see that they get on their plane."
No detours.
"Yeah, and--and don't rule out shooting them if necessary."
What's going on?
What?
It's Ogawa. it was him at the embassy.
He walked out with the sword.
- Are you sure?
"- Myka, I saw him."
You have to trust me.
Dickinson looked at him when I asked him about the file.
Artie was right.
"Yeah, and now he's got the sword and the tsuba."
Heading for the diplomatic terminal.
There's no security.
"How about you both just take a time-out, huh?"
Just for the drive to Dulles.
Let's go.
Bored?
Yeah.
"Oh, finally."
Bad leg?
You haven't got any skill in your fingers.
"How's your castaway getting along then, Doctor?"
"Pretty bashed about a bit, actually, Jon."
God knows where he came from.
Bugger doesn't speak a word of English.
"He isn't from around here, that's for sure."
[Men laughing]
"Christ Almighty, Lukey!"
What the hell's the matter with thee?
[Ursula]:
When did Dr. Mead say he'd be here?
When he's finished his surgery.
So what do people from Poland have for breakfast?
Probably some awful kind of sausage.
But I'm sure porridge will do him much more good.
We'll soon find out.
Nothing wrong with his appetite.
- Glad to hear it.
Are the sisters of mercy in attendance?
"Yes, we are."
"Good morning, Doctor."
Shall we go up?
"Morning, Janet."
I'm glad to see that bruise.
"Doesn't look very pretty, but better it's there than not."
"Eh, nurse?"
What's his temperature?
- It's a little over.
Make sure he drinks lots of water.
"So, Polish, is he?"
It would appear so.
But i ain't got the money to pay it.
Josie... nick... she's a gilt-edged corporation.
"Mr. Boyd, we can get through to the hospital now."
I got a carriage for the colonel.
"No, i don't want any carriage."
Got a golden chariot comin' for me.
I wonder if those gates are really made of gold.
"Right, then."
Go straight to the office...
Don't dawdle on the way
Don't worry
I'll call in 30 minutes to check
"Oh, hello Fujio"
"Is your mother here, too?"
Why are you outside?
It's no fun listening to women's talk
"Well, why don't we go in together?"
I'm fine out here
"Right, you wait out here"
Aunty!
Tell mom...
"If she's not out soon, I'm leaving!"
I'll tell her
Mrs. Ishino has arrived
Good
Welcome
Please come in
I hope you're well
Been here long?
A little while
"You're very pretty, today"
Average?
And speed and endurance of a questionable nature.
Shoot!
"Now there's no way this specimen could complete, let alone compete in, the Iron Man competition... unless..."
Let me guess.
"Well, unless what?"
"Your boy gets a first-class, knowledgeable, certified trainer to guide him to a winning body."
"Yeah, but where do I get that?"
"I mean, a dude like that's gotta cost big bucks."
"Not a dude, T.C."
"A ""dudette."" Am I right, Barbara?"
"Modestly, yes."
The pride of Bayonne.
The top instructor at the Firmer Body in Ten Days Figure Salon.
"And in return for my services, Magnum continues to search for Roger... and then runs the Iron Man to pay his debts to you."
Deal?
You got it.
No!
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And breathe.
And a one and a two and a breathe.
"Good morning, Barbara."
Very subtle.
You're wasting your time.
I don't want to play.
"Oh, now, Magnum."
"Now, the secret here, you see, is knees to chest."
Knees to chest.
Try it.
Now...
"I am heading for a swim, and when I get back, Barbara..."
"Oh, God, can't you help her?"
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the devil.
"Now, kindly undo these straps."
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother's in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?
Thank you.
"Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good."
Nothing you could do could make it any worse.
I can't do it.
I need evidence that the Church would accept...
-...as signs of possession.
All right.
Do your ears.
One at a time.
"Okay, bend your heads over, shake them out with your fingers."
Put your hands above your head.
Hands out in front of you.
Over.
Move those fingers.
Reach down and lift up your nut sack.
"Drop your nut sacks, and skin back your dick."
Turn around.
"One foot at a time, pick it up and wiggle the toes."
Other foot.
"Bend over, grab your ass, spread your cheeks and give me two good coughs."
(MEN COUGHING)
Stand right there.
julie:
You're like two people.
Inmate Montoya Santana?
One is like a kid.
Doesn't know how to dance.
Step this way.
Doesn't know how to make love.
That's the one I cared about.
Step inside.
But the other one...
The other one I hate.
"Τhe one who knows, the one who has his rap down, who knows how to run drugs."
Who kills people!
SANΤANA:
"Until now, I would've thought it a sign of weakness to even listen to what you said to me that night."
But I see that you were right.
Ha!
That's all from mini-golf right there.
No lessons.
Can you believe it?
"I don't know what you think you're doing here, but..."
I was just starting to count the number of your fingers
I'm gonna break.
Get it?
You know what?
"I'm not too good at math, so I might lose count here."
Wait.
Ah!
He paid me.
A lot of money.
- For what?
"- To make up test results, phony prescriptions, medical bills."
- Why?
- I don't know.
You know who your father is.
I didn't ask questions.
I did it as I was told to do.
He came to me with a lot of cash.
"He said he needed a terminal illness, so I gave him one."
Ah!
"Jesus, Victor."
We need to get something straight about this partnership.
I'm in charge here.
- You work for me.
- Okay.
"Every decision about this party has been made for a reason, so before you go unwinding my hard work,"
- you might want to get...
- What the hell are you
EZRA:
Josiah.
So you have any biblical parables on hand for unrepentant grifters?
No.
-Someone here to see you.
travis:
"Mrs. Standish, I presume."
-l'm Judge Travis.
-My goodness.
You are even more impressive than your reputation.
Yeah?
Well... .
My daughter-in-law believes that Mr. Wingo's charges may be false.
I wanna know why Mr. Wingo would cause...
... hisproperty to be discovered on you.
Well?
What will happen to me if I'm found guilty?
-Are you saying the charges are true?
-Definitely not.
travis:
"Madam, get yourself in hand."
Mr. Jackson's going on trial for murder.
I don't have any time for horseplay.
Mr. Wingo is adamant that you stole his property.
And you are equally adamant that you did not.
"I wanna know the truth, and I wanna know it quickly."
"Ezra, are you acting as my attorney or not?"
Not so long as you leave me in the dark.
"Ezra, take care of this."
I got a trial to convene.
Good day.
"My, my, my, judge."
You should've called me yesterday.
Who the hell is this person you're meeting?
"Okay, can I ask you a favor then?"
Can I bring my girlfriend along?
- Girlfriend?
- Yes.
You want to take your girlfriend?
We were supposed to go on a date today.
"Sure, fine then."
Then I'll be right back.
"I'll go tidy things up a bit, and I need to call her."
"Alright, what time then?"
- How about two?
- Two?
"Okay, two then."
Hold on.
- Hello?
"- Director Kim, it's me."
- How are you?
"- Fine, of course."
Did you happen to read the paper this morning?
It said that a film director named Kim died in a car accident.
And so I called just in case.
I felt awful because of that.
So you're alright?
That was in the morning paper?
Interesting.
"- Anyhow, I wonder who it was."
"- Someone, I guess."
"- So, is the script almost done?"
"- Uh, well..."
"Actually, I was just taking off to somewhere quiet to work on it."
- You may.
- Now we're talking.
I'll start here.
This is good.
Can you tell me why grandma married the 4 of them?
Mrs. Maria Cecilia always liked to pick her husbands.
She also liked to boss them around.
She was so bossy that they all left.
"The one she really, truly loved was the one over there, with the mustache."
Maybe because he was the one who picked her.
"Soon enough, she got bossy."
"Told him to get rid of the mustache and told him to stop working, which he didn't like."
"When he left her, he said:"
"""I'll come back when you quit bossing me around!"""
Mrs. Maria Cecilia got really sad.
"She decided that from that point on, she'd care only for her granddaughter."
"Only her, and no one else."
Me?
- You.
Can I have some more?
- Sure.
Are you okay?
Wake up!
Say something!
Wake up!
Grandma!
Say something.
"What's the matter, darling?"
My present died.
- How come?
- She ate too much.
"She never had enough to eat, but there was too much here."
Eh?
Aw!
Christ!
A dead sheep?
Hm.
Not strictly Russian ?
", but certainly can't live on crusts and straps."
So I'm going to roll it up and make him some bowl.
Lucky fellow.
"Well perhaps your sister would like to start feeding me too, unless of course you actually found me some work."
So.

[Dan] The search is over.
The winneroflast month's $6.4 million lottery jackpot... has finally stepped forward.
She's a waitress at a local Denny's right here in Harrisburg.
Pennsylvania's newest multimillionaire is Wendy Fawcett.
Thankyou so much!
I don't know what to say.
I've never won anything before in my life.
"[ Woman ] Wendy, what are you gonna do with the money?"
I'm going to put some in savings and some of it in checking.
And the rest I'll be sharing with a good friend.
- And who's that?
- I'm not telling you!
[ Cackling ]
"And we're giving a lot of it away to the Big Brothers, the Sunshiny Day Club, Asthma..."
- [Man] Do you have asthma?
"The AST, the ALT..."
It's eight times over normal.
Yeah.
He was doing so well.
He said his last scan was clear.
I did a flawless job on that glioblastoma.
I can't help it if the damn thing had already spread.
The LFTs suggest metastasis to the liver.
God.
Never even got a chance to start the antiviral protocol.
I just wish I wouldn't have held out that hope.
He's gonna go fast.
"So, uh..."
Who's gonna tell him?
Oh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'll be back to check on you.
"Yeah, I know, I know..."
Low platelets.
I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.
When's the transfusion?
"Well, just say it."
Your LFTs were through the roof.
You're sure?
We'll do an abdominal sonogram just to be certain.
Cancer has spread to my liver.
Yes.
How long do you think I've got?
Not long.
- We'll make you as comfortable as possible.
"- No, no, no, no, no, no,"
I can't believe it.
-She--
-You don't think a psychiatrist...?
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"-Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
-Yeah.
So in the meantime try not to worry.
How?
"The edema affected her brain, you understand?"
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, talking to the radio."
-You should've called me when it happened.
-Listen.
Regular hospital not gonna put up with that.
"We give her a shot and bring her here until the doctors fix up her leg, then we take her right out."
"Two or three months and she's out, good as new."
-Miss?
-Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.
-Are you a relative?
"-Yes, I am her brother."
He is her son.
Just a minute.
"You know, it's funny."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of there."
"You go in, Dimmy."
I'll wait for you outside.
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"There's lore about spirits possessing people, riding them."
"Whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative, well, that's super."
[EMF METER WHINING]
SAM:
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here ghosty, ghosty, ghosty."
"-Come out, come out, wherever you are."
-I don't get it.
No one ever died on this bus.
It's not like there's a body here.
"But a flap of skin, a hair-- Hell, a hangnail--"
Something's gotta be tying the ghost to this place.
We gotta find it.
SAM:
Yeah.
"Got a new driving permit, issued two weeks ago."
[CLICKS OFF EMF METER]
-Just before the first attack.
-Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk MacGregor Sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
-MacGregor?
-Yeah.
What?
I knew his son.
"All tourists, all registered with that stupid odd jobs app."
"Oh, yeah?"
Wow.
"God, that's crazy."
"Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you, it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper."
"Okay, okay."
Alright.
"- Well, if your story's true..."
- Cooper.
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?
How'd you know where I am?
"It's a games company, I looked up the address."
"Yeah, really?"
"No, no, no, no."
How'd you find me here?
This place.
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?
"Yeah, with your GPS on your phone."
Find My Friends.
Find My Friends?
"That would've worked, but they took my phone."
"And it's in a building, like, a mile away."
"So, yeah, nice try."
That's right.
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity that!
"Look, all I'm saying is that"
"I think that you could've come up with a better story, it could have been funny or..."
"Okay, alright, don't be pissed."
Do you ever wonder how your bank account got hacked?
- Okay.
Where you going?
- Subway.
- I thought we were gonna walk.
It's 15 blocks.
"Come on, I think you'll like it."
- Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
- You are so an out-of-towner.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm one of the graduates.
Wow.
You're hours early.
I just wanted to beat traffic... and have time to get ready and relax and also I've heard... the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains.
- This is true.
Take your pick.
- Thank you.
This is so exciting.
Isn't this exciting?
This is my eighth year of doing this.
So not so exciting for you.
Got it.
You're being so cryptic.
Do you need a power source or not?
My batteries are all fully charged.
It just depends on how fast they deplete.
- So we need one just in case.
- Mom.
"Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony."
What are you doing here?
"I'm sorry, what are you doing here?"
How do you even know about this?
- Yes.
"""owns extensive properties in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk."""
"""Cedar Chase has been the family seat since the 17th century."""
"""The grounds..."""
"""include a private lake and several hundred acres of manageable land."""
"Bugger me, they're loaded."
What's this sudden obsession with money?
It's not like any of us are paupers.
"Well, El's father filed for bankruptcy over the summer."
Shit!
I'm so sorry.
"Doesn't buy you happiness though, right?"
"I mean, look at Mr. Gimp, case in point."
"Oh, he's all right."
He's kinda cute.
"In a sweaty, loser kind of way."
"Uh, I know he brings out the maternal in you girls or something, but honestly, I think..."
I think he's a creep.
"Oh, you should write that in his birthday card."
"Did, uh, you just use the word ""maternal"" to describe me?"

Another war flick.
How boring.
How could you do this?
And you?
You are worse than a traitor.
You're a murderer who's going to kill all the people who won't be able to leave through this door anymore.
They promised to let me go to the future.
"We have you, fräulein."
We don't need him.
But what do you mean you can't come right now?
"Listen, this isn't a marching band that's coming, eh?"
"I want you in my office, now."
Espínola.
Espínola.
Espínola.
"It's gone dead, God."
Evacuation Order.
Have the agents return to their time periods and their homes.
Only essential staff and security.
"Yes, Sir."
And what do we do with Juan?
"-If you don't mind, take him to your house."
I'm staying here with you.
"-No, Angustias, you go home."
(Machine gun fire)
Well I think that I'm going to have to stay.
(Machine gun fire)
"Oh, thank God."
God and this wonderful machine.
You've got to hurry.
Lola is telling them about the Ministry.
To say that...
I love you   and that I don't want you to die and lots of other things...
Come over here.
I love you.
Shouldn't you hurry up?
They'll be here soon.
You look great.
Thank you.
"There, come on."
- Are you still up?
- It's skateboarding.
Is it skateboarding?
Is it exciting?
- Move!
- It's really exciting.
Move!
Then you have to go to bed in half an hour.
Sleep tight.
"Jorgen was a diplomat, so he was sent down there."
He sat down in the chair and he didn't say a word.
"Finally Baunsgaard asks, will they do it by 3   or will we have to pay overtime?"
"Jorgen said, you won't have to pay overtime at least."
I just fired all 42 of them.
This story gets better and better.
Last time it was 32.
"I don't know the cost in dollars and cents, but we almost went bankrupt."
But we had integrity.
"Integrity, Jorgen."
"- And cheers to that, Jorgen."
- Thanks.
Cheers.
- You're not drinking much tonight.
Love you too.
Bye.
Georgie?
What's gonna happen at the appointment tomorrow?
It'll be fine.
I called Clint and I left a message.
He knows us and he loves you.
Just be totally honest and nothing bad can happen.
"That hasn't always worked, even with Clint."
Look.
I know that you were disappointed when we asked your aunt Crystal to leave.
And I know that you wish things could've turned out differently.
No.
I don't.
Not anymore.
And I-I was just on the phone with Jeffie and he remembers Crystal.
My mom...
She didn't trust her and... she said she was a bad influence on us.
Come here.
"Everything's gonna be all right, okay?"
"Amy, honey, I thought you did a great job at that meeting today."
"Well, at least it was a step."
"Now that I can get close to Matt's horses, I can start to gentle them."
Yeah?
And how do you plan on doing that?
"Hopefully, right under Matt's nose, and then I'll find homes for them."
Great.
Hey.
"It's really beautiful out there, Amy."
You wanna go for a walk?
"You should, you should."
I'll-I'll put wood on the fire and keep it going till you get back.
Like John Garfield in Body and Soul.
Exactly.
John Garfield.
"People tell you that, Father?"
Do people tell you you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
"Well, you know this director who was doing the film here Burke Dennings?"
I've seen him.
You've seen him.
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
All of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
"Some rituals used in the black mass, maybe."
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"And please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M Street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
Didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
I'm up.
I'm up.
She don't want to believe that the boy is using drugs... but he comes home every day with bloodshot eyes... and then he eats everything in the kitchen.
She knows he didn't get those red eyes... from being in the library.
I hear the boy can't even read.
"Good morning, Mr. Moses."
What do you think?
"You think this is something, check this out."
What do you think?
"Look, girls, y'all just gonna have to wait in line."
"Mr. Moses, let's make a trade."
I'll trade you The Best of Wynton Marsalis... for Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday.
Never!
I would never give up any of my records for anything.
It would be like cutting off one of my hands.
"Jeff, you're right."
"Got to go younger, huh?"
Yeah.
I'm getting me girls on Soul Train.
"Have a good day, Mr. Moses."
"- Good morning, Mrs. Walker."
"- Morning, Jeff."
Thanks again for the tickets tonight for that show.
No... thank you.
When the Georgetown Three make it big...
"I'm going to say, ""Special thanks to Mrs. Walker..."
"""who let me slide on my rent when I didn't have it."
"""This Grammy's for you."""
Have a good day.
"Hey, Jeff, ready for tonight?"
You know I am.
First show's sold out.
It's complicated.
Can you trust her?
Yes.
Absolutely.
"And you can, too."
But you can't trust me with the truth?
"Oh, hang on."
"Alexis, that's not about trust."
I am your father.
"And from the day you came into this world, it's been my job to protect you."
[Sighs]
"So, what's our next move?"
There is no next move.
We let sleeping dogs lie.
"It's safer that way, for everyone."
"I'm really sorry to interrupt, but I think I found something."
- On Phillip's homicide?
- Yeah.
"I was going through Jordan Keegan's computer files, and I found something interesting."
It's a screenplay.
Mm.
"""Gemini Killers."""
"Yeah, it's a dreadful story about a serial-killing duo."
"Not sure, but it might give us some insight."
I've seen this before.
The script?
"No, the..."
the notes in the margins here...
This odd handwriting that...
I know who the killer is.
"No, I cannot hold."
I...
He's from nigeria.
Nice to meet you.
"Yeah, you, too."
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Well, at least"
One of the dubois women is happy in her work.
Bridgette loves working at the library.
She doesn't even mind the fact
That you can't really talk in there.
Will hate to see it end.
Meets all kinds of interesting people.
Even helped a nice young girl set up an e-mail account.
Hmm?
"Come on, bridgette dubois, librarian at large?"
Isn't that good for at least a smile?
Hmm.
"Well, I guess not."
"Hey, come on, I mean..."
"I just, I can't stand the thought of this monster getting away with this,"
"The thought of devalos losing his job, his license."
"Look, I know he made a mistake,"
"But the truth is, if that had been one of our daughters,"
I would've done the same thing.
I think he showed remarkable restraint
In not murdering the son of a bitch.
See?
It's easy.
Now you can write e-mails to whoever you want.
Wow.
Thanks.
You're a very smart kid.
You have to eat it.
What's this stink?
"The MiIanese brought it, it's all moldy."
- That's how you eat it.
- With mold?
"It's MiIanese cooking, refined, it's totally different."
"Not like us, we eat stuffed peppers."
Taste it.
Try it.
What's it like?
But stuffed peppers too...
How about a kiss?
- I don't think so.
- Gimme a kiss.
- You're hurting me.
- No kiss 'cause he's here?
problems?
"If anyone's got problems here, it's you, if you speak."
"tell yourma to buy somethin' black, she's gonna be in mourning'."
"Shut up, you moron, yourma stills brings you snacks."
Maybe you still don't get my type.
"Good boy, go inside."
That clown...
settle down!
"- You came on a new motorbike, huh?"
"- No, on foot."
What are you doing to my motorbike?
I'II take the personal responsibility to explain.
"You take the responsibility, huh?"
Let's take him inside.
careful.
It can't go on like this.
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
"Get out, sinister one!"
"Get out, terrible one!"
Away with you!
Away!
Get away!
Away!
Don't touch me!
- Go away!
Away!
Die!
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Have pity, dark one..."
"Look, isn't that the one who put your viola out of tune?"
There she is!
There she is!
You yourself are a devil's servant!
Profanity comes from your lips!
"Die, crumble away!"
Crumble away like ashes in the desert!
You are a devil with a tail and hair.
"Sisters, tear off his clothes!"
Trample him down!
Trample him down!
This woman is guilty of carnal intercourse with the Devil.
She is subject to the judgment of the inquisition.
She shall be tortured and then burned at the stake.

Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard the ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
No!
You take 'em!
And you stay with them till I send for you!
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
You lad.
Come here.
Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get.
So you go with him.
What will happen to the women?
You leave the women here.
It'll give Captain Taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those two men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on.
Who are you?
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the tree house.
But he's a savage.
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
It is already there!
"Were you there, Mrs Thielbacke?"
They called neither for me nor a doctor.
Well!
Hold it then!
My hands are so dirty.
"Come on, move!"
"Hold yourself straight, girl!"
What do I say if someone sees me?
That you've fetched your wages...
No hospital... is that at all doable?
"Well, there you see."
Isn't he a fine boy?
Didn't you also come into this world in your mother's bed?
But the due date was a long way off!
"Oh well, that's why I too didn't believe it when the pain sat in."
Then I would've called the doctor.
So you did it all alone...
A mother's soul
- All alone...
Bruno was there;
he helped me.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
I left the money and the papers in the car.
Bruno...
"Could I not return to Mrs Kunze, Bruno?"
Why do you ask questions?
"Nope, you'll stay with me for a couple of days!"
I'll find somewhere to sleep.
I've never been worried about that!
Oh my goodness... the bed!
"Instead of feeling sad thinking about silly past, I'm peaceful  happy now."
You bloody!
Sister!
What's this?
Have you gone mad?
Why are you bringing to our home?
What's your game?
My plan is...
Are you playing games?
May I tell you?
You fool!
Who are you?
Are you trying to play with me in India and my brother-in-law here?
Has he forgotten the past?
Is that why he didn't recognise me?
Hey Kick!
Now I got you in my hands.
"Give me some of your revenge, allow me to stay with him,"
I'll make him see stars in day time.
"One small request, don't tell anyone here about our story in India."
You too don't tell anyone about our plan.
Have you lost your memory?
Now I'll give you kick of the life.
Sleeping like a log.
I'll give him the shock of his life.
What's it Prakash?
Unable to sleep.
"Come, sleep."
- What happened?
- What's that?
This...
I hate any cloth on my body when I sleep except this blanket.
So you admit it's me.
Just tell me what you have.
The dead whiz kids... they all had one more thing in common other than their talents.
Otto.
He found a pattern.
They all applied to Seattle State University.
Kevin Whitfield apply?
Just like all the others.
You gonna talk to their admissions officer?
- Yeah.
I am.
- Good.
Take me with you.
The only other person that knows as much about this case as you is me.
"You came to me once, for help."
"I saw where it was going, I told you to drop it."
"And you did, and I just..."
Watched that eat away at you.
I was there.
I know it's you.
But if I say it out loud it means I'm either crazy or it's true.
You just said it out loud.
[Sighs shakil]
"Gracie and Helen, you don't tell them."
I do when it's time.
"Let's solve this case, Duval."
"When we get there, I do the questioning."
You don't talk.
They were so rare.
Each of them.
I remember some of their essays.
Who could want to take these lives?
- Do what?
You can't kill anyone.
What makes you think they'll let you?
They don't care about Lisa and Charlie now any more than we do.
It's all about Allie.
Then where are they?
We tried to pick up Lisa.
Lisa was helpless.
Allie can take care of herself.
Then what makes you think any of this will work?
I don't know if it's gonna work.
At least I'm not afraid to try.
"Mary, don't do this."
Listen to me.
I-I know this.
Walk away.
"Even if you lose the project, walk away... before you do something you can't walk away from."
MAN:
Here they come.
Why don't you just fade away?
You're a burden to the project.
"You don't have the stomach for it, and you don't have the brains."
You have no idea what I'm capable of?
What I've done?
I won't have any more blood on my hands.
Everybody set?
Get a tight lead on that subject.
Run away!
Take the little girl!
It's a trick!
Run!
It's a trick!
"If she hadn't crashed, she'd been gone anyway, so what's the diff?"
She might have come back?
"Well, we'll never know, will we?"
"So, spare me the pity party."
I am over it.
Morning.
Correct.
"So, that's it then?"
That's the story?
"Yeah, for now."
Because Big Mac doesn't want his family dirty laundry aired in public.
"Ah, no, because most of what people are saying is hearsay and we don't print hearsay, George."
But it just seems so...
Underwhelming?
Yes!
There is a life attached to that body.
"Well, not anymore, to be accurate."
"Which we are, George."
The facts.
"So, an unidentified woman..."
Which everyone knows is Trina!
She hasn't been formally identified yet.
"So, until then it is not a fact, it is gossip."
"We print news here, George."
News.
Siouxsie?
"Ah, Siouxsie, is Monty..."
"Right here, George."
"She's, er, processing her grief."
"Were her and Trina close, then?"
Not really.
Trina didn't really like kids.
And shut up.
"Right everyone, your work-experience placements have been finalised."
"And as 99% of you left it to the careers officer,"
I don't want to hear whingeing about where you're heading.
Sir.
There seems to be some mistake.
"Is the mistake you choosing to ignore me saying ""No whingeing""?"
"No, sir, it says here I'm going to work at a garage."
Yes.
Come on.
Me.
A garage?
- Does that seem likely?
- What's your point?
I wrote to the local paper.
To shadow a journalist there.
Maybe even write a few pieces myself.
"Right, let me have a look."
"I don't get paid extra for this, you know."
"OK, it says here that Sutherland is expected at the newspaper."
- Case closed.
"- Well, then there's clearly been some sort of mix-up."
I don't mean to be rude but  look at him.
- No offence.
- None taken.
"What was your first choice, Sutherland?"
Airplane driver.
- And that is...?
- Someone who drives planes.
- You mean a pilot.
- Do I?
- What was your second choice?
- Look where i'm pointing.
- 90 seconds!
90 seconds?
"Wait, no!"
I don't have a script.
"Excuse me, I never got a script."
There is no script.
This is the lottery.
"For the love of god, f there was script, we'd all be rich."
Amateurs.
"Captain, Lieutenant."
How's the investigation going?
"Well, we're just getting started."
"Spoke to the staff, the camera crew."
Everybody said they left the building after the show.
They usually do.
"Well, somebody was here."
The girl didn't stab herself.
You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail.
Some of them are pretty dicey.
"You know, personal."
I put them on top.
"I need quiet, everyone!"
New girl.
"New girl, you're on in five, four, three, two, and you're on."
Good evening... people.
Welcome to the big gold rush pick 6.
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Are you ready to play?
Then let's play... the lottery.
And the first number is...
Turn it on!
Saeko-san loves chocolate more than anything else.
That's why I will make chocolate that can make Saeko-san happy.
Saeko-san.
I know everything that Saeko-san likes.
High cocoa chocolate.
Strawberries.
Caramel ganache.
Orange peel.
Rum soaked raisins.
Light green pistachios.
Bright red kirsch soaked cherries.
Ah.
Does this silence mean that she's touched?
"No, it was a miss?"
Souta-kun.
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I can't accept this.
- Eh?
Because this is totally serious chocolate.
Eh?
Ah.
Did you think I'm a really serious guy?
"A guy making chocolate is really weird, right?"
"But, you know, my family is a cake shop, so making this sort of thing is no big deal."
"So, see, there's no deep meaning to this or anything."
There's someone I'm going out with.
Huh?
"- After Christmas,"
I got back together with my ex-boyfriend.
"Since he likes to travel around, I'd been neglected,"
I thought it would be fine when Souta-kun confessed.
"Never mind that, doctor."
Is the master okay now?
He's absolutely fine.
Aunty!
How will I...
Why are you making her cry?
Leave her alone.
"Ask the doctor when we can take the boss home, dear."
Today itself.
"And Dr. Rohit is around for help, too."
"Let's go home, uncle."
Get well soon.
We've got a lot to decide.
"No, Rohit."
"You're a good doctor, I know."
But let's leave it at that.
"What do you say, Laxmi?"
"Place some money in aunt's plate, grandpa."
"Why do I need to do that, dear?"
After all that she has done for us we ought to give her the keys of the family.
"Use keys on locks, sir."
Place some change in it now.
Treat that like a golden biscuit!
"Come on, sir..."
I'll take that.
"Coming, sir."
Did you call me?
"I've been alone for 20 years, after Lajwanti's death."
I have never missed female company in all these years.
"You have served me so well now, Lakshi!"
I don't think a wife would have taken so much of care!
See that?
"That's why I brought you along, just in case."
But we didn't come to fight.
We came to burn railroad bridges.
"If you don't like the plan, you're free to drop out now."
"If you come, you'll do it my way."
[train bell]
- Cloudin' over.
- Yeah.
Is it gonna rain?
Might could.
"It rains one minute, shines the next."
[conductor] All aboard!
[train whistle]
"- Good morning, conductor."
- Morning.
Didn't you get on at Marietta?
You're the one who saved Xiao-Mei.
We owe you a lot.
"Oh, that's just my duty, it's nothing."
"Drink up, come on Mr. Jeng."
You could help this old fool.
"Thirst and respect, huh?"
"Mr. Wu, why did you say you were a fool?"
(laughing)
"If I tell you son, you'll still never know why."
(laughing)
"Oh yes, I understand you."
"Well, I feel like"
"I'm half drunk and half sober, half of me is mad and half of me a fool."
"I work half a day, and I get half day's pay."
Everything is just half and half again.
"(laughing) Well then, you would be half an old bald head and half a young man,"
"Well, the hit I can take."
"It's the not swinging back, that's what bothers me."
"Standing up for the truth the way you did,"
It's what I've been telling the American people
I'm gonna do for them.
That's why I'm in this.
"John, I don't know what to say."
Stop trying to argue yourself out of a job.
What's up?
"Royo, it's me,"
Aisha.
It's about the deal.
"Isaac ain't gonna bitch out, is he?"
You said this was happening.
He's still in.
"But listen up,"
"I know you ain't down with the split, never have been."
- Maybe I can do better.
- You?
Money ain't coming in like it was.
"That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together."
"If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears."
You still there?
I'm here.
"Well, I'm still listening."
Good.
"Okay, he's got it."
"Oh, no."
- What?
- Locke signed in downstairs.
He was just bumped up to head of field ops.
He has a debrief scheduled with Mullins.
So if that bug hitched a ride on Aldo's body...
We need to call Booth.
"Uh, Brennan said Booth's busy."
"What, too busy to hear about this?"
"Trust me, it's important."
(crickets chirping)
Sergeant.
It's been a while.
"Yeah, too long."
I wish it was for a different occasion.
"Yeah, me, too."
"Who killed him, Seeley?"
"I don't know, Dave, but I'm gonna find out."
Need my help?
"No, I'm good."
"But either of you two, uh, ever hear from Aldo before he, uh, went missing?"
Not me.
He wasn't easy to find.
"All right, well, if you hear anything, just let me know."
"It's my job now to take care of things, okay?"
"Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait for that to happen."
"You know what, Ted, I'm not here to get into this with you right now."
This is about Aldo.
Guess that's what it takes-- one of us dying before he comes around here.
"Oh, come on, Ted, you know he had nothing to do with Father Clemens' murder."
Yeah.
What did Booth do to help him stay alive?
Not enough.
We all could have been more in touch with him.
DAVE:
He's the reason that we're all home.
"At least for me, I'm grateful."
Are you angry because I'm here all fine?
Is that why you're mad?
Ok!
You can miss exits.
How can you go that far?
Are you stupid?
Fine you can forget your phone.
But wasn't there a phone booth?
You could have called!
I didn't think I would go that far.
I didn't even know that I didn't have a phone.
Did you know that I was waiting for you?
"No, I don't."
Excuse me!
Who are you?
I said I'm sorry.
"I'm really sorry, I want to die ok?"
Why are you so angry?
Is this worth it?
Did I do it on purpose?
"You even missed planes, did you forget?"
-It's twice now.
-Three times!
-Were you counting?
-I was never late!
Because it's always on your schedule.
You don't even care about my schedule.
"Whenever you call and say 10 or 20 minutes, I always had to go even I was on the toilet."
"Even then there could be traffic, or something could be wrong with the car."
You can be late!
But I should be able to call you!
The performance is driving me nuts!
We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.
"Naik, detail 10 men for guard duty."
The remainder will pile arms and prepare for work.
Halt!
"Gunga Din, water."
"Gunga Din, bring water!"
Bring water!
Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
"So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?"
"- Salaam, sahib."
- Who are you?
What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
"Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children."
The children are looking bonny.
"Come on, everybody, in the other room."
"Go on, get up."
On the double.
Get in there.
You heard me!
Quick!
That's right.
Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
"- Trinkets, sahib."
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
"- Go on, open them up."
Who are these playful subjects here?
"Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
"No,"
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist.
The one wearing the male birth control.
I was gonna go with
"""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
"All right, he's a hero."
Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff,"
I have a date.
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
Great.
Bring her in.
You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
Mm.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
What did you think of yourself?
Angel?
I lifted them for your sake.
"Now you can marry her, or just keep her."
Brother!
What's this you have done?
You have crossed all limits.
You showed your standings.
"You have misunderstood me, Sheen."
Stop your performance.
What did you think?
You will gain me like this?
"Faiz, this was a big mistake by you."
Victory is not in forcing.
Victory is in defeating hate.
Well!
You and your brother won't understand this.
These are professional killers.
Might have lifted up even the women your family.
Be in your limits and speak!
You speak badly about our women?
"Step away, brother!"
Move!
What are you doing?
What are you all doing?
Leave me.
I will shoot her.
"Making fusses, bloody!"
"What else can be expected of you, Impotent?"
"Stop it, girl!"
You call us Impotent?
Shall I show you our manhood?
What's different about it?
There's nothing different about it.
You're just like your father.
So easy to trip up.
"- So, how was work?"
- Same as always.
Although I had one customer come in looking for a makeover.
She needed one.
"Dyed blonde hair, blue eye shadow, ash brown foundation."
Hideous.
"Anyway, she was shocked when she found out how old I was."
Oh.
How old were you?
Sorry.
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.
He wants to take me to some Alzheimer's benefit.
I said forget it.
I can't believe he still asks you after all these years.
Why don't you go with him sometime?
"Please, those days are over."
I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband.
That's my life.
I have no interest in starting another one.
"Besides, he knows my situation with you."
You're not seeing him because of me?
How would it look?
"The mother's dating, and the daughter stays home alone."
"Mom, who's looking?"
Hello.
Hi.
Then who...?
A shadow stealthily approaches Agwarda!
What are the secrets hidden in the lowest levels of Agwarda?
What are YOU doing here?
!
You were trashed!
I was resurrected...
"After all, I'm a series regular."
A regular...?
!
Don't miss Great Dangaioh:
"""Sneak Attack!"
"The Sword of Shadow"""
Humph!
I'll destroy you as many times as I need to!
Don't run away!
Hold it...!
Penalty!
Penalty!
"Penalty, Ms. Hitomi!"
You sure you want to do it now?
Yes.
"But things are starting to heat up now, so it may be too risky to talk to her."
And that's why I need to do it.
"Now, as our true enemies draw nearer, we need her help."
All right...
Don't worry about what may happen.
Do what you need to do.
The heavy fog that has set in over Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands continues to hover after 4 hours.
All flights into Naha Airport have been cancelled until further notice.
Ryoko Sugi...
"Boy, this is so degrading..."
I won't have my decisions questioned.
Go below until I give you permission to come on deck.
Clear?
"Yes, sir."
Quite clear.
Mr. D'Arblay set the gallants.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Set the gallants!
A beating every day for a week.
- Why won't the captain do something?
- What can he do?
- You all right?
- Thank you.
"Come on, then."
We'll go down together.
Easy now.
Muster on the gun deck.
Move!
- These stripes are healing nicely.
"- They're still bloody painful, sir."
"His own son, eh?"
Can't the captain see what's going on?
"Hey, you, come here."
Sit down.
You said captain can't do anything.
What did that mean?
- I was guessing...
- What's it mean?
"If he went for Scott-Padget over this, there'd be a court-martial."
They'd prove he attacked an officer to protect his son.
That'd finish him.
"If Scott-Padget has influence, it'd be easily done."
- To our meeting.
"Oh, what a poison!"
Some friend you've got!
"No, actually he's a good man."
"Actually, he's not Georgian, he's Greek, though he lives in Tbilisi, he is a tennis coach."
"Excuse me, what's your name?"
- What?
- Your name.
Oh.
Maria.
And I'm Yuri.
Incidentally!
"I didn't drink that much, but it went to my head."
Let's have something to eat.
I was hanging about the station all day!
Very well.
"You take charge here, I'll go and procure some plates and forks."
Tanya!
Can you find some plates and forks for us?
There you go.
Thanks a lot.
Good girl!
"My dear, why do you keep coming and going?"
"You know, I couldn't understand how it could... how it could be that the door's locked but the man's gone!"
"You know, I thought I was going to die."
Let's have another shot.
Though I can't drink much.
"You know, when I drink, I get..."
I get kind of bad in the head.
Start singing right away.
The matchmakers came to me
On a skewbald mare!
I can't wait to dive in and find out all about you.
Mer looks weird.
Does she look weird to you?
She looks like she's gonna pee her pants.
"Oh, crap."
I made her hydrate.
Meeting the family always blows.
I'd never make you do that.
"Me, either."
One of the many perks of dating a dead guy.
Who's that lady touching Meredith?
Derek's mom.
"Oh, that's why she looks so weird."
"She does not look weird, okay?"
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.
Looks like she's gonna pee.
"Dr. Yang, you mind checking on some of my post-ops?"
ER is swamped with traumas.
"Also, would you like to go on a date with me?"
I'm sorry?
A date.
"You said not to play hot and cold with you, so, um, I'll pick you up around 8:00?"
"Oh, and make sure mr."
Kenner in room 2-2-1-2 gets that enema.
He's been holding on to it for days.
Okay.
'Cause that wasn't weird.
"See, another perk of dating a dead guy."
No awkward dates.
"2-to-1, but who's counting?"
Why can't I have that nice man's organs?
- Never.
- What else did she say?
- That he was nice to her.
That he helped her get over Quini.
Thank you.
"Bye, buddy."
Goodbye.
His name is Sebastian Rovira Galvez.
He doesn't work at the hotel anymore.
He got fired.
They still have some of his things there.
We need to get them.
MOTHER WITH FRIEND
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.
The photos of the girls were taken with a roll like that one.
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?
Where are my photos?
- I don't have them yet.
- And what do you have?
"Aguila Photography, in Seville."
Someone places a prepaid order every month.
- Who?
- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.
"They develop them there too, but they wouldn't tell me about them."
But definitely not communion photos.
I think there's someone else there.
You can see the reflection of whoever took the photo.
He's blurred by the flash.
Tell me who he is and you'll get your photos.
"All right, but I'll need the negative."
I'd be happy to show you around.
Right.
Please follow me.
"- Go, go, go!"
"Quick, come on."
- Move.
"- Grab these ones, too."
- What are they doing in here?
Riley said I can't keep it up in my room any more.
- You can't keep it in the freaking kitchen.
- This is our common area.
"And as you can see, we keep a very tight cleaning schedule here at the house."
"We also like to focus on and stress education, music..."
Hot soup coming through!
"The kitchen, where we provide a well-balanced diet."
They're his pets.
Rescue rats.
Tweaker grew up in the basement of a candy store before coming here.
- They were his only friends.
- Take me to Mr Webb.
"Hey, clean the crumbs off the floor."
They're very clean for rats.
"Hi, I'm Randy Webb, home director."
I see you've met Furry and Scurry.
"Wonderful, lovely creatures, I assure you."
"This is not good, Mr Webb."
Not good at all.
"Come on, over here."
- Did you get what I needed?
"- You betcha, Ms Frazier."
Excellent.
"Two season tickets, third row, centre as promised."
"You can see that, right?"
"Yeah, I mean, you're obviously upset about what happened."
"I am upset, Luke."
I'm very upset.
I don't have to play these games.
Of course not.
This is fucking fucked up.
"It's what you said, Chris."
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"" It's what you said to Felix!"
What are you trying to say?
- That I sent the postcard?
"- Well, I know I didn't send it."
"You bitch, you're gonna set me up, aren't you?"
- You're gonna tell him about the fight.
"- Calm down, Chris."
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Chris!
Shut the hell up.
That arsehole is going to get us killed!
He says he didn't send it.
"He said, ""Truth or Dare, bitch."""
Did you?
It's not a secret.
Other people heard.
They could've passed it on.
"Yeah, but you're the one that said it."
So what if I said it?
Why the fuck would I write on a postcard for Christ's sake?
"- It's because I chucked you, isn't it?"
- What?
I said it was 'cause of the way you treated Felix.
I said that was why I was dumping you.
"She's a fraud, Brian."
A fraud!
She didn't write any of her songs.
"Well, so, that's the case with a lot of singers."
It's a very common industry practice.
"Well, then you're all a bunch of frauds, aren't you?"
A bunch of frauds and charlatans.
You want to be a puppet?
"Then sing for your life, puppet."
Come on.
♪ Spread your tiny wings and fly away!

(muffled singing)
"Come on, Anne, sing along."
You know it.
"You didn't write it, but you know it, bitch."
STEWIE AND ANNE:

♪ And if I could you know that I would fly away with you. ♪
"Hey, Meg, you here for the expired hot dogs?"
"No, Carl, I'm looking for Chris."
I've looked everywhere and I can't find him.
"Uh, I haven't seen him but I'll keep an eye out."
(knocking on glass)
"Hey, bozos, what do you think of this?"
(laughing):
"I did, I did it!"
You're crazy man.
You're so crazy.
"(gunfire, men shouting on TV)"
I thought I told you to clean up in here?
And why aren't you dressed?
"All right, line up here."
ERNIE:
The guys who robbed me are there?
They'll speak.
Give me a number if you recognize a voice.
- How did you find out about them?
- Police work.
Ready?
Yeah.
"All right, let's go."
"""Stay in the corner and behave."""
"""Stay in the corner and behave."""
"- ""Stay in the corner and behave."""
- Hold on a minute.
"Okay, go on."
"""Stay in the corner and behave."""
"- ""Stay in the corner and behave."""
- Yes.
Number five.
"Ask him to laugh and say, ""Or we'll punt you like a football."""
"Number five, laugh and say, ""Or we'll punt you like a football."""
"""We'll punt you like a football."""
I can't pick anybody out.
Is that all of them?
Number six.
"- ""Stay in the corner and behave."""
- No.
"Are you not lD'ing these guys, because you're afraid of them?"
- I'm not afraid.
- You'll take care of this on your own?
- Did Chicky give me up to these guys?
- Which guys?
"Clutched his halo and held it straight, didn't he!"
How do you know all that?
I know everything you do and think.
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of...
"And as you were leaving the room, you turned at the door, didn't you?"
"And you said, ""For a moment, I thought..."""
What did you think?
What did you think?
Did you think Dr. Jekyll was falling in love with you?
"You, with your cheap little dreams?"
"Or did you think, perhaps that in him, you saw a bit of me, Hyde?"
"Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?"
"It isn't quite clear, is it?"
Oh...
What are you going to do?
Something so simple.
I'm going to put an end to all that confusion.
"Please, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
"Please, no!"
"Yes, dance."
Dance and dream.
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll of Harley Street dancing with your own butler and six footmen.
Dream they've all turned into white mice and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.
"Here, you in there!"
Open this here door!
Police!
- Ivy!
- I'm going in.
Governor!
"Ho, there!"
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
Hey!
How about a drink for you and your men?
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
"Listen, ""Herr Mac""."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
Freulein Ravenwood.
Let me show you what I am used to.
Nick!
Take your lousy hands off!
wait..
I.. can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that...wait..
I'll tell you everything.
Yes.
I know you will.
Let here go!
...Whiskey?
"Shoot them, Shoot them both."
My medallion!
"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
"Boy, you're something!"
Yeah?
I'll tell you what.
"Until I get back my five thousand dollars, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
I'm your goddamn partner!
"Get the fuck off me, man!"
"Then go, go!"
"Get the fuck outta here, maricon!"
So Michael is one of my favorite students.
Rodriguez.
Sorry?
Michael Rodriguez is our son.
"No, yeah, I meant Michael Rodriguez."
He's got a knack for poetry.
"He writes beautifully, you know."
"It must be difficult for you, though."
How so?
"Well, I mean with the issues Michael's having."
"You know, the..."
"His refusal to use the boy's bathroom,"
"The eyeliner in class, et cetera."
"You know, all the things you and I spoke of"
A month ago Mrs. Rodriguez...
You made me look like a fool in there.
"It isn't like that, Kike."
Listen.
"No, I have been listening."
You been keeping a lot of shit from me.
I'm supposed to find out from his teacher?
"How the hell you think that makes me look, huh?"
"He's walking around out here,"
Going to the fucking girl's bathroom?
What the fuck's that say about me?
"I'm sorry, I thought this was about Michael."
"Don't fucking start, Angie!"
You don't need that shit anyway.
"Like, not at all."
"Because we got a long session coming out, trying to figure who's sitting on his last bomb at this very minute."
"Now, whether you know it or not, one of you three people has got the answer."
"Officer, none of these people are to leave the hospital until my men get here."
"And, Doctor, I want a complete record on this group."
[Ticking]
"Candlelight, incense... and after-dinner drinks..."
Ahhh.
I feel like a female Hugh Hefner.
"All right, Ms. Hefner."
"Why don't you just, um, put this in your pipe and, uh..."
- Smoke it?
- Right on.
[Giggles] Ooh!
A sealed envelope from a lover by candlelight.
Uh-huh.
What is this?
Tahiti?
Brisbane?
Kathmandu?
"I'll see your Kathmandu, and raise you a Cairo, Istanbul and Vienna."
- When?
- As soon as possible.
[Laughing] [Phone Ringing] What do you think?
"Oh, terrific!"
"Yes, we can make it to your villa this summer."
"- Is Alex here, Mrs. Linden?"
- Louise?
- Hello.
"- Al, uh, look."
I'm not trying to cause any trouble.
I just want to tell you there's no point in you coming home tonight.
The two of you can stay there...
He...
"He saved Roger, didn't he?"
Hey.
"Hey, the race is on."
"Oh, hey, man."
Spare me.
I don't want to look at no race.
I don't want to know nothing about no race.
Shh.
Today's running of the famed Iron Man Classic drew a record number of competitors.
"The big surprise of the event came in the last leg, the 100-mile bicycle portion, when a rider sponsored by Island Hoppers... suddenly reversed field as he exited the famed Austin Memorial Gardens."
"We've got some footage of that Island Hoppers biker, who certainly lived up to his sponsor's name."
"Whoever you are, Island Hopper, we admire your style."
Yeeha!
Look at...
And that's the news from all of us to all of you.
Good night.
ANGEL GUTS:
RED PORNO
There are perverts everywhere nowadays.
Hello?
Come on Nami.
You're my best friend.
"Do my shift tomorrow, please?"
I've got a date.
What job is it?
Can just anyone do it instead of you?
Yeah.
As long it's a woman.
It's very easy.
You just have to stand there doing nothing.
What's that?
Don't tell me.
That's European or something?
Bet you got a story to tell.
This is Davis Hartley here.
I'm not some nickel and dime street mutt.
I'm not trying to rip you off or anything.
It would be stupid.
A guy like you?
Got a couple pounds of Lead in his eyes?
What's that?
Is that maybe grief or something like that?
You want to talk about it?
Maybe you think I'm trying to rip off your experiences to put 'em in my novel.
But that's not true.
Davis Hartley is not some moral cretin.
Not precisely.
I'm trying to make a point here.
I'm a professional New York City car driver.
You know what that means?
I'm the greatest individual at being able to find anything in the world.
I could find a penguin in a sandstorm.
- I don't know what a penguin would be-
- Stop talking.
Please stop talking!
Hello!
Stop talking!
You want to help?
"After I stop, I'll be busy for a while."
Find a guy named...
Alex Bohemia.
Who do you think I am?
Like this one here.
I can strap it on my upper thigh and fuck my love slave from behind.
I also really enjoy using the humbler.
Here's the slaves bum.
his upper thighs fit here.
It's worn in a kneeling position.
The scrotum goes in here.
You clamp it in.
and he's unable to stand up.
"He has to follow me on all fours and it pulls back hard on the scrotum, of course."
It's very unpleasant for him.
And I of course enjoy it.
Naturally.
A toast!
A toast!
Let's drink to our well-being!
A meter forward
A meter backward
A meter downward
A meter upward
And bottoms up
Prost.
Prost.
So you think life's shitty?
- It is.
- Just find some place nice.
I like the way things used to be.
What do you mean?
Down here you sense every little thing.
You can really taste the grapes.
It seems to me.
I think so too.
Humanity would live... once again.
The end
Mmm...
Mmm...
"You gotta wrap it up, Teddy."
"We're closing for the afternoon, but we'll be back in a few hours for the dinner rush."
I'm ready!
Let's go!
- Why do you have two bottles of wine?
- What?
It's a wine train.
Ooh.
You guys going on the wine train?
"Uh, you get the wine on the train, Lin."
You don't have to bring it.
Oh...
"Otherwise, it would be just called a train."
Right.
"Lin, you're sure kids are allowed on this thing?"
"It says right here in the brochure, ""Kids are allowed."""
"It says, ""Kids are allowed, ""but not welcome."""
Like in the health and sexuality section at the bookstore.
- Where's Gene?
- He's picking out his outfit.
I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene!
"Gene, why do you look like Dexy from Dexy's Midnight Runners?"
- 'Cause we're going on a train!
"- Well, go put a shirt on."
"Next thing, you're gonna be telling me to go put on underwear."
Put on underwear.
Okay.

"THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES,"
"ITSELF THE CENTER OF NO LITTLE CONTROVERSY,"
WAS DELVING THIS WEEK INTO STILL ANOTHER QUESTION OF COMMUNISM:
WHERE LIES THE LOYALTY OF OUR NEGRO POPULATION
I love you very much.
"Good morning, sir."
"John, what do you think of the president's proposal?"
I don't know.
"It's good to have less enemies, I guess."
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way why didn't you run against him?
"- No, no, no."
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.
I like my constituents.
I like being a thorn in the side of the administration.
But I think voters today want somebody cool.
"Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker, I think you're pretty cool."
He went to bed at 8 and watched...
The president has a call scheduled with the speaker at 9:30.
"- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?"
- No.
You have to be here in case of a deadlock...
"Hey, I'm gonna see you later."
-
-With the red tie for that.
- Jenna?
"- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President."
Red tie's the way to go.
Jenna.
Jenna.
Did you get me in?
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?
"That Joe, collecting stuff like that."
It used to be just guns.
- What sort of trick you got in mind?
- A small wall type.
My f amily bible.
"When you spot your job, holler."
- There.
Am I right?
- That looks right.
That one?
It's a pipe.
What's the layout?
Martinelli's private office at the Sanctuary Club.
I was willing to turn a trick because you're Al's f riend.
I'd cut it off to here f or Al.
But I ain't souping Martinelli's safe.
"I've built up a legitimate business here, with a positive f uture."
"Forget it, Murdock."
Wash it out of your mind.
No grease. it wouldn't do me any good with sand in my mouth.
"If it's a pipe, couldn't you show him how to do it?"
How you like that?
"Murdock, you got something there."
"I have a letter l want to get, and she wants me to get it."
"Lady, there was a time I could have used you."
I'll show you how in five minutes flat.
Come on.
- Where next?
- Where does Martinelli live?
Crescent Beach.
Why?
"Suppose you drive around, show me the sights and wind up there after dark."
he's been here a million times.
"- i'm not a psychic or anything, but... i don't think she's gonna give him a tour -- not of the house, anyway."
"- okay, i need a drink."
- christmas time -- everybody needs a drink.
i'll take a cool one.
- here you go.
- salud.
- i'm pissed.
- salud.
[crowd cheering]
"- * on the 12th day of christmas, my true love sent to me * * 12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping *"
"* 10 lords a-leaping, 9 ladies dancing *"
- brandie!
"- * 7 swans a-swimming, 6 geese a-laying * * 5 golden rings"
"- they grow up so fast these days, don't they?"
- what is she doing here?
- i wonder where she gets it.
- * and a partridge in a pear tree * [cheering continues]
[both giggling]
- [clicks tongue] [laughs]
"- hey, i still got it."
- [chuckles]
- we still got it.
"- you know, i cannot believe that dirty ho is sleeping with my man."
- [chuckles] i thought wayne was your man.
"- that's not the point, okay?"
dang ghosts are screwing up my life.
[scoffs] what's the world coming to?
this is my mama's place.
[urinating] hey!
loser!
go drain it somewhere else!
"I let my guard down, fell madly in love, planned a huge wedding, and the guy didn't show up."
"- Wow, that really sucks."
- No kidding.
Must have been so humiliating.
I don't like to dwell on it.
"I mean, just standing up there in your wedding dress... and all those people staring at you?"
"The point is,"
I know a little bit about anger.
And it's not healthy to hold on to it... or to take it out on other people.
Especially someone as sweet as your mum.
It's killing her that she can't connect with you.
"I gotta tell you, whoever that guy was, it was his loss."
Thank you.
Because you must have been so hot back then.
Yes.
Way back then.
Oh.
Here she is now.
Talk to her.
It'll be fine.
I promise.
"Hi, sweetie."
"Listen, um..."
I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But we can try.
Really?
Yeah.
So where do you wanna start?
"Well, the fact that dad's engaged to a 25-year-old..."
Or that I think I have a crush on joy... and I'm pretty sure she's feeling it too?
"Oh, wow."
He was starving...
Yoyo!
He has a fever and his stomach ached.
Yoyo!
Where was I just now?
You were getting nowhere.
Because I don't know what you're talking about.
You still remember the good old days?
"""l remembered the love song she used to sing."""
"""Even in my dreams I will always remember."""
"""Her tender love warms my heart."""
"""The good old days I will always remember."""
"""Like a flower that bears fruit is our love."""
"""l cannot live without you."""
"""The calm water rippled as you left me!"""
"""Our love will never be forgotten."""
You know how I suffered these 3 years?
But I have my own difficulties.
Difficulties?
Why did you get engaged to Fat Pig?
It's all because of you.
Me?
You shouldn't marry Fat Pig.
You should marry me.
"Sooner or later, you'll know how much I love you."
Love?
Action speaks louder than words.
Can you wait?
Did you make it?
"If you didn't come, I would have made it."
What?
I meant the 'Beast'.
"All right, guys."
"Winner takes all, a week without chores."
"Prepare to meet your doom, boys."
"Not tonight, French Fries."
This game is mine.
You know why the Flyers suck?
Lt all comes down to Lindros.
What a waste.
Sucked us dry and left us for dead.
"So, you gonna kiss me tonight or what?"
- Pair of nines.
- Pair of trois.
"Triple aces, boys."
I win again.
- Tweaker!
- Tweaker!
"You know I really like you, right?"
So you'd have to like gnaw on my lip for this to totally suck.
I guess it's not like in the movies where kisses magically happen at exactly the right moment.
Just like the formation of rainbows.
Wow.
Can you imagine if I told other people that you actually said that?
- It could be your dad.
- I'm in the shower.
- There's a thought.
"- Easy, pilgrim."
- It could be the guys.
- You gave them my number?
What?
I made pizza and we were gonna have purple cows after we kissed.
"Look, I'll make it up to you."
I'm sorry.
Shizuru!
What?
Has something happened lately?
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Yeah, but you are acting a little weird."
And so!
"Because our class has not been on the ball lately, the teacher chose a new motto for our class!"
What do you think it is?
Sis!
Eh?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Man...
You just don't listen to what anyone else says!
I'm sorry!
Say it again!
I don't want to!
Please!
I will listen this time!
Please!
What I was saying was...
My class has not been doing well so my teacher choose the motto Everyone has kibi kibi kibi-dango!
Sis has been acting like that for a long time.
G-Grampy?
You are acting like you are in a haze.
"What, did you get some of that Katsuragi-kid's smoke?"
"I admire her desire to search for anwsers, but the thing she wants to know about is so vast and vague, that she is struggling."
She is like a small bird caught in a net.
A net?
It is a trifling thing gor someone like you who can see those things.
"I'm not in trouble, Carl, you are."
Please tell them they're wrong.
Did you kill Lawrence Ridgeway?
I'm sorry.
No.
You shot him?
It's my job to look out for you.
To look out for this family.
People depend on me.
"When they told me about the rifle,"
I thought... but I didn't want to believe it was you.
Ridgeway told me about the account.
"If that money disappeared, and they came asking, he would have pointed to me."
He was a loose end.
I had to protect us.
And why not blackmail the Secretary of the Navy while you're at it.
That was nothing ;
it was an empty threat.
It was a diversion.
Man is still dead.
"But that AUTEC money is just sitting there, and we're about to lose everything."
I did this for both of us.
"We needed it, Phillip."
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
"Oh, no."
"Vance nails you with the shredding detail, huh?"
"Yes, from redacted to unredacted to recycling to..."
"Tell me, I have a question."
Hmm?
Do you believe?
Believe in what?
Where are you going?
We have some business in town.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
- I trust that you'll keep an eye on things?
- So I'm the babysitter now.
"Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another."
- So you say.
"- I'll watch things, Miss Pearl."
"Thank you, Harper."
"I'm thinking nothing huge, dinner at the Grill, maybe a late movie..."
A double date?
"Two pair, out on a Friday night, coupled."
"Yeah, a double date."
- You think that's a good idea?
- Why not?
"You know, we all haven't gone out before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us."
"The couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt and me and I just think it's important that we get over it."
I don't know.
"You know what, I think that sounds like a great idea."
- You do?
"- Yeah, yeah."
A nice evening out with friends.
"Sounds fun, as in fun."
Hm?
- A double date it is.
- Okay.
Heh.
So we will see you tonight.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
"Ha, ha."
Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
"Oh, yeah?"
Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!
"Look, guys, we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money."
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
"If we can't even win that, what's the point?"
"Hey, hey."
Look at this!
"No, no, no, no."
Yeah.
We suck.
"Your father would be so proud of you, Ben."
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really.
Maybe when he shaved?
"Yeah, I think I watched him shave."
"So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?"
I don't know.
I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
"Ben, you're working too hard."
"Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself."
"You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben."
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.
Okay.
All right.
- Good night.
"- All right, good night."
- Don't come home before 3:00.
The band is too loud.
"Ten minutes, Yuri."
Ten minutes.
All I asked was that you hold Mikhail... for ten minutes.
Is that a long time?
No.
That is a very short time.
How long can you hold your breath?
"I know a fellow in Odessa once who could hold his breath... for five minutes, 33 seconds."
Did Mikhail talk to anyone while he was here?
"Nicholas, please."
The man is trying to speak.
He was talking... to her.
"So, what did you and Mikhail talk about?"
I told him he had a phone call.
The caviar is fresh tonight.
Did I tell you what a pretty girl you are?
"Let me ask you something, sweetheart."
Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you lie to me?
I will never lie to you.
"Because if you lie to me, pretty girl... you won't be pretty anymore."
Get back to work.
All she needs is a good f-
What are you doing over there?
"Oh, Mikhail, I missed you."
You're so tense.
I'll help loosen you up.
What's this?
You playing hard to get?
Is this a game?
Fine.
Have it your way.
What good is your word?
What's he gonna do now?
He's lost everything he had.
"No great amount of money, Patricia."
"Oh, it isn't the money, father."
He had dreams.
"They're gone, perhaps... perhaps even his faith in himself."
- Everything.
- But the boys is young.
I'll think of something.
- I'll find a way to help him.
"- Oh, don't talk to me."
I don't wanna hear any more alibis.
I don't wanna see you.
"Oh, I didn't mean that."
I don't know what I mean.
"Well, I understand."
I-I have failed you.
- But if I could make amends..
"- Oh, what could you do?"
I might be able to arrange backing.
So he could go on with his production.
"Father, where would you get any money?"
I'll get it... someplace.
[ship horn blowing]
"Jason, when is the captain going to marry her?"
As soon as we're upon the high seas.
- You have the license?
- Right here in my pocket.
"Though I understand, we won't need it."
"While we are waiting, couldn't we go some place and snuggle?"
Snuggle?
is that necessary?
Herman will see you've slept with me.
- ls he jealous?
- You better believe it.
- And where'll I sleep from now on?
- l'll show you.
He's staying all next week.
It'll give me lots of time for the treatment.
What'll you say about me?
That you're a writer in need of some peace.
He knows I'm a member of the Literature Club.
"Isn't it a bit perverse, Christine taking in two lovers at once?"
Perverse?
You're going to help me with Herman?
You care about as much for Herman as for me: not at all.
A great deal.
"Take the keys, so you can come and go as you like."
We'll be back late.
Bye...
Give Herman my regards.
"I will, and you start your novel!"
Drive carefully!
Chapter One
When I arrived at V. yesterday...
"Damn... I'm wearing your shirt, Johan!"
Home movies?
Johan.
Henk.
Gé?
"Snip, snip, snip..."
Do you take Christine to be your lawful wedded wife?
What is your reply?
I want... that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the control room, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me.
I want to see that.
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothing.
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
ELl JOE:
You're thinking it's cowardly.
I think it's smart.
"See, I know all about your six amigos."
You all been making quite a name for yourselves around here.
"Real proud of yourself, ain't you?"
ELl JOE:
"Yeah, I suppose."
But it had to be done.
"See, I haven't been sleeping too well ever since I pinned that murder on you."
Your conscience bothering you?
[chuckling ] I ain't got a conscience.
How about Jess Kincaid?
You killed an innocent farmer just to frame me for murder.
"Got you off my trail, didn't it?"
This little voice inside keeps telling me...
... VinTanner'sgonnacome looking for me.
Settle out both scores.
So I figured I'd find you first.
I'm glad I did.
Let's do this.
Gotta get back on the trail.
MAN:
Take cover.
YATES:
Don't let him get away.
Get him.
What took you so long?
I thought you might need this.
Yah!
"Now, now."
No need to rush in all at once.
I didn't hear right.
I can't believe what I heard.
This is for you.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.
Good.
Don't take shit from nobody.
He shoots him in the foot and he tells him to go fuck himself.
"Tommy, you going to let this fucking punk get away with that?"
What's this world coming to?
That's what the fucking world's coming to.
-How's that?
-What is wrong with you?
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?
How do I know if you're kidding?
I'm kidding with you and you fucking shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. I'm a good shot.
-Hard to miss at this distance.
"-You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?"
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard!
I can't believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
is it the first hole I dug?
Not the first hole I dug.

How rude!
Even I am not used to people not turning around to look at me.
Using my pickup line on me?
- Yes.
- Liquor baron Zakir Merchant.
Awesome.
"Okay, Tony."
I never should have doubted you.
"Well, you didn't."
You're helping me.
"No, I-I mean before-- when you said... this guy was suspicious."
I just thought I knew him.
I still don't know why.
Grab his arm.
What?
"Yeah, just don't touch his skin."
Oh.
Perfect.
Bandage?
Right here.
Okay...
I can't get over your... speed.
"You used to spend months researching, analyzing, planning-- now you just... go."
"Jake, I'm still the same person."
The same person having a conversation over a dead body.
"You guys know I'm still here, right?"
Any luck on those prints?
"Uh, yeah."
"We got one, McGee."
Sending it straight to Abby.
Is that what I think it is?
Low-tech but effective.
Who's lead officer on this wing?
Uh...
"I'm real sorry, Lieutenant."
I don't know how we missed that.
"Well, the good news is, there are other cameras pointed in this direction-- we just have to look at that footage."
Restrooms stay closed until we can an M.E. here.
We didn't scare him.
What's your name?
"Well, in Germany they call me Johann"
And here Honza.
That's what we call our pig!
"Well, Johann, you can sleep above the pigsty."
- The nights are warm.
- It's him.
Above the pigsty?
Is there no bedroom - er some tiny room?
There isn't.
"All right, I'm used to hardship on my travels."
"Go and turn the hay, up by the wood."
I'll feed Terry and then I'll help you.
"There's a rake, the meadow above the chapel."
He never killed himself working!
"Good, he's here, so we can keep an eye on him."
And we'll pay him back for his trouble.
We'll scare him out of his wits.
"If he doesn't behave, just call us!"
"What are you up to, Honza?"
You're slow!
Would you call me Johann?
You already have a...er - the pig Honza.
"As you like, Johann."
I'm glad I came at the right time.
"You can't do it all alone, poor girl."
I'm not alone - I have my Henry.
What's that?
You wait!
So those palace rascals are still bothering you.
With God's help I'll be home soon to protect you.
- So sorry.
Uh.
- Hi!
"Oh, it's you."
All of the research I could've been doing while chasing this Will-o'- the-Wisp Psychiatrist.
"- So, you hit someone?"
- With my cane.
I struck him across his fat face.
- It was fatter than mine.
- Why?
He had a leg tremor and Nystagmus.
- That's abnormal eye movements.
So?
- It was obvious he was in the advanced stages of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
I told him as much.
That's a neurological disease.
It's brought on by excessive alcohol consumption.
- She knows what it is!
"- I don't, actually."
"Well, you should, seeing the company you keep."
I-I still don't understand why you hit him.
He called me a nosy old Jew.
"Jew, yes."
"Old, perhaps."
"Nosy, never!"
"Ok, well, uh, good for you."
- What is that?
- That's a flight tracker app.
"He should be in the air by now, if he got on the plane."
"Makes you wanna dance, doesn't it?"
I am so sorry.
I feel like I've been in this car for four years.
- Your keys.
"- ls it just the keys or along with the keys, the car too?"
"Along with the car, the driver too is there."
I have never seen a flower selling flowers.
"Will you just see, or buy something too?"
I will buy all your flowers.
How much do they cost?
Around 4000.
Give me the address.
Where do I send it?
- Your name?
- Nisha.
I don't want flowers.
I am at fault.
And the flowers are being punished?
The flowers are being punished.
And you are sweating?
Here...wipe off your sweat!
- Sweat?
!
- Please take it.
"If I were in Baba's place, I would have picked up the girl..."
- ..and parceled her right away!
- l would say...
Let Baba just mention it once.
I will pick up her entire family!
How would you know what love is?
One should go straight to the girl and ask her...
'Will you give me a kiss?
Or shall I slit your throat?
'
Rascals!
"- Oh, no worries."
"- Ok, uh..."
"You know, there's something I wanted to ask you, something Brandon told me about the night before he was attacked."
Mike was drinking?
Yeah.
"He had a little slip, but he's been sober ever since, going to meetings every day."
"Oh, that's great."
Good for him.
Brandon said that he was in a fight.
"Yeah, I guess so."
He blacked out so he didn't really remember anything.
"Oh, gosh..."
But there was blood on his hands when you found him?
That's...
A little.
He was fine.
- Was it his blood?
- Stef.
"If you have questions about Mike's sobriety, you have to ask him."
Of course.
Of course I should.
You're right.
Sorry.
Thank you so much for the coffee.
Appreciate it.
"All right, Jude, just keep your eye on the ball, buddy."
Takes a little getting used to.
"Just hang in there, kid."
"Um, you might wanna hang on to the bat a little tighter too."
"Here, grab another one, all right?"
"Hey, Connor, let's go, come on."
"Throw a token in there, let's see what you got."
What do you think?
"I think that before we get there, the victim will be up and gone."
"No, I beg of you, give her the medication."
They're painkillers.
"Two tablets in the morning and two at night, dissolved in water."
You said two in the morning and two at night?
Yes.
"When you go to the chemist's, you have to be very determined or they won't give you everything."
is it hard to come by?
That's not the issue.
Chemists are like that.
"She's suffering, poor thing."
We can't do anything.
Let her take this and sleep.
"Doctor, what's wrong with her?"
"Oh, excuse me a second."
Speak louder. it's windy.
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.
How do you know?
"I said, how do you know?"
I can't hear.
Speak louder.
We were cut off.
"You were saying, doctor..."
What's wrong with her?
"Nothing, she's just old and weak."
She's just a bag of bones and she's not very well at all.

How are humans alive?

"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
- Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
No.
- I don't want it then.
- You bought it fair and square.
"But you said it was mouth painted, when really it was hand painted..."
- Calm down.
- Please get him out.
- I want my money back.
"- No, let's go."
Oh yes!
I'll just take your blanket then.
"- Frank, everyone's napping."
- Off we go.
- What's this?
- The mouth painter's blanket.
"- It's a bedspread, Frank."
- Why are you taking her blanket?
- Anything this thick is a blanket.
- It's too coarse to be a blanket.
- There's a bedspread and a blanket.
- Give me back my blanket.
- I need something to bargain with.
"- Look, I'll give you 1,000 for this."
"- Come on, she's a pensioner..."
- It's a matter of principle.
What an old con artist.
The nerve!
"We're helping a brain dead woman, all focused on that,   and old Granny Grab-All is just waiting for some sucker."
- She's just an old woman.
- I'm going to call my lawyer.
- Isn't that a bit extreme?
- Not the slightest.
Fraud is a legal matter.

I just gotta make a quick stop first.
"You know what, when people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or the store."
"No, thank you."
"You know what, this is for computer classes."
"Know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
I really don't.
To get you rich.
"'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gon' blow up."
How do you know I'm not rich?
Your teeth.
"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon."
They know the window of opportunity's only open for a moment.
You gotta get in when you're young.
Get the money and get out.
"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy."
I don't have sex for a living.
Neither do we.
Neither do they.
"Yes, they do."
Where is my phone?
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so lo-ong
He's got charisma.
"No, that's Charisma over there."
Girlie Show.
"Ken, send me a car, okay?"
What is your location?
"Dark Sensations, in the Bronx."
I wish you were here.
Mr. Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
Tiny Eyes!
Tiny Eyes!
Whoo!
"Hey, everybody, let me see."
"Yeah, back and forth."
This is old-school.
It's how you did it.
- Uh-huh.
Shore:
"- Mr. Ellis, Mr. Ellis, this is Mr. Danner."
He is the lead soprano in the Gulfhaven Glee Club.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Kind of a nerd.
- [ All groan ]
"- So, we hired him as our full-time music teacher, so we don't need you anymore."
"No, but the recital."
"N-no, but thank you."
But our jam is def.
"All right, do you have enough for the repairs?"
'Cause we got to get this baby rolling!
- Bye.
- [ Beep ]
Get what baby rolling?
Your baby. [ Laughs ] Obviously.
- Should be rolling by now.
- Jules?
"Okay, well, you told me that I should talk to Trav about being more responsible, so I did."
"And then we bought this old van, and Trav's a genius, and Scooby-Doo, and you're gonna be rich."
"Sweetie, I see that you are insanely excited about an old van and a plan from Travis that seems like the greatest idea of all time."
But it's not.
You have your mom goggles on.
"- ""Mom goggles""?"
You're Marta Kozlenko.
He was my father?
I lured my father to his death?
It wasn't your fault.
"He wanted it to look like a kidnapping, not a defection."
Somehow the KGB got onto us.
"We'll go to Zurich, first thing in the morning."
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
For what?
For all of this.
"Maybe if I hadn't called you or taken you out of your life, maybe..."
It would've happened anyway.
Whoever's after us needs my numbers too and you weren't just part of the job.
"I've always cared about you, I always will."
Marta.
Alright we have to get outta here.
What's wrong?
Police are downstairs.
We made the paper.
(speaking German)
(speaking German)
You speak English?
We need you to drive us to Zurich.
We're not gonna hurt you.
But my deliveries.
I have customers.
Today we're you're only customers.
Don't even think about it.
"Thank you, Jann."
I hope we didn't cause you too much trouble.
"Appreciate it if you can, uh, wait a couple hours before calling' the police."
- The truth.
- Why?
Because he could come back!
They've got a right to know.
- OK.
I'm coming with you.
- No.
- Let me take the blame.
- No!
"I got us into this, not you."
Although...
I'm in so much trouble
I think they might actually eat us.
I'll see you next time I'm allowed out.
Which is probably in the next 50 years or so.
You could leave them in the den till they promise not to punish you.
"Yeah, I might just do that."
You sure you don't want to split the blame?
- Positive.
- OK.
I'll see you in 50 years.
"I can smell you out there, young lady."
You are beyond grounded!
"Open this door, Maddy."
Open the door!
"You and Rhydian gave Tom and Shannon, a picture of you in wolf-form!"
What were you thinking?
"In some parts of America, wolves are protected."
I'm going to get our wolves protected too.
"If you want the Government to start passing laws to protect them, you need..."
- proof they actually do exist.
- I've got it!
"Kelton, do you read me?"
Do you read me?
"Kelton, answer me."
"Kelton, talk to me now."
Come on!
This is Alpha.
I'm okay.
Search and Rescue's traveling.
Monroe!
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
I've got my location.
Look for a manhole cover...
It's number... nine...
It's number 929.
That Nathan card wasn't a coincidence.
That perp knew I was going to be on this case.
You think he has an ax to grind?
I don't know.
I cross-referenced the word Nathan with the number 929.
II Chronicles 9:29 talks about the prophet Nathan.
"Nathan passage, Nathan card..."
"Why it's relevant, I have no idea."
Perp could be a religious fanatic.
What's his profil say?
His taste is consistent.
"Both Sara and Amanda are attractive, civic-minded politicians' wives."
"High profile, soft target."
How hard did they look at Amanda's husband Curtis McNeal?
"With a fine-tooth comb, even though he was mayor at the time."
There were rumors of an affair.
He took a lot of heat from the local press.
Nothing stuck.
Why?
- No.
"You just won a really big battle, my friend."
Come on.
"So we're not gonna get married, but I have to get rid of my pants."
Mm-hm.
And we both win.
All right.
I'll get rid of them if you like.
You're getting a lot of bids on this place?
Yeah.
"I know it's crazy, but it's a neighborhood in transition."
"Is that like young, hip, gay couples or something like that?"
Yeah.
"Hip gay people, young couples, young families."
ANNA:
Wow.
"God, this reminds me of where I grew up."
I bet it's got one of the...
Wait a minute.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, that's it."
We used to have the exact same one except my mom used it as a desk.
So when do all the fabulous people arrive?
"Well, actually, the open house is tomorrow."
But I have this one buyer and I wanted to make sure his girlfriend likes it first.
"Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?"
"Yeah, I have an idea."
For this house.
For me.
"And hopefully, if you like it and things continue to, you know..."
"Anna I have a plan, okay?"
"What we doing, hut?"
!
I pulled you out of shit and so we thank!
He'd be here without me?
The stairwell to sell three grams of hashish!
Do not do that!
What You're pissing?
Talk.
"If come up with a plan, You'll earn more money."
They will not give my brothers just squeeze.
-Which brothers?
"Who's got a fat, your brothers or you?"
I...
That's right!
You've got guts!
You know the market.
We make millions!
Think!
Thanks for the shirt.
"It is still in a coma, but outside dition."
That's better.
But you should have just obiæi neighborhood and find out how much it is.
"I'm sorry it was, but I thought that crime police shoot so bad."
"Squat is closed, all in all good."
It is celebrated?
"Nothing, drink appetizer."
I'll tell you what we are celebrating.
Here I am in the lab.
They found 2 samples DNA on the bag and Cetin head.
When will the results?
Tomorrow.
I told you if you trust in me.
"–Yeah, man."
How's retirement?
–I'm shaving' a few strokes off my golf game.
–You look good.
–You I don't know.
–Ronnie Gardocki.
Joe Clarke.
Taught your boss everything he knows.
"Yeah, but you didn't teach me everything you know, right?"
That's right.
I'm saving some.
–We're gonna grab a bite.
Wanna go?
–They're busy.
"When I miss tee time at Riviera for this, you better be buying."
Riviera?
Since when do they let hacks like you play at Riviera?
You guys still here?
Come on!
"Hey, who was that with Vic?"
"–Joe Clarke, his old partner."
–They kicked him off the force.
–Why is that?
–Some punk took a swing at his last partner.
Joe knocked out like half of his teeth in front of this crowd.
Total railroad job.
Don't worry.
It's nothing like what you're going through.
So it's been a year since you called me up.
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?
Can't I buy you lunch?
Move!
I like that!
I love that!
Romeo e Juliette!
Romeo loves his Juliette.
Wait!
What the hell is going on here?
"Resin, you'd better watch out!"
We got good models over here.
I'm not worried about her taking my job.
She couldn't even fit into the samples.
Your hair looks like a sheep dog... and Juliette croaks anyway.
You thought there was something going on when you saw that big... drop of sweat in his hand like Mission Impossible.
And Harnesee seemed so hot.
"This is a bit bigger than breaking into""Quantico""."
- You got the story from Skirt?
- And hot full details!
Vogue is in Fort Knox!
Nina will be euphoric.
"Man, this neighborhood is dead."
"Soho used to be fly... but now it's all just sell-out, sell-out."
Sell-out.
"Then Tribeka was the e-hood, but now it's gone to yuppies... with their editting facilities, waiting 45 minutes in line... for lunch at Bubbie's."
"See, it's all about the alphabet city in the Y2K!"
"Paul, what are you doing here?"
You remember Alex?
- I need to talk to you.
- Is something wrong?
I need some liquids.
"What's your poison, Joce?"
- I'm okay.
"- Jocelyn, listen."
Mom.
- Birthday celebration.
- Whose birthday?
"Mom, you're missing the best part."
"Guys, Peter's here, and I need to help him with something outside just for a minute, and then I'll be right back, okay?"
What's he doing here?
"It's Dad's birthday, for fuck's sake."
Dinner's almost ready.
"Lupita, set the table."
You have hands.
Do you know he's a DEA agent?
- Huh?
Who's a DEA agent?
- That Peter guy.
Get the fuck out of here.
"I saw him leaving here and he had this jacket on that said ""DEA."""
"- Shane, stop making shit up."
- I'm not.
D-E-A could stand for a lot of things.
"It was the same kind I see on the news when they bust people, the exact kind."
- What exactly did he say to your mom?
- I don't know.
"When I saw him, he was getting into his car."
He looked really mad.
"He's mom's boyfriend, isn't he?"
I really have to get back.
I didn't mean to interrupt your celebration.
I just don't like the way our last conversation went.
- I was upset.
"- I know, and you had a right to be."
- I'm sorry I went behind your back.
- I want to be with you.
"Umm, mother."
"When we go to the U.S., let's not use the name Madis Snack Shop."
The name could be...
DELICIOUS Korean Food.
What did the former President say?
That he was sorry... that he was thankful.
And be happy.
I used to work in the kitchen of an outgoing ship.
As the kitchen head.
The world of Korean food is daebak (great)!
Do you know how to say daebak in English?
"Oh, Dae~bak!"
"In 1983, twenty-one brave soliders sacrificed their lives for their country in carrying out a mission.Their honored names to be remembered forever."
Lee Jin Pyo Park Mu Yeol.
Take a deep breath.
You're doing great.
The child's heartbeat is weakening.
"One last time, push harder!"
"If you can't do it, we'll prepare for surgery at once."
Where is the father?
No... he's not around.
"-= October 9th, 1983, Aung San, Burma. =-"
"It's after 10 already, right?"
The President is a little bit late.
"Burmese Minister was late to escort him, so he is on his way with the senior official."
Okay.
"All team, report on your situation."
Drive away.
"Congratulations, it's a boy."
=This is an urgent news flash report.=
=Burma local time 10:28 a.m=
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.
[BEN CLAPPING]
Great class.
We ran into each other.
You came to my class.
I had no idea this was your class.
You called to ask me if this was my class.
"No, you never called back."
Because you told me not to call you if it was my class.
It was.
- No.
We just ran into each other.
- Okay.
We're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
BEN:
Exactly.
Do you want a swim?
Sure.
"You know, I was just thinking why can't we be friends?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?"
"I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?"
I hear you.
I mean am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
Right.
Or has an insane smile?
Or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
[BEN CHUCKLES]
"- Did you just say ""dry hump""?"
- Yeah.
BEN:
Listen to this
I've done all my daydreaming
"Oh, that sleep walk should be over by now"
"As for me, i moved to St. Augustine, Florida, where it hasn't snowed in 50 years."
- [ Engine Starts ]
- And you know what?
"I auditioned, and i was back on TV."
"[Male Announcer] And now it's time top lay north Florida cable's... second-most popular game show, Lucky Numbers, with your host, Russ Richards."

"My goodness, I'd love to take you home with me tonight."
How 'bout it?
"Tonight, after the show?"
Dinner for 250?
Okay.
I'll make the margaritas.
"All right, now..."
"[Narrating] You know, sometimes i walk past an appliance store... with 45 TV sets in the window, and i'm on everyone of them."
"At times like that, i say to myself, ""Why me?"""
"I mean, ""Why me?"""
"If i had to answe rthe question, i'd have to say, ""Just lucky."""
"You're making my dreams come true Doo-ooh, doo-doo, doo-doo"
Nights were warm
Dreams were easy
No one standing
Overhead
Conversation
-Get out.
"-lf l can't have you, then the jailer can."
Uh.
[WlNGO LAUGHS]
"Hot-blooded, passionate."
What a woman.
Maudie.
"My, my."
I don't know how you manage to resist such a display of ardor.
stains:
We'll bear witness.
We'll be on the jury.
Mr. Litefoot here is gonna look after our interests here at Eagle Bend.
You have entrusted me with this case...
... andsoIguaranteetoyourightnow that this man will be convicted.
"And hung, or--"
Or you get your money back.
"All right, let's ride."
Your name...
... Obediah.
"Obediah was a, uh, prophet of God."
He predicted the downfall of the Edomites.
The Edomites were an arrogant people.
They thought they were better than everybody.
"They tried to destroy Obediah's people, but-- lt didn't work."
Obediah's people rose up.
Justice was served.
Anything you wanna tell me before we go to trial?
"No, sir."
This Obediah just wants his day in court.
"You tell a story like that, Josiah..."
... you'lldojustfine.
Okay.
The police said the safe was locked.
The old man held out on the fucking guy.
As plain as day.
"Carlos, you want another helping?"
Carlos?
Carlos?
- You want more ham?
"- Oh no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
See you in a couple of days.
"Mickey, wait."
"Carlos, there's someone I want you to see."
Let's go.
"Come on, help me clean up."
Sean:
"Six months ago he came to me and asked for a loan, to stay afloat."
He shouldn't have been in that position.
I shouldn't have given it to him.
"The thing is, this is not a small loan, 25 grand."
Yeah.
Come on.
"There's a bodega on every corner of the Heights, Carlos."
What makes Eddie's profitable?
Eddie!
Why is Eddie in debt?
Eddie.
"If he sells the place, I get my money back, and I'm not forced to have this conversation."
We both know he ain't gonna sell it.
We both know he ain't gonna be able to work it for quite some time... if ever!
"The way I see out of this, for all of us... is you take over."
"The bodega, it's a cash cow."
Where's that smile for the crowd?
- Beautiful.
- Use your arms.
Steady waist.
She has a knack for it.
She got it from you.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Gather round for the extraordinary debut of the world's youngest tightrope walker.
Maria!
Please talk to them Barbuda.
"Forget it, Foguinho."
No time for changes now.
The act hasn't been announced yet.
- But we're set on it.
- You can change your minds.
"Can't you see the place is packed, Barbuda?"
They're all here to see our act.
"Come on, Marcelo."
- He can't make you do this.
"- Don't go, Marcia."
- Is Maria in this?
"- Of course not, she's out."
"It's time, Marcelo."
"We'll be watching from the front row, okay?"
Come on.
I'll never leave the circus again.
I'll be with you.
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls."
Keep your hearts in check.
"At last, we have come to our finest attraction."
The incredible tightrope walker couple:
Marcia and Marcelo!
"Erica, you were right to be upset."
Really?
Yeah.
"And also, to answer your question, when are you allowed to decide what we talk about?"
When you're ready.
"And apparently, that's now."
So...
Let's talk about Kai.
Ok.
"Ok, what's the catch?"
No catch.
Sit.
Please.
"Well, he... he is withdrawing from everything,"
And I feel like it's my fault.
Why?
Because you told him that you felt something for him?
"And he thinks that changes everything, and I told him it doesn't have to, but he--he doesn't listen."
"And you think that he's wrong-- that after your confession, that you can continue to be just friends."
Yes.
Because I made it very clear to him that--
That you were not breaking up with Ethan.
Right.
I know.
What?
It's funny.
"You know, a year ago, you and I couldn't have this conversation."
"You know, I would have shut it down and, uh, you would have dropped it."
You would've done as you were told.
Heh.
Yeah.
Things are different now.
"Okay, okay, I'll tell you."
Mind your blade
I want it for my Master.
He's wounded
Who's your Master?
Is it Thunderstorm?
Shi Zhengzong
"Hey man, let go of me!"
How did your Master get hurt?
My Master is so unfortunate
While he was asleep...
Someone covered with blood suddenly came in
Blood?
"Y es, he was stabbed here"
He knew martial arts
Have you heard of anyone who was stabbed here and didn't die?
Who is that man?
"My friend, why're you so rude?"
Release me first
"Oh, my waist!"
T ell me quick!
"Y es, yes!"
That man was covered by blood
But he could still survive!
My Master asked him what happened
And he tried to chop him up
I sensed something was wrong so I kicked him
"Go on, speak"
"Okay, it so happened that I kicked him"
Right on where the knife was stabbed
The knife plunged in two more inches
He gave out a loud cry!
Do not desire it.
Miss Dashwood.
Col. Brandon's lawn is perfect for kite launching.
Mind the pretty ribbons.
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte and her master appeared with Lucy.
The last person I expected to see.
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.
I'd not seen you for so long.
You sly thing!
It was the Dashwoods she wanted to see.
"I've heard nothing but ""Dashwood"" for I don't know how long."
What do you think of them?
My mother wrote of little else in her letters.
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.
You are quite rude today.
He's to be an MP.
And he is forced to make everybody like him.
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.
Here he comes!
"Now you shall see, Charlotte."
"Hello, Mr. Willoughby!"
"You must meet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer."
"- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele."
- Welcome to our party.
May I sit beside you?
I've longed to meet you.
I've heard nothing but praise for you.
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are too excessive in their compliments.
The praise came from another source.
"You are Erik Berg, right?"
Hello.
I know you.
- I work in the law.
- Oh well. in section two?
During alderman Wallenberg.
I have read your articles about police informants.
- Do you have time to talk a little?
- Yes.
Thank you for standing for.
"Especially Lasse, who is old GSi `is."
"We do not have approval from the management, not even unofficially."
"They find out, we have spoken with Wagner or Johan -"
- We get the Police Complaints Board on the neck.
Is this the work Elier what?
"- No, I'm sick."
- I'm on my time off.
"But if something happens, as we enter immediately into service."
Frank'll never survive this.
We do like this.
SHOOTING TIPPING STlLLE OF THE COURT
Unlikely many reports on a moped robbery I must say.
- We should just ...
- It's okay.
Continue In just.
Do what you do best.
"If no make a fuss, so please direct them to me."
What the hell was that about?
- Who is it?
- It's Niklas.
He's good.
"What I said earlier, it was ..."
He said that I was unfit.
"Now, all my life, people have told me that I'm very fit."
"My Uncle Lionel was in the fucking Olympics, okay?"
I didn't know that.
Archery?
Pentathlon.
"So, to tell me that I am unfit now when my fitness really matters, when the fitness stakes couldn't be higher..."
Here I am!
With nothing left!
Nothing!
You have taken everything that has meant anything to me!
You have--
Get a blanket.
Dennis.
What are you-- what are you doing?
"You're a doctor, right?"
"I mean, you help people?"
I-I do.
"I, um, heard you wrote a book about... people's private parts."
About sex-- yes.
"Yes, I did."
Is everything all right?
I don't think so.
I think... something's wrong with me.
"And originally, it gets produced in here."
"It's called a nocturnal emission or, colloquially, a wet dream."
It's incredibly common and perfectly normal.
Are you sure?
I couldn't be more sure.
Hasn't your father or... someone explained any of this to you?
- Ow!
- John!
So I'm just digging A long trench.
Through the gravel And the pebbles.
He needs to be Excruciatingly careful.
About the amount of time He spends down there.
He could really hurt himself At that depth.
"Hey, zeke, we're at 35 feet right now."
Copy that.
Really?
Really.
Just be careful.
"I'm seeing hardpan, Like I wanted."
But there's not even A speck of gold on it.
"Well, let's go somewhere Else more interesting."
Yeah.
Roger.
"Whoa, boy, is this..."
It's a gold worm.
But I don't know if they Necessarily correlate exactly.
To there being A lot of gold.
It would be really Nice to see.
"Just a little flake Of gold, you know?"
Are we getting deeper?
Yes.
After 2 hours At 37-feet...
"Hey, you doing okay?"
The first stages Of nitrogen narcosis.
Are setting in.
Dangerous.
"Zeke, that's way too."
You need To get out of there.
"So zeke has two choices,"
He can call it quits Or get bent.
Call it a gut feeling.
"Oh, that's still annoying, you know."
What is?
You talking in riddles and intuition.
You never change.
Yeah.
So has he?
"You know, contacted you?"
I haven't seen or heard from James in 15 years.
"And, uh, the irony's not lost on me"
That you're the one who's asking.
Carol.
Carol.
Look at me.
"No matter what you think,"
I'm not the one who drove him away.
You made things intolerable for all of us.
"Well, if it--if it makes you comfortable to blame me,"
Then you should go ahead and blame me.
I don't care.
But the truth is that you made choices.
And the choices you made--you chose badly.
I'm not the one who disappeared.
"Oh, there it is."
How did I not know?
What?
What--not know what?
"Oh, stop it, Artie."
You're in town for whatever reason and you decide to twist the knife
For old time's sake.
Rub it in that I chose the wrong guy.
Right.

all right?
let's go.
It'd be better to say I was the subject.
Clara wanted to talk about me...
And boy she talked...
Did she say you were selfish?
That's what she always say.
If you think she's right..
-She's right about that.
I don't know exactly what selfish means.
Someone who loves himself more than others.
"Yeah, but that happens to everyone."
Some of them realizes and others don't.
Did she just say that?
No.
She talked more about...
I don't know!
I remember it was getting dark..
And I started crying.
I don't know if Clara noticed that.
Did you cry?
I've never seen you crying.
Clara talked and talked...
And she was making an image of me that I couldn't recognize.
Has this happened to you before?
Yes.
No.
That couldn't happen to you.
Why do you ask me then?
Clara said everything was over.
That it'd be better if we don't try it again.
That everything became an useless effort.
And what did you say?
I didn't speak much.
"Where are you getting cold, eh?"
-Mishanya!
- Leave me alone!
I awfully respect you.
Judge foryourself.
What makes a man happy during the war?
-What?
- Look.
"To stay awayfrom bullets, to have a good nap and a hearty meal."
-Yes.To receive a letter.
- That's true.
-Stepa!
-What?
-What do you think...
"- l'm not thinking now, I'm drinking tea."
-There is no happiness at war.
"- Nobody has asked foryour opinion, man."
You are too young.
I'm leaving in 30 minutes.Will you take a bath?
Then get ready.
"No, I'm not going to take a bath."
I'm no bloody Onegin.
What?
Can you tell me for sure when we are going out on a mission?
Does your ex-con soul long for some action?
You can not even kill a hen and you talk about missions.
I had no knife then.
"When I'm armed, I'll do anything."
-Stepa!
-What?
Could you demonstrate to him how prisoners are taken?
OK. I'll pretend to be a sentinel... and you'll attack me from behind.
"Do not stand so, do something!"
Say something.
Tell him I feel ...
Wait!
I have tried to something.
"Call someone, right?"
"Why do not you write in: 'complaints and suggestions. """
"Silent, we are in trouble!"
Problems?
Crocodiles are good speakers!
"Addons Max, you're breaking the rules."
"This time to visit your friend, Allan."
What is ...
Asshole.
Addons I tell you what just seen was real.
"Addons Breaking the rules again, and I assure you kill someone else."
Addons It's time to play.
You killed an innocent man.
in cold blood for no reason!
Addons I disagree.
Involve friends when you break the rules.
"Addons And I will continue to kill more people who have no sin, if it does not follow them."
Addons Thank you for your cooperation.
Do you think that it is false?
I do not know ...
God ...
Lake Casino.
We in Ireland should not be in here.
We have in the Atlantic.
What does it mean?
That our destiny is not New York.
What are you doing?
"What ""regulations""?"
"Lockout devices must be in place during the cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery."" OSHA, 1989."
Yeah?
Write your congressman.
And hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
Youjust made my Shit List.
She's copping his joint.
"He starts telling' her ""baby this"" and ""baby that"", chatting' her up like motherfuckin' Barry White."
"Tellin' her what he wants to do, and how he's gonna make the coochie feel and all that."
- That's right.
- So dig.
"She's stops, she looks up at him with these big puppy dog eyes and she's all: ""that sounds good puppy but me no have no coochie..."""
And the brother's like:
"""Say what?"""
And he looks down and sees that she is really a he!
"Man, that's bullshit."
You telling me the ho's wearing a thong and the fool can't tell the difference?
"She had a tuck job, man!"
"Come on, Jonesy."
You know how they do it!
- You might.
I don't.
"- Yeah, wathever..."
"Ei, Reznik?"
You up for some cards tonight?
Can't.
Got plans.
Shit.
Nigga says the same damn thing every poker night.
"What's up with you, man?"
You used to be all right.
-Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know.
It haunts me.
"Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy."
"After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver."
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
"-Oh, thank God!"
-I know.
Come in!
Hi.
I'm sorry to barge in on your Valentine.
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.
"-Oh, my God."
-Poor Ross.
"We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes."
You know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you before you watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it?
Is it scary?
It's ironic how footage of someone being born..
can make you want to kill yourself.
"Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it."
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?
They made themselves a place where the shit couldn't touch 'em.
"Every precinct has its ""cop bar, """

"This Armenian guy, he's from the other side over there."
He tells her that she's dead.
Right?
She's gonna be dead by morning.
"- So he drops this box off at her place, right?"
- They call you guys.
- They call Bomb Squad.
- Right.
We go in there.
We x-ray it on scene.
"- And, uh, we can't see anything in there."
- [ Man ] Right.
I cut a little hole in it.
I can see there's something in there.
[ Man ] Uh-huh.
"I, uh, I see that there's, uh, some white fuzz."
There's something pink.
I can't figure out what it is.
- Suddenly I realize I am looking at a tongue.
"- Ah, shit!"
"A big, fat tongue sticking out at me."
Yes.
The guy put a goat's head in there.
[ Man ] This at the end of the twentieth century.
"H.G. Wells, he'd turn over in his grave to think at the start of a new millennium..."
It's-
You know what?
This isn't a basement.
This is a nursing home.
I know something new we could do.
"Jackie, Donna, get naked."
The rest of you guys back off and give us some room.
"- Hello, friends of Fez."
- Hi.
Where's Nina?
She don't wanna hang out with me tonight.
She said she needed space.
- [All] Ooh!
- Uh-oh.
That's the same sound you guys made when I told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.
"Fez, when a girl says she needs space, that means that she's dumping you."
You don't understand.
She said it was her and not me.
- [All] Oh!
- That ain't good.
"- Oh, what's the big deal?"
"- Oh, man, I can't tell him."
"This is a job for someone who's cold, heartless and just inhuman."
"Jackie, go for it."
"Fez, when a girl says, ""It's not you, it's me""... what she really means is it's you."
- So I have really been dumped.
- [Hyde] Yep.
And here's another tip.
"When a girl says she just wants to be friends... it means she wants you to do stuff for her, but she's not gonna put out."
"So, you know, heads-up on that one."
Yep.
Women'll screw you over every chance they get.
Shit.
"Sir, we have Black Hawks coming in."
Which direction?
"From I Street, and fast."
"How do you feel, Mr. President?"
"Surprisingly good, Dr. Cale."
"Let me call in, make sure they don't think we're dead."
"The former vice president, Alvin Hammond.."
is clearly calling the shots as the new commander in chief.
I have John Cale on the line.
Cale?
Where's Carol?
Finnerty's been relieved of command.
The cavalry's coming.
Should be hitting the residence in a few minutes.
"No, no, no, not by air."
They have to come by ground.
I think we can handle this.
They have Javelin missiles.
Not according to our intel.
"Even if we wanted to call them back, they've gone dark."
"If they fail, they're going to kill every single one of those hostages.."
including my daughter.
Just go.
Take this and stay out of sight.
Thirty seconds!
Let's go!
"Incoming, three of them!"
Spread out!
Castle in sight.
"I say again, Castle in sight."
Are you ready?
Thanks for the wallet.
Dr. Roncero.
Psychiatrist.
7th Left.
Twenty three.
The day I spent waiting at the window was the day she wouldn't come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr. Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
Can't it be sooner?
"No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?
I've got an appointment at 5:00.
Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
Benigno Martin?
Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"The last fifteen years, you said?"
Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, makeup and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's makeup and her hair?
Aren't you rushing things?
I find you irresistible.
I'll bet.
You know something?
Take off three inches of paint and you'd be quite attractive.
How do you like our country?
After tonight I'm going to become a citizen.
After tonight you'll be entitled to citizenship.
"Well, how long are you gonna be?"
Can't you see I'm busy?
Who was that?
My husband.
Your husband?
"Relax, we're not married anymore, we're just good friends."
He lives down the hall.
"Oh, come on, let's get out of here."
Where to?
I'll change my dress and I'll show you the town.
Which one?
"Oh, I don't know."
You're a better judge at that than I am.
This is my new one.
"Say, that's pretty."
I'll get into it.
I won't be a minute.
"Well, uh... take your time."
You married?
No.
Never been?
No.
How come?
I don't know.
Ms. French.
I found just the cabin upgrade you were looking for.
- You work fast.
- Follow me.
This was Amanda Kane's cabin.
Nice work.
It's been over a week.
You think we're gonna find anything?
Cleaning crew might have missed something.
So what happened?
You know as much as I do.
Amanda got on the boat and disappeared.
No.
"I mean, what happened with you after the story broke?"
You can Google all the ugly details.
"Kate, if you don't want to tell me, I'll drop it."
It was like...
A bomb went off.
"I destroyed my life, and I hurt everyone else in the process."
"I lost my fiance, my career."
But you know what the worst part was?
What?
Facing my mother.
"That day, she was crushed."
"She says she forgives me, but she hasn't looked at me the same way since."
You sure you want to do this?
What?
Search the room?
"No, not search the room."
Rescue a woman who ruined your life.
Amanda Kane didn't ruin my life.
She saved it.

- Let me check.
"- Hi, I'm Erin Harkins."
- I'm on the phone.
- You're busy.
We get it.
Can we get an approximate time orientation will begin?
Doctor?
Don't tell me you're keeping med students waiting.
- Check with Pratt.
- I'm checking with you.
- Intractable pain and hydronephrosis.
- Dr. Carter?
I cannot admit him to Eight West.
There are no beds.
"I'm Dr. Weaver, Chief of Emergency Medicine."
"I will give you a brief tour of the ambulance bay, after which our Chief Resident will give you his attention."
"Because, as you'll learn, it's his primary responsibility."
Come on.
- Sorry.
What was that?
- Demolition-site accident downtown.
- At least a dozen injuries.
- ETA?
- Now.
- I gotta call you back.
Paramedics can transport using standing field protocols-
- We've got multiples.
- Wait here.
You know that?
Completely hopeless.
- Any sign ofthem?
"- No, Your Majesty."
We've searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
"Well, keep looking."
"Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored."
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
"Yes, sire."
"Oh, what have I done?"
What have I done?
- Has he kissed heryet?
- Not yet.
Oh'
"Oh,Judy'"
Yo' Flounder' Any kissing?
"No, not yet."
Hmm.
"Well, they'd-- they'd better get crackin"""
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
- I can't see a thing.
- Nothing is happening.
"Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once."
"Okay, all right, this calls for... a little vocal romantic stimulation."
Stand back'
Wow.
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
"Oh' Geez, man."
I'm surrounded by amateurs.
"You want something done, you've got to do it yourself."
- He's skin and bones.
I lost money on this one.
"But the price of the others went up by 200 liras, right?"
"Mr. Eduardo, it's going to be hard to win the war this way."
"Win or lose, I refuse to be trampled on."
"No, that's not an option."
Am I clear?
"No, no."
"They're too fat, too ugly!"
Too German!
"On top of that, they're too expensive!"
Am I making myself clear?
- It's unthinkable.
"- Alright, I understand."
There's no need to shout.
Fat is always useful.
We'll make soap out of them.
"Come, let's go."
They're going to turn these prisoners into soap...
That's their problem.
Tale a look at that.
Queen of the Skies.
"Queen of publicity, that's what she is..."
- What do you think?
"- Well, she's photogenic."
What did you say?
That they'll make soap out of them?
There's a shortage.
Soap is worth more than 200 liras a kilo.
and god knows people in Naples need it.
- You must be joking.
"- No, General."
A meeting?
We're isolated because of Han and Puyo's embargo.
And Puyo's preparing to attack us.
I want to ask Commander Jumong what he plans to do about this.
Call the Commander.
You can't talk to him now.
Why not?
"Is he really dead, like the people say?"
What are you talking about?
The Commander isn't dead.
Even Sosuhno has disappeared.
Yuntabal.
Tell us what's going on.
Where's the Commander?
I can't tell you.
I can't trust you until I meet him.
He's the one who failed to protect us against Puyo and the Han.
We'll take matters into our own hands.
Let's go.
I'll talk to Songyang before attacking Jolbon.
He'll want to avoid a war once he finds out Jumong is dead.
We'll be ready to attack as soon as you return.

I've gotta rest.
"I told you, you shouldn't have done that last hit, man."
You've been doing too much lately.
"You're not doing enough, friend."
I love the venom and the sweet venom loves me.

"Miss, could you please get some change out of my pocket?"
I can't get it myself.
Put the rest back.
What's going on here?
"You should hang a sign around your neck saying ""fully blinded""."
Otherwise nobody will notice.
Stop interrupting my business.
Teach the man some manners!
I'll see you later.
"Märchenbrunnen, Friedrichshain."
There you are!
What are you gonna do with the barrel organ?
- Were you a soldier during the war?
- Of course!
- What is your name?
"- Biberkopf, Franz."
- I'm Sonja.
- Are you from Poland?
"No, Bernau."
But then your name wouldn't be Sonja.
It is based on my appearance.
- Are you allright?
"- Yes, sort of."
"- You're not getting any pension, huh?"
"- Sometimes I get some, but not regularly."
Will you take me along?
"No, I'd better not."
What's the matter?
I'll take you along.
But your name is not Sonja at my place.
Your name will be...
It's better to sell them than to eat them.
You're a degenerate.
All of Naples is degenerate.
Why did you bring me here?
So I can feel as degenerate as you?
We didn't start this war.
We don't sell our bodies for a pack of cigarettes.
A pack of cigarettes?
"Maam, what will you give me for that?"
Right.
With this and a pack of cigarretes I can get bread... for a large family.
Would you like some maam?
- Here
- Thank you.
- I brought you here because...
- Because everyone can be cruel.
- Are we even now?
- Yes.
- Do you need anything else from me?
"- No, no."
Jimmy?
What did I do to you?
It's not my fault if things didn't go well for you today.
"What's wrong with you, Jimmy?"
- Here.
- What's that?
Try it.
"Here, like this."
Are you crazy?
I already have hair.
Did you bring this filthy thing from the US?
"No, not at all."
Ha haahah!
"What's High School Musical 1 and-- dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!"

Bridon Gueermo.
"Bridon Gueermo-- oh, he's such a dream!"
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo.
"But he'd never go for me, I'm nobody."
"That's not true, Red."

I fucked up your life as well.
Never mind.
I'll pay for that too.
You take care of yourself.
"Murat, I need your help."
I am pregnant...
I want this child but not marriage.
If we get to the point...

"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting centre... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply for an exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.

I'll do everything for you.

I'm fed up with your mysteries.
I'm tired.
"Nathan, it'll take five minutes of your time, no more."
And then I'm out of here.
You'll never see me again.
I give you my word.
- You give me your word?
- Yes.
I give you my word.
"You know who I am, you know where I work, you're a lawyer."
"If I do anything wrong, anything at all which..."
It wouldn't take you five minutes to blow my career out of the water.
"Nathan, believe me, it's important."
You have to see it.
I swear.
It's important.
Come with me.
Five minutes.
10 minutes... no more.
And then...
I'm gone.
You brought me here just to tell me this?
What the hell does it mean?
Or is that all part of the message?
You come out with these little riddles of yours and expect me to...
"You see that guy, the kid in the orange jacket?"
Do you see him?
"Yeah, I see him."
So what?
Name of Dennis.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be in...
The End.
That wasn't me!
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ha ha.
Ask anyone!
"Okay, then."
Why don't we start by asking...
your conscience!
Aah!
"Uh, now who's cheatin'?"
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Yeah, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man, that was an accident."
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that!
- Is it?
"Okay, okay."
That's... that's just the wind.
Donkey!
"And apparently, it knows my name!"
"As fast as possible,"
And leave before they get there.
The thought had crossed my mind.

Don't be stupid.
Tell me.
Or I'll turn you over to him.
That must be karen.
Ahh...
Sorry I'm late.
I found the druid's noch
On an ancient roman map.
And I brought you those crumpets
That you like from marks and spencer.
"Thank you, karen, you're an angel."
You owe me five quid.
The noch was a small hill
That was significant as a place
Of worship for druids
In wales 2000 years ago.
"Right, so, I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders."
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, my lady."
(TINKLING)
I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
"So, which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?"
"Go on, fight it out."
"And don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."

"But really, you could've just asked me for the keys."
Just drive.
It's fine.
I just stole your car.
Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
"Yeah, I'm not telling you my name."
I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery is in progress.
Emma Swan.
Good name.
"So, do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
Excuse me?
"- Hey, eyes on the road!"
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky I do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
"I don't know if it's my old ears, or the subway underneath."
- Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
- He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury..."
I heard about that.
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't want to hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
- Why?
- Because he's my boy.
"There's oil under that vacant lot, Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politic me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President you're going to forget who got you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
*****
"Guy,ready?"
"Hey,buddy.How you doing?"
Where'd you come from?
Get back!
"Move,move,get out of the way!"
- What's going on?
- They're under the ground!
- Look out!

Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.

"Oh,this does not look good."
- You were actually near where...
"- um,yeah,no,it was just right there."
- Was it over here?
- The south side.
Okay.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.An l.E.D.maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
- Holy crap...
- It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past,there were multiple occasions.He's not finished yet."
- So you know this case?
"If you can't hold it, you take your ass to the men's room and cry in private on the toilet."
- Like a man.
- I need to use the men's room.
"Look, I know where Betty put the key."
I can get it tomorrow.
She's not gonna stay in her office all day.
What?
I thought you gonna start squawking about how dangerous it'll be to go back.
"Squawk, squawk."
I'm not gonna wag my finger.
It's Chuck's life and she can live it however she'd like.
I can't expect her to sit inside all day and...
- Hide!
"- No, I don't need to..."
"Woman, hide your ass."
"Oh, Vivian."
"I didn't know you were here, um."
We're just closing up.
There.
All closed.
- There's still people inside.
- Cleaning crew.
How are you?
"To be honest, I wasn't craving pie, I was craving company."
Lily absconded with herself.
First time in 30 years I don't know where she is.
I didn't know where else to go.
It's all right.
I'm sure Lily will be back.
"Oh, yes."
Though I don't know about Olive.
"And then of course, there's Charlotte."
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
It's time to show the word we've got something to stay.
A song to sing out that will never fade away.
I know I'll miss you but we'll meet again someday.
We'll never fade away.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.

"- Yes, certainly."
Right.
He told me that no other he love like me.
And then I said that was not important.

That's good.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... and I happened to look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
What?
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
–What's he moving'?
"–Just, you know, warehouse electronics, man."
"CDs, TVs, DVDs."
Same stuff as before.
Where's he keeping his stash?
Are you gonna hold this third strike over me for the rest of my life?
"I could lie to you, but I have far too much respect for you as a person."
"Yes, I am."
Here is your authorization to check Mackey's financial records.
Thanks.
Hope we don't find anything.
I just hope you find the truth.
"Hey, Joe."
It's Vic.
Can you believe I walked out on them?
"When they left, I thought it'd be easier."
I thought they'd miss me more than I'd miss them.
"Guess I'm the shithead, huh?"
–Stacy still on the swim team?
"–Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
"Yeah, she, uh..."
Damn it!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"–Broke, with nothing."
–What about your pension?
Damn lawyers for the civil suit ate it up.
–What about the stuff you took on the side?
–I guess I didn't take enough.
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.
"–Joe, you can't live like this."
That won't happen.
"Then if I do win, you'll have to do me a favor."
"And if I lose, just let Jung Yeon go quietly."
- Sure.
- Hey.
"Whether he wins or loses, he still gets the benefit."
"Hey, it doesn't matter."
I'll just end it quickly.
It works like this.
"The one who attacks first, is at a loss."
The rule is simple.
"If he strikes, all you have to do is dodge."
"And since you're fast, you can dodge him until the end."
"Here, try to hit me."
Okay...
I'll be okay.
"For real, this time."
One more time.
After you continue to dodge like this...
Counter punch.
The opponent may attack first...
But you can turn the tables on him instantly.
You need to get your ass beat.
"Yes, Officer Han?"
I'll call you once we're making good progress.
You can go to Yong Moon Plan when I do.
Okay.
Delivery.
I'm okay.
"The opponent attacked first, but you can turn the tables on him instantly."
[Important Issue
- Controversial Issue.
Updates on Ridgeway's shooter.
Go.
Ridgeway was shot three days ago.
Ryan's had eyes on Wickes for the last week.
He wasn't the triggerman.
"Well, he could have ordered it earlier."
"McGee, e-mails?"
Wickes has contacted three people since we suggested the AUTEC connection to the SECNAV's shooting.
ZIVA:
"Bob ""Smitty"" Smith, Ronald Ostrowski, and Vice President Frank Satner."
TONY:
All haunt the Wickes Steel boardroom.
Whole lot of motive going on.
"Working to clear their backgrounds, but so far, all talks have been work-related and clean."
Look for codes.
Yeah.
And cross-reference keywords with recent e-mails.
Whoever shot Ridgeway wanted to keep him quiet for a reason.
Could be this.
Report detailing the project
Ridgeway worked on for AUTEC.
"Well, it's been redacted."
Yeah.
Can we get access?
Mm.
Won't be a cakewalk.
Leads on the AUTEC hacker?
"Whoever he is, he's good."
Hid his IP behind a wall of alternating secure servers.
We need to get in this report.
Okay.
RYAN:
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
This is a dream come true.
That's very kind of you to say.

Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I know you.
You were at the crime scene.
You're a cop.
"No, but I wear the hell out of a uniform."
This is Kendall Frost.
She's a private detective based out of San Francisco.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused.
What exactly are we doing here?
Phillip Harris was a member of our society.
His death is a tragedy.
But it is also an opportunity for you or Ms. Frost.
Phillip's death has left an opening in our ranks.
What do you mean?
"There's got to be like a highway or something, right?"
"Yeah, there's got to be a highway."
What's going on up there?
Squad up
My niggas
"I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck--"
What the hell is this?
We knock these niggas out
"I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck you wanna do?"
- I'm turning around.
"- Nah, just go through, man."
"Dude, we're not driving through this basketball game."
"You know, Roldy, I really thought you were bigger than this."
"Dude, I'm not scared 'cause they're black."
I'm scared because they're scary.
And it's not like we got Gregory Hines out there.
They're not that scary.
It's my ball!
Turn around.
"Rob this motherfucker, drop his punk ass in a ditch"
"Drag this pussy nigga, slap his ass up like a bitch"
My niggas is my niggas 'cause my niggas--
- Fuck!
It won't move!
"- Shit, dude."
Shoot him dead between his lips
I see some pussy--
- That's not good.
"- Now there's no music, man."
"Shit, man."
- Motherfucker!
- I'm gonna cut.
- Prep the area.
Here we go...

We have an airway.
"I was looking for rings, trying to butter up her parents."
"I just called them, by the way."
They're going to be here in the morning.
Hard to imagine.
Losing your partner like that.
Yeah.
"So, Dallas."
It's a great opportunity.
You got all kinds of opportunities here.
- A state of the art facility.
"- Come on, you're a surgeon."
All you need is a sharp knife and some thread.
"""State of the art""!"
You're not going there for any opportunity.
- You're following a fella.
- I'm not following a...
Peter and I are going together.
Whatever gets you through the night.
"You know, she..."
She told me in the doorway of a Portuguese bakery in Montreal.
She was in love with a woman.
"And she was happy, you know?"
"I mean she was crying when she told me, but she was happy."
"Took a lot of guts, falling in love like that."
You guys stayed friends?
"Yeah, mostly."
Mostly.
What the hell is he doing?
Is he a waiter here?
What's wrong with him?
"Oh my goodness, what are you doing?"
Hey!
How many are in your family?
I have four.
"If you also have four, we're a perfect match."
You pervert!
"Dad, help me."
Me?
Not me.
So you're with him?
- With him?
Who?
I?
- Come here.
- I'm gonna kill you today.
- don't know him!
It goes down really smooth.
"Sorry, it's just that you eat so beautifully."
I haven't seen anyone eat ramen noodles as sexy as you do.
"Actually, I'm a writer."
So whenever I see anything beautiful I can't let it pass.
I'm sort of a workaholic.
I want to eat it.
'I want to eat ramen.' That's the title.
I suddenly got that poetic vibe.
Pink tiny glamorous lips Like blooming nipples
Slightly open
Your tongue that's like a shell's flesh
Accepts without any reservations Those erected noodles
Really.
Yeah.
it's...
Huh?
Tanaka... and his parents had to put in a missing person's report.
But he suddenly came back yesterday.
Tanaka?
You looked kind of pale.
what're you doing?
!
Help...me...!
STOP!
Yu!
are you alright?
what is Noah all about?
!
And what the hell is this supposed to be?
!
you are next.
an entire Arcam research party was killed on Mt.
Ararat in Turkey?
I did happen to hear that.
Noah's ark was later discovered in that place.
Noah's ark?
as it was written through the 7th and 9th chapters of the book of Genesis in the Old Testament.
The humans that God made had grown to become incredibly evil.
God regretted his creation and decided to destroy man.
a man who's heart was right with God to build an ark for his family and for two of every living animal on Earth.
What does any of that have to do with this?
!
Let me finish the entire story.
a different research party was attacked by someone at another location.
Elimelech.
Who was that?
Boaz... a kinsman of mine...
just wanted to say goodbye.
and their two sons left their home in Bethlehem.
they arrived in the land of Moab where they found relief from the famine.
Elimelech died.
Naomi's two sons grew older and eventually married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth.
they knew very little of the God of Israel:
The God of Naomi and her sons.
and Naomi loved them very much.
tragedy struck again.
Naomi's two sons also took ill and died.
Now three widows faced the future alone... together. and I want you to go back to your families.
What?
Mother?
do it for me.
but we can't let you live alone.
Bethlehem is no place for two Moabite women.
My people will not accept you.
You'll be strangers there.
As you were a stranger here.
Don't you understand?
It's my fault that you've been hurt.
The Lord has punished me.
That's not true.
Your God is good.
You are good.
you'll do as I have asked.
Go.
Return to your own people.
I will go;
And I can't betray him.
"Not now, or ever."
We must apprehend this Calvetti.
Do the impossible.
Be quick.
You're crazy; they're looking for you.
- I came here to give myself up.
There's nothing else I can do.
- No.
But it's me they want.
I can't let you die in my place.
Watch out!
The guards.
Everything in order?
- Everything.
I brought her meal.
Don't worry.
I'm not here to hurt you.
"If it was up to me, I'd let you kill whoever you want."
Bon appetit.
Save yourself.
It would be crazy to give yourself up.
What good would that do?
Everyone's against us.
"Lucrezia, Giacomo, even Martina."
- Martina?
The maid.
She told the judges I had ordered her to let you into the castle.
Martina said that?
They must have paid her to make a false statement.
We must find her and force her to tell us everything she knows.
Meeting me has cost you dearly.
This young man has departed from our midst.
"The Lord gave, the Lord bath taken away."
Let us pray.
Come in.
"Just put the coffee on the table, please."
-You're Sarah Beth;
-Yes.
Your--
-Please sit.
-There's no need for that.
I have something to say and then I'm going.
-How did you know I was here;
-l have a room at the hotel.
The clerk told me.
I'm not gonna let you hurt Pop anymore.
He can't stand any more.
"Maybe you couldn't hurt him, even if you tried."
"Maybe there's not anything that can hurt him, not after Brock."
I hope so because nobody can stand any more.
Even him.
So maybe the pain's over now.
Unless you've brought him more.
Have you;
What do you want of him;
Nothing.
I came to help Brock.
I didn't know he-- l didn't know until the train was almost here.
"I'm not even going to see your father, Sarah Beth."
"I might try if I thought I could make up a little to him and to you for all the years, but I know I couldn't."
He tried to tell me how he felt.
How the grass was somehow godly to him.
He tried to tell me and I didn't hear.
"Hyang Gi, get a bit closer."
"Smile, smile!"
Okay!
"All right, one, two..."
Wait!
Really...
"Hey, move your breasts up a bit, like this."
Mom!
"Wedding photos are like your honeymoon, you only get it once."
"Mom, you're not a professional, leave it up to the pros!"
You're being completely rude!
"Rudeness is momentary, pictures are forever."
"It's fine, right Mr. Choi?"
"Yes, are you ready now?"
"The kids are going to get tired, stop it."
"Ahjumma, please take my mom to a cafe or something."
We won't even get one good photo because of mom.
What?
We're going to be spending the entire night like this.
And my feet hurt.
You think you'll get anything with no suffering?
Endure it!
You think I'm doing this because I have an excess of strength?
Let's go.
"Let's go and drink some tea, and get some fresh air."
There's no need for us to be here.
Are you the only one whose feet hurt?
You think I like doing this?
Ma'am!
"I'm sorry, Oppa."
Let's start.
All right.
"We used hand signals, too."
"Folded arms, the table's hot."
"A touch to the eye, we need to talk."
And a hand running through perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.
Get out.
Now.

I grew up...
"Well, really, I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med."
"And now that I've gotten accepted, it seems to only come down to the money."
"No, thank you."
"You don't want to touch the consecrated objects, do you?"
"Step back, please."
The train is about to leave.
Come on.
- I've calculated ten minutes to the refinery.
- Excellent.
I hope the train won't be late.
"All right, my dear chaplain."
Let's go.
"Hey, Padre Julio!"
How long have you been back?
What a surprise!
Are you going to keep us company?
Tell us a funny story.
- Will this wagon blow up as well?
"- Well, the bomb is close to it."
"Come on, we're about to leave."
I'm really glad to see you again.
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, and you?"
"- Same old, same old."
- Take my hand.
- This is Padre Alonso.
- Pleased to meet you.
Why don't you sit down?
What happened to Padre Aginaldo?
The poor chap has appendicitis.
We had him taken to Puerto Silas.
That's why the bishop sent Padre Alonso.
- I'm going with him to show him the area.
- I'm sorry to hear about Padre Aginaldo.
"You don't want to die, huh?"
"Well, don't worry about it, sonny."
I'm gonna let you live.
"Oh, boy, thanks."
"Oh, boy, you're welcome, but on one condition."
"You gotta keep your mouth shut, you understand?"
Sure.
You don't talk to nobody.
You just keep your mouth shut.
(AGREEING) Don't say a word to no one.
You keep everything quiet.
You don't say nothin'.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
You don't say nothin' to anybody.
You keep your mouth shut and be sure you just do like I tell you.
Then you won't get into any trouble.
Shut up!
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Someone's at the door.
Let's see who it is.
"Well, let's go."
You get the door.
"Okay, sure."
"But be sure when you open the door, you don't say nothin'."
Remember what I told you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to nobody.
"Just open the door, see who's there, and that's all."
You don't talk to nobody.
You understand?
"Just open the door, that's all I'm askin' you to do."
Jeremy!
What?
"Haven't you read the studies, Liz?"
A glass a day is actually good for you.
Lowers your blood pressure.
"And smoking's good for your lungs, right?"
What do you expect?
You said we're a family full of addicts.
I never said that.
You said that you were the only one who wasn't hooked on something.
"That's, of course, unless you count the wine."
You.
"And then there's Nick, who's famous for his zany hi-jinx, and Nick's mom, a pill freak."
Jeremy...
"I'm a guest in your house, right?"
Yeah.
"So do you think it would be rude of me if I told you, as a guest, that you're a spoiled little jerk?"
What do you think?
I need a ride to this party.
I am not taking you.
We have guests.
"Oh, come on, mom, what am I gonna do?"
Sit here and watch figure skating-- [whispering] Sit down.
I'll take you.
It was very nice.
Thank you.
Liz:
You're welcome.
"Well, you sure do give your mom a pretty hard time."
I see her...
Like...
Twice a year.
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
ORWELL:
Trouble in the dream team?
(BANG)
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
Come on!
ANNA:
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
"That's a good thing, eh?"
"No, thin like you're not eating properly."
Oh.
"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we going to do this now?
- Good night for a date.
- Our tenth anniversary.
- How do you know it was a date?
I just wanted to see you.
"I haven't asked you anything about whether or not you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to, Harry, cos I just can't."
He's a friend.
- Oh...
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"That's very convenient for him, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
- What?
Aren't you?
"- Yeah, but you're not looking at me."
That's 'cause I don't wanna see your silly grin while you pitch.
"Now, continue."
"Look, Teague has breakaway speed to spare and durability."
"( chuckles ) Now, that is one lethal combination."
Lethal?
That is an interesting choice of words when describing Kisan Teague.
Let me ask you this.
Do you think he's a good person?
A good person?
I believe he can be.
"Besides, who are we to judge?"
We all sin.
"I'll answer for you, Charles."
"He can be a good person, but he chooses not to be."
How's Kisan any different than dealing with Sutton or Jared?
"We don't need any more distractions, Charles."
- We need a title.
"- And Teague can help us get there, sir."
- I really believe that.
"- The answer is no, Charles."
"But it was a very impassioned pitch, so je vous remercie."
"Means ""thank you"" in French."
- ( intercom beeps )
- Woman:
Jason Antolotti on one.
- ( beeps )
"- Good morning, Jason."
I'm here with Charles Greane.
"Larry, Chuck, let's talk Teague."
"- Way ahead of you, J. Been trying to..."
"- Go on, Jason."
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.
The demon is a liar.
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
Come in.
Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
He's here already.
"It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
"Do you want to hear the background of the case first, Father?"
Why?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
"Would you like some brandy in that, Father?"
The doctors say I shouldn't.
But thank God my will is weak.
He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.
"A good soldier should forget his past, and realize that he might not have a future, because he fights every day as though it were his last."
"Really, Alonso, when it comes to inspiring people you are one of a kind."
Come on.
I dont understand.
The place where we they're meeting us is...
It's two blocks from here.
"Also, coincidentally, they're meeting us in my neighborhood."
"Please, can you give me something?"
It's to eat.
Yes.
Here you are.
Thank you.
I've never seen such poverty.
The War had just ended.
People were hungry and there wasn't much food.
just what they got with their ration card.
My grandfather told me.
How everything has changed.
Hey.
I could swear that's you.
When I left home yesterday it was half-painted.
It was going to go in the sitting room.
Should we go in and ask?
No.
We have a mission to complete.
(WHISPERS) He's late for the Angelus.
Here.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
-Is Lola working with the Nazis?
Impossible.
She is saving lives and risking her own.
They're making your mind into mush!
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got to the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed."
"Jesus Christ, what happened to you?"
I almost got into an accident on the way here.
And I told him I was partying all night.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
Get over here.
"- Doc, I'm fine."
- Let me check you out.
Come on.
"He took mercy on me, gave me 10 milligrams of Valium and sent me home."
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
"Right in front of us, there."
I think it's been following me all morning.
- Get the fuck out.
"What are you, nuts?"
- I'm telling you.
I don't know what's going on.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
"Well, I guess you can't have cake today."
What if it's my leg?
"Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself, because you didn't answer my messages."
Claire:
Grawr!
Gr-a-a-awr!
"Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"This is my new friend, Charlie."
"He loves dinosaurs, and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye."
"Hi, Charlie!"
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?
"Oh, do you have to go so soon?"
He smells so good!
"Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony."
(sighs)
What is going on?
"I gave Phil such a hard time for being too emotional about Luke's graduation, but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit."
I know.
It happens so fast.
Luke used to love coming here.
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.
The one outside is yours?
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!
You're lucky.
"When Manny goes, you still have Joe."
"Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less."
We just have face it...
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.
"Luke has a job, and he's dating."
He can serve on a jury.
- You're right!
"Letting your dad rot in jail, that's serious."
"Changing your name, that's Napoléonic!"
"What part are you going to play in your new family, shit-guzzler?"
"Shit, help me, Matalon!"
"How long have I been saying she's nuts, boss?"
"Start digging your grave, dickhead!"
Yours will only need a lid on top.
Music!
Roll end credits!
- I love you!
- My God.
Can you stomach this?
You should have gone to a posh deli in Neuilly.
- Does he love her or something?
- He hates her!
Who the hell asked you?
"And who's you, anyway?"
"Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you."
Idiot!
You'll regret that very much.
"So, Léo!"
What do you think of Parisian Nights?
"This is nothing, wait for the main course!"
Don't you miss the pigs?
"- You won't snout, will you?"
- No.
Why?
I don't judge anyone.
Who judges the judges here?
"Men who have women and friends, they're shelters from justice."
Can you keep on picking my dishes?
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
what do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only h have one shot?
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
"And that whoever you do not shoot, will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground."
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather 'round me here.
Captain taylor.
Mr. Crusoe!
I thought you'd forgotten us!
Are you gonna be leading us?
- I'll leave that to you.
- Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
It's coming from the jungle!
"Lancaster, unshackle the men!"
"Come on, pick up the muskets."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sods!"
They're in disarray!
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Reload!
No!
Hold your fire.
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the Wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"Alright, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she liked to go?"
Any favourite hiding spots or favourite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts, when Ronon was trying to track a Wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
Oh yeah.
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know.
To know what?
Ellia!
Why did you take the retrovirus?
Because I don't wanna be this way anymore!
I hate what I am.
You heard what Dr Beckett said.
You know the retrovirus isn't ready.
I have no choice.
"When they kill the other Wraith, I won't be able to pretend anymore."
Pretend what?
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.
- We've got the guy who killed him.
- A cop killed my father!
- Kesser doesn't have the brains.
- He was convicted in court...
- Answer me!
- I'm telling you!
Your father is dead and this case is closed!
"If you can't accept that, that's your problem."
I can take that gun and that badge away from you right now.
- Is that what you want?
"- Do what you got to do, Nick."
"Hardy, we're out of our patrol zone."
Will you tell me where we're going?
We're going to visit a friend.
I'll break here for dinner.
I'll be back.
Right...
I'll just stay here and watch the boat.
- Can I get you something?
"- Yeah, a guy named Chicanis."
I don't think I've seen him all night.
"Okay, tell me what you know!"
Who told you to lie?
- Give me the names.
- Don't shoot me.
"- Hardy, put up your gun."
- Now!
"No, put up your gun."
"Hardy, damn it!"
This shit has got to stop.
If you have a drinking problem...
You were out of control.
The stars shall be your guide.
"As long as we're headed east, that's the direction we're supposed to be going."
I'm looking for the Little Dipper.
"If I could find the Little Dipper, I could find the North Star."
"Shane, help me find the Little Dipper."
"What do I look like, Harriet Tubman?"
Fine!
"I'll do it by myself, okay?"
You guys are no help!
Just...
Just...
Welcome to Hump Island!
It's time to feast here in the belly of the beast here at Eden East!
Now can you feel it?
Come on!
"Man, we are about to get this party started right!"
You guys ready?
Bingo!
"Hey, yo, check it out, y'all!"
A luau fire and drum show is coming up real soon!
Some of the best drummers in the whole world.
Don't forget to check it out!
This place is out of control.
"What could she be possibly getting into over here, man?"
"Come on, let's not get ahead of ourselves."
"For all we know, she could be sitting in a corner sulking somewhere."
"Hey, we can do this."
"We get in, we get out, we're back before sunrise."
I know...
I know that girl.
San Diego!
I know that girl.
"Here's a dollar, kid."
- Treat your folks to dinner.
- Wow!
♪ Memories are made of this ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
♪ Serve it generously with love ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
"♪ One man, one wife... ♪"
"Oh, come on, ladies."
Buy something already.
"Oh, Sue, why are you trying to sell containers to that fat tub of shit?"
She's never had a leftover in her life.
That's the great Jim Reeves.
Hard to believe it's been ten years since we lost him in a horrific plane crash.
Lucky bastard.
"- Hey, mister."
You a pervert?
- No!
Then why are you staring at ladies through that window like one?
- That's my wife in there.
- How come you're not at work?
How come you're not leaving me the fuck alone?
I'm gonna tell my dad you swore at me.
He's a cop.
"Then he can solve your murder, you nosey little shit!"
"Frank, no!"
You've got to stop swearing at other people's children.
You're right.
"Hey, go play with your father's gun!"
- Frank!
- I didn't swear.
Would you please go in and carry out the rest of the stuff I didn't sell?
What happened all of a sudden?
I'm scared.
"I'm afraid of losing you, too."
But you're doing all you can to lose me.
Doborobon.
I was waiting for you.
- They released me.
- Isn't it too soon?
"Yes, but I insisted."
"Goodbye, Donna."
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
Did you speak to him?
What did he say?
Nothing.
"I just remembered how you once told me,"
"""Doborobon, it's a shame that your life is like water."
"""Clear, tasteless and odorless."
Change a little.
"Surprise yourself."""
But I never believed in that.
"People never really change, Mom."
They just start lying to themselves.
"You can go now, Morn."
I promise I won't bother you any more.
I just wish you could come here for a moment and explain to us why you did all this.
"Well, now I'm in your house."
I have a lot of spare time so I'm pondering.
I'll probably understand something in the end.
"Previously, on ""Satisfaction""..."
- Who's in the conference room?
But are the points in the number line still there?
"Yes, they are embedded in Q, right?"
"So, you might wanna say how Z is embedded in Q. Ok?"
"So, we want these pairs to extend Z so that..."
"Ok, which classes will correspond to Z... to the elements of the natural numbers?"
"What will I... if I... give me the number five, what class would you hope that it somehow associated with?"
"Yeah, how about five over one, so that, for instance, n over one in Q corresponds to n in Z."
So this is the other thing that we might hope for in our construction.
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, if you've taken an Algebra course, then what we are looking for is an isomorphism of a..."
Z into Q.
"But, if you don't know these words yet, that's ok."
"Ok, so tell me what the equivalence relation should be."
"So, after grade school, or after enough examples, we see that, what?"
"Q is the set of all, let's say, m over n..."
"Here's a def... here's a... these are equivalence classes... such that m, n are in Z, n is not zero, where m over n is an equivalence class of a... is the equivalence class of m coma n with the relation..."
What relation?
"Ok, tell me when p... two things, two ordered pairs are equivalent."
When will p coma q be equivalent to m coma n?
Steve.
[Student speaking].
Good!
This is otherwise known as the... what are some name...
You cross multiply to check whether fractions are the same...
Yes that's the equivalence relation...
So with this relation these are equivalent if... if what conditions are true?
Steve suggested doing what?
"Let's take p times n, and check whether it's the same as what? q times n."
And what else?
Let's just demand that n and q not be zero.
Ok?
Which is good today and good tomorrow.
Dr:
"Yes, it lowers heart disease and cancer down the road."
S:
I had no clue.
I thought the flu shot was just a nice thing to avoid a week of the sneezing.
But flu shot can actually reduce your cancer...
Dr: ...and heart disease down the road.
And we have to think long-term as a society.
S:
What about statins?
"I mean, it seems things like Lipitor, etc.--"
"no one should take medical advice based on a thing in a video-- but, are taking it, just for heart disease?"
Or are people taking it more broadly now?
Dr:
Listen:
"I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound affect on cancer, heart disease, stroke, potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases."
"And again, giving no recommendations, but what I say is, you and parents should talk to your doctor and say,"
"""Why shouldn't I be on this drug?	"""
S:
And there are some side effects?
Are they easy to test for?
Dr:
"They test for them, and they're reversible."
You have to do a risk-benefit analysis.
"Have to look at you and say, are you at high risk for XYZ?"
"If you are, what can prevent it or delay it?"
"The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease."
S:
This is fascinating.
"But no advice here, everyone should talk to their doctor."
Dr:
"-What the (bleep) is happenin', forum?"
"Listen, if you have a girlfriend, don't put her  on an ATV and make her ramp things."
-(man) Here we go.
Oh-ho!
(laughing):
Oh no!
-And wouldn't it be polite to make sure she  hasn't broken her neck before you start laughing?
"I mean, look at that."
I think she may have actually kissed her own ass.
"(man in video laughing) Yeah, you hear this dumbass laughing?"
"Epic boyfriend FAlL man, really."
Are you guys ready for it?
Are you guys ready for the cutest six seconds ever!!
Ever!!
"That you'll ever!! see in your life, ever?!!"
Check it out.
So damn cute!
"That's actually a viral video back from 2007, but, I mean, look at them."
"I want that one, that one, that one, and that one."
"But not that one, 'cause he looks like an (bleep)hole."
"Seriously though, cutest furry little bastards ever!!"
"All right, this last video, it's simple, it's incredible, it's tragic..."
"You know, just watch."
(imitates crash)
"Now, this video really bothers me."
Mainly because the woman isn't doing stupid.
"She isn't playing with gasoline, she isn't drag-racing, she isn't playing with sharp objects, but yet she still gets hurt."
And I feel so bad for her... that I'm actually still gonna do the super slow-motion replay over the funny voiceover.
"-(high-pitched voiceover singing) Stack these cans, all day long"
Stack these cans While I sing this song
"Hey, I didn't know creamed corn is on sale..."
Whoa!
Come...
What's this?
Another temple of death?
"It's my tomb, Antony"
"When I die, it will be sealed tight"
"Here is where I'll lie, but not be confined"
"Beyond flesh, I will journey to the next life and back at will"
"And there, my sweet, noble king,"
I have reserved a place for you to travel with me
"I will lie anywhere with you, Cleopatra, but I'm not ready to accept death, not, not yet"
"Tonight, I had a dream"
I was winning a great battle!
ln the desert!
Even the ground was in my favor
"Octavius' army was marching on impossible terrain no place to deploy, nowhere to maneuver his army"
"lf I strike him, and I strike him hard and fast,"
I can stop his momentum...
And finish him in the desert!
That's right!
"So we may finally realise your vision... of uniting the east and west in a new Golden Age of light, of love, and dominion"
Antony!
Let me and my men come with you
"No, I need someone here I can trust"
You'll see that the Queen is safe?
On my life
These are just ornaments
"Still, Octavius will not have them"
"Your Majesty, this is the whole list?"
You must complete this side
Yes
Where is Caesarian?
I haven't seen him of late
[Student speaking].
Interesting.
"That's not something I'm going to demand right away, but what's a more important consideration?"
Second row here.
[Student speaking].
"Good, tell me your name... n cannot equal zero, David said."
"So m, n are in Z and n is not zero."
Ok?
"This is one possible answer you might give to this question, but it is not very satisfactory, for a few reasons."
Probably the most important reason is... we have no idea what this notation means.
What do you mean by m over n?
Right?
What's that mean?
The integers don't have a division defined on them.
Right?
What does it mean?
"Ok, so I'm just gonna say this is not quite good enough."
Because we don't know what you mean by... what's this symbol.
What does this mean?.
"Ok, so, let's try to be a little more careful."
And we can be guided by what we do know.
"So, let's think about the motivation."
"So, when we think about fractions, you know, we're usually thinking about trying to teach children something about dividing,"
"I don't know, cakes into pieces or something like that, right?"
"So, you know, you might for instance take a cake, which looks remarkably like an interval"
"[Laughter]... and dividing it into, I don't know, three pieces, and giving somebody one of those three pieces, ok?"
"We have a name for this fraction, we call it?"
One third.
Right?
Ok.
One third.
"Which really means one part of three, right?"
"I like the white, white pages."
"White, easy to read white stuff."
We get some people in here that like to work too much.
"White on the dark, and making him really dizzy. ,, ."
"I used to, um, I used to be in charge of a lot of the websites for a university."
And I imagine that dealing with academia is very similar to dealing with the government. .
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, science is academia, science at Stanford."
"Exactly, it is."
"Really challenging, and I feel your pain. ,, ."
"Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, yeah."
"It's a, it's a challenge.'Cause I do want done."
"And, you know, it is hard to work on a team."
"Because everyone has a different, uh, view of what a website should look like."
"Well, and I think that the biggest challenge for me was getting, getting."
People to understand that the website isn't about them and it shouldn't be what they want.
"It should be for the audience, who is going to the website and how do they consume information in, in the easiest, most efficient way."
Yeah.
Right.
And that's what the content management system department.
"Exactly. , can be the other way around."
"But um, I, like I said, you're side is very helpful, I, you guys have so many good programs I wish I had more time to just sit and just watch some of them."
And then I got this new DA 100 camera but there's really not much happening there for that one. .
"But uh, we do have some digital uh reflex uh, it's at least for the moving piece, um, that's the part I. Used to."
"I mean, I bet my constant was a negative 79."
"I mean, forever."
"But uh, there's digital ones that are, they, they have a lot more stuff, they're a"
little more complicated.
They do.
"I have um, a 90, a D 90."
"The, oh yeah, yeah, the"
D 90.
So
I think kids are going to push my buttons.
"And that's the thing that scares me the most about going back to school, just the other kids."
"After three short months, Adam is starting again at Boston High."
His brief success in the jail classroom is a stark contrast to what he is about to face.
It's like asking a baby to read.
And I said it was like to trying to make gold out of straw like Rumpelstiltskin.
And mom said it was like trying to make silk purse out of--
Adam is still well below grade level and Doctor Andrea Weiss worries that there is nothing in place to help him.
"When I went back to test him, he hadn't made any progress."
But he shouldn't have.
There was no way for him to make progress because he needs specialized instruction.
He's not going to get it by osmosis.
"He's not going to stand in a room and it's going to, you know, kind of go through his pores."
It's not going to happen.
"He needs somebody to say, look, this is the way to do it."
This is the structure.
This is the recipe.
It works every time.
And then he'll own it.
What's that called?
Food chain.
Exactly.
Food chain.
Adam has been placed in two Special Ed classes.
"But the kids here have such a wide variety of learning problems, that, ironically, Adam appears to be doing better than he really is."
An element in all organisms is--
Carbon.
"Carbon, exactly."
"Academically, he's probably at the top of my classes."
"I have the whole gammut, you know."
"I have real low level, acting out kids."
"40 would be for the average female adult, 50 would be for the average male adult."
"But it's funny, we don't tell that to kids."
"I only learned this recently myself, too."
"Going through my whole life, and never really bothering to find out."
And nobody ever bothered to tell me.
"It's like saying,"
"""Here, have the keys to my car, go pick up some stuff for me, go get my groceries."" But I didn't teach you how to drive the car."
"Teaching kids, ""You got to eat it"", but not teaching them how, or how much."
"Now, again, let me show you how easy it is to get protein."
Especially here in the United States.
"Your standard American diet for breakfast, you got your bacon, you got your cow's milk, and you got your hen periods."
How many slices of bacon would you want?
"I know you might not eat bacon now, but how many slices do you remember as a kid, maybe?"
"Maybe 2, OK?"
Each slice is 5 grams.
Two times five.
How many eggs would you want?
2?
Each egg has 6 grams.
So what are we at?
10 + 12 is 22.
How many glass of milk?
One glass.
Each glass has 8 grams.
So you are at what?
30.
"We are not even done with breakfast, this is not including the toast with cow's butter you might put on it."
"So, you are not even done with breakfast, and you are almost at the limit."
"The average American does not need to worry about getting enough protein, they need to worry about getting too much protein."
That's why the U.S. has the highest rates obesity in the entire world.
"And people always tell me, ""Jesus."
What?
You divide by something is the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
So I'm multiplying by the inverse of 1/4.
"So this is going to be equal to-- well, we could divide the numerator and denominator by 2, so the 4 becomes a 2, the 2 becomes a 1."
"5 times 2 is 10/1, So it's just 10."
Part B.
Or let me do every other one.
C. 5/11 divided by 6/7.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 5/11 times the inverse of 6/7, so times 7/6."
"And so we get, this is 5 times 7 is 35 over 66."
And that's in lowest common form or simplified form.
So E.
Let's do E.
"E, we have negative x over 2 divided by 5 over 7."
"Once again, this is the same thing as negative x over 2 times 7/5, which is equal to negative 7x over 10."
Think you're getting the hang of it.
Let's do part G here.
We have a negative 1/3 divided by negative 3/5.
"Well, this is going to be the same thing as negative 1/3 times the inverse of this, times negative 5/3."
I just swapped the numerator and the denominator.
So this is going to be equal to-- the negatives cancel out.
A negative times a negative is a positive.
1 times 5 is 5.
3 times 3 is 9.
Let's do one more.
Let's do I.
Part I. 11 divided by negative x/4.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 11 times the inverse of this."
"The multiplicative inverse of it, times negative 4/x."
"And if this confuses you-- actually, I shouldn't write multiplying."
That looks just like an x.
I should say this the same thing as 11 times negative 4/x.
"Or you could view this as 11 over 1 times-- you could even view it as negative 4/x, which is equal to minus 44/x, or negative 44/x."
People are dying because they drink their neighbor's waste.
The water is so unclean that it contains your neighbor's waste.
This is hard for many environmental enthusiasts to grasp.
Climate change overwhelms them so much that they forget reality.
They forget that two million kids die of diarrhea due to unclean water.
It's horrible that we don't have clean drinking water in the world.
And that we have air pollution because houses don't have chimneys.
That contributes to childhood pneumonia.
It's a major environmental problem.
"At the same time, I say the climate is the biggest environmental threat."
But not the biggest environmental problem - it's a future problem.
You have to think several thoughts at once.

Sad Movie
"This year, 32 public libraries are scheduled to open in Seoul."
"The city announced it as part of a plan to introduce 48 libraries,"
"First, let's have a meeting regarding the design."
I think I can be a better man.
"Young Master, have you fallen in love with me?"
"Well, I mean..."
"You did all this today, ... and I'm a bit dumb about stuff like that."
Really?
"If you've realized that you're too dumb to realize something like this,"
I must have...
Think about it carefully.
So am I too dumb to realize it or not?
What did he mean by that?
Chang Hui.
So his name was Chang Hui!
She may not be worthy enough to marry into Yongmun.
Lady!
Lady!
My Yi Nok... my Yi Nok...!
She must have been a noblewoman from a great family.
"I hid the truth because I worried about the danger, but now I think I should find her real name."
"If I find her real name, will we find her enemy as well?"
"We found an explosives dealer, but he died before he could be questioned."
"A noble prince of royal blood, and a criminal who sells women to China..."
How could they make a deal together?
"If he wants to do something in secret, he will have no choice but to deal with men like him."
He is spraying filthy blood in order to dethrone me!
"The child of a queen of noble blood, ...or a child of a filthy palace maid..."
We both act exactly the same!
"Your Majesty, you must listen to the woes of the people before the prince appears."
You must bring them to your side!
"If you continue to neglect your duties and dally in women and alcohol, the people's anger towards you will turn into a welcome for the prince."
People can be so stupid!
The prince is a monster just like me!
Why do they want him?
[laughter]
Joy:
"Because if you were having sex with yourself, one more question: that would mean that you have sexual feelings."
See?
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
David:
"Well, the thing is...okay."
"The important thing is, at least as far as thinking about my life-"
"If you are going to have a sexual relationship with someone,"
Joy:
Yeah.
David:
That's a lot of energy you have to spend into thinking about that
like thinking about that relationship.
Joy:
"So, what are you just lazt or what?"
[laughter]
David:
"Well, I still form relationships."
Asexual people have the same emotional needs as everyone else.
"So, I still have to think about forming relationships."
I just don't have to think about forming relationships sexually.
I have to think about how am I going to start a relationship without something else?
How am I going to form intimacy in a way that isn't based on sexuality?
Star:
Help me with this.
Because what you seem to be describing is more of a choice.
Than an orientation.
"Intially, I thought you were describing an orientation."
David:
"No, I am describing an orientation."
Star:
I sat up till after midnight studying *The Roman Ritual*... ...thinking about what lay ahead.
You mean *The Roman Ritual* *of Exorcism*.
A text used by Catholic priests... ...as a guide to performing the exorcism rite.
"Yes, I think I actually fell asleep with the book in my hand."
What happened next?
"*I woke up, freezing. *"
*It was exactly 3 a. m.*
Three a. m. is the demonic witching hour.
It's a way for demons to mock the Holy Trinity.
"It's an inversion of 3 p. m., the miracle hour... ...which is traditionally accepted as the hour of Christ's death."
I thought I smelled something burning.
*Only later did I connect it... *
*... and I remembered that that same* *smell of something burning... *
*... had been perceived by Emily. *
"Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and..."
"Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our..."
At the hour of...
"What do you make of this gesture, this nod in your direction?"
I don't know.
"Some kind of acknowledgment, I guess."
That the game is on.
"You're really God's gunslinger, aren't you, Father?"
Standing tall and facing the devil with your prayer book at your side.
"Objection, Your Honor."
Counsel's harassing my witness.
Sustained.
"Mr. Thomas, you know I won't allow that in my courtroom."
"Forgive me, Your Honor."
"Father, did you understand this black-robed figure to be the devil?"
I believe it was a demonic manifestation.
Like the demonic force you believe possessed Emily?
- Yes.
-I've never driven one of these
-She's a M.I.L.F.
-She's a M.I.L.F.
-get back in you cage!
-I'm gonna change your grade kiddo

My name is Autumn Moon.
I quit school after junior high.
I was no good in my study.
But the education system was no better.
It not only excludes me from further study... ...but produces juveniles like me.
"I've got nothing to do but hang around public playgrounds... ...playing basketball, talking part in brawls... being recruited as or recruiting triad members."
Stop!
No way!
Can I have a shoot?
This half-witted jerk is Sylvester.
I never found out his last name.
But I'm sure he's no Stallone.
"I ""recruited"" him from the street."
He was being bullied by a group of students and I came to help him.
"Well, at least he was smart enough now... ...that I could provide protection for him."
"That's how he became my ""junior""."
One brags about being a Big Brother. ...but one doesn't boast oneself of having a retard like sylvester as junior.
If anyone of you will never bully him again... ...I'll make sure you pay for it.
"Well, you may think I'm worth nothing because"
I'm jobless and hang around all day... ...but that's not exactly true.
My job is to help Big Brother Wing collect debts.
"I'm lone wolf type of person, doing whatever I like to do."
"To me, freedom counts first."
I'm not like the rest of them because I have brains.
I don't take orders.
So it has this four pattern.
"So can we come up with any term that is a multiple of 4, what is our value?"
Well at 4 our value is minus 3.
What's the next multiple of 4?
8.
At 8 our value's minus 3.
So in general-- and if we did 12 we'd also get minus 3.
If you don't believe me you should try it out.
"So at any multiple of 4, we know our value is minus 3."
"So what I do is, they want to know the 55th term."
So what term is a multiple of 4 that's closest to 55?
"Let's see, is 56 a multiple of 4?"
Yeah.
56-- that's 10.
"14 times 4 is 56, right?"
"So the 56th term, we know the 56th term because 56 is a multiple of 4, just like 4 and 8 and 12."
So the 56th term-- I have trouble saying that.
Maybe I have a little lisp.
"56th term is negative 3, right?"
Because it's a multiple of 4.
"If the 56th term is negative 3, what is the 55th term?"
"Well the term before the negative 3 term is always the negative 5 term, right?"
"Up here, negative 3?"
It's always negative 5.
"So the answer is negative 5 is the 55th term, and that is choice A."
Very good.
"All right, let's move on to the next question."
"I know that one's a little hard, and those you always just have to experiment a little bit, try to see the cycle, and then make sure you have your terms right."
You know that you're starting on the first term as opposed to the 0 term.
And then figure out what the easiest value is as close what they're asking as possible and then you can kind of move backwards or forwards.
That's how I do it.
That's so you don't get too confused with the shifts on the terms.
"962 01:18:56,900 --&amp;gt; 01:18:59,383 If that's so, let's go and give joy to the fair 963 01:18:59,383 --&amp;gt; 01:19:03,900 But I am in this state, I mean my clothes are not so suitable, 964 01:19:03,900 --&amp;gt; 01:19:06,200 let me not embarrass you later."

I will be right back.
"983 01:21:50,000 --&amp;gt; 01:21:54,900 I guess you would like this one in your hands to be real now."
"984 01:21:55,000 --&amp;gt; 01:21:58,700 It wouldn't be worth to spend my bullet for you"
"985 01:22:00,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:04,600 Are you begrudging Mira because of me?- Get out of my sight."
"986 01:22:04,900 --&amp;gt; 01:22:07,300 Nothing happened between us."
"987 01:22:07,719 --&amp;gt; 01:22:09,953 Got it.. 988 01:22:09,995 --&amp;gt; 01:22:12,295 the beating you ate was not enough for you 989 01:22:12,316 --&amp;gt; 01:22:16,238 If you want we can continue in a place, where is no risk of fire."
"990 01:22:16,866 --&amp;gt; 01:22:20,904 I don't expect you to thank me because I didn't give you away 991 01:22:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:22:26,600 but I thank you because you returned and took me out."
"992 01:22:28,019 --&amp;gt; 01:22:30,393 Get out of my sight!"
"993 01:22:30,500 --&amp;gt; 01:22:36,500 Someone who owes an apology to everyone shouldn't be so aggressive Orkun!"
"994 01:22:36,600 --&amp;gt; 01:22:41,000 We are aware of what you did and asked Yaman ."
"995 01:22:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:22:44,900 I am sure your family feels like that too."
"996 01:22:45,100 --&amp;gt; 01:22:52,200 If they knew the truth they would have a big disappointment."
I am sure.
"997 01:22:52,269 --&amp;gt; 01:22:55,430 But as Yaman prefers to keep quiet about this issue... 998 01:22:55,700 --&amp;gt; 01:23:00,500 I will respect his decision too."
"999 01:23:00,753 --&amp;gt; 01:23:04,071 I want to help in compensating the expenses 1000 01:23:04,110 --&amp;gt; 01:23:08,110 I am happy to hear this from you but... 1001 01:23:08,200 --&amp;gt; 01:23:13,500 I will be happier if both of you work to renovate the house."
"Okay, I worked for Pioneer"
"Hybrid International, out of Adair, illinois."
I worked under plant breeder Dr. Mark Hoffback.
And I reported to Bruce Edson.
He's a senior research associate for Pioneer.
And my project was related with nitrogen-use efficiency corn hybrids.
"The field that I worked with was flooded out not once, not twice, but three times."
And if you there today there is only soybeans that high.
"In other words, we had to contact other research stations around the Midwest and go"
[Text on screen:
"Josh, student intern]: to their nitrogen-use efficiency plots and collect our data."
"So I went to Marion, Iowa; Princeton, illinois; and Johnston, Iowa, which is Pioneer's world headquarters."
And I collected my data from their locations.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So what would you say is the most exciting thing about your internship this summer?
Josh:
"The most exciting thing was to work with very smart, intelligent people that know a lot about the maize or the corn crop."
"And most of all, their passion about it."
They really
like what they do.
And it made me like what I do.
Learning from those people is worth more than the paycheck every week.
"Or most importantly meeting those people for down the road future references, for possibly a job after graduation."
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
Thanks a lot for talking with us.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Bill.
William Bailey:
"Hello, Beth."
Beth Seaton:
"My lord, this isn't small issue."
That shop means everything to me.
My means of earning.
The only way to support my family.
And I built that shop with hard work.
"Now, it's just a piece of land."
And no one's ready to buy that as well.
"These people say,  "" Donate with faith.. """
""" ..and you'll never be wronged "" ."
"And the insurance people say  "" Pay your premiums on time.. """
""" ..we're there in your troubled times "" ."
I gave donations and also paid my premiums.
But none of them are willing to help me.
I am an ordinary human.
A middle-class man.
"My family, my wife and children.. ..will be forced to live on streets."
"No, my lord."
You'll have to give me a chance.. ..to defend my case in this court.
And the constituency of lndia gives me the right.. ..to voice my plea in this court.
"So please, my lord."
One crore is a big amount for a middle-class businessman.
"And especially, when it's a question of his survival."
"So, the court accepts Kanji Lalji Mehta's case."
Silence.
"And only after carefully examining.. ..all the evidences and arguments.. ..the court will give its verdict, whether.. ..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will get his compensation or not."
"And if he does, then who will pay him?"
"The insurance company or, the temple."
The court's adjourned for the day.
Wait.
Wait.
You can perform all the veneration you want.. ..and ring those bells as many times you wish.
Your God razed down my shop.
But you know - consumer resistance against factory farming is steadily growing due to the increasing awareness of the animal suffering that it entails.
And sometimes you come across people from an entirely different background who surprise you.
It was in America that I met a man who is known as the Mad Cowboy.
He was a factory farmer who got out of the livestock industry and went vegetarian around the time of the Mad Cow Disease crisis in Europe.
"Hi, nice to finally meet you."
Nice to see you're un-lost again.
"- Yeah, finally, we made it."
Welcome to my humble abode.
- Thank you.
It's nice and warm here.
This is on the farm.
"And this is one of the dogs we had, which was Sam."
Good critter.
That's the farm ...
"I'm a fourth generation farmer, rancher, feedlot operator from Montana."
"At one time I had 7000 head of cattle, 12,000 acres of crops and 30 employees."
I spent 45 years of my life in production agriculture.
Not something I learned from a book.
I learned it by doing it.
I was a factory farmer.
The worst of all.
"Not a family farmer, but a factory farmer."
Never met a chemical I didn't like.
We'd actually grind up animals and feed them back to our animals.
Had all of the bad habits ...
What are you doing here?
- Branding.
- Ughh.
See there.
I've branded hundreds of thousands of animals.
It's still allowed in America?
- Absolutely.
And YU is just answering =)
SHUT UP!
You!
Yes?
Not you!
Him!
What's your name?
MI
Yes You!
I am Ml...
He is MI and I am YU!
And i'm about to whoop your old a## man because i'm sick of playing games!
YOU!
Ml!
Everybody's a## around here!
Him!
I'm gonna kick his....
Carter!
Carter!
I'm kicking his a##!
I'm kicking it!
So two years ago today
"February 11, 2006 my partner, Juan Montealegre died in Miami"
"For those who were listening to Yeast Radio at the time will recall the entire ordeal and the memorial service is on Yeast Radio in complete unedited form if you go to somewhere around February 15th or 14th, 2006 the funeral was on February 14th, 2006"
"I want to show you something, though which is the point of this video"
"This is Juan's death certificate now I've crossed out the parts that I don't want to show because they are, you know, irrelevant, relatives, Social Security, that kind of thing and I've highlighted things I want to show you"
"Now, keep in mind that first of all, if you've listened to Yeast Radio you'll know that I was"
Juan's sole caretaker when he was sick and I had to deal care of all matters of significance and I was his partner and we were planning to come here to Chicago on Feburary 1st 2006 and he died shortly after that
"Needless to say, he was unable to come up here"
I say that just as evidence of our partnership together.
Plus we had already had a business - started a business together - a hair salon
So here is what I want to show you.
They said he was a geek.
"Some kids had told him he was worthless, to go hang himself, and I think he got to the point where enough was enough."
"Tonight, a tragic situation."
"A Perkins boy, just 11 years ago, believed to have been desperate enough to take his own life."
This is an awfully complicated and difficult issue.
"Kids will be kids, boys will be boys."
They are just cruel at this age.
"Here what we get is, nothing's wrong, we didn't do anything, everything's fine."
"They punch me, strangle me, take things from me, sit on me."
Give it to him hard.
He is not safe on that bus.
I have been on that bus.
They are just as good as gold.
My voice is not going to fall silent.
I will go to my grave until a difference is made.
"We reached out to parents who have lost kids, parents of kids that are being bullied all over the world, and it took off like wildfire."
All it takes is for one person to stand up.
Be the difference.
"Go out and find that one child, that new kid standing over there by himself."
Be willing to stand up for him.
Everything starts with one and builds up.
"Eventually, we have an army."
"If we all do it together, we will change the world."

"You wanna know if I was moving on without you I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"To tell the truth I've thinking bout you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"Christmas day, you said you had a ring But you changed your mind"
Too caught up in the streets Boy your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried
And up late at night and I hurt Cause I put in mine and worked all the time
And you never put in your work And I'm going crazy with you
"You got me so confused Cause you walked away, and I walked away"
And we should've stayed baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
"And I'm in love with you Baby I want this, baby I want it"
Say baby I'll do what it takes And I will be here all the way baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry

The faculty is excellent.
I love all of my professors.
It's pretty easy for the professors to keep in touch with the students.
Of course we make ourselves accessible.
"If you have a question, you can always contact them through mechanisms like the online learning system ""sakai"", through emails, through chat."
They really care about their students which is great.
Thank god

Luck was on our side this time
"Mahmoud should be with you tomorrow morning at court and you're ready, right?"
Ofcourse!
Today's case will really help us and I've made a deal with the officer
"I'd love to know, where has he been for 2 weeks"
"It's just like you see it, his actions are odd"
I'm very worried for him
What's the reason for this confusion?
Let's hope he stays that way till tomorrow!
What if he doesn't get confused tomorrow at court and told him everything?
How would we solve that?
We're ready for everything Mr.Sameh
"Medical statements, the guy who got hit yesterday."
Everything!
These will really help us
As long as he's at court tomorrow
"Mr.Mahmoud, what do you have to say for what's being said about you?"
Mr.Mahmoud
Yes?

This is a statement from your doctor
With a list of medications you used to take
"Also, a court case from yesterday"
And she's ferried a couple airplanes.
From North Carolina to Oklahoma.
Stuff like that.
Just little pick up...
You can see her picture up there.
That's her with her uniform on and that's her next to it with the...
"Oh, yes I can see that."
130-something pounds and...
She likes it.
"She says, ""I go to work for my hobby."""
Runs in the family then.
Came right down from you
When did you meet De then and where?
In Grand Rapids.
A flight to Chicago.
I was doing some commercial bill collecting.
And they had some kind of convention went went to around St. Patrick's Day.
So the boss flew down.
There was a big headquarters where the western... area...
That was - I forget the initials now.
It was like a commercial version of...
We did credit reports on places.
They'd have a group - say all the plumbing and suppliers would meet once a month and they'd discuss and you'd keep building habits.
We had a part of our outfit would
liquidate - if a place would go bankrupt
We'd send our crew in to get them out of bankruptcy.
"I remember one guy, we made him sell his airplane"
His twin-engine airplane.
He had a hot secretary.
"He got rid of the secretary, got rid of the airplane and he lived in east Grand Rapids."
Gave him so much money for groceries and that was it.
With the stipulation he couldn't even go to the building for a year.
And then decide what you want to do.
*I saw your eyes today in court when* *I explained the significance of 3 a. m.*
*It's not going to stop* *until Emily's story is told. *
Are you gonna make a statement?
Do you believe it was the devil?
Is the defense ready to proceed?
"Yes, Your Honor."
The defense recalls Father Richard Moore.
The witness is reminded that he is still under oath.
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.
"Her mother, Maria, called me and said that Emily had asked for me."
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.
Did Emily explain to you the letter's significance?
Yes.
She said she'd written it the morning after the failed exorcism... ...and that it was important for me to share.
"Father Moore, was Emily a good person?"
I believe that one day Emily will be recognized as a saint.
- So she loved God.
- Yes.
She was very devout.
"Father Moore, if Emily loved God... ...if she was so good and so devout, why do you think God... ...allowed this to happen?"
- Objection.
What is the relevance of that question?
Father Moore's belief in this matter is crucial... ...in establishing his and Emily's understanding of her condition.
"And that mutual understanding is paramount in determining... ...whether Father Moore was, in fact, negligent."
I'm going to allow it.
"Your Honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify... ...about why God would allow the death of a young girl?"
The objection has been overruled.
"Again, Father Moore:"
Why did God allow Emily to become possessed by demons and then die?
I'm trying to do better.
"Being brillians not enough, young man."
You have to work hard.
"Intelligence is not a privilege, is a gift."
And you use it for the good of mankind.
You want to try it back there?
So is that it?
Yes.
My design to initiate and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world.
Are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction?
"Peter, what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half?"
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.
"Rosie, our new friend thinks I'm gonna blow up the city."
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
"Come to the demonstration tomorrow, and you'll see for yourself."
"And you need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto."
Did Edison sleep before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent?
"Rosie, I love this boy."
"OK, so they just want to know cost as a function of hours."
So let's see.
It's a linear relationship.
We could treat this just like any other line.
So if we write it as y equals mx plus b.
I didn't even have to do this.
So y is equal to mx plus b.
"So m, or the slope, is equal to change in y over-- or let me write it differently."
Because we want it in terms of-- so we could write c is equal to the slope times the hours plus b.
"Instead of x, we have hours, and instead of y, we have the cost."
So what's the slope?
"Slope is equal to change in the dependent variable, change in cost, divided by change in the independent variable, divided by change in hours."
So let's see.
"If when our hours increased by 3, how much did our change in c go by?"
"When we go from 2 to 5, so if we say 5 minus 2, that's how much we changed in hours."
That's delta h.
Then how much did we change in cost?
Well it's 30 minus 15.
So it equals 15 over 3. which is equal to 5.
So we figured out the slope.
Slope is equal to 5.
Now we just have to figure out the y-intercept.
"So this equation, we could rewrite it as cost is equal to the slope, which is 5, times the hours plus whatever our y-intercept is."
"And then we just have to substitute one of the points in to solve for b, just like we did in the previous video."
"So let's substitute the point when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15."
So the point 2 comma 15.
"So when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15. c is equal to 15 when h is equal to 2."
And now we can just solve for b.
So you get 15 is equal to 10 plus b.
"Subtract 10 from both sides, you get b is equal to what?"
5.
"So the equation of this line is cost is equal to 5 times h plus our y-intercept, or plus our c-intercept we could say."
"Emily Rose's condition, in fact, was demonic possession."
An exorcism was her only hope for a cure.
Some of you may find yourself unable to reconcile Emily's beliefs... ...or those of the defendant with your own.
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.
"Because you will see that after the utter failure of doctors to help Emily... ...Father Moore simply tried to help Emily in a different way... ...using an approach that he, Emily and her family firmly believed... ...was her only chance for relief."
And we will show that despite his greatest efforts... ...and his sincere love for Emily... *... there was nothing he could've done* *to prevent the death of Emily Rose. *
Are you okay?
Aren't you gonna eat anything?
*She said it was terrible to hear* *the clinking of spoons and forks. *
"She was always hungry, but she said they wouldn't let her eat."
"Who did she mean by ""they""?"
The forces that were in control of her.
That were inside her.
"You know, the demons."
Tell us what else happened that night.
I walked her back to her dorm... ...and she seemed really nervous and scared.
"*So I held her for a while,* *trying to calm her down. *"
"*I fell asleep, but when I woke up,* *she wasn't beside me. *"
Emily?
Hey.
Can you hear me?
"*I called her father, and he told me* *to bring Emily home. *"
*Jason and I put Emily to bed... *
*... hoping she would sleep. *
And when did Father Moore become involved?
Emily stayed home after that.
"She didn't return to school, and she kept getting worse."
"Eventually, when she didn't get better, we called our priest, Father Moore."
"When he arrived, I sent my daughter Alice upstairs..."
*... to see if Emily was awake. *
Emily?

Come.
Do you remember I had told you that... ... a day would come when your son would call you mother?
Come.
"Perhaps you haven't recognised her, sir."
Do you recollect that she had come with Arun for your birthday party?
"Yes, I have recognised her."
But I don't understand how...
Before marrying according to custom he...
And that is why she was unable to accept her son until today.
She bore her troubles alone... ... so that I could become a pilot in the Indian Air Force.
Because she had made a promise to my father.
There are some things that are greater than the limits of society.
You are one of them.
And I think that you should give your son his medal.
I?

I believe that her son should receive the medal from her.

My son!
Today I can hold my head up with pride and say... ... that I do not know how much penance I must have done... ... in order to become the son of a great mother like you.
Your devotion will bear fruit

"Who are you, demon?"
Bay and the beach with the map and if we'd find something we'd just mark it.
"Because they're trying to get a drift pattern to the bodies, or survivors."
Then we'd come back and drop it off
But all those guys - the bodies that came in were all in the fetal position
And two guys survived.
One guy lived between
Charlevoix and [?].
Dad knew him quite well.
He said they started off with more than that on the raft a floating type thing.
"But it was so bad a night - just a nasty night, as you can imagine."
And the water felt warm to them.
Which it would
The water was 35 degrees and the air was 15 with sleet.
"They said, ""I'm just going to get in here and get warm."""
And they drifted away.
Two of them did hang on.
"Survived, out of the -"
But we could hear when they were breaking out -
"You listen at night, to the transitions on the channels."
Can you hear the radio of The Bradley before they went down?
Uh-huh.
Radioed in.
"It's breaking away, or bending away or"
"And when you flew out with - who was the pilot, again, that you flew out with?"
Don Hanson
"When you flew out, the goal of that flight was what?"
Flew all of the islands.
All around the shores of all the islands.
To look for survivors?
For survivors or anything that would be anything.
"And I was 16, 17 at the time."
Did you know at that time where the location of where The Bradley was?
"Oh, he's in Grand Rapids."
He's got a good job.
He worked a couple different jobs but he's working with ACI now.
On ComCast - the place in the
He's got about a dozen guys that work for him.
He trucks them all around.
"My daughter, she's an airplane mechanic."
Civilian mechanic for the National Guard in
North Carolina.
But she had to join the Guard to do it.
And she picked up her pilot's license in high school.
Her AMV license at Western.
And went to Alaska and worked on float planes.
DC6s.
"First year there, she got laid off"
She was the head mechanic of the car wash.
"Next year, when she got laid off she went and flew in the - worked mechanic for these"
DC6s at Air Alaska or something like that.
The guy got a 4-engine piston plane.
He flies down to Kodiak and around there.
"She blew it there, in a way"
"I think, because she's a mechanic so she's working as a mechanic and he found out - of course, it's a small outfit, just a dozen planes."
He found out that she had a pilot's license but also the engineer thing.
So there was a panel that - she was an engineer not a flight mechanic.
Flight mechanic was on the 130.
"I could fly - any crew member could fly - flight mechanic get drunk or something like that, I could handle it because all you did was flip a couple fuel switches and some tea handles."
"If you had a fire, you'd just pull the handle."
So that was
"But, if something happened on the ground, well"
"""he's a mechanic,"" you know."
But as far as the flying part of it...
"Anyway, she flew the panel for him and he said, ""You've got a pilot's license."
"In 2002, she starts conversing online with a man named Jim Price."
"They meet, fall in love, and marry."
"He just got me right from the very beginning, and we laughed all the time, and he just was my best friend."
"When she was and Jim were together, it seemed like that was gone."
That didn't matter.
All the baggage of the memories that she had were what kind of put away.
"For a few years, she had doctors to help her, a husband's who adored her."
"Then two years after the marriage, tragedy."
"Jim, a diabetic, died of a stroke at the age of 42, another day relive in full pain over and over again."
And we could say time heals all wounds.
It doesn't for her.
"Her best friend, Wendy LaVoy."
"I think Jill's brave, and I think she has a lot of courage."
And she's my hero because of it.
I don't think she knows that.
She will.
"Before we go, she brings something for me-- an article from almost 40 years ago."
I was in my 20s.
I have no memory at all of this.
"Oh, my gosh."
I think you were working at the White House.
"Oh, good grief."
I was working at the White House.
"In her book The Woman Who Can't Forget, she says she's trying to learn to live forward."
"Inspired by her husband, learning to laugh at her difficult gift."
"What's so great about Jill is Jill will call me on any given day and she'll say, Wendy, do you remember what we did 20 years ago today?"
"I'm like, you're kidding, Jill."
I don't remember what I had for lunch today.
Little cerebellum--
"At the same time, the doctors hope she'll help unlock the secrets of Alzheimer's, of genius, and the way all of us remember."
"I don't want to go too crazy here, but it could-- revolutionize is maybe too big of a word-- it could profoundly influence how we think the brain stores memories."

"In this video, we're going to look at a proof that the perceptron learning procedure will eventually get the weights into the cone of feasible solutions."
I don't want you to get the wrong idea about the course from this video.
"In general, it's going to be about engineering, not about proofs of things."
There'll be very few proofs in the course.
But we get to understand quite a lot more about perceptrons when we try and prove that they will eventually get the right answer.
So we get to use our geometric understanding of what's happening in weight space as to get a proof that the perceptron will eventually find a weight vector.

"I object, Your Honour."
Mr. Kanji is calling service to God a business.
Of course it's business.
Take a visit to any religious place.
First you've to pay for parking.
"Then, pay for standing in the smaller queue."
"Then pay for the flowers, blanket, candle."
And the donation box is kept right before the idol.
"As soon as you bow down, you've to put something in it."
And they even charge for the offerings of God.
Just like we're charged for seeing wax statues in the museum.
"Similarly, they charge us for seeing the stone idols in temples."
And the priests have salaries as well.
"His is less, and his is more."
And you even have income tax benefits.
Right?
"So, where's the service?"
"And, Your Honour, there's never recession in this business."
No.
"ln fact, they do better business during recession. "" Oh, God!"
"Oh my, God! """
Relax.
Consider that it is a business.
"Still, why are you asking them for compensation?"
You pay premiums for your insurance.. ..so you can ask them for a compensation.
But why will the temple pay you?
Because...l've paid premiums in their temples as well.
- What?
What nonsense?
I knew you won't believe me.. ..so I have brought all the proofs along.
Look.
These are the receipts of the premium.. ..l've been paying for the last 18 years.
Star Wars!
That's a great one.

Student:
Rand al'Thor.
Brandon:
"Ok, Rand."
"Or basically anyone on a ""Hero's Journey."""
Student:
Frodo.
Brandon:
"You know, I honestly don't think Frodo counts."
"I think Frodo stays as an everyman, and I think that's perfectly plausible."
Frodo stays as an everyman.
Aragorn stays as a superman.
In the movie they move Aragorn from here to here.
But in the books he basically starts here and stays there.
And it's fine to do that.
Any three of these archetypes can work.
I like to put up spiderman here.
"Because he basically fits the perfect archetype of the everyman who becomes superman, right?"
And that's why his story is so compelling.
That's why it works.
But there are plenty of stories that work with the superman straight off.
"And we're talking... in this we talk about power level, which is not always the same way it is."
"There are plenty of books that are about, you know, the young woman who is not socially adept who becomes super socially adept."
And this is the same sort of archetype.
Or stories that start off with somebody being perfectly socially adept.
"I mean, Oscar Wilde's characters are all basically social supermen, right?"
"And we like reading about them because we're like ""Wow, I wish I could come up with rhetoric that quickly in the middle of a conversation."
"I love this character."""

Scientists are still mystified by how we retrieve our memories.
Each one of us has about 500 trillion synapses in our brain.
"If we could access all of them, it would be like having an entire Library of Congress in your head."
So could solving the mystery of Jill Price and her memory turn us all into living libraries?
"Once again, Diane Sawyer."
"As we now know, Jill Price has a unique brain that can, in effect, relive her life day-by-day, including watching the TV shows she loved."
I tested her memory with random clips.
"This is ""All in the Family."""
Can she guess which episode from a few seconds?
You ain't ugly.
1975.
"She had her baby on the 22nd of December, 1975, and this was right before."
She's right.
"By the way, she once helped work on a retrospective for CBS."
"Like, ""Who shot JR?"""
"And I would explain what was going on, and when it happened, so it is useful in that respect."
What was the date of that episode?
"""Who Shot JR?"" was on March 21, 1980, but we found out who shot JR on November 21, 1980."
[GUNSHOT]
And I could tell you what I was doing in both of those instances.
"The final episode of ""M*A*S*H""?"
"February 28, 1983, and I could tell you what I was doing that day, and it was raining that day too."
And what about theme songs?

"Father, you don't have to worry about me."
"I'm an agnostic, remember?"
"Demons exist, whether you believe in them or not."
Your involvement in this trial might just open you up to their attacks.
"Look, Father, I appreciate your concern... ...but you need to be worried about yourself."

"Now, what I need from you is more information about Emily's condition."
Specific details of how it progressed after the dorm-room episode.
"Well, after the first incident... ...she was sent to the university hospital for testing and observation."
"Emily once told me that in her dorm room, she resisted the demons... ...but at the hospital they overcame her."
So she believed... ...that her possession began at the hospital?
"Yeah, I think she did."
"And after that, things just went from bad to worse."

Convicted person Nazif Kara...
Do you think my tensionhas to do with what you're saying?
good morning Nurten good morning Orhan
I was going come to you.
What Ayten he doing ?Is not ready yet?Let's go to my dad's hearing she said she would like to go
"No, he's very sick,still sleeping...hardly slept a little last night."
Really?a quck recovery than .
let me knowif you need something.
There is no waythat the patient can get out of bed he just gained consciencehe should not be moved.
This is what we willexplain to the court
"Come to my office,I will give you the necessary paperwork."
Son...will Mahir be able togo to the hearing? no mrs.
"Feride, did you talkto Ms. Nihan?Will she come?"
For today's hearing willneed to have very strong nerves!
"That son of a bitch will not appear today,doctors would not allow it."
"I still think it's better this way,this time he would not has tostand in front of you and make youeven more nervous."
"Feride, are you okay?Can I do something for you?"
Or are you just upsetfor the hearing?
"See you at the hearing,Turgut."
Mr. Attorney!
"I heard that Mahir Karawill not attend the hearing,do you think it's a good or a bad thing? my dear"
"This is our favor,Of course, because a pencilwill be broken today! we will revengeSuleyman's death today!"
Mahir Kara will not comeand no one will be influencing the decision Feride!
"Where is the son in law will he not come god , god"
"look, pray for us.."
You too pray for me go don't worry come on woman.. where is your drum? oh shit I forgot it.. never mind she brought it thank you Balçiçek.. how do you take this microphone out?
Ok.. go now are you ready?
"1,2,3000 hello dear guests.. welcome all..."
Tonight we will have a lot of fun.. me and my aunt oh I mean me and Mrs Kadriye will entertain you tonight although we are new to show bizz
Tonight we will dance and sing.. oh aunt kadriye stop thumping that drum..
I cannot hear myself talk..
I will give you time to play solo at the end of the program..
Why are you laughing?
She was always like this even when we were kids.. she didn't play the drum then but she used to hold it and hit our heads with it she's a real witch.. she is..
let's hear the drum aunt Kadriye..
"""Hoppa"""
Oh Great!
Why are you laughing?
Hey blondie why are you laughing???
You!! how can you laught with only 1 tooth in your mouth.. yeah you!.. they laugh a lot at everything..
Are you ready? we're ready
Ok let's start
We will start with a song
It was a wonderful concert.. thank you so this means you forgot last night
At one moment I began daydreaming and forgot everything
Who am I.. and where am I.. and what is this place
I just went with them and started daydreaming
Excuse me.
"I had to speak politely as the last time don't worry, be at ease.. it suits you more"
Aunt Kadriye it seems we have succeeded
I'll close my store and go on with show bizz from now on you're right
Get up girl and dance.. such a fool it seem they perfected the job
I hope they finish before they face any problems
God willing
"The food was extremely delicious when it comes to cooking, Nakiye is excellent"
Shewket what do you do?
Two lines.
And what do they do.
"Well, you bring in your initial guess, you bring in your data, and all you gotta do, right, is minimize that sum."
"So all you gotta tell it is, what do you want to minimize."
"Well the sum of remember i've, this x not, our initial guess of a and b."
"And I have ax+b is my guess for my line fit, minus the actual values, square it, sum it."
"Well, I don't need an absolute value here, by the way, right?"
"Because my data is real and I'm squaring it, okay?"
"So, if I had imaginary data, you have to be careful."
Okay?
"So I'm going to go and then it's going to return e, which is there, I'm just trying to minimize this."
"So you've given it a guess: one, one."
And it has an algorithm.
"Okay, so it's a utilization search algorithm."
It just goes to look and say I'm going to change a and b.
In such a way to minimize that thing. okay.
That's it!!!
"Now, if you go to the L-1 case, the only difference is what?"
You don't square it anymore.
"In the L-1 case, what you do, here it is."
"Now I do take the abso lute ? that I'm not squaring I just. ax+b-y, absolute value, sum."
'Kay?
Line fitting.
That's all we're doing.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
Line fitting today?
"So, it seems like we're taking a step backwards."
"We've been recognizing dogs and cats on our computer, and now we're just doing"
line fits?
But there will be an important point to be made.
"Okay, so let's, we got those and here is our thing."
"Now, I should just draw the"
"line, right, connecting those two points at -- that will give me the"
whole line.
"And if I've done this reasonably well,"
"I think it's going to happen to go through -- well,"
not happen -- it was arranged to go through that point.
"So I think that the second line is this one, and this is the"
all-important point that lies on both lines.
Shall we just check
"that that point which is the point x equal one and y was two,"
right?
"That's the point there and that, I believe, solves"
both equations.
Let's just check this.
"If x is one, I have a minus one plus four equals three,"
okay.
Apologies for drawing this picture that you've seen before.
"But this -- seeing the row picture -- first of all, for n equal 2,"
"two equations and two unknowns, it's the right place to start."
Okay.
So we've got the solution.
The point that lies on both lines.
Now can I come to the column picture?
"Pay attention,"
this is the key point.
So the column picture.
I'm now going to look at the columns of the matrix.
I'm going to look at this part and this part.
I'm going to say that
"the x part is really x times -- you see, I'm putting the two -- I'm"
kind of getting the two equations at once --
that part and then I have a y and in the first equation it's multiplying
How are things?
My dad is not back yet...
"We don't know his where about- Oh,really?"
"He sent a message, only to me."
"""I am out of the city, I have to clear my head a bit, don't worry and so on"" - he wrote.."
So much.
"- Good thing,that he informed you.."
I have a terrible headache.
"If you want we can stop in a ""Pharmacy"", before you get the forest street."
"No, i already took some medicines, i have always these migraines..."
If I have the pain I can't open my eyes.
Now of course got worse...-Then we turn off the air conditioner and open the widows..

"If there was a little support for Faruk, if there was a source to handle his assets for some months,"
I know he will pull himself together.
There are some things he is waiting for but...
"Don't cry my dear, don't cry.."
Everything went so wrong...
The only thing I can't endure in this life is woman's tears.
"Don't do it, please."
"For sure, there must be a way to save us from this situation.."
The only way is to pay the debts...
Unfortunately..
The wares can't compensate the debt.. then everything will be sold... whoever buys it.
"Ender also will have to wait fairly to get her debt back, I know this."
What has Ender to do with it?
You did not know?
Faruk borrowed money from Ender too.
Exactly 500.000 US dollars.
"Leave it for Gods sake, this is all humbug (palaver)..."
I wonder why are you so cruel when it comes to Faruk?
So this is going to be 9 plus 27 is 36.
So that is 36.
"And if we want to add it to negative 81 over 4, we just have to find a common denominator."
"So all of this business is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and so our common denominator can be 4, times something over 4."
"We have negative 81 over 4, and then 36 times 4 is 144."
Is that right?
"Yeah, that's 144."
"So 36 times 4, so it's plus 144."
30 times 4 is 120 plus another 24 is 144.
"So you have 144, essentially, minus 81."
"So this is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and actually, I can even simplify it"
"little bit more, because we have a 2 here and a 4 there."
So divide the numerator and denominator by 2 so you get it over 2.
So you're going to have pi times-- this is going to be 44.
Let's see.
"If this was an 80, this would be 64."
So it's going to be 63.
Let me write it this way.
It's going to be 63 pi over 2.
Did I do that right?
60 plus 81 is 141.
"Add another 3, you get a 144."
Yep.
And we're done.
We figured out the volume of our front of jet engine-looking shape.

I dreamed a dream in time gone by.
"When hope was high, and life worth living..."
I dreamed that love would never die...
I dreamed that God would be forgiving...
"And I was young and unafraid... and dreams were made and used and wasted... there was no ransom to be paid... no song unsung, no wine untasted... but the tigers come at night... with their voices soft as thunder... as they tear your life apart... as they turn your dream to shame... and still I dream he'll come to me that we will live the years together but there are dreams that cannot be..."
There are storms we cannot weather...
Thank you so much for your concern.
"It seems like you're doing some secret work, but I hope you're safe too."
"He was a bit strange, but he was a good man."
How can you tell?
"I'm not sure, but he smelled really nice."
"If you thought he smelled nice, then he must have eaten chicken or dumplings."
It wasn't like that!
It was a nicer smell than dumplings!
"It smelled like ""I love you""!"
Then maybe he ate both chicken and dumplings!
"Anyway, I feel like I met a really nice person today."
So you met a mysterious man in a black hat under the moonlight...?
Then maybe his name is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?

So you're saying that ship and warehouse both belong to Yongmun?
Yes.
I'm sure they moved all the girls to the ship by now.
"If they both belong to Yongmun, then did they just loan them to the loan sharks?"
"If they loaned it out to a dirty man, then they must have had dirty business."
What should we do if Yongmun responds?
"If Yongmun comes forward, then we should too."
We may have a fight on our hands.
But...
I don't think they will.
That is the explosives manufactured by Choi Chul Joo.
They are more powerful than the explosives from China.
"If this deal with him succeeds, then will we have unlimited access to these explosives?"
Yes.
"If we add the power of those explosives to our army and weapons, we will not be lacking in the next attempt."
Is there a way we can obtain those explosives without Choi Chul Joo?
I don't want to return to the beginning again now.
Come on!
I had very difficult childhood.
there were so many things i did not have in my life.
"I didn't know about the comfort of a bed at all... a warm house, sleeping with a full stomach , to dream of beautiful things..."
But now i know..
"When one is in poverty it doesn't impose so much, because there is nothing, , nothing!"
One is subzero...
"But now is difficult,Mira."
I don't want to lose these.
At least that will not happen...
"When we met with Faruk, he loved an ignorant but beautiful girl."
"I did everything,.. so he loved me."
"From the day I walked out of that neighborhood, I didn't return there again ,never looked back."
I wanted to forget..
"And, I did forget."
"I wanted Asude to be Sude,"
And it happened like that...
"I know the value of my life better ,than any other women , who lives this kind of life.."
That i don't want to lose ..
Do you understand?
"I don't want my children to live in bad conditions , which i had as kid.."
I don't want you to worry about your future.
So you won't have to climb through life..
"Mom, please!"
"Don't write tragedy scenarios right away, for God's sake"
Nothing will be as you think.
"Above all, i trust my dad."
You trust the man who licked the dust in front of everyone.?
"Don't do it, for Gods sake."
"Okay, i mean i also will not forget what happened this evening."
"but I am not in love with this sort of life, as much as you are."
When I stack another mass on here-- so let me redraw it actually down here.
Because it's a different case.
"And I apply the same force, and now I have this new mass on here."
I'll do it in red.
This is m1.
The problem tells us that my new acceleration is 1/5 of the original acceleration.
So it's 1/5 of whatever this was.
So it's 1/5 a sub 0.
"So the question is, what is the ratio of m sub 0 to m sub 1?"
So m sub 0 to m sub 1 is equal to what?
And I'm going to keep it in abstract variables just to confuse you.
And then I'll show you that you can actually substitute numbers and the problem becomes a little easier.
And you might want to pause it and try it for yourself.
So let's work it through.
So we know we have this relationship to start off with.
"And just for simplicity, let's write what m sub 0 is in terms of F and a."
So we just divide both sides by a sub 0 and you get F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is equal to m sub 0.
Good.
So let's just put that aside for a second.
And let's do that same relationship here with this.
"So here, this relationship tells us that F sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0 times this new acceleration, which is 1/5 a sub 0."
"And so, if we divide both sides by this term right here, we get-- dividing by 1/5 is the same thing as multiplying by 5."
So you get 5 F sub 0 over a sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
I just divided both sides by this term right here.
"Well, what's F sub 0?"
What's this?
Let me switch colors again.
What's F sub 0 divided by a sub 0?
Well it's here's.
It's what we solved for in the beginning.
We just got it from this relationship.
So we could substitute.
Subtract 8 from both sides of this.
You get x could also be equal to negative 8.
Let's do one more.
"Just to really, really get the point drilled in your head."
Let's do one more.
Let's say we have 4x squared minus 25 is equal to 0.
So you might already see the pattern.
This is an a squared.
This is a b squared.
"We have the pattern of a squared minus b squared, where, in this case, a would be equal to x, right?"
This is 2x squared.
And b would be equal to 5.
"So if you have a squared minus b squared, this is going to be equal to a plus b times a minus b."
"In this situation, that means that 4x squared minus 25 is going to be 2x plus 5 times 2x minus 5."
"And of course, that will be equal to 0."
And this will only be equal to 0 if either 2x plus 5 is equal to 0 or 2x minus 5 is equal to 0.
And then we can solve each of these.
Subtract 5 from both sides.
You get 2x is equal to negative 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You could get one solution is negative 5/2.
"Over here, add 5 to both sides."
You get 2x is equal to positive 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You get x could also be equal to positive 5/2.
So both of these satisfy that equation up there.
Now we can write down our precise definition of dimension.
"So if we do what we've been doing, we create a geometric structure from a given D-dimensional object,"
"like a 1-dimensional object like a line, a 2-dimensional object like a square, etc., by repeatedly dividing the length of its sides by some number N."
"So, when we were bisecting the sides , the number N was two (2)."
"When we were trisecting the number N was 3, and so on."
"This is our recipe, and we saw that at each new level we got N raised to the D (N^D) copies of the previous level."

Today we're going to begin focusing on theories that are primarily concerned with environment and how they influence organizational effectiveness and survival.
"These theories are called resource dependence theory, network organization, and new institutional theory."
"Feride ,If you can stayand give you support."
"No need for that ,Turgut ."
I Will do the in your caseMrs.
Judge?
What a fate !
"Mr. Erda , please the defendant should not speakwithout permission!"
Let's start with the procedure .
With your permission .
Do you want to say somethingin defense of your client ?
Ma'am .
"Judge , defendantaddress is known ."
"Accepts all chargesand admits that he forged official documentsand is fully prepared accessed all hearings,for that matter please defendant Mahir Kara wos brought to trial,but not in a prison."
"Mr. Erdal against the accused Mahir Kare was not only raised the accusation for false identity you will judge him, because of fraud too."
He was also chargedthat is included in the job of weapons smuggling .
Mr. Mahir stoletruck full of bullets!
But I ..
Mr. Mahir !were you that nighton the scene?
Mrs. Judge did read fileI gave you .
Prosecutor Turgut was trying to set me upand cover up his dirty work .
"If you continue with these accusations ,I will raise charges against youfor false accusations and humiliation of the Court"
and you will have to dealthe third case.
Is there any eyewitnesseswho sawthe scene that night ?
"Then someone accused Bulent Tyrjaki ,Your brother in law , and a case full of bulletswas found in his shop ."
It's a trap !
"And you can have a dossierand your brother in law too ,filled with charge!"
"All fabricated lies, ma'am."
Judge !
"We reject all allegationsand declare that we are not guilty ,Mrs. Judge ."
I thought you came to meand said that you werethere that night ? is that correct ?
Have you beenon the sceneor not ?
"Yeah , I was , but .."
I wasfor a good cause .
"Since you bought me this washbasin, I'll pay for our meal."
"Go ahead and eat it, Young Master."
I bought one for you too.
Come and eat.
I'll wait outside for you.
I guess I have to eat this then.
Have you stopped going to the government offices and filing reports?
I stopped it because it was useless.
Then do you think stopping Choi Chul Joo's ship will be useful?
You can never tell a lie.
"Young Master, are you... ...going to stop them?"
They can't regain their daughters by stopping the ship.
The parents are doing something foolish because of their own guilt.
They're trying to protect their daughters!
Protect?
They were the ones that sold their daughters off.
"Choi Chul Joo took them, but their parents were the ones that sold them."
They do not know how to protect.
"It's not that they don't know how, it's just that they're powerless."
"I know, because I lost someone too."
I was too powerless to protect that person.
I couldn't go with that person either.
Do you know how painful that is?
You can say that because you're powerful and you've never lost anyone like that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
"When I was young and imprisoned in the Queen's palace with my mother,"
I was fearful that I would lose her.
"I pretended to be calm and comforted my mother, ... but I knew."
I knew that I wouldn't be able to protect her in the end.
"I knew I would lose her, because I was too young and powerless."
I was desperate to protect her.
But now...

"So, we're going to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of negative two-fifths, which is negative five-halves."
"Remember, when I multiply  negative five-halves times negative two-fifths, those numbers don't cancel out, they become one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to negative fifty-halves, or X is equal to negative twenty-five."
"This looks like it's the solution for our equation, but we're not going to be positive until we check it."
"So, negative two-fifths X equals ten."
I'm going to substitute negative twenty five in for X and I get fifty over five equals ten.
"So, ten equals ten."
That makes negative twenty five the solution for this equation.
In this lesson you have learned that you can solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
"I'm going to be asking you a few questions, ok?"
Some of them may seem quite silly.
"Bear with me, alright?"
"First of all, we need to find out, do you know what day it is?"
What day of the week is it?
TUESDAY.
Tuesday.
What's the date?
"It's the 21 of July, 2009."
Fantastic.
And what season does that put us in?
SUMMER.
Summer.
OK.
Where are we now?
"FlRST FLOOR, IN PRlNCESS ROYAL."
And what city are we in?
KENT.
And what country are we in?
ENGLAND.
I'm going to ask you to remember 3 objects.
You're...
Moonlight Warrior!
Moonlight Warrior?
Wow.
That's not bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'll be a warrior fighting against evil men like Sir Moonlight Black Hat!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I will not forgive you in the name of justice!
Moonlight Warrior!
Why don't you finish your bowl of rice in the name of hunger?
Alright.
"Rice, I will finish you off in an instant!"
"Soup, you're with him!"
I'll destroy the both of you!
You are a true glutton of Joseon!
"When I see him next, I will definitely get his name."
"Your life is now at its lowest since you sold off your daughters. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you are to lift yourself up from there, you must invoke your sense of pride!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"If you really don't think you can make a difference, then you should just die!"
"If you're going to keep on living, then you must fight!"
I have been there and picked myself up.
He is right.
Let us pick ourselves from the pit and rise up together!
I forsook my own daughter and considered myself no less than an animal!
Thank you for helping us do something!
We'll do everything from this point on.
This is the promissory note that Choi Chul Joo wrote for me.
One day's interest is ten thousand yang.
"In ten days, he will owe a hundred thousand yang."
We will use his interest money and use it to buy back your daughters!
An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth!
He will try and set sail as soon as possible to minimize the interest payments.
Do whatever it takes to stop that ship.
Security is high.
Did you call to ask how much I got as priests fee?
Nothing.
The marriage was cancelled due to differences between.. ..the two parties.
We are returning in the same bus.
The boys people are at the back.. .. and the girls people on the right.
I and Shambu are suffering in between them.
Why should it not be cancelled?
It is a love marriage.
Is there any rule that lovers will never go apart?
They got separated due to a silly issue.
The groom has.. ..a temporary job but the girls side was told.. ..that it is a permanent job.
At this the girls father got angry and made the girl.. ..take the issue up with the groom in front of everyone.
At this the boys ego got hurt.
So it is an ego problem.
Because the girls side insulted them..
When did we insult them?
They only lowered our dignity.
As if they had any dignity.
"Hey priest, why should we talk with those people.. ..who do not have any status or capability?"
We are drinking scotch because we are capable.
The drinking during day time shows.. ..that theirs is a manner less family.
"You driver, stop the bus."
I will finish off this man.
Who are you to finish me?
"If I hit you, you will go sprawling."
What will you hit me?
If I take one more peg.. ..I will sleep on the seat myself.
We do not talk to idiots.
- But we are talking to idiots.
Do you mean that my teacher is an idiot?
It seems to be your opinion.
Not theirs.
available today in US English and they're coming pretty soon in many other languages.
I hope you enjoy that.
Let's talk about another Cloud Computing Application; this is one of my favorite demonstrations.
"It's called Google Translate, which Eric called summation earlier."
"So the Google Translate App that's available today from Google Apps in the Android Market, allows you to type or even speak a phrase in one language, and then have it immediately translated and even spoken back to you in one of 50 other languages."
So that's pretty cool and you can try it out.
But what I want to do today is I actually want to show you a preview of a feature that we've been working on for a little while--it won't be out for a few months--it's called Conversation Mode in Google Translate.
"And for that, I'm going to invite my colleague Kyle over back on stage to help me out."
"Please keep in mind this is experimental, so it may or may not work perfectly."
"Nice to see you, Kyle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
Were going to be in Germany in a second. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Hold on, it says French. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
We're in Germany. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"So--I know, yes, so Kyle, I'm a tourist and you're a salesman at a local shoe store here in Berlin."
"So we're going to start conversation mode here, and you'll notice that I have a button in English and you have a button in German."
"So, our conversation would probably go something like this."
Do you have these shoes in size 41? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try that again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try it again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What color? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Black or Brown would be fine. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have black and brown. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Can you give me a discount if I take both? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Twenty percent. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Sold. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
"That's a deal, that's a deal. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Vielen Dank. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
That--this really is history because for 50 years people have talked about being able to do what you just demoed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:

Baby blue is so last year
"Thank god, I brought reinforcements, front color, top shelf"
"Okay, this is ugly, who would want to wear this"
Everybody after we do
"You know, I think I'm gonna go bare."
I'm gonna create a naked zen millenium kind of a look.
Genious.
Thank you
"Okay, check it out."
I spent all morning covering these things.
I was so exhausted goes like manual labor of it all.
Broken a nail.
I decided
"Nick, no way, my dad will kill me if he finds that I'm throwing a party"
He doesn't have to know.
He would be out of town.
He's always out of town Brooke
"The first party of the year creates the social Siberia, and I, for one, do not intend to be left out in the cold##"
"Besides, if you back, we will be wearing Monica knee-pads for the rest of the semester"
You're right
Of course I'm.
You're so right
Hi
"Hi, I'm here with Thomas"
Tom
So yh
Talk about your self and how long you have been breaking and how you finding it so far
I have been breaking for 3and a bit years so since October 2008 and
I first go into it at university and the first time I saw breakin was with bboy Diggity
He was our first coach he is a crazy guy neat moves and everything is good so yh good
How you finding the society and how has the society developed over the past few years
Bigger
It goes like this.
"Woo, woo, woo, you are my flower,"
I want to pick you and put you to my heart.
Kimho played a wonderful melody from the cultural revolution of Mao in China.
Behind me on the screen there was a big pictue with three people.
A pilot
A soldier
I don't remember his gesture.
And a girl with a red cap.
Forth question:
What must a somali businessman do to get his business running?
On the picture there was a sentence in three languages.
We must free Taiwan!
Fith question:
"What happend indeed, when someone migrates?"
During this time I concerned myself alot with Taiwan.
I watched lots of videos on youtube.
"One video shocked me, as I heard about it 30 years late."
"It was about a resistance fighter from Taiwan, who opted for absolute freedom of speech."
The government said: we will catch you.
He said: no you will catch my corpse.
70 days he barricaded in his office.
Then the police came to arrest him.
Shortly before that he burned himself.
Some minutes later the police entered and you saw a black burned corpse on the floor.
You couldn't recognise him.
He turned thin as bones.
His skin turned to scurf.
His arms were like this: fists towards the sky.
His 9 year old daughter was at his funeral.
She looked into the casket and didn't recognise that it is her father.
She cried and didn't understand why she should watch that.
"And now, a rockabilly guitar."
Which is nice.
"But what if I want to make, say, a -- (Applause) --"
Thanks.
"What if I want to make, say, a rock organ?"
Is that possible?
"Yes, it is, by recording myself like this."
(Organ sound)
"And now I have that, I have that recorded."
Assign it to a keyboard.
(Music)
So that's cool.
(Applause)
But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
"Impossible, you say."
No.
"It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine."
It's really fantastic.
Check it out.
(Music)
So every noise you can hear there is my voice.
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that.
There's no samples.
There's no synthesizers.
"That is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point?"
Why do this?
(Laughter)
"Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd,"
"I suppose, is the easy answer."
"But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist."
I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine.
"So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see."
I'll be leaving as soon as he gets better.
It might be a burden to you and the young prince if I stay in the palace.
What burden?
His Majesty is very happy to see you.
I took away too much time as you already have a weary heart.
His body was blue all over...this mean that  there must be someone who's harming him purposely.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
"If there is a problem with the food, we need  to investigate the royal chef and find out the truth."
That's right.
We should...
You are wrong.
It won't be too late to investigate  after His Majesty gains back some energy.
What are you talking about?
We need to find out  the truth in order to prescribe the right treatment to him.
"Your Highness, he is extremely ill so please come back at a later time."
What do you mean?
I'm his mother.
Move a side.
Your Highness!
What's your intention for preventing me from seeing him?
I need to see his condition with my own eyes.
Please tell the Queen Mother that His Majesty  is not in a condition to see her right now.
Are you saying that I am harming him now?
I'm really looking forward to how the MV turns out.
Anyway we're done in the U.S.
"We'll eat-up, sleep-in, and get on the plane back to Korea."

Hello
Hello everybody
Hello at the top
Do you remember years ago when they were making Braveheart?
"Everyone said, ""Oh it's ridiculous, Mel Gibson playing a Scottish guy; that's not going to be very convincing."""
Look at him now.
An alcoholic racist.
The most Scottish thing I've ever seen.
"I was going through a town called Bathgate at night. and there was a guy pissing against a front door,"
like that.
He then took out his keys and went inside.
I'm from Glasgow.
"If I had to explain Glasgow to you, I'd say that if I had to pick a city in the world where I could depend on a member of the public to punch a man who was on fire."
To punch a flaming man to the ground.
We should get a photo of that blown up. and use it as the welcome sign at Scottish airports.
"Underneath, we should have the words, ""Scotland welcomes careful drivers."""
I mean the naivety of Al Qaida trying to bring religious war to Glasgow.
We're four hundred years ahead of you guys.
You've not even got a football team.
"There's a fallacy, isn't there, that that baggage handler prevented hundreds of people from being horribly burnt."
These were Scottish people flying to Spain.
People say its good that they didn't hit a fuel depot.
I think it's good they didn't hit the queue coming out of the duty free.
It would have gone up like Hiroshima.
British army have got a big recruitment driving on in Scotland at the minute.
Because that's what you need when you're fighting an unwinnable war in the desert.

"Darling, I am not a fool."
I have read the history of all the lovers in the world.
I then researched it.
After that I loved you.
"And darling, remember!"
lf I get the chance then I will even lay down my life like them!
"Yes, darling."
I will lay down my life!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! shame! shame! shame!
"And besides that,"
Gary's Mattresses are probably filled and stuffed with dead minorities.
-We're stalking prices!
"-All right, so this video's old."
It's been floating around the Internet for about two years.
It's got about 2 million views and I don't know if it's real or not.
"I mean, look at that."
Terrorist Gary?
"""I'm a suicide bomber and I'm so offended."""
"But see, the address they give for the store doesn't check out on Google Maps."
"Also, the guy in it looks like a stand-up comedian that I've seen on TV."
Which makes me think the video is fake.
It also obvious seems a little too f--ked to have appeared on TV.
"-If you find a mattress at a better price,"
I'll kick a puppy and punch a kitten just for you!
"-All right, I've made up my mind."
That is definitely not real.
"So there you go, guys."
"I gave you a perverted cat, a shit-eating elephant, and a racist mattress guy."
"That's it, I'm out."
I'm gonna go have a beer.
"Oh, and the comment question of the day comes from a user named, bing!, and she said..."

"-So, where does steel wool come from?"
Leave your interesting or creative responses in the comment section below.
"Oh, you know what?"
Let's change it up.
Let's open the comment section of the day responses to Twitter and Facebook as well.
"So, leave your interesting or creative responses in the comments section below or on Twitter or Facebook."
But thanks for watching today's episode of =3.
I'm Ray William Johnson and I approve this message.
"So tell me forum, why are you here?"
Now sit aside.
We do not speak to drunkards at all.
I am a drunkard but not a hen-pecked husband.
How dare you say that to me?
Did you see what he said about you?
I am observing you since some time.
Why are you getting aggressive?
There the ladies have entered the arena.
You too enter the fray.
What are you ranting?
We agreed for this marriage.. ..since we did not know that you are worthless people.
See this sari that you presented.
Please do not tear the sari.
That sari is more than enough for your status.
"Madam, past is past."
Please keep quiet now.
"Who are you to speak in between, you bald fellow?"
How dare you speak to me like that?
If not a bald fellow we will call you a rotten fellow.
"Teacher, bald is better than rotten."
Oh!
Is that so?
Why dont you say loudly so that all can hear?
All of you please listen!
"My teacher is bald, not rotten."
"My dear bride, why dont you patch up for what happened.. ..by saying sorry to the groom once?"
You shut up.
Will a sorry nullify everything they did?
"Look sir, will you accept it if the girl you love insults you.. ..in front of all and then say sorry?"
I will not.
Every time this bus puncture at this place.
Is this a hotel?
"And they—that is, the Middlesex County Correctional Department were forced to place her in a women's facility."
But that was a horrible situation amounting to torture.
AG:
"Your case went to the Supreme Court, how you were treated in the court?"
LH:
"Well, there's the illusion—you know, I wrote a book called illusions of Justice."
There is the illusion that we have justice in the United States.
"I made the mistake of thinking that lawyers enjoyed a First Amendment right, and I called a press conference, and I criticized the trial judge at the trial and said that the case was a legalized lynching."
"And before you know it, I was facing disbarment."
They attempted to disbar me by bringing charges against me.
And they asked me to come and explain myself.
I refused.
I sued the judge.
I sued the prosecutor.
"And I sued all of the members of the Ethics Committee, forced them to come to my office."
I took their depositions.
And the case went all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.
"United States Supreme Court said,"
"""Well, Hinds could not have understood the seriousness of the charges; otherwise, he would not have made that sort of statement."""
They sent the case back to New Jersey.
The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed and tossed it out.
AG:
"You're still a lawyer today, and you—"
LH:
I'm still a lawyer today.
AG:
And you represented South African President Nelson Mandela?
LH:
"That's correct, yeah."
JG:
"I wanted to ask you about the trial itself, the only trial for which Assata Shakur has ever been convicted."
LH:
And so then what we can do now is plot these things.
So let's do the following.
I'm sorry.
How many coeffients of A and B which you were two of them which.
"You're trying to get new a's and b's. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'm sure like with many of those, like 35. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Yeah, you can give, if you have something a higher, for instance, if you want to fit it a parabola, ax^2 + bx + cx, you've passed in a, b, c and you'll find out Yeah."
"The higher dimensional, the harder it is to, you get a lot more local, it finds a local minima, not your global minima."
"Your guessing is very important in this, 'kay?"
"The higher, the, the more complicated your guess, or the, your thing you're trying to minimize, the curve you're trying to fit to, the more important it is to have a really good guess."
"So there are my coefficients, A and B, and let me do this here for A1 too and B1, and these are, so now what we want to do is say okay, my data, let's say XP for X plot, pretty much goes from zero To five, and now we'll just say is my y2 fit, What is it?"
It's a2 * xp
"*, oh + b2."
"There's my curve fit, y1 is gonna be a1 * xp * b1."
"And now I can say, hold on, and I will plot xp versus y2."
"And lets plot the L2 fit in red and the y, and the y1, L1 fit in magenta."
Sound good.
"Oh, here, yeah, thank you."
Okay.
There we are.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
I have an L2 fit and an L1 fit.
And look at that.
They kind of don't look very much different.
Like you don't really expect them to look that much different I suppose.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
There's my data.
"And you can see that the L2 and L1, slightly different, especially up here, but slightly different."
"Now here's t he question I'm gonna ask, and this is why L1 becomes important."
We think about our data Pretty easy thing about putting a line there.
"Now, what would happen if i had out-layers."
"Now, lets talk about that formula a little bit."
[MUSlC PLAYlNG]
"""Blanksy's Beauties."""
No?
I've never even heard of that show.
"""Blanksy's Beauties"" aired only three months in 1977, and she was just 11."
Today she works as an administrator at a religious school.
"Her job history, as unsettled as her life."
She says she was 12 when she realized she had begun to live two lives at once-- the present and the past.
"Her mother, Roz."
She was not easy.
"And that's because everything that was going through her head, she couldn't explain."
"Her brother, Mike."
"There were things I would think to myself, why don't you just get over that."
She doesn't.
It was hard for them because they didn't really know what to do for me.
My brother is totally opposite of me.
"I'm screaming, and yelling, and crying, and they didn't really know what to do for me."
You can see the toll it seems to have taken on her year-by-year.
"This profound lesson she teaches about our memories, our lives."
"Is it possible our happiness and survival come from what we choose to edit, to forget?"
Because you said at one point that we have no idea how much of ourselves is created by editing our memories to shape ourselves.
Right.
And I don't do that.
"Like, I still feel bad about stuff that happened 30 years ago."
But we all do.
We can all remember one or two things.
But not one or two things.
Everything.
And I really live it and feel it.
"And I think, God, if I just done this, then I wouldn't have done this, and I wouldn't be here, and I'm always constantly doing that."
"Her father, Len, a Hollywood agent, looks back."
Most of us are like that oyster that has that little grain of sand.
Let's just make some funny tails.
Twist about two inch bubble at the end of each balloon.
And force the bubble to the very end of the flat tail.
Do it with all four balloons.
"I know, it does not look like a crane now."
Some silly sculpture... anyway.
We are going to improve it now.
We are going to use one more balloon to make the crane's arm.
Inflate a balloon.
I use a brown balloon
leaving about eight inch flat tail.
Oh!
I forgot to mention.
Not for this sculpture. but with regards to many other sculptures.
We can use technique desribed in this instruction to wrap balloon in balloons.
Now let's fix the crane's arm.
Just force the brown balloon through both sides of the cabin.
That is the simplest crane's arm.
"Again, we can make funny tail."
It will represent the hook.
Let's make this bubble up to one inch size.
This time I am going to tie a knot to secure the funny tail at the end of the balloon.
It is a necessary precaution.
Be course my young son will play with this crane.
As all we know all unlocked bubbles doomed to be deflated in hands of little kids.
Here I twist two small soft bubbles.
And lock all ends of those two bubbles in one lock twist.
"Actually,"
I twist one bubble.
Lock both ends and split the bubble on two bubbles.
"In anyways, it will look the same."
It looks ... ridiculous.
Come on.
What about the picture Mike?
"Simply misunderstanding, media distortion###."
Tabloid sensationalism.
I don't know Mike.
I saw the mayor this morning and he didn't look like a man that had spent the night alone
I'm happy to report that he's alone and unloved
"Alright, let's move on to something little lighter"
"Hey Paul, how's your headwound"
Hank's still suing### you Paul?
But....
The last thing I need is publicity* about one city hall employee suing another one
Here's the thing

Here it is
My family's thanks giving recipe for the best sweet potato pie in the world
Guard it with your life.####
This is a xeroxed page from the Joy of cooking
That book has been in my family for years
I can't wait to go home for thanks giving.
I love the whole thing.
A little snow on the ground a little touch football game before dinner.
Get to sit at the kiddie table.
You still sit at the kiddy table?
"Big fish, small pond"
Thanks giving at my house is nothing but a bunch of fat overstuffed### drunk sitting in front of a TV turned### up so loud they can't hear each other
"Oh, and me in the bedroom rifling** through jacket"
"So, that's 5 days and 4 nights at the Bahama Hilton? is the continental breakfast included in that?"
Thank you
Your family's going to The Bahamas for Thanksgiving?
I hope not.
I graduated from high school and went to college and business school.
"So, you know, it's important to get ahead in life."
"Sarah Lee keeps up the family tradition by attending the children's storefront school in Harlem, where at first she is a standout student."
"And to everybody who knows her, Sarah Lee is a leader, highly motivated, and highly verbal."
She can really hold a conversation.
She will talk to you.
"You say, alright,"
Sarah just a minute.
Just take a break for a minute.
"Go get you something to drink or get a fruit or something, just to hush her up for just a few minutes."
"[INAUDlBLE] been in the store, right?"
Yeah.
For a long time.
Told you.
"Feelin' it, feelin' it."
But in the fourth grade something changes.
She got real shy in history.
She wouldn't participate in classroom activities in history class.
She wouldn't come with the answers.
She would do her homework but it would take her a little longer.
So she got tired of being slower in the work.
"And she kept saying, mom, something is not right."
"Like, I couldn't understand."
My comprehension wasn't well.
And my vocabulary wasn't well.
And my reading skills wasn't well.
Her teacher also notices a puzzling difference between Sarah Lee's personality in class and out.
By nature she's very energetic and outgoing socially.
"But in class, a lot of time, it's the opposite."
She'll listen and she's not a behaviour issue.
And she'll sort of look at you and focus right at you.
"But I always wonder, you know, how much she's really absorbing."
Uht-oh.
That brought us to seventy.
We want to show fifty two.
What happened was we weren't paying attention to the scale or the units.
The value between each of our numbers is ten because this number line counts by tens.
What we really want is two jumps of one and that will bring us to fifty two.
Be very careful to pay attention to the unit marks on the number lines.
Let's model forty five on a number line.
As we see these numbers come up we're watching our scale and see it counts by ones.
"It starts with thirty five, goes to thirty six, thirty seven, thirty eight, and so on."
We have four tens in forty five.
We can start at forty.
"Five ones, we can do one jump of five."
Forty to forty five.
If we model eighty nine on the number line
"-again let's look at our scale- eighty, eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, and so on."
I see this is counting by ones again.
Eight tens is eighty.
"And, we have nine ones."
We could handle this in a couple of different ways.
Let's think about doing what we did last time.
A jump of five; eighty to eighty five.
"Then we need to do one, two, three, four more jumps of one and we're at eighty nine."
Let's try a three-digit number.
One hundred thirty two.
"Ninety, ninety five, one hundred, one hundred five."
Our number line counts by fives  so we need to think about that as we're working.
"We have one hundred, three tens, so let's jump three tens."
"I have to do five and five is ten, twenty, thirty (three tens) and two ones."
"One, two, and that brings us to one hundred thirty two."
Let's model two hundred fifty three on a number line.
"Two hundred, two hundred ten,  two hundred twenty, two hundred thirty."
"Frank, let's go, please."
"Everybody's looking at me to make the quintessential Italian dish, so, yeah, I'm feeling the pressure."
I'm feeling that I need to bring it.
What have you got for us?
"Clam, artichoke, and blood orange."
"Pancetta, basil, toasted fennel seeds, and guajillo pepper."
I knew you guys were gonna be looking at me
"'cause I'm Italian, so I wanted to do something different and hopefully impress you."
"Well, it worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Bravo."
Good job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you so much.
Look at the texture in that.
"That's what I loven risotto, you know, being able &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to stir&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and find all the little goodies&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- hiddenn there.
- Yes.
"Um, Frank, you ain't playing around, dude."
"That's pretty good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Thanks, guys.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Frankie!"
[Applause]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Frank, the light bulb's on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"- That's it, baby. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All right, David, please."
"I need to start making a name for myself in this kitchen, or else I'm gonna go by the wayside, and I can't have that happen."
"In the veal stock risotto, I put portobellos and some oyster mushrooms, gooseberry-roasted poblano, and some scallops. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Making risotto and&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; using veal stock at the same time is a very dangerous game."
You nailed it.
Thank you.
Really good job.
This is one of the best things that I've tasted in a long time.
- Oh.
"Oh, my gosh."
- It's delicious.
"The poblano, the cook on the rice is perfect. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The layering of flavors.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Well done.
"- Oh, my God."
And then I jump up and say:
"""I won this award last year, but didn't say the most important thing."""
It should look like I just grabbed a mike.
"Then I say that... ...some people are glad that child- ren die, it saves the environment."
Others fall on their knees and say someone has to save the children.
"Some pray to a higher power, but most feel powerless and stare off into space."
They think only crazy optimists like Rosling think it's getting better.
In school we did a lot of variety shows.
I had good directors but they said that I couldn't act.
"""You're always yourself."
"You can't take direction and you can't act."""
So I became a stage manager.
-Were you disappointed?
"-Yes, but the criticism was right."
I have semi-controlled ADHD.
I can communicate and lecture but playing another person takes a different kind of skill.
You have to tape it well on my cheek.
This is totally awesome...
I've been waiting for this for five years.
- Can't you make it bigger?
- We can run it in widescreen.
The total projection was bigger a minute ago.
- We can stretch it sideways.
- Make it as big as possible.
- It's not even half the ceiling.
- That's because of the lens.
"Sure, but for the maximum effect it needs to be as big as possible."
Try widescreen.
"See that, Karin?"
"They said it worked, but it doesn't."
We're not using the whole ceiling.
You lose 90% of the effect.
Yes it is.
"And what is exciting about it is, because this grant involves students and research, the students get to be involved in, sort of, cutting-edge research."
No other institution in the country is looking at pennycress.
Or looking at this sort of approach at off-season seed production.
And so part of my job is to breed new varieties of pennycress.
And the big part of that is trying to produce more oil on these seeds.
"They are about 36 percent, right at the moment."
"And we're trying to get that, up to say, 40 to 45 percent."
And so a big part of this trying to look into these seeds and finding out how much oil is in there.
Beth Seaton:
How do you do that?
Win Phippen:
"Well, we've hired a chemist, and we have, it's called an ""automated GC"" or a gas chromatograph."
And it allows us to look inside these seeds to find out how much oil is in them.
"I actually have one next door, if you want to go over and take a look."
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, let's take a look."
Win Phippen:
All right.
Beth Seaton:
Let's go.
Win Phippen:
So come on in.
This is the research lab.
And this is where we actually extract the oil right out of the seeds.
"Another grant that I wrote with the USDA allowed us purchase an automated gas chromatograph, and that allows us to actually look at the oils inside in the seed."
And so the first thing we have to do is we have to actually count these seeds.
Beth Seaton:
"So you count these little, tiny seeds?"
Win Phippen:
These tiny little seeds.
Beth Seaton:

Manish has developed ill intentions.
He wants to keep the 100 million worth of diamonds to himself.
Manish has turned a betrayer who we cannot trust anymore.
"I don't want Manish now, but those diamonds."
Go and search every corner of the city.
Beat him!
I don't want to hear anything.
If I don't get those diamonds. . .
I will bury you half in soil and blow up the other half with a bomb.
I want those diamonds worth 100 million.
Go and find Manish anyhow.
Is Lily home?
"- No, she has gone to Goa."
My name is Manish.
Ask her to call me when she returns.
"Look, don't forget, it is very urgent."
"Do make her call me, okay?"
He was just as light on his feet as - you couldn't imagine a guy that size could be as light on his feet in step dance.
"The Donie guys, of course, Peter and Patsy, they used to always..."
"Patsy, Peter, and..."
Patsy worked for me.
Best worker I had.
But Peter and
Lester would - They'd get up...
Friendly rivalry.
Which was good.
"Could you describe a typical party at night or something, where they'd be playing music?"
"Yeah, they'd play the music."
They had the chairs sitting around the hall.
The parish hall?
"Wouldn't have any tables set up unless it was a dinner or a wedding, you know."
"So here you are, you're trying to dance and you've got everybody in the aisle and all these old women standing there watching you."
So you're not really doing too much dancing.
"Jack [?] would set up a stable right outside there, right around the corner where they..."
They'd have a keg of beer out there.
"Because it wasn't - the bar wasn't in the - in fact, the kitchen was where the bar is now."
And where the kitchen is was the high school.
That's what they...
There at the parish hall?
Yeah.
"And then when they finally quit using that, they made that into a little library too."
In 1960.
Even when they first put the other stuff out.
They wouldn't have any alcohol in the parish hall.
They'd have the keg sitting on a table outside.
"Yeah, just a table thing there."
And then - so continue with that scene.
"Well, that'd be it."
And they'd just play the music.
"Unfortunately, Al Gore was busy but I did manage to speak to some other people who had quite a bit to say on the subject."
You look great.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Some information.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Hi.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you finally.
- Yeah.
You do such great work. - Thank you.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
What are you doing here at the moment?
"We're out here trying to show people that if they're eating meat, they're engaging in the number one environmentally most destructive behaviour they could engage in."
"And showing people that rather than cars and trucks, and SUVs even, rather than planes, meat is the number one cause of global warming."
Do people believe that when you tell them?
People are shocked to find out.
"We hear so much about cars, and trains and planes and energy, and people don't realise that it is actually the meat on their plate that's causing global warming rather than the car that they're driving even."
Some information here.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
How's it going?
Check that out when you have a chance.
Thank you.
Check that out.
Thank you.
"We use this catchy phrase ""cli-meat change""."
Its really just a way of to grab attention and get people to look in our direction long enough for us to give them a leaflet and explain the issue a little bit further.
OK.
"And get them to go home wondering how is it that meat causes global warming, rather than wondering what's on television tonight, or what am I going to have for dinner tonight."
When I lost my virginity
You walked in mid-lose
That was an honest mistake.
Mom you stayed and talked.
She seemed a bit confused.
"So, you swear I didn't cause you any big problems here at work?"
Here's the morning papers with a big picture*
I read those yesterday.
Thank you
"Mom, you didn't cause me any problem"
There is no reason that you should feel bad about any of this.
"I just want you to know, the last thing I thought would happen on### my visit that I'd wind up sleeping with the mayor of New York City"
Did we forget to knock
"No, they're not my family."
They're just friends
"I know, bad idea"
"Stuart, I don't feel well."
"Stuart, I don't feel well."
Knowing about Mike's mom and the mayor is killing me.
"James, secrets are power."
"You get something good like this, sit on it."
"Right now, you leak it, it just office gossip that makes everyone uncomfortable"
"But, in 20 years, when Mike's running for president, this little gem gets me an ambassadorship to Sweden."
What do I get?
Topless postcard from Sweden
We just connected
The mayor is really an amazing man.
He's smart.
"He's funny, he's sweet"
I guess it's uncomfortable talking to your mother about sex
"No, mom, I've been looking forward to this day"

"- Yes, please."
You're losing.
I had hoped Father Moore wouldn't need me... ...but I don't wanna see him put away.
How do you know him?
"Well, I was his parishioner at St. Vincent's Church... ...about 15 years ago."
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years when he called me last fall.
"But he needed help, so..."
"What kind of help, doctor?"
"He wanted a medical perspective from a psychiatrist... ...you know, one that he knew, trusted... ...to observe Emily's physical and mental state during this..."
During the exorcism.
Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Can you help our case?
"That girl was not schizophrenic... ...and she was not epileptic, or any combination of the two."
I've seen hundreds of people with those problems.
"They can be terrible afflictions, of course, but they don't scare me."
"But what you saw that night in Emily, that did scare you."
"God, if I'd known, I never would've been there."
"I started praying again since then, you know."
I examined that girl before I drove back to the city that night.
She was lucid... ...and she was completely aware of this separate entity inside her.
"When she wasn't in his grip, she was totally herself, completely normal."
The awareness of her alternate mental state is counterindicative of psychosis.
Crazy people don't know they're crazy.
That's right.
"You'll testify to all of this, in detail?"
Everything you saw?
TOM BEARDEN:
Do you ever get mad about this?
DANlEL BELL:
It gets frustrating.
It definitely does.
TOM BEARDEN:
"Bell says the ranch has become a much more dangerous place, too."
Do you fear for your life out here?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, when we're out in places like this, where we don't have communications, and you're always thinking, what am I going to do if something happens?"
TOM BEARDEN:
Have you ever come across armed people coming across the border?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, I have, on several occasions."
And the most recent one was actually when we were building this fence.
"We were hauling material in with a mule and we came around on a trail that's used by smugglers, and ran right into a group of about 10 people."
I have two daughters now.
That's Ida and her baby sister Rosa.

largest student-run event in the country.
And so the students take full advantage of those opportunities.
The learn a lot from it also.
Beth Seaton:
"You have a lot of international type of things going on in the department also, don't you?"
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
"For many of our students, they have not had the opportunity to go overseas."
"Some of them, frankly, have not even been to Chicago or on an airplane."
But we take them and have taken them to China.
"Last year, was to Australia."
We have a trip to Brazil coming up.
"A trip to Russia, which was very successful."
"And the students understand that it opens up a whole new world for them, which they were not aware of before."
Beth Seaton:
I remember reading in the newspaper about the trip you took to Australia.
You were on that trip.
William Bailey:
Yes.
Beth Seaton:
I was surprised at how many students you were able to take with you.
William Bailey:
"It's always a concern, because the students pay for it themselves."
"We keep the cost as low as possible but at the end of the day, it is a wonderful experience, and the students uniformly get their moneys' worth."
And we have many students who will go on every trip we offer.
Beth Seaton:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today about some of the things going on in the School of
Agriculture at WlU.
William Bailey:
"Thank you very much for dropping by, Beth."
We enjoy sharing all of our activities with you.
Beth Seaton:
And he's in the seventh grade.
"So what happened to the fourth grade, the fifth grade, and the sixth grade?"
"I mean, something's wrong."
"At that point, I did think I was dumb."
"I was stupid, like, why can't I read?"
"All my friends go to Latin, Boston Latin, one of the best schools-- probably the best school in Massachusetts, like, an exam school."
They read fine.
Why can't I read?
Adam was too old for the early intervention remedies and the school's solution to help Adam sounded better on paper that it was in reality.
They said Adam needs a small classroom setting.
And where did they send him?
It's like going into prison.
"He's down in the cellar, in a little room about this size with 12 other kids."
"So instead of working on ways to make it in school, Adam started working on ways to get out of school."
I went to the school and went room to room to room to his teachers.
Some of his teachers had never seen Adam.
And this is two months into the school year-- had never seen him.
"You take school out of that age, you take it away, you take it out of the picture, what else is there?"
"There's marijuana, there's stealing cars."
"I mean, what else is there for a kid?"
So you run the streets.
"And you run the streets, you get in trouble."
You make bad choices.
Adam was so-- he was mad.
He can't read.
Adam's parents knew it was time for professional help.
At the Boston Medical
"Center, Doctor Andrea Weiss, a clinical psychologist, gave Adam a new battery of tests."
What we're going to do first is I'm going to give you some reading lists.
And what I'd like you to do is just read down the list out loud.
And if you come to words you don't know--
Doctor Weiss's tests provide a kind of road map to when Adam's learning skills hit the wall.
[horn honks]
-Ah!
No... no!
-You don't believe me?
"Think, Ian."
Think about earlier today.
-I have a ghost in my house; I need it gone.
"-Hell yeah, we're real Ghostbusters."
-So where's the ghost?
"-Aw man, she's such an idiot."

Now we are going to look at the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and it's role on heart health.
The Mediterranean diet has certainly been around for millennium and yet there is no one Mediterranean diet.
"It refers in general to the way the people in the countries of the Mediterranean diet, have traditionally eaten foods."
"There's a hypothesis that there are differences among these populations, for whatever reason."
The way that these populations have eaten for centuries has actually lead to lower rates of heart disease that you might see in other parts of the world.
So the first person to really study this relationship and to scientifically prove that eating a certain way impacted your heart health was an individual known as Dr. Ancel Keys.
Dr. Ancel Keys lived to be 100 years old from 1904 to 2004.
Tape?
Who dares to throw it here?
"Salute, sir."
Everyone has different problems... ...and different solutions too.
Your daughter wants proof and we want your statement.
And you want your daughter's life.
On the reverse side of this tape... ...you must record in your voice that I'm telling you now.
Listen to it carefully.
"Dear daughter Radha, because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, I'm forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Your father Shreekant.
"After recording it, you'll keep it behind the big door of Mahalaxmi."
"Mr. Shreekant, if you or police will try to play any trick... ...I'll send you half a piece of Radha's body."
It will never happen.
Why are you breaking the utensils?
When daughter's body will come home you can break my skull.
I'll die but not bend at an ordinary goon.
Then I'll have to bend.
"Aunt, please try and explain him."
This is the time we must think practically.
After all it's a question of Radha's life.
"Come, Uma!"
"Why, Uma?"
Come Uma.
"Radha, this is Damodar."
"Because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, we're forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Fine!
And each of these wires connect two
letters into a pair.
"So in this case, you might see, the letter Q is going to connect with the letter E. Now you make 10 of those pairs."
Two letters in a pair will swap over.
"So if Q is connected to E, then Q and E would swap over."
That's an extra level of scrambling only available to the military.
"Now, this had the most number of combinations."
"Now, this calculation is going to be the hardest calculation, but we can do it."
So there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
How many ways to arrange 26 letters?
"Well, it's 26 times 25 times 24 all the way down to 1."
That's 26 factorial.
But we don't want every combination of 26 letters.
We only want to make 10 pairs.
"So that means there are 6 letters left over, which we don't care about."
"Because we don't care about them, that means we're allowed to divide."
And we're going to divide by 6 factorial.
Now there are 10 pairs.
We don't care what order those 10 pairs are in.
"Because we don't care about it, we can divide by 10 factorial."
"And the last thing to divide by, 2 letters in a pair."
"Well, if I swap them over, that would still be the same pair."
"If I had A and B, that's the same as B and A. That's still the same pair."
So I can divide by 2.
And I do that for each pair.
"There's 10 pairs, so I'm going to divide by 2 10 times."
Just 2 to power 10.
And that is how many ways that you can connect 20 letters into 10 pairs on the front of the machine.
How big is that number?
Shall we do that?
"150 trillion, 738 billion, 274 million, 937,250."
"So the total, 158 quintillion, 962 quadrillion, 555 trillion, 217 billion, 826 million, 360,000 flat."
"And if you multiplied that times that, you'd get 1."
Part B.
I'll do all of these.
We have 2/8.
"The inverse of 2/8 is 1 over 2/8, which is the same thing-- this is equal to 1 times the inverse of this."
"Times 8/2, which is the same thing as 4."
"Now immediately, you might see something."
"I guess, you see a pattern here."
"If I take 1 over a fraction, the result is the fraction swapped."
So the inverse of 2/8 is 8/2.
You just swap the numerator and the denominator.
So let's apply that to part C.
"If I have negative 19/21, its inverse is just going to be you swap the numerator and the denominator."
Negative 21/19.
"And if you were to multiply these two numbers, you would get 1."
The negatives would cancel out.
"The 21 and the 21 would cancel out, the 19 and the 19 would cancel out."
Part D.
"The inverse of 7, multiplicative inverse, is 1/7."
"And then finally, let's do E."
So the inverse of-- so they give us z to the third over-- so it's negative z to the third over 2xy to the third.
"So the multiplicative inverse of that-- one of the harder words for me to say-- is just going to be equal to-- so that's the inverse-- is going to be 1 over this, which is just going to be negative."
The denominator becomes the numerator.
2y to the third over z cubed.
Now let's go to this next section.
Divide the following rational numbers.
Be sure that your answer is in simplest form.
"So I'm just going to do every other one of these problems, just so that I don't use up all of your time."
So let's do this first one: part A.
"Well, I'll do it over here."
Part A. 5/2 divided by 1/4.
This is the same thing as 5/2 times 4/1.
AB:
I'll talk to you later.
"In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier."
"Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649."
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
"And instead of squaring it this time,"
"I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number."
So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.
"How many digits do you have, six or seven?"
"Seven, and yours?"
Seven?
Seven?
"And, uncertain."
Seven.
Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have?
"Say ""No."""
(Laughter)
"Good, then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable."
"What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits, any six of them, in any order you'd like."
(Laughter)
"One digit at a time,"
I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.
"Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2."
AB:
Did you leave out the number 6?
"Good, OK, that's one."
"You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"4, 4, 8, 7, 5."
I think I only heard five numbers.
"Granted it's not something that a normal person should do, and it is dangerous, but you have that awesome rush that  you get to brag to your friends afterwards."
Even if they don't get it.
When people lie and then you learn  about the facts of a story there's also change.
Like the 5 guys everybody believed  raped a girl at Hofstra University.
Oooh the hate they got.
A buncha black guys raped a girl.
Time to go crazy.
I think it's Crazy O'Clock.
"Oh shit, it is."
Then you find out that the girl was lying.
That it was consensual.
And this was from her lawyers mouth.
"Her statement also coincided with a video that was taken of the incident, that showed it was definitely consensual."
I know what you're thinking.
"""I can't believe the girl that was willing to have sex with 5 guys at the same time would lie."
"My world is upside down."""
But congratulations to that girl  because she is definitely our
"Douchebag of the Day for announcing to the world that she was gangbanged by 5 guys in a bathroom by saying that they raped her and later sayings,"
"""Whoops, I lied about it."
"It was just a gangbang."""
Kudos.
"There's also my favorite form of change, which is Photoshop."
"Or as I like to call it, lying."
And we're gonna talk about Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Because Jennifer Love Hewitt had  some photos taken of her and a lot of people were saying that she was fat.
"She went off, ""I'm not fat!"
I'm beautiful.
You don't have to be impossibly skinny.
"Be happy with who you are."""
Which I think is a great message for women.
"On the cover of the new Shape Magazine,  she is Photoshopped."
Oh the hypocrisy gets me so hard.
A function allows us to do that.
Expressions and statements don't do that because they just get done at 1 time when they're executed.
Functions allow us to package up computation that we want to do later.
"Hi,Lee"
"Sup,Vovan"
"Lee ,you're one eyed Pterodactyl"
And I was riding on you
And you're an goat
"So, what do you want from me"
I ...
I insulted you
And you should be upset
And I beat you!
LOL
I'm bad!
I came to one simple conclusion
Insults are only hints who is the offender and not much more
"Well, suppose if you analyze what Volodya said about me"
First.
I'm one eyed Pterodactyl...
"First of all.It's a obvious lie,and inconsistencies"
And as a our friend suggests us
I have two eyes and I'm a human
"Second of all,my system of values does not see anything wrong with one eyed Pterodactyls and even if it saw something wrong with it"
I I know anyway that I'm not a Pterodactyl
I think
It also refers to Volodya allegedly riding on me
Did not happen and that I'm am an goat
"I'm not a goat ,and there nothing wrong with goats"
"Put in Volodya sentence harsher words, witch you will not hear on our show"
But you can hear everyday in the neighborhood and nothing will change
"Insults are fantasy, fears and complexes of the offender all and nothing more"
There's the cars we're driving and the water waste.
And all the trash we don't care where we're throwing it.
That's what I think.
"Cars, buses."
"It's industry, its gasoline, it's energy use."
All the fumes from cars.
Cars.
Too many vehicles maybe.
The fumes in the air.
All the gas.
And people driving in the city.
"Cars, factories, planes."
I image the aviation industry hasn't helped.
I mean one air plane can fly across country and its like 40 tonnes of carbon.
"40 tonnes, that's a lot."
I think in one word I would say pollution.
"Coal power stations, gas power stations."
People using more energy than they need to.
We are wasting a lot ...
An excessive use of gasses.
"And also coal burning stations, especially in China."
"All the pollutants that we pump into the air, day after day."
"Everyone says the same thing: it's the cars, the planes, the industrial plants."
It's because we leave our lights on and take long showers.
Always the same familiar answers.
"And yes: of course it's true, but no-one has yet won the grand prize."
Because we're forgetting one extremely important factor.
Eighteen percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock farming.
That might surprise you.
"Farmed animals, 18%!"
And guess what percentage of total global emissions are caused by transport?
Thirteen percent!
"Come all the way down to n, which is the"
"last line, come back up."
Drop it down.
There.
So now we have to drop some matrices in here or vectors in here with one and 1's with occasional 0's and 0's with occasional 1's okay.
So how do we do that.
"So, let's, let's come here and let's build zero vector, E0 is 0's end by one."
This is a vector of 0's.
Okay what we're going to do is do the following.
First of all let's take the let's make a vector of e2 which is just e1.
So I'm going to copy the one vectors.
"And what I'm gonna to do with e2 is I am going to, to occasionally put in zero."
How often do I put in a zero?
Well every nth point.
"Remember M, M is the small, is the small matrices in there."
"And, by the way, part of your homework three is going to be all about convincing yourself about this stuff."
"Because you're just going to be, your gonna emmese, immerse yourself in building matrices."
"That's all homework three is because you gotta build a derivative matrix and X derivative and Y and then, this."
"So, we're going to do, is for J equals one to M cuz that's how many, M blocks I have, remember, n by n, and I have these n by n blocks and there's m of them."
Now I am going to go down for each block and what I am gonna do is the following.
"For E2,"
Put an occasional zero.
Alright.
"So, Jay is going to one second."
Jay's going to go one.
"So, the first thing he is going to do is say y is five."
"So, he's going to go down to the fifth component."
Put a zero.
"And then Jay is going to be two, it's going to be the tenth component."
Put a zero.
"So, it's a bunch of ones, fifth component, tenth component."
All the way down.
"An image I quite like is that of being a Trojan mule, if you excuse my metaphor."
"What we are trying to do, is to get into schools, universities anyhow."
"Then the process does the work, really."
But I'll just finish with the story about how off-putting mindfulness can be to some people.
"I have a lovely colleague, very eminent professors of University of Exeter, called Willem Kuyken."
His daughter said to him after he  came back after one of these dos saying how well it went.
"She said, ""You do know dad,  that mindfulness is for losers."""
(Laughter)
"He said, ""Okay, you are sure about that?"""
"She said, ""Yup."""
Then she phone him later.
"She said, "" I just want to clarify that a bit."""
"He thought, ""She is going to say, 'I don't really mean it, dad'""."
"She said:""I just want you to know that it is not just me that thinks that."""
(Laughter)
And this is a girl's experience  in home and so on.
"She is a teenager, anything her parents  do is automatically awful."
"It is important really to start where people are, and to make sure that we do this in ways that appeal to people and don't just gratify our own egos."
"Okay, thank you for your time."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Katherine."
(Half bell)
(Bell)
"(R. Brady) Our next speaker is John Bell, who is the vice president of Youth Build USA."
He has a long career working with young people in leadership development in a variety of different kinds of settings.
"We'll hear more about what  he is doing, from John."
"(John Bell) Dear Thay, dear friends, let's see who is in the room first."
How many here are classroom teachers?
Please raise your hand.
"Wow, just take a look around."
Wave to each other.
(Laughter)
How many here are school leaders or school administrators?
It's obvious you're doing well.
It looks good on you!
"Come on, enjoy your meal...- hey. dude..."
Didn't you find any other place to take the girl for a walk?
Your head doesn't work at all!
Don't let your friend wait for you.
Enjoy...&amp;gt; Thanks.
May God never let you lose your appetite!
If you want we can leave right away.
"We will leave after you're done with your meal.- If it's for me, I am sated."
I did a cheekiness.
"When it gets colder it has no taste, come on!"
Did you really give rein for 500000 USD to Faruk?
I gave it from my personal account.
Only fools do unrequited favors.
"I didn't grant that money to Faruk, dad!"
"Cut it out, for God's sake!"
I was married four times... and I didn't give reins to so much money for anyone.
I didn't lend anyone money without getting the return until today!
Neither in my personal life nor in my business life.
"Because I know that everything which belongs to me, belongs to you, to your brother, to my grandchildren and to this holding at the same time."
I don't ever forget this either.-But you don't behave like that
You take steps which you can't take them back.
"Dad, please!"
"Really, I don't have energy to discuss with you."
I have been running here and there all day.
Please could you let me unbrace myself a bit...
Don't test my patience Ender!
"I can tolerate you to feed ""street dogs"" at your home.. but nothing else except your family is yours."
Don't ever forget this!
Call Haldun right away!
"Let him investigate about all Faruk personal possessions.. and put on my desk.-as you wish ,sir."
"They're gonna be talking about it, and I'm sure some of them are using it,"
'cause why else would it be on there?
"Now, Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica."
"I've used this since it's come out, so for years and years and years and so has my husband."
"It is, like, our top favorite product."
It is good for men and women.
It is a daily product you can use.
"Hence the name, Daily Microfoliant."
"And, who uses it?"
"Dun dun dun dun, Oprah."
"That's right, Oprah, another queen here."
She uses it and you can see it's a little white rice powder and you mix it with water and--every day.
It's a very very very gentle gentle gentle daily exfoliant.
"So that's the Dermalogica, and, in makeup, what I have--"
I have Glo and I have the La Bella Donna.
"Now, the Glo Pressed Base is Hoda's favorite from The Today Show."
She loves herself Pressed Base.
This is the Honey Dark I have in my hand.
"Glo is great because there's Pressed Base, there's Loose, they have Satin, they have"
"Barely Beige, like a sheer type coverage, so a lot of options in Glo for you."
"La Bella Donna, one of my favorites, of course-- pretty much all these are my favorites-- is Bella Foundation."
"I use it on a daily basis, and they also have compact and loose, and Alicia Silverstone loves La Bella Donna."
"She loves the Brow Kit, which I will tell you about the Brow kit over and over and over because you get four colors in one compact, and this is the one for brunettes, so we pick your--you know your hair color."
Just pick the Brow Kit that matches and you're set.
Your colors are already picked out for you; it's like a no-brainer here.
"So, La Bella Donna, ooh, pretty four colors, I love it."
Love it.
"Now, last but not least, so you're using all of these products and you're like, yeah,"
I use these products.
"I do my skin care regime, I have the Fabulous Make Kit, makeup,"
I use it all.
I'm good.
"""A week."""
"Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped."
"He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking."
"And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second."
"And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time."
(Laughter)
"And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like ... (Laughter)"
"Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up."
Albert hands me the knife.
"I go in, tail comes off."
"I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off."
"Albert instructs, ""Push it way up there."""
I do.
"""Push it further."""
I do.
"The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you -- and he says, ""Bite 'em."
"Just bite 'em off."""
"And I heard him, I heard all the words."
(Laughter)
"Like, how did -- how did I get here?"
How did -- you know -- I mean -- how did I get here?
(Laughter)
"It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own: and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies, and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy."
"You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity."
(Laughter)
"And I'm like, ""What is this jacked-up metaphor?"
"I don't like what I'm thinking right now."""
"And I can't get this thought out of my head, and I can't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do."
I went in and I took them.
"I took them like this, and I yanked my face back."
And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.
(Laughter)
"You are, you are in no condition to deal with this right now."

Faults are breaks in the Earth's crust where rocks move past one another in some way.
Typically faults are associated with earthquakes.
We've called faults 'boundaries' in class.
"We've talked about divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, but there are 2 types of common faults."
The first is a dip slip and the second kind is a strike slip.
Dip slips are in the top of the picture and this occurs when 2 pieces of land move vertically.
This leaves one of the pieces higher than the other.
A strike slip occurs when 2 pieces of land move horizontally.
Most of you would call this a transform boundary because the pieces of land move from side to side.
Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions.
Let's get started.
Let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much.
This should hopefully be a relatively easy question.
If I were to ask you what one fourth plus one fourth is.
Let's think about what that means.
Let's say we had a pie and it was divided into four pieces.
"So this is like saying this first one fourth right here,"
let me do it in a different color.
"This one fourth right here,"
So let me write 12th down.
She's the 12th tallest and shortest.
"If everyone in the class is a different height, how many students are there in the class?"
And these are the type of questions that I just like to make sure that I'm not miscounting.
So she's the 12th tallest.
So what does that mean?
That means that there are 11 people taller than her.
So let's say from shortest to tallest.
So this is Stacy right here.
"And so, if she is the 12th tallest-- let me put it this way."
"If I said that she was the first tallest, that means there's no one taller than her."
"If she's the second tallest, that means there's one person taller than her."
"If she's the third tallest, that means there's two people taller than her."
"And likewise, if she's the 12th tallest, that means that there are 11 people taller."
"Similarly, if she's the 12th shortest, well, that must mean that there are 11 shorter than her."
So this is really just making sure that you parse the words correctly and count properly.
"So if there's 11 shorter, 11 taller, and then there's"
"Stacy, well, that's 22 plus her."
There's 23 students in the class.
"And this is just to make sure that you don't say, oh, 12 taller, 12 shorter, and say 25 or something like that."
"It's just to confuse you really, I think."
Problem number 11.
Image.
Clear image.
Invert colors.
Problem number 11.
Switch colors.
"The quadratic function g is given by-- this is just the general way people write quadratic functions-- is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c, where a and c are negative constants."
Which of the following could be the graph of g?
So I'm not going to even look at the choices.
"I'll just show you how I would-- if someone didn't even give me any choices, and say, well, if a and c are less than 0, what's this going to look like?"
So let's draw the x and y.
"It's good, but not great."
People say things that aren't true.
- It's never true...
- But they can make it bigger.
The following day...
They demand:
"""You who have knowledge, power and money"""
"""you must give all children a fighting chance!"""
"They fall down, stare into space and think:"
"""It will just get worse for the children."""
But raise your eyes and you'll see the statistics.
That's the world up there.
The world in 1959.
The ring corresponds to the bubble.
In London I lectured to hedge fund managers.
They're the worst kind of capitalists.
They wanted to know the exact condi- tions in every West African country.
"They know if there is sun, ore, oil, forest..."
They invest in Africa and want to know what country is most stable.
But the aid organizations have the same policy for everyone.
"The organization has an environmental, school or gender policy."
Then they pursue it in all countries.
To me it was horrific that businesspeople had a more fact-based worldview than young activists and university professors.
Dad was a coffee roaster at Lindvalls Coffee.
"Here, look..."
This is great...
"In this cigar box I have Dad's old club badge and five cents from East Africa, a coin Dad found in the coffee bags."
The raw coffee beans pass under magnets so all metal is removed.
They bring in huge amounts and inspect them carefully.
Here are coins from Colombia and Guatemala...
"Dad brought the coins home, sat me in his lap and got out the atlas."
He told me that the Africans didn't own their coffee plantations.
I'll say it today before it's too late.
I've saved a woman from afire...
Saved a man from drowning...
"But now,"
Now...
I want to save a man who's fallen in love.
"I know it's too late, but..."
Please accept this.
The stadium will be open for use from 9am to 10pm.
The district will try to attract
Citizens from various classes.
Now some late-breaking news.
"This evening, a fire broke out in a shoe factory in Dobong-gu."
"The blaze killed two firemen on duty... and a third, unidentified victim."
The firemen killed were 40-year old Suh Ki-soo and 30-year old Lee Jin-woo.
38-year old Lee Jo-hyung was severely burned and moved to a hospital.
The tragedy occurred in the basement of the building as the dispatched firemen tried to extinguish the flames.
"Finally, Hong will report on tonight's weather."
Rain is falling across the nation.
"The rain should quell the 20-day heat wave and open the rainy season, according to the Weather Bureau."
The early arrival of the monsoon... will most likely continue for a month.
"Especially starting the next month, a seasonal rain front will..."
Please draw me again.
"Actually, I'm leaving to study abroad next month."
"I know, you punk."
That's why I'm showing it to you.
I don't show this to just anyone.
There was something I really wanted to draw before leaving.
"If the chance came, I thought I could draw it well."
I really thought... that I could draw it well.
I know it already.
"You wanted to draw me, but it didn't turn out as you expected."
"""And what does 32 and a half - that number - mean to you?"""
Rachel:

"""We're heading the right way."""
Rachel and Clare were 14 when their weight dropped to a pitiful 28 KGs.
It was 1984.
Their mum:
"""I'd picked up a diary that was open in their room and read it."
"They'd read about anorexia and they had stopped eating."""
"Their dad: ""... and were noticed."" Mum:""Yeah, that was their way of being noticed at school."""
"""When we got anorexia, it was the first time we got recognized."""
"""People actually verbally said to us, 'Oh gee, you lost weight' and we thought hey, this is an achievement."""
"When Rachel and Claire look in the mirror, they don't see what we see."
"""Your face is thinner."" ""No way, you are so much thinner."""
They see a distorted image of themselves and of each other.
"Anorexia is not just about being thin, it's a serious mental illness."
"""I think you take away the anorexia and then my God, I have nothing."
I don't even know who I am.

"If my father did all this, why would he try so hard to bring.. ..you out of the jail?"
Do you know you would have been in jail.. .. for up to five years if he does not helped you.
Why would he do that if he wants to separate us?
Because they want that you should find fault in me.
Forget about all others.
Do you believe that I am the culprit?
Let us leave that matter now.
"Shailu, Do you believe that I am the culprit?"
What can I do but believe.
To get a job so quickly you may.
It is useless to convince you.
You began to believe.. ..your father blindly.
That is why you could not even .. ..believe me.
You dont love me any more.
I cannot be with you if you dont love me.
It is not proper for you to go to Vizag for such a small reason.
Small arguments are common among couples or lovers.
It may look like a small incident for you.. .. but it is very big concern for me.
Then also how can you break a relation?
You should convince her later when she is calm.
Convince her?
Is she a small girl?
Doesnt she have any brain?
You are behaving arrogantly.
I need not beg her.
She will come to me if she wants me.
Why are you worried so much baby?
It is just a small argument.
Is it not your fault that you raised an argument with him.. ..when he was surrounded by many tensions?
You know quarrels will increase if you let them to.. ..otherwise they will simply vanish.
After all the hard work I have done to separate them.. ..this old lady is trying to take away my fruits of success.
What are you still thinking?
"Jack had a bucket in his hand, a chicken under his arm, and a pitch fork and a rope at the end of which there was a goat."
"And Jill said, I am feeling very nervous."
"Jack said, Why? I am afraid you may have your way with me."
I am alone with you.
"He said, What do you mean?"
I didnt do anything and my hands are full?
"So she said, You may put the pitch fork down, plant it in the earth, tie the goat to it, put the chicken down and put the bucket over it, couldnt you?"
(Laughter)
"And in the process of holding a relationship, the first moment of meeting the expectations may be common."
"But as every step that we take in life, the expectations may become different."
"Because these expectations keep changing in people, they are not consistent and they cannot be."
One person may be consistent with the same expectation throughout their life; another persons expectations may be changing because his perception and experience of life is changing.
Now relationships become great conflict.
(Applause)
A while ago an old client contacted me.
He was having some trouble at work and he was asking me for coaching
"It was in the early days of August, he was telling me he had some time issues, but I agreed,  so he sent me a message asking me,"
"""Can you make it on Tuesday  at 20 and 8 minutes?"
"The first thing I thought was,  ""At that time of the night?"""
"Plus, he was cynical, he asked for 20:08."
Couldn't it be at 8:30? or 8:00?
"Fine, I forgot about it."
"Ok, I texted him"
A week passed away.
"Next Monday  I sent him a confirmation message,"
"""Where do you want us to meet?"
"""At the office..."""
At that time in the office?
8pm?
Generally they're closed.
"Fine, Ok I tell him, ""I'll see you tomorrow."""
"Automatically he sends me a message,  ""Tomorow?"""
A and the right-hand side is also a vector that I'll always call b.
So linear equations are A x equal b and the idea now is to solve this
particular example and then step back to see the bigger picture.
"Okay, what's the picture for this example, the Row picture?"
"Okay, so here comes the Row picture."
So that means I take one row at a
time and I'm drawing here the xy plane and I'm going to plot all the
points that satisfy that first equation.
So I'm looking at all the
points that satisfy 2x-y =0.
It's often good to start with which
"point on the horizontal line -- on this horizontal line,"
y is zero.
"The x axis has y as zero and that -- in this case,"
"actually, then x is zero."
"So the point, the origin --"
"the point with coordinates (0, ) is on the line."
It solves that
equation.
"Okay, tell me in -- well, I guess I have to tell you"
another point that solves this same equation.
"Let me suppose x is one,"
so I'll take x to be one.
"Then y should be two,"
right?
So there's the point one two that also solves this equation.
And I could put in more points.
"But, but let me put in all the"
"points at once, because they all lie on a straight"
line.
This is a linear equation and that word linear got the letters for
line in it.
If the mean beak width does significantly increase or decrease in size.
This is referred to as Directional Selection.
Then the environment allows the survival and reproduction of finches with bigger beak widths.
Let's say we know that the average beak width of all finches is 6.07 millimeters.
This includes finches that have been studied over the last few years.
But now let's say we're studying a sample of finches from today.
"We want to know, do finches today have beak widths that are different in size?"
"That means our null hypothesis is that, the population mean for finches today is equal to what they have been."
And what should the alternative hypothesis be?
"That mu is less than 6.07, greater than 6.07, or not equal to 6.07."
"Sir, what's the progress?"
The New West is on strike until the King agrees.
We're in the right.
The King can't ignore our petitions.
Not just the Southerners.
The majority of the ministers are with the New West.
They insist the King punish Prince Yuning.
What will you do?
Geum.
Mom.
We'll have him banished for this.
He won't threaten your crown again.
I'll see to that.
We're leaving.
As you say.
Your Grace.
The New West is applying pressure.
If they keep this up the King will have to accede.
Is something bothering you?
The Crown Prince knows everything.
What?
He knows what's wrong with him.
"Now I can see the suggested route to my destination, the length of the ride, and also the price estimate."
We've arrived.
I'm paying for the ride and I'm rating the driver.
I was very satisfied.
Done.
You can see how very easy all of this was.
"Instead of waiting, the driver got a job thanks to Liftago."
"As a passenger, I am happy with the service."
I didn't wait in vain and my order didn't depend on a single phone number or on a single transport company.
I chose the best driver around.
I was able to see his price in advance and his rating.
I knew who would pick me up and in what car.
"Actually, I didn't have any trouble at all."
"With Liftago, we're creating a free taxi market."
Hassle-free for passengers and hassle-free for taxi drivers.
"The better and more convenient service we provide, the more orders we get for Liftago drivers."
And that is our goal.
"Thanks to the skills of the whole community of marketers, we can create something truly great together."
"Just imagine that in a few years, we'll be as important for city transport as Google is right now with searching for information on the internet."
Good luck!

"I don't know if you could share this information, but do you have any idea how many people your newsletter goes out to?"
"Um, I think we have, uh, 1,300, I think."
"Okay. ,, ."
"Just curious, um."
"So this, you're bringing up an int..."
"We've only had a newspaper, newsletter for so, so long, so..."
Yeah.
You're bringing up an interesting course idea for me.
"Which is, um."
Taking an existing website and going through a redesign to become more responsive.
No.
"Sir, but why?"
Forget this case.
But it's such an interesting case.
"Interesting yes, but it's also a police case."
But...
"Sunita, you want me to call your parents?"
"Fine, I won't take it up."
"But as medical students, we want to know."
Okay...
That is Sanjay Singhania.
Hit on the head with an iron rod.
"After the incident, he lost his memory."
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.
He remembers events for only about 15 minutes.
Afterwards... he forgets everything.
"For example, he'd ask your name... and in 15 minutes he will have forgotten it."
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.
"Regular tasks like eating, drinking, driving, also his feelings..."
lie embedded in his sub-conscious mind.
How does he go about his everyday routine?
How does a child perform instructed tasks?
"By committing to memory, learning by rote."
"Or, by jotting things down in writing."
"Likewise, he remembers tasks by writing."
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?
"This, no one knows."
"Unfortunately, he doesn't even recall a face."
How can someone live on like this...
You shut up
"First, you owe us an apology"
"I apologize to you vey much, madame"
I even apologize on behave of everyone who hurted you
Thank you
"Second you'll forget all the money you gave Cobra and will pay us our own money no problem, sister just go up on stage thanks three"
What do I want?
I do not know you'll pay for the taxi to get us home at the end of the evening 2 taxis .. there are many of us
Ok sister
Crazy..
"He agreed to our terms quickly if so, we will go out on stage.. what can we do he granted all of our requests"
Ok dear sister here you go
Did you put salt in the coffee
No I added sugar
Oh! does he like it with salt?
No Nakiye it's a tradition to put salt in the groom's coffe well I don't believe in these traditions
"Nakiye, sit down"
I have to sit down .. right?
If you may allow me I would like to get into the main subject
You have seen our son
I have raised him well until he got to this age
And young people will not stay single
And want to get married mom stay in the main subject
"In short, they liked and loved each other"
So we want Nakiye to our son Shewket for marriage to Allah and His Messenger
What would you say Nakiye?
Do you need something Mr. Ethem?
"No he means, do you want to marry Shewket?"
I want to of course ..
I agree
"Then, it's done .. congratulations congratulations"
I kiss you congratulation my daughter
Because you don't know poverty - Whatever it is!
"My dad can go to bankruptcy, we can go down to Zero... we will rearrange our life according to that."
"What are those mom, what are those, what?"
"You mean the real, true happiness is this, those things?"
"My sweetheart, are we not a family?"
How fast have you given up ?
"You will see,"
That man will be ashamed for what he did...
And also for attacking my dad in front of everyone ..
He will apologize to dad in front of everyone...
"I am saying it again, I trust my dad."
We have to support him.
After all this I don't even care what people say.
And i know my father is not a thief.
I know that he never wanted to do something bad.
We will pull ourselves together.
"You also pull yourself together, please.."
Are you alright?
I am worried about you.
(and he deletes it).
"And that Orkuc is an orkuc (blurt out) really. he wanders around with Hale, but I can't believe what Eylul did, how can one abandon the friend and go to them?"
"Instead of consoling Mira, both of them ran away..."
"I thought that ""plastic"" was next to Mira, he also went to Hale?"
"It looks like your receiver broke down, I am telling you since one hour."
"I am saying I saw him, I am saying she was in the car, I am saying he was with Hale."
"She needed moral support, by finding and putting her head on a pillow like this..."
"Okay, don't brisk up (simulate),i got it."
"I can understand all of them, but never Eylul."
"I will take one too, my head is exploding too."
"This night after talking to you, i did not get a wink of sleep."
I was so sad.
Who knows what they are talking about us?
How does it feel now that it's over?
CL:
"It is so wonderful, it's so incredibly wonderful that it's over, even though it was funny."
J:
It is not quite over yet.
You will get points too.
CL:
"Yes,"
J:
"Wow, wow, wow."
Right in the lead Camilla.
That was not a bad score at all.
CL:
"No, it's ok when you are here, but out there it is terrible"
J:
"Sit down and breathe a little now, since you didn't do that when you were dancing"
J:
Well done.
"Whatever happened to — ""agree to disagree?"""
Third-year Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke has become the face of the campaign for access to birth control coverage for women.
"""Without insurance coverage, contraception can cost as much as $3,000 dollars during law school. """
Both sides have been locked in a weeks-long battle over mandated birth control coverage.
"But on his radio show — Limbaugh took a personal shot at Fluke to make his point. ""essentially says she must be paid to have sex."
What does that make her?
"It makes her a slut, right?"""
And he didn't stop there.
"Thursday he said — if taxpayers have to foot the bill , then. ""we want something in return."
"And that is the videos of all the sex posted online so we can see."""
That got Limbaugh's critics fired up.
As an anchor for WFLD somewhat tentatively puts it.
"""Wow."
"You can um, imagine um, that sparked a lot of um, reaction and not very well, negative as you can imagine."""
It spent most of its time in Algiers. ...and recently turned up and it went to Switzerland.
Now we have it.
It's a major discovery.
It's a unique piece.
"There is no other cast of it in bronze."""
The buste comes with its original wooden case which is covered with masonic symbols.
"It's on sale for 680,000 euro."
"Other gems at this year's Tefaf are paintings by El Greco, Auguste Renoir and Frans Hals."
This Rembrandt is the most expensive piece on exhibit.
The asking price is 35 million euro.
New York-based art dealer Richard Feigen says the global art market... ...remains buoyant as a result of continuing financial uncertainty.
"""There is a lot of liquidity, a lot of money out looking for art... ...and less and less art to buy with it."
"I think that reflects that art has effectively been monetized... ...and now seems to be regarded as an asset class, a place of refuge."
"People don't like the dollar, they don't like the euro, they don't like sterling."""
Security at the Tefaf art fair has been stepped up considerably this year.
"Last year, on the final day of the art fair, one visitor walked away with two pieces of jewelry... ...worth 860.000 euro."
Without paying.

Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of Inside Leathernecks
I'm your host Nick Spinozzi today we are with
WlU Men's Golf Head Coach Mel Blasi.
Mel thanks for joing us today.
[Mel Blasi]
Thanks for having me.
Coach why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself.
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I'm a..a..46 years old
I guess maybe you don't want to know that but I have a family a young family here in town a wife and 3 children.
I've been coaching here at the university for 13 years and I'm also a graduate of Western illinois 1987.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This is your 13th year coaching 12th or 13th?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
So that's the picture for a two by two system.
"And if the right-hand side B happened to be twelve seven,"
then of course the correct solution would be one two.
Okay.
"So let me come back next time to a systematic way,"
"using elimination, to find the solution, if there is one,"
"to a system of any size and find out -- because if elimination fails,"
find out when there isn't a solution.
"Okay, thanks."

So line I can be 6x plus 5y is equal to 3.
So if we were to subtract 6x from both sides you get 5y is equal to minus 6x plus 3.
And then you divide both sides by 5 and you get y is equal to minus 6/5 x plus 3/5.
So this is line I right here.
I'll do line q in a different color.
So q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
So let's subtract 5x from both sides.
You get minus 6y is equal to minus 5x.
"If you divide both sides by negative 6, you get y is equal to-- minus 5 divided by negative 6."
That's 5/6 x.
"Well, it actually looks like D comes into play."
Because the slope of this one is minus 6/5.
That's the slope of line l.
The slope of line q is the inverse of that made negative.
At this point it's a good thing to memorize.
I haven't proven it to you yet.
"If you want a line that has a slope perpendicular to this one, or a line that is perpendicular to this one will have a negative inverse slope."
So the inverse of this is minus 5/6 and the negative inverse is plus 5/6.
So this is the negative inverse of that.
So these lines are actually perpendicular.
So that is D.
See you in the next video.
We're on problem 27.
"And the question is, which equation best represents the graph above?"
"So before even looking at the choices, let's see what we can figure out about the graph."
So what's its y-intercept?
"So if we said that this is the equation of a line, we said y is equal to mx plus b where m is the slope and y is-- and b is the y-intercept."
"It's late, I'm getting slightly muddled."
So what's the y-intercept?
"Well when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 0."
So this is going to be equal to 0.
The y-intercept is 0.
Because this'll have some positive value.
It might have an insignificantly small value.
We could make it 0.000001.
But it's still going to have some positive value.
"So no matter what y we choose, as long as it's greater than 0, 2x minus 3y will be greater than 2x."
"So we could say that as long as if 2x is less than x squared for any x we pick, then 2x minus 3y is definitely going to be less than x squared."
Why is that?
"Because minus 3y is going to subtract from the 2x, because we know that y is greater than 0."
So let me ask you a question.
Is 2x always going to be less than x squared if x is greater than 2?
Sure.
"I mean whatever x is, on the left-hand side it's going to be 2 times--pick a random number--2 times xŁŹit could be 2.5."
"But on the other side, on the right-hand side, you're going to have 2.5 squared."
"So if you think about it, you're going to have 2 times a number."
That's always going to be less than--ŁŹthat number which happens to be larger than 2 squared.
The smallest possible is 2 times 2.0001.
You could make a lot of 0's there.
But I think you get the point.
That's still going to be less than 2.0001 squared.
Because you only have a 2 here instead of a 2.0001.
"So actually, statement 2 alone is sufficient."
Hopefully that made sense.
"You just have to see oh, if y is greater than 0, then the 3y is definitely going to take away from the 2x."
"Then as long as x is greater than 2, 2x is always going to be less than x squared."
"If that makes sense to you, then you should realize that statement 2 alone is sufficient for this."
That was interesting.
"Oh, no sorry."
Either of them alone were sufficient.
"We did that in the first one, right?"
"Statement 1 or statement 2, independently are sufficient to answer that question."
120.
"A report consisting of 2,600 words is divided into 23 paragraphs."
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And we'll count about 50 to 100 of them, and we'll place them in a glass tube..."
And then we add some hexane.
And then we grind it up.
"And what you can see is the white part here at the bottom is the pulp of the seed, and that's where the oil is."
And what that oil will do is actually migrate up into the extraction layer here.
"And then will suck that little clear part off, and place it into a GC vile."
"Now once the liquid in in here, we have a computer that can control this robot"
And it applies a sample on every 24 minutes.
"Because this is automated, we can run anywhere from 900 to 1,000 samples within a week, and runs 24 hours a day."
Beth Seaton:
"Why would you run 900 to 1,000 samples?"
Win Phippen:
"Well, if you're breeding plants, you're not quite sure which one has the components that you want."
"So when I make a cross, I've got all the these young seedling plants, and I'm not sure which one I'm interested in."
So I have to collect seeds from each individual plant.
Beth Seaton:
Every single plant?
Win Phippen:
Every single plant.
Beth Seaton:
And that's why you keep these numbers running?
Win Phippen:
And I've got to keep every single vile together.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Once we have the sample in the vile, there's a robot here that is controlled by the computer, that will inject a sample very 24 minutes."
"So, as soon as the sample goes in, it actually enters into a very long glass tube."
It's about 30 meters long.
And so if it's a very
"And by the way, if you come over here to your MATLAB code and say, what's, what's"
A?
Notice how A is saved.
"The one wants components one, two, two is one."
"It only saves what it needs to, Okay?"
"So normally when you say A it , prints out this giant matrix to your screen."
"And it's just saying look, here are the components that are nonzero Yeah."
"I want to add like 68 equals twelve, do you blow the sparseness, or [inaudible] can you say A bracket, six comma A equals twelve, do you then add that point?"
And it's still sparse?
"Yeah, yeah, you can do this, check this out, yeah."
"A six comma twelve is equal to seven, because we like seven right?"
Huh?
"It's the best number ever, and we can just say spy that and check it out."
There's Taylor's number right over there.
It's a seven.
Still sparks.
You can do anything you want now.
Okay.
We're going to keep that there.
"And then by the way, I can put down diagonals anywhere I want now."
Let's put down another row of 1's at one.
Look at that.
I put it one diagonal over.
"As I said go to one, which is the next one over."
Put down ones.
Now our matrix is a little more complicated.
"I encourage you to look at page, whatever in the notes, where I actually show you what this thing looks like.'Kay?"
"And, this thing has a complicated structure, in particular, I guess we could Actually, I have it in my notes, so let m, e let me, let me draw this what this thing looks like."
"Do we have, turn the lights up here real quick?"
And then Alright.
So let me just show you what this thing
looks like.
Helene.
Wow.
"Um, what is that?"
"That is saffron risotto, topped with scallops that are crusted in a red peppercorn-smoked sea salt wrapped in burdock root."
"So, visually, when you can still see the center &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of that bright grain of rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what does that mean?"
That it's perhaps undercooked?
"""Perhaps."""
That's not perhaps.
It's definitely undercooked.
The basket...
What the [Bleep] is that? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A basket.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Bleep].
Uhh!
"God, I could scream."
The scallops are still raw.
"I'm looking at that, and I'm looking at the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; trophy, I'm thinking, ""nah."""
"All right, guys."
You guys understand the spirit of this competition? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What we're looking for here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Scallop basket...
Go in the garbage basket.
[Scoffs]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We're not fooling around here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We're looking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;for specific things,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's not a game, and you're not here to waste our time."
- You understand?
- Yes.
"The rice is undercooked, and the scallops are a joke."
You guys understand the spirit of this competition? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What we're looking for here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Scallop basket...
Go in the garbage basket.
[Scoffs]
"The rice is undercooked, and the scallops are a joke."
"They really seemed offended by these creations that I made, but at least I went to the edge of my comfort zone."
I tried something new.
It was when Golgotha killed Dardane.
"And surprise surprise, the very same day you find an item that is not even referenced in the loots's list of Horizon 1.1."
"Comrades, this is a critical moment, an emergency meeting is a must."
"Come on, follow me... and you, come here."
Okay I see.
I need to contact Tenshirock as soon as possible.
What is the date...
Tenshirock.
"Tenshirock, Tenshirock !"
- I absolutely needed to see you.
"- Really, what for ?"
This.
Well !
If it isn't my favorite little noob.
"Can you tell me why you give him a cheated item while me, your old friend for ages, I get nothing."
"Ash, Ash, Ash."
We are not going to talk about this again.
"I already explained my motives to you : if I give you just one item, created by me, you're going to resale it right away to those poor souls who are enchained in their virtual world."
And you'll feed their addiction.
"Me, I'm here to set them free."
There is no such thing as a worthless trade... and you didn't answer my question.
Noob power.
What?
"Noob power, it is nothing else than my brilliant plan to decolonise the MMORPG."
I already regret asking...
And how do you plan to handle it this time ?
"Well, as usual, a small demonstration is better than a long speech, look."
"Comrades, this item is a threat to the Noob guild."
We are near the destruction.
"If one of the game master sees us with it, nobody will escape."
And our avatars will be deleted.
This staff is a gift... a gift to the foes of the Noob guild.
And then we're going to multiply that times y plus 2.
"So when you multiply y plus 2 times this, so you have y times negative y squared, it gets us negative y to the third power. y times 3y is going to be plus 3y squared."
2 times negative y squared is negative 2y squared.
And then 2 times 3y is plus 6y.
So then you go all the way down here.
"This thing can simplify, too, because you have 3y squared minus 2y squared."
So this going to be negative y to the third plus-- this part right over here simplifies to just y squared-- y squared plus 6y.
So that's this entire part simplified to this down here.
We can take the 2 pi out of the integral sign.
So let's do that.
We're integrating from y is equal to 0 to y is equal to 3 dy.
"And I took the 2 pi out here, and that is equal to our volume."
"And so now, we're essentially ready to take the antiderivative."
This is going to be equal to 2 pi times the antiderivative of this business evaluated at 3 minus evaluated at 0.
And I'll color code it.
I found this useful.
"The antiderivative of y to the third is y to the fourth over 4, so this is negative y to the fourth over 4."
"Antiderivative of y squared is y to the third over 2-- or y to the third over 3, I should say."
"And then finally, I'll do it in yellow."
"Antiderivative of 6y is 3y squared, so plus 3y squared."
And we are going to evaluate all of this business at 0 and 3.
So this simplifies.
"This going to be equal to 2 pi times-- well, let's see."
Let me do it in the same colors.
3 to the fourth power is 81.
"So it's negative 81 over 4, plus-- 3 to the third is 27 divided by 3 is 9, plus 9."
"And then 3 squared is 9 times 3 is 27, plus 27."
"And then when you evaluate all of these things at 0, you just get 0."
"So you're just subtracting out 0, so we really don't have to do anything else with the 0."
And now we are ready to simplify.
Let me see.
"Actually, let's just add them all up."
Let me do it again.
"The Laplace transform of sine of at is equal to a over s squared, plus a squared."
And that's a significant entry.
"And maybe a good exercise for you, just to see how fun it is to do these integration by parts problems twice, is to figure out the Laplace transform of cosine of at."
And I'll give you a hint.
It's s over s squared over s squared plus a squared.
And it's nice that there's that symmetry there.
"Anyway, I'm almost at my time limit."
And I'm very tired working on this video.
So I'll leave it there and I'll see you in the next one.
I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before:
What is possible with the human voice?
What is possible with the human voice?
(Beatboxing)
♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing) (Dog barking)
Yeah.
(Applause) (Boomerang noises)
It was coming straight for me.
I had to.
"It was, yeah."
"As you can probably well imagine,"
I was a strange child.
(Laughter)
"Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be."
I was constantly experimenting with these noises.
And I'm still on that mission.
I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make.
"And the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises"
"I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do."
And there's things that no one's voice can do.
"For example, no one can do two notes at the same time."
"You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... (Two-tone singing)"
You don't see me in the hood
It's cause I'm doing this man
"Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah... )"
"I'm still hearing those sirens,"
"I'm still getting chased by those lights,"
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
"And my time is none because I'm writing more,"
"And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness,"
"I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure... )"
"And I can't let y'all derail me man,"
"I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie"
"Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man... )"
We got them craps going on
"And that yak going on,"
"Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin',"
"It's whateva, put that on the chedda man,"
"But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time,"
"Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out,"
"This is it my nigga, this what we boast about,"
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth
And show me love bitch...
"I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, (I dont love you bitch)"
"I wanna hold you in the morning, (Ha)"
Hold you through the night (Hahaha)
"I just wanna love you for the rest of my life, (We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, )"
"I wanna hold you in the morning, (we wanna love money)"
Hold you through the night. .
(Ha) (we don't wanna love bitches though)
"There's a certain mystique when I speak,"
"That you notice that it's sort a unique,"
"Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,"
"And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,"
"I think because now, because even connected to the web uh, I do multimedia for my work too."
So if I created something in there.
There's gotta be finally in the end exported as a.
Multimedia page.
Right.
On there.
Connecting that.
Yeah.
"You know, it would be a lot of free, free videos."
And I've searched for educational page on energy so I have some fun ones that I'd really I ike to put together for kids stuff.
"And, um, there's a lot of, you know, do it, uh, to be able to watch a video and have it actually."
"Get it all together. , out there."
Yeah that's a great idea.
Okay.
"And would you, um, would you find project type courses, maybe past the beginner stage, um, helpful, where you could practice your skills in a certain, um, in a certain environment or piece of software?"
I think...
"Um, I don't usually do the downloads."
"I, I only have a subscription just to watch the videos.'Cause I really never, have never had the time to be able to do one of those full class ones."
"Uh-huh. , The files to work with ."
"Um, I don't, I just don't have that kind of time to be able to use those true detailed trainings."
Sure.
"Um, I mean, if I did I probably would have signed up for that but I only did the one with the crash course videos."
Just the three videos.
That's my subscription on the space there.
"Um, yeah, even with the subscription that you have you still, uh, you can watch all of the different videos."
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Um.

Here we go come with me there's a world out there that we should see take my hand close your eyes with you right here

We could write 3 plus 2 is equal to 5.
Term three is minus 5.
And that's because minus 1 times this 5-- let me draw these arrows-- is equal to minus 5.
And then we add again-- I'm going to switch colors just to keep it interesting.
"So term four is going to be minus 5 plus 2, which equals minus 3."
"Then term five is going to be minus 3 times minus 1, which equals 3 again."
Right?
And I think you see how we're getting these patterns.
You just keep switching between adding 2 and multiplying by negative 1.
And then so term six is going to be what?
"It's going to be this plus 2, which is 5."
I think you're seeing the pattern again.
Let me do a bunch more and I'll do it outside of the scope of this chart.
The term seven is going to be what?
"It's going to be minus 1 times that, so minus 5."
And you see the pattern now.
Term eight is going to be minus 3.
Term nine is going to be what?
"Minus 3, minus 3."
So here we added 2 so we multiply it by negative 1.
So it's going to be 3 again.
And you could just experiment with yourself.
"Once you understand how soon. the sequence works, do a bunch of terms until you see a cycle."
And that's the key thing.
"In any SAT problem, when they ask you like what is the 100th term?"
It's going to have a cycle because they don't expect you to sit and write out 100 terms because you would run out of time.
"So if they ask you the 100th term, the pattern probably repeats every three or four or five or, at most, six terms."
And then you can use that to figure out what the 100th term is.
"So here we see that the pattern repeats-- let's see, 3, 5, negative 5, negative 3."
"3, 5, negative 5, negative 3, 3."
"So we see it repeats every fourth term, right?"
"This is kind of one cycle, then 3, 5, negative 3, and this is another cycle."

Are you doing it intentionally?
"Mom, don't mess with me today!"
It's like that.
"Now I don't know where that point is, frankly."
But --
linear algebra will find it.
The main point is that the three
"planes, because they're not parallel, they're not special."
They do meet in one point and that's the solution.
"But, maybe you can see that this row picture is getting a little hard to"
see.
The row picture was a cinch when we looked at two lines meeting.
"When we look at three planes meeting, it's not so clear and in"
four dimensions probably a little less clear.
"So, can I quit on the row picture?"
Or quit on the row picture before
I've successfully found the point where the three planes meet?
All I really want to see is that the row picture consists of three
"planes and, if everything works right,"
three planes meet in one point and that's a solution.
"Now, you can tell I prefer the column picture."
"Okay, so let me take the column picture."
That's x times --
"so there were two xs in the first equation minus one x is,"
and no xs in the third.
It's just the first column of that.
And how many ys are there?
"There's minus one in the first equations,"
two in the second and maybe minus three in the third.
Just the second column of my matrix.
And z times no zs minus one zs and
four zs.
"And it's those three columns,"
"right, that I have to combine to produce the right-hand side,"
which is zero minus one four.
"I mean, I don't have any doubt that the Coupe is a little bit better."
But the difference is not night and day.

This car is barely a convertible.
The roof aperture is so small it's more of a targa really.
And it's quite a fussy shape from some angels.
Those rear buttresses rise unexpectedly high.
And those ultra-low profile tires leave annoying amounts of vacant space in the wheel arches.

Have you eliminated all of Choi Chul Joo's men?
Yes.
"When the prince said that he was going to the harbor,"
I thought he was going to attack the people holding the ship to let it sail.
But this is what happened.
Now we have no way to obtain explosives.
The prince eliminated Choi Chul Joo so that we would not be implicated.
The police have finally reached the harbor.
Now we must give the Interior Minister a sufficient explanation for this.
"Choi Chul Joo used explosives to set sail, but the ship's owner Yongmun eliminated him."
"In the ensuing fight, all of his men were killed."
All of the men involved directly are now dead.
It is now impossible to identify the origin of the explosives.
Why did Yongmun kill the men with the explosives?
We were investigating explosives traders as you instructed us.
"As a result, we found Choi Chul Joo."
He had borrowed a ship from us to go to China.
Everyone is dead!
We cannot find out the source of the explosives!
We had no choice.
They had used explosives from our ship.
"If they had escaped to China, would you not have suspected us instead?"
"In addition, we did it to save lives."
We risked our lives to save the poor girls who were going to be sold in China.

"My parents have never been to Mac, so it'll be like ""here's my new home!"""
It'll be nice to have them here when I kind of know my way around a little bit more and I can sort of tell them about Macalester.

"I'm running the 5k with my mom, and ""running"" is a loose term."
I'm betting my dad will attempt the 5k and then just not want to do it about halfway through.
And then he wants to go to a Wild game so we're going to try to hit that.
"Last year I did the 5k, which was pretty awesome."
Probably we'll be going to a play in Minneapolis hopefully and cooking dinner for her.
She's the best.
I'm also running the 5k with one of my roommates.
"Running, walking the 5k with one of my roommates."
I'm really looking forward to getting some nice meals in good restaurants.
"I don't run, I stand there and watch people run around."

This is a 1967 issue of the Uppsala newspaper.
A slum was being torn down in central Uppsala.
Behind that window my mother grew up.
"It was called ""unplanned workers' quarters""."
"Gran lived there, so I've sat at that window eating soup."
She had an inner window and an outdoor toilet.
She moved in the late 1950s.
This is Grandma on the steps.
The picture was taken in the 1920s.
Grandma was born in 1891... ...when Sweden was somewhere between Uganda and Ghana.
Here she is on the steps.
She's actually showing her hair.
Otherwise she always wore a kerchief when she left the garden.
"Mom had tuberculosis and was quite ill, so I was a very longed-for child."
Which I realized later.
"When I was born, people questioned whether she should look after me."
When I was four she had another bout and I stayed with Gran.
But by then streptomycin had come.
"It came in 1949, when I was one."
It cured the disease.
Previously you were consumptive.
"Once a consumptive, always a consumptive."
I remember from Mom that it was very shameful to have tuberculosis.

"The female polar bear is number 6 because she sleeps for over three months,"
living off her fat reserves.
She not only survives the winter-- but creates two new lives.
The young bears learn their survival skills from mother.
"How to keep warm, what to eat, where to walk."
They must learn fast-- or freeze solid-- just like the animal sliding into number 5.
Only one frog in the world is found north of the Arctic Circle.
The wood frog.
It has to survive the northern winter.
The frog is cold blooded.
"So when the ground freezes, so does the frog."
Cold's not the problem.
It's the ice.
The crystals expand like daggers.
"For most animals, freezing means certain death."
But not this frog.
The first ice crystal forming on its skin sets off a chain reaction.
The cells prepare by filling with glucose-- a natural antifreeze.
The fluid between the cells contains proteins that attract ice-- quickly forming crystals small enough to prevent injury.
Blood freezes in veins.
And the ice races towards the heart.
"In 20 hours, the frog is frozen."
70% of the water in its body is ice.
There's no breathing.
No heartbeat.
The wood frog is number 5 because it survives the winter in suspended animation.
Essentially there's no frog here at all.
"It's just a collection of individual cells, suspended in ice, struggling to stay alive."
The frog spends months locked inside its frozen time capsule.
The quad is what I really like.

"I cut off my hair, and of course, she backed out, but even though my bangs looked horrible"

"Oh man, I'm going home"
"All right, number 14."
"In the xy plane, the equation you of line I is-- let me write that down-- number 14."
The equation of line I is y is equal to 2x plus 5.
"If the line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis, what is the equation of line m?"
"So I'm going to draw a graph for you, just so you understand what I'm doing."
But on the real SAT you really don't have to do this because you wouldn't want to run out of time.
"Oh man, I'm going to run out of time if I can't draw a straight line."
I'm being a stickler for this.
"Oh, I still couldn't do it."
I'll move forward.
"So this line, so y equals 2x plus 5."
"So if you remember from our slope and y-intercept modules, the y-intercept's going to be 5, right here."
And then the line's going to have a slope of 2.
Right?
So the line's going to look something like this.
That's line l.
This is line l.
"And then we want to know, they say line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis."
So reflection would kind of be the x-axis-- this is the x-axis.
"So it's like if we were looking at this in a pool of water, the reflection would be like if you took this and flipped it over the x-axis."
So the line m is going to look something like this.
Line m is going to look like this.
So a couple of things.
It's like the mirror image.
"If we flipped it, it's like we flipped it over the axis."
"So if the y-intercept here is 5, the y-intercept here is going to be minus 5."
Right?
Because we just flipped it.
"And similarly, if every one this moves up 2, right, because that's at slope."
2.
For every one we move here to the right we're going to go down 2.
So the slope is going to be the negative of this or negative 2.
"Merlo Pont, Jacques Lacan, Raymon Queneau, and its said that Jean Paul Sartre got the notes"
The Master-Slave dialectic sets out the origen of history.
How did history begin?
Perhaps no one ever asked himself this but the beginning of history is the beginning of human relations
"For Hegel, history began when two wills clashed, two desiring wills"
First let's differentiate between the human will and the animal will
The human will seeks other wills.
To wit: the will of one man seeks the will of another
That is: he desires that the other recognize him ...that he recognize him as the superior. ..that he submits.
So that I seek the will of the other.
I want the other to recognize me and submit to me.
And I'm going to constitute myself when this happens
The relationship that is going to be established between the other and myself
But at first the man seeks wills.
The animal seeks things and the things that it seeks it usually eats.
It desires natural things.
But man doesn't seek natural things
The consciousness is desire.

You like the shape of the rhinoceros?
The rhinoceros?
"Uhh, I havent really thought about it"
So let's say that that is the x-axis.
"Actually, I drew this-- let me edit, undo."
OK.
So let me draw the x-axis.
You might realize pretty soon why I have to redo this.
"The y-axis. x, y."
All right.
So we know that a and c are negative.
"So c is the y-intercept, right?"
"When x is equal to 0, we're just left with g of x is equal to c."
So c is the y-intercept.
"So if c is less than 0, we know that the y-intercept is going to be below the x-axis."
It's going to be a negative number.
We know that this is c.
That's where the graph intersects the y-axis.
We also know it's going to be symmetric around the y-axis.
"Well, actually, we don't know for sure that it's going to be symmetrical around the y-axis."
"And I could go into that in more detail, but I won't."
But that's all we need to know.
It depends what the bx-- this term-- is.
But let's just ignore that for now.
And then we know that a is negative.
"So in general, you might want to prove it to yourself, you know the graph of y equals x squared."
That opens up like this.
And the graph of y is equal to minus x squared.
It goes down like that.
So a possible graph for this would look like this.
The important thing is these are the two things that you know when they tell you a and c is negative.
"It's going to be a graph that opens downwards, and it's going to intersect the y-axis in the negative area, below the x-axis."
A legitimate graph also would have looked like this.
It could have also looked like this.
It didn't actually have to be symmetric.

"Well, how should I...?"
"I don't actually think I've ever given a talk on the history of Mozilla to a large set of people, which is pretty shocking..."
Ok!
So...
I'm gonna give it a try.
I'm not sure if I've actually given a talk on the history of Mozilla to this many people.
So that's probably an indication that I need to do more of it.
"Mozilla's been around for a long time, since 1998."
And I thought when we got started...
I'd like to ask:
"Of the people here, how many have been in Mozilla for three months or less?"
Can you raise your hand?
"Ok, excellent."
How many have been here a year or so?
That's a pretty good group too.
"Ok, how about the five year?"
Pretty good and I'm gonna say the ten year.
How many people?
"Who's around, though?"
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..."
So there's nine people in this room that have been working on Mozilla for ten years and more.
And there's probably another nine or ten people in this gathering today who have been here that long as well.
And so I'm gonna explain the different roles that we had in the early days.
"I'll try to name some names as we go along, I won't get all of those names, but if you see this people and have questions about Mozilla or Mozilla's history, find a good time and ask them, because we all have many memories."
"So, Mozilla started in 1998."

3 times 3 is 9.
We did the whole thing.
They're just repeating the same question.
That equals 10.
That's choice B.
Rewind the video and see what I did here.
3 times 3 is 9 times minus 3i plus 3i minus i squared.
"These terms cancel out and you get a minus i squared, which is minus negative 1."
"So you have 9 plus 1, so that equals 10."
So that is choice B.
That's crazy.
They just gave us the same problem twice in a row.
All right.
They're giving us more and more imaginary problems.
"But these are fun, especially if they're going to repeat the same question."
"Problem 30, if i is equal to the square root of negative 1-- well, I'll just keep writing it because they keep writing it."
It's good as a reminder. i is equal to the square root of negative 1 and a and b are non-zero real numbers.
What is 1 over a plus bi?
"Well, once again, if they kind of want us to rewrite this, they probably just want us to get rid of the i's in the denominator."
So we multiply times the conjugate of this complex number.
"So we multiply times a plus bi, the conjugate over the conjugate, a plus bi."
The conjugate isn't this whole thing.
The conjugate is just a plus bi.
"Oh sorry, we should be multiplying times a minus bi. a minus bi over a minus bi."
"The conjugate of a plus bi, just so you get the terminology right, is just the a minus bi."
But I'm doing a minus bi over a minus bi.
So I'm not changing this fraction because this obviously is 1. x over x is the same thing as 1.
So let's see what this is equal to.
"Well, the numerator just becomes a minus bi times 1, which is a minus bi."
"Then you have a times a, which is a squared. a times minus bi, so it's minus abi."
"Then you have bi times a, which is plus abi."
I'll write it down here.
Why not using it ?
"For too long, we are the laughing stock of Horizon 1.0."
We have an opportunity to regain our dignity.
We can't control it !
"Artheon is right, we can't use it !"
We have to sale it at the auction house.
"No, the cheated staff must be destroyed."
"Bandaid, delete it !"
"No, I don't want to."
It'll be a waste !
Imagine how much we could earn if...
"Delete it, if not I will kick you out from the guild !"
"Ho, dictator, tyrant, fascist, communist !"
OK...
But it's really not fair at all...
"Obviously, this cheated staff is indestructible."
"I'm the only one who can destroy it, or a game master, maybe."
"But for that, he will have to delete the avatar of the owner with it."
On no.
"The staff cannot be destroyed, by any craft we here posses."
"So let's sale it, it's the only solution."
Let us use it !
"With it, even Bandaid will be usefull."
"I say it again, this item is a gift."
We have one solution left.
"We have to bring it into the Vulca earth, and throw it into the endless abyss fault of the Arks."
What ?
This zone is only available from the level 45.
Every player falling into the Arks fault will for ever lose one of his items.
It's the biggest penalty in the game.
We just have to throw in Bandaid until his cheated staff disapears.
"No, this is crap, in that case, we can call a game master right now !"
And they're like pissed.
"Well, as pissed as a news anchor can be."
"-Boy, that interview on osteoporosis on Good Morning America sounded a lot better now than it did a few minutes ago."
[laughter]
-I'm like an angry troll.
-Don't be trolling girl.
So naturally my question is: so you missed the bridge falling; you can't rewind the tape and watch it?
"I mean, you're a news center."
Do don't have that kind of technology?
Or you couldn't do a split-screen?
Even I can do a split-screen.
"Hell, I can do a triple screen with the troll."
"""Triple screens are gay and so is your face... yo."""
"I don't know, I don't want to rip on him"
'cause I don't know how news stations work.
"But anyway, back to my original point."
"This video's funny, but why 8 million views?"
I don't get it.
"Maybe if they took her and crammed her into a dryer or if they took him and rammed his head into a fire extinguisher, then it would get 8 million views and we would all go"
"""Yeah, I get it."""
"Not that I recommend ramming a news anchor's head into a fire extinguisher,"
I'm just sayin'.
"If such a thing did happen, the video might go viral."
But you know what else you should cram into a dryer?
"The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bing!, and she said..."
"-If you were to have your own holiday, what would it be called?"
-So invent a holiday.
What's your holiday?

-Really?
-Yes.
"Anyway, he gave me this paper... ...and asked me to give it to anyone if he is late... ...and who will take this paper will drive me."

How can your uncle treat you like that?

So the answer is no.
Katherine Weare is a professor at the Exeter University in UK.

It is great to be here and looking at these great crowded people can make you feel quite jumped-up really about yourself and feel you are very important  to be sat on this stage.
I went home once after a do like this and I said to my son- he was in the kitchen-
"""I had a great time."
"Somebody came up to me afterwards and said, 'I could listen  to you talk all day'."""
"He said, ""Only because we don't have to."""
(Laughter)
"But I am afraid you have to, for 7 and half minutes, whatever I have left."
"Like everyone here, I have a mindfulness story and it is very similar actually, to some of the earlier ones."

"No.... you're all singing, but you're not going. you think you're traveling with me on my vacation,but that ain't happening, so you can stop singing"
I'm sure you're feeling uncomfortable
"Sir, with all due respect, sitting on a red hot poker is uncomfortable."
This is excruciating.
Maybe we should just put it on the## backburner for a while
I was kinda hoping you could explain that picture.
"Well, I was asking for change."

Still bonding sir
Good morning
"Mommy , it's fake happy Mike.."
You're angry.
It's easy to make a family
"But what's important is, how this family will be you have to make great effort to keep it together"
Now you'll be both responsible for each other
I am sure you will do great
But you will also face some storms you'll have fights.. discussions.. all this might happen
But it is important to know how make up you have to yield for each other try to be silent when angry
If you do these things your ship will sail
If you don't we will always remember your words
Don't worry we will do our best to keep our family happy

"We're gonna look at one more really interesting al-, algorithm that has, lots of important applications, called a Rabin Karp Algorithm."
Invented by two Turing award winners.
Michael Rabin and Dick Karp.
"I can remember hearing about this algorithm, from my friend, Dick Lipton, who explained it to me over the phone, and, I, he explained it to me in about, fifteen seconds, and I realized I had to have this, in the book."
"And, so now, here we are, presenting it."
"Th, that was, in the 70's."
"So the basic idea for the Rabin-Karp algorithm is, has to do with hashing."
He was a wise professor of sociology from Michigan.
"A ""Mandela"" type."
There were only eight of us at the meeting.
Afterwards he asked what we were studying and when we'd be done.
I said I would finish med school in 1975.
"""We'll probably be independent then, come work for us."" We shook on it."
Then he was killed by a letter bomb the next year.
That made the promise more serious.
In 1975 Mozambique won its independence.
"We founded the Africa Groups' Recruitment Organization and then we went, Agneta as a midwife and me as a doctor."

Papa Enrique is wearing my glasses.
He dressed wounds.
I saw that he treated infected wounds and burns the same way.
"""Can't you see the difference?"""
I asked.
Then I gave him my glasses.
"""Now I see!"" he said."
"""There's pus in this wound."
"I can't afford glasses."""
So I gave him my spare glasses.
It gave him a whole new life.
And he provided a whole new class of care.
"When I wrote instructions, he said:"
"""Unfortunately I cannot read."""
Eventually we created two symbols.
Infections were marked with a cross and he took those last.
The hardest part was understanding the depth of poverty.
We knew we couldn't give the same kind of care as in Sweden of 1970 but we didn't realize we had to go back to 1850.
Eventually we learned to treat fractures without plaster or anesthetic.

Computer monitor
A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures for computers. Monitors often look like smaller televisions. The main difference between a monitor and a television is that a monitor does not have a television tuner to change channels. Monitors often have higher display resolution than televisions. A high display resolution makes it easier to see smaller letters and fine graphics.
There are three types of computer displays:
Diameter
"In geometry, the diameter of a circle is a line from one side directly to the opposite side through the centre. It can also be defined as the longest chord of a circle. The same explanations can be also used to describe the diameter in a sphere."
"The letter ""d"" or the symbol ⌀ are often used as a symbol for the diameter. The diameter's length is often called the diameter itself."
"The diameter's length is twice the radius, and therefore the relationship between the diameter's length and radius can be shown with the equations:"

History.
"In 1869, the island of Hokkaidō was organized into 11 provinces."
"Other than the Hokkaido provinces, the majority of Japan's former provinces were converted into prefectures by the Meiji government between 1870 and 1876."
"The Hokkaidō provinces were dissolved in 1882. In that year, they were replaced with Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture."
"In 1886, Hakodate, Sapporo and Nemuro prefectures were abolished. The reform replaced with another entity called the ."
"In 1947, Hokkaido Prefecture was established. The old provincial boundaries are mirrored in the island's subprefectures."

Scram
"A scram or SCRAM is a quick shutdown of a nuclear reactor. It is done in an emergency (a dangerous situation). A scram is performed by quickly inserting all of the control rods, or, if this fails, injecting boric acid into the reactor. A reactor that has been shut down still requires cooling due to decay heat. If the cooling system fails, the core can still melt down even if the reactor has been shut down. This has happened during several nuclear accidents, including Three Mile Island and Fukushima. The RBMK reactors used in the Soviet Union had graphite-tipped control rods, a design flaw which caused the reactivity to increase for a moment when the reactor was scrammed. This design flaw contributed to the Chernobyl disaster."
Sorrel
"Sorrel (""Rumex acetosa""), also called common sorrel or garden sorrel, is a perennial herb that is cultivated as a garden herb or leaf vegetable (pot herb). Sorrel is also known by the names spinach dock and narrow-leaved dock."

"After the battle, Guam was turned into a base for Allied operations. Five large airfields were built by the Seabees. B-29 bombers flew from the island to attack targets in the Western Pacific and on mainland Japan."
"Four U.S. Marines were awarded the Medal of Honor for their brave actions during the Battle of Guam: PFC Luther Skaggs Jr., PFC Frank Witek (after death), PFC Leonard F. Mason (after death) and Captain (later General) Louis H. Wilson, Jr.."

Western Allied invasion of Germany
"The Western Allied invasion of Germany was an attack on Nazi Germany that was done by the Western Allies in the final months of the European War in World War II. The invasion started with the Allies crossing the Rhine River. Then they spread out and moved through western Germany. The Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945. This is known as the ""Central Europe Campaign"" in United States military histories."
"By the early spring of 1945, the Allied forces in Europe were doing well. On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany since the October Battle of Aachen. By January, the Allies beat the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this last major German attack took the last of Germany's strength. The Germans could not do much to stop the final Allied attacks in Europe."
"Additional losses in the Rhineland weakened the German Army, leaving few troops to defend the east bank of the Rhine. By mid-March, the Allies had captured an intact bridge at Remagen. They also defended the bridge on the river's east bank."
"German casualties during the Allied attacks to reach the Rhine in February–March 1945 were about 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war."
"On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Red Army had moved through Poland. The Russians"
were nearing Berlin. The Soviets also moved into Hungary and eastern Czechoslovakia. These advances on the Eastern Front destroyed experienced German troop groups. It also made it very hard for Adolf Hitler to strengthen his Rhine defenses.
Order of battle.
Allied forces.
"At the very beginning of 1945, the Commander of the Allies, General Dwight D. Eisenhower had 73 divisions under his command in North-western Europe. This included 49 infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions and four airborne divisions."
"As the invasion of Germany started, Eisenhower had 90 divisions. This included 25 armored divisions. He had one of the largest forces in any war. The Allied line along the Rhine stretched from the North Sea to the Swiss border. The Allies wanted to capture the industrial Ruhr area."
German forces.
"Facing the Allies was ""Oberbefehlshaber West"" (""Army Command West"") commanded by Field Marshal Albert Kesselring."
"Kesselring had shown he was good at defending land in the Italian Campaign. But in Germany, he did not have the troops or weapons to make a good defense."
"During the fighting west of the Rhine up to March 1945, the German Army on the western front had only 26 divisions. Most of the troops were used against the Soviet forces. The Germans had 214 divisions on the eastern front in April."
Eisenhower's plans.
"After capturing the Ruhr, Eisenhower planned to have 21st Army Group go east to Berlin. Eisenhower began to change his plans toward the end of March. He found out that Soviet forces held a bridge over the Oder River, from Berlin. He was worried the Soviets would capture Berlin before the western Allies."
"In addition, he was worried about the Ruhr. The Ruhr had many Axis troops and a lot of industries. He was also worried about the ""National Redoubt."" Some people said Hitler's most loyal troops were preparing to"
defend themselves in the mountains of southern Germany and western Austria.
"American forces in the south were really fighting hard to win. On 7 March, Lt. Gen. Courtney H. Hodges's 1st Army had captured a bridge over the Rhine at Remagen."
"Johnson County was divided into nine townships. Two of these no longer exist. They were made part of independent municipalities. All of the cities are considered ""governmentally independent"". They are not included in the census numbers for the townships."

Korean paper
"Hanji (Korean paper) is the Korean traditional paper. ""Hanji"" literally means “paper of Korea”. ""Han"" stands for ""Korea,"" and ""ji"" means ""paper."""
History.
"""Hanji""’s history goes back to 4th century. Koreans started making it after papermaking technique came to Korea from China with Buddhism. After since, Korean paper came to be known as the highest quality paper available in East Asia. During Goryeo period, ""hanji"" flourished with the development of printing technique in Korea. Its best days continued throughout Joseon Dynasty. However, it didn’t last forever. Western’s mass production of paper and Japanese’s oppression on Korean traditional cultures ended golden ages of ""hanji"". Nowadays, Korean paper is considered as a tradition worth preserving and spreading. More people are interested in arts and crafts of ""hanji"", and there it has become the part of the tourism for foreigners, too."
Characteristic.
"""Hanji"" is made out of inner bark of mulberry, a tree native to Korea. The inner bark of the mulberry is so strong and durable that it does not decay in water up to a year. Korean paper’s durability comes from this tree. The life span of Korean paper is 1,000 years. For example, ""Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong,"" the world's oldest woodblock print was created in 751. Also, thanks to its durability, Koreans even used it as body armor in war. 1 year old trees are used to make the high-quality ""hanji"", and older trees are used for cheaper modern papers."
Usage.
"There are several kinds of mulberry trees in Korea. They grow in different climate conditions. Each kind of mulberry tree produces different kinds of hanji, and they are all used in a different way. There are various kinds of Korean paper, and they are named after their usage. ""Changhoji"", for instance, is a kind of Korean paper. ""Changhoji"" means window paper. Koreans used to glue ""changhoji"" on a door because it allows both air and light through it, thanks to its wide fiber. There are other kinds of ""hanji"" as well. When Korean paper is used as a copy paper, it is called ""bogsaji"". It is used as paper for family registry book or Buddhist scriptures. When the Four Gracious Plants (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum and bamboo) or birds are drawn on ""hanji"", it's called ""hwasunji"", the drawing paper. Nowadays, Korean paper is used for arts and crafts."

This tradition is called siesta, and is most common in Spain and Latin America. Some stores and services close while their owners and/or employees take their siesta."
Word.
"The word ""sleep"" comes from the old Old Germanic verbs for sleep. In Old and Middle High German, it was called ""SLAF"". The original meaning of the word was ""to slap"", which was related to the word for ""flabby"" (not hard or firm)."
"Many words related to ""sleep"" have very different meanings. For example, ""sleep"" may be used to mean death, so that ""putting an animal to sleep"" means to kill the animal without pain. ""Sleep with someone"" can also have a sexual meaning."
What sleep is for.
"Sleep helps the brain function. The details are not fully understood, but it is important to get enough sleep for the body and the brain to be healthy and to work properly. In general, animals (and people) sleep at periodic intervals, such as once a day. Certain animals send out signals to the others that they will soon go to sleep. Yawning is such a signal."
"Both humans and many animals sleep about once a day. Some animals, such as cats, sleep many times a day for short periods up to 15 hours a day (or even longer)."
"When people sleep, they often have dreams. Probably some animals do, too."
"Not only people sleep, but all mammals and birds, and most fish, reptiles and other animals also too."
Brief stages of sleep.
There are four stages during sleep:
"While humans sleep, REM and NREM are sleep patterns that help with long-term memory, remembering information, procedural memory, and creative thinking."
Different types of sleep.
REM sleep.
"In mammals and birds, sleep can be divided into two categories. In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. It is called REM-sleep (rapid eye movement). Most dreams take place in this phase. as the body becomes relaxed and the eyes move while sleeping. This phase helps prepare one for the next day. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night, and the periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. It is often encountered 90 minutes after falling asleep, and continues to occur every 90 minutes. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253."
"REM sleep is found in mammals and songbirds, but is ""poorly established"" in reptiles and fish. According to a survey:"
NREM sleep.
"The other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). In general, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes, stages III and IV are combined and called stage III."
"Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), and REM."
Getting enough sleep.
"People who regularly get less than 8 hours of sleep a night tend to complain more and feel very fatigued throughout the day. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep is extremely important, as it could affect one’s body and increase the chances of serious health problems. For each age group, there are different amounts of sleep that are recommended:"
- Toddlers (4 to 12 months): 12 to 16 hours (w/ naps)
- Toddlers (1–2 years): 11 to 14 hours (w/ naps)
- Preschoolers (3–5 years): 10 to 13 hours (w/ naps)
- Grade Schoolers (6 to 12 years): 9 to 12 hours
- Teenagers(13–18 years): 8 to 10 hours
- Adults (including old age): 7 to 9 hours
The timing of sleep and the amount of it are both important. Both are different for different people. Some adults sleep best from 22:00 to 05:00 or 06:00 or 07:00. Some sleep best from midnight to seven or eight. These variations are normal.
"How much sleep is enough also depends on age. Children need more sleep than adults. Newborn babies sleep about 18 hours per day. Small babies sleep many times a day; human babies do not develop circadian rhythms before they are 3 – 4 months old. At the age of 1 year, they sleep for about 14 hours."
"A nine-year-old should sleep about 9–10 hours per day and teenagers, too, also need that much sleep. Adults who sleep less than about 8 hours a day perform worse than those who sleep that long."
Bad habits.
Poor habits could affect one’s sleep schedule in many ways without taking notice. A few habits that are very common and ruin sleep are:

The ""Stabat Mater"" hymn is about the suffering of Mary, Jesus Christ's mother, during his crucifixion. It is sung at the liturgy on the memorial of Our Lady of Sorrows. The ""Stabat Mater"" has been set to music by many composers, among them Palestrina, Pergolesi, Alessandro Scarlatti and Domenico Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Haydn, Rossini, Dvořák, George Henschel, Karol Szymanowski, Poulenc and Arvo Pärt."
"In the 16th centry, the hymn was added to the Roman missal. The Council of Trent banned it, like most sequences. In the 18th century it was added to the Breviary of Roman Catholic mass. The Second Vactican Council abolished this form of mass, so it is only part of regular mass one day of the year. The current version can be found in the Roman Gradual, which dates of 1973."

When people have silicosis, the changes in their body often are cyanosis (when skin goes a blueish color), a fever, when the body gets hotter or being not able to breathe properly. Sometimes doctors do not realize that someone has silicosis, and think that they have other illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis or fluid in the lungs."
"It was first noticed in 1705 by ""Bernardino Ramazzini"" (an Italian doctor). He saw something that looked like sand in the lungs of stonecutters. The name silicosis is from Visconti in 1870. The name comes from the Latin ""silex"" which means flint."

"Hemingway's sentences were short, the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas City Star newspaper. He wrote about what he knew and felt. He used few descriptive words. His statements were clear and easily understood."
"He had learned from earlier writers, like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson, but Hemingway brought something new to his writing. He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt. In later books, sometimes he missed. Sometimes he even looked foolish. But when he was right he was almost perfect."
Marriage with Pauline Pfeiffer.
"With the success of his novel, Hemingway became even more popular in Paris. Many people came to see him. One was an American woman, Pauline Pfeiffer. She became Hadley's friend. Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway."
"Hemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly. One time, they went away together on a short trip. Years later, Hemingway wrote when he returned that ""...I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face."""
"But they wouldn't stay married. Hadley knew Hemingway was also in love with Pfeiffer. Hemingway was seeing her in secret, even though he was married with Pauline. Because of this, Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated. She kept their son. He agreed to give her money he earned from his books. In later years, he said that his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life."
"At twenty-five, Hemingway was living in Paris. He was a famous writer. But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous. Much later he said, ""the city was never to be the same again. When I returned to it, I found it had changed as I had changed. Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy."""
"Hemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928. They settled in Key West, an island with a fishing port near the southern coast of Florida."
His well-known books.
"Before leaving Paris, Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to New York to be published. The book of stories, called ""Men Without Women"", was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West."
The Killers.
"One of the stories was called ""The Killers."" In it, Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming violence. This was a new way of telling a story. Here is an example:Nick opened the thingy and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He did not look at Nick."
"""What was it?"" He asked."
"""I was up at Henry's,"" Nick said, ""and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you."""
"It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing, ""they put us out in the kitchen,"" Nick went on. ""They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper."""
"Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything. ""George thought I ought to come and tell you about it."""
"""There is not anything I can do about it,"" Ole Andreson said."
"Any new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers. But stories like ""The Killers"" shocked many people. Some thought there was too much violence in his stories. Others said he only wrote about gunmen, soldiers, fighters, and drinkers."
This made Hemingway angry. He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story.
"Hemingway was happy in Key West. In the morning he wrote, in the afternoon he fished, and at night he went to a public house and drank. One old fisherman said: ""Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully. He asked a lot of questions. And he always wanted to get his information exactly right."""
A Farewell to Arms.
"Soon afterwards, he heard that his father had killed himself. Hemingway was shocked. He said, ""My father taught me so much. He was the only one I really cared about."""
When Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before.
"His new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One. He meets an English nurse, and they fall in love. They flee from the army, but she dies during childbirth. Some of the events are taken from Hemingway's service in Italy. The book is called ""A Farewell to Arms""."
"Part of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto:""At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. . . .""Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went up the bank looking for a place to cross. . . . we did not see any troops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. """
Death in the Afternoon.
"""A Farewell to Arms"" was very successful. It earned Hemingway a lot of money. Because of this money, he could travel to other places."
"One place he visited was Spain, a country he loved. He said, ""I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain. And if I can write any of it down truly, then it will represent all of Spain."""
"He wrote a book called ""Death in the Afternoon"". It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting. Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art, just as much as writing was an art. And he believed it was a true test of a man's bravery, something that always concerned him."
The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
"Hemingway also travelled to Africa. He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting. He said, ""Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like. No riding in cars, just simple walking and feeling the grass under my feet."""
"The trip to Africa resulted in a book called ""The Green Hills of Africa"" and many smaller stories."

RB Leipzig
RB Leipzig (RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V.) is a German football club from Leipzig.
History.
The club was founded on 19 May 2009 by the Red Bull Company. It was formed out of the SSV Markranstädt. Due to the regulations of the DFB the name Red Bull Leipzig for marketing reasons was forbidden so they were called RB (short for RasenBallsport). Also the logo was forbidden.
"The company was sure that there is a great chance to form a new club, because with the Zentralstadion (now Red Bull Arena) there was a good stadium and there is no club in professional football in the area. The club is now in the Bundesliga. Like in Salzburg many fans protested against this deal because they had the fear that the fanculture will vanish and football will be only a business. So they wanted a ""normal"" football club."
"They started in the Oberliga Nordost-Süd(5th level) and became 1st in the 2009/10 season. But the next season they failed to gain promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. So the coach was changed, the new one is the Austrian Peter Pacult. The first match under the new coach was a 3:2 win in the German Cup (1st round) versus VfL Wolfsburg from the Bundesliga."

Hebrew name

Who is a Jew?
"Who is a Jew? () is the basic question about the identity of Jews, or in other words: which people are considered to be Jewish."
Question of race?
"The definition of who is a Jew may depend on a few things. Because Judaism has no specific race, it can include characteristics of an ethnicity, religion, and citizenship, and so the definition of who is a Jew is not specific."
"This question has been a subject to legal arguments, especially in Israel but also outside of it. There have been court cases in Israel since 1962 which had to address the question. In addition, the United Kingdom and other countries has had to consider whether the question was a racial issue or not."
In Nazi Germany.
It was an important question to the Nazi party in Germany. The Nazis decided who a Jew was with the Nuremberg Laws.
My mom is Jewish or I converted.
The question is based on the person's genealogy. Simple definition: a person is a Jew either by birth (in any case if one's mother is Jewish) or by religious conversion.
Other ideas.
"However, some disagree. Therefore, the following need to be taken into account:"

Third Punic War
"The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage, and the Roman Republic."
"The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars, and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage. The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city and tore down the buildings. They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them, and didn't want to fight another, so they totally destroyed them."
Punic Wars
"The Punic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC. They were probably the largest wars in the ancient world. The term ""Punic"" comes from the Latin word ""Punicus"" (or ""Poenicus""). This was the word the Romans used for the Carthaginians, due to their Phoenician ancestry."
The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic. What was at stake was control of the trading around the Mediterranean sea. Carthage lost the three wars.
Context.
"Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians. It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean. It was a maritime empire, in contrast to the land-based Roman empire. The Romans decided they needed Sicily, which was then in Carthaginian hands. The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years, and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage."

Lachesis (genus)
"Lachesis, also known as the ""bushmasters"", is a genus of venomous Pit vipers found in forests of Central and South America. The name ""Lachesis"" is also the name of one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology. There are currently three species found."
Description.
"Adult bushmasters can grow up to the length of 2 meters (6.5 ft) to 2.5 meters (8.25 ft), but there have been some which have grown up to the length of 3 meters (10 ft). The largest one ever found was 3.65 meters (12 ft) long, making the bushmasters the longest venomous snakes in the Western Hemisphere and the longest vipers in the world. They are not the heaviest vipers in the world, but adults usually weigh up to 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 11 Ib)."
Where they live.
Bushmasters are found in forest areas of Central and South America. They are also found on the island Trinidad
Reproduction.
"Bushmasters are oviparous: they lay eggs. This makes bushmasters different to other pit vipers found in the New World, because other pit vipers are viviparous, they give live birth instead of laying eggs. A female can lay around a dozen eggs at a time. The female stays with her eggs until they have hatched and may attack any predator that comes near the nest."
Venom.
"The bushmasters are one of the largest and dangerous snakes in South America, and can inject a large amount of venom into their enemies. Even young bushmaster's bites are harmful, but bushmasters are nocturnal (they are active at night), so not a lot of people have been bitten by them."

Ossicles
The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body. They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles. They are in the auditory system of all mammals.
They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness.
Anatomy.
"The ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The terms mean hammer, anvil, and stirrup."
Development.
"Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified (turned into bone) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the quadrate, prearticular, articular, and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates."

Khrushchev's Secret Speech
Krushchev's Secret Speech was the speech in which Nikita Krushchev denounced Joseph Stalin after the latter's death. The speech was a spoken report to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 25 February 1956. Its title was On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.
"The report was known as the ""Secret Speech"" because it was delivered at a closed session of Communist Party delegates, with guests and members of the press excluded. Although the text of the Khrushchev report leaked almost immediately, the official Russian text was published only in 1989 during the glasnost campaign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev."
"The speech was based on an investigation of the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 XVII Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They were victims of the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. Estimates of Stalin's role in history were quite changed by the speech. Many in the West who had been Communist Party member, or at least sympathetic fellow-travellers, resigned their memberships and no longer defended the reputation of Stalin. Russian writers like Solzhenitsyn found they were treated with more sympathy. The speech was a significant turning-point in history."
"The speech caused such shock to the audience that, according to some reports, some of those present suffered heart attacks, and others later committed suicide. Many Soviet citizens were confused by De-Stalinization. They had been fed on praise of the ""genius"" of Stalin. This was especially obvious in the Georgian SSR, Stalin's homeland, where rioting ended with the Soviet Red Army crackdown on 9 March 1956."

The plot.
"With a fascinating cast of characters, the novel in its deepest layer is about the interplay of good and evil, innocence and guilt, courage and cowardice."
"The novel is a satire on the Soviet society, a love story and an ironical look at some religious themes, all interwoven with elements and characters from the Faust legend. The novel is divided into two parts. It starts with a plot in which two apparently unrelated stories alternate chapter by chapter."

A department of restoration was added in 1973 and an archive set up in 1977.
A program for international cooperation was set up in 1993.
"In 2001, the Tokyo Institute and the Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties merged."
"In 2007, the Research Institutes were merged with the Tokyo National Museum, the Kyoto National Museum, the Nara National Museum and the Kyushu National Museum."
Poaching
"Poaching is the illegal hunting, killing or capturing of animals. People poach because animal products, such as hide, ivory, horn, teeth and bone, are sold to dealers who make clothes, jewelry and other materials from them. The poaching causes various effects, its most direct impact is extinction, either globally or within a given locality."
"Poachers catch Indian tigers with steel traps. This is against the law. After trapping a tiger, they kill it and sell the body parts for money. Like the rhino, the tiger is a very endangered species. If the killing does not end, they both face extinction (all of that type of animal dies). Extinction means that someday there may be no Indian tigers or rhinos left on earth."
Jean-Baptiste de La Salle
"San Juan Bautista de La Salle (born 30 April 1651 in Reims, France – died 7 April 1719) was a priest and an educational reformer. He was the creator of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. He was beatified on 19 February 1888 and canonized on 29 May 1900 by Pope Leo XIII. He had to take the administration of family business after his parents died, so he completed his theological studies and was ordered to the priesthood at the age of 26 on 9 April 1678. Two years later he received a doctorate in theology."
Wife
"A wife is a married woman. ""Married"" means that the law says two people are legally ""joined"". During the marriage ceremony, the wife is called the bride."
In countries and times it has been different how many wives a man can have legally. In old times there were no limitations in some countries. In Christianity and Judaism a husband (a married man) can have one wife (monogamy). In Islam a husband can have up to four wives (polygamy).
"There are some names for special kinds of wives. For example,"
a queen is a wife of a king.
A man whose wife is deceased is called a widower.
Catherine Parr
"Catherine Parr (alternatively Katherine or Kateryn) (c. August 1512 – 5 September 1548) was Queen of England and of Ireland (1543–47). She was the last of the six wives of King Henry VIII. She married him on 12 July 1543, and outlived him by one year. She was also the most-married English queen, with four husbands. She was also the first woman to be queen of both England and Ireland."
"Catherine had a close relationship with Henry's three children. She personally helped teach school for Elizabeth and Edward, both of whom became English monarchs. She helped get the Third Succession Act in 1543 passed. This placed Mary I and Elizabeth I, back into the line of succession to the British throne."
"Henry died on 28 January 1547. Six months after Henry's death, she married her fourth and final husband, Thomas Seymour, the Baron of Sudeley."
"Catherine gave birth to her only child — a daughter, Mary Seymour. She was named after Catherine's stepdaughter Mary – on 30 August 1548. She died only six days later, on 5 September 1548, at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, from what was probably childbed fever (sepsis). This was common at that time, because births did not happen in clean conditions."
"Many years later, in 1782, the coffin of Queen Catherine was found in the ruins of the Sudeley Castle chapel."
Queen (band)
"Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. They are among the most commercially successful bands in history, selling over 300 million records worldwide.

Three of their biggest hits were ""Bohemian Rhapsody”, ""We Will Rock You"", and ""We Are the Champions""."
Formation.
"With his friend Tim Staffell, Brian May started a band called 1984 in the mid-1960s. The band broke up after a little bit and then May decided to make another band and teamed up with two other college students named Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves ""Smile"" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They did a few hits such as ""April Lady"". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of Smile and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left Smile to join Humpy Bongs and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano in 1970. Then Farrokh came up with the name Queen, so they changed it from ""Smile"" to ""Queen"". They then started auditions for a new bassist. They were going through several bassists during this time and none of them stuck, only lasting for about a few minutes. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called ""Queen"" with songs such as ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" and ""Liar"". Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics ""Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me"" in ""My Fairy King"". Brian May has a degree in astrophysics."

World line
"A world line is the unique path that an object has as it travels through both space and time, usually called spacetime. As we learn from special relativity, the faster an object goes, the more time slows down for that object. As you can see in the illustration to the right, the slower object has a quicker passage of time than the very fast object, the one which time passes much more slowly for. When an object reaches the speed of light, it will be zero on the ""t"" axis, meaning that it will have made no progress in the time direction. Basically, the world lines show that when the speed of light is reached, time stops for the observer. World lines are very often used in theoretical physics and special relativity, as well as general relativity."
Usage.
"The concept of world lines is used widely in theoretical physics, for it shows some interesting facts about high-speed motion. For example, the time dilation equation presented by Albert Einstein is algebraically undefined when an object's velocity is the speed of light, but using world lines one can find that when the speed is the speed of light, time will stop. Although Einstein's equation (for time dilation) does show that an object going faster than light goes backward in time, the same concept can be described using world lines."

The winner of each city is allowed to go to Los Angeles for the big final. Gagnon won the whole competition and had his first contract with Vans. He started his professional career by doing demonstration with the team and competition."
"But in 2000, He decided to move to California where the sport is more important and he could do it all year long. There is also more competition in California. Since he moved there, he has competed in Brazil, China and Switzerland. For him, skateboarding is not just a sport; it is a kind of art. It is a way of expressing himself, being original and unique. It is not a traditional sport where everybody executes the same tricks. A skateboarder needs to develop a unique style almost like an artist."
"Pierre-Luc Gagnon said that skateboarding helps kids to use their imagination for trying new things. He fell in love with skateboarding when he started and he never stops. He started to go to the skate park each day after school at the age of nine, and now he practices it six days a week three hours by day."

Tamamo-no-Mae
"Tamamo-no-Mae (玉藻前) is a legendary figure in Japanese mythology and folklore. In the Otogizoshi, a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period, Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe. She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan. Tamamo-no-Mae's body mysteriously always smelled wonderful, and her clothes never became dirty. Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful, but she was very wise in all subjects. Although she appeared to be only twenty years old, there was no question that she could not answer. She answered every question posed to her, whether about music, religion, or astronomy. Because of her beauty and intelligence, everyone in the Imperial Court adored her, and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her."
"After some time had passed, the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill. He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers, but they had none to offer. Finally, an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness. The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails (kitsune), who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne. Following this, Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court."
"The Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke, the most powerful warriors of the day, to hunt and kill the fox. After escaping from the hunters for some time, the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream. Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae, the fox told Miura-nosuke would kill it the next day, and begged for its life. Miura-no-suke refused."
"Early the next day, the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu, and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow. The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki, or Killing Stone, which kills anyone that comes in contact with it. Tamamo-no-Mae's spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone."
"Hoji is said to have haunted this stone until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji. Genno did a certain spiritual ritual, and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation, until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again."
"In Matsuo Bashō's famous book, ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"" (Oku no Hosomichi), Bashō tells of visiting the stone."
"The stone split on March 5, 2022. While some have humorously said that Tamamo-no-Mae is now free, there is a far more general belief that the split is an omen of impending tragedy."
"Tamamo-no-Mae's legend served as base for the noh drama ""Sesshō-seki"" (""The Killing Stone"") and the kabuki play ""Tamamo-no-Mae"" (or ""The Beautiful Fox Witch"")."

Floppy disk
"The floppy disk (or a 3 1/2 floppy for today's standard) is a removable magnetic storage medium. Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. Floppy disks are inserted in to a floppy disk drive or simply floppy drive to allow data to be read or stored."
Floppy disks store much less data than a CD-ROM disk or USB flash drive. A normal 3 inch disk can store 1.44 megabytes of data. This is usually enough for simple text documents.
"A special type of floppy disk was made in the late 1980s. It could store 2.88 MB of data. They did not become popular. Larger size floppy disks became available in the 1990s. The two most popular were the Zip drive and the Jaz drive, both made by Iomega."
"Floppy disk technology has been around since the early 1970s (the 8-inch floppy was the first). Today, floppy disks have been replaced by other storage media, like USB flash drives. Floppy disks and drives are no longer manufactured, but are still widely-available as new old stock."
The floppy drive.
"A floppy drive (often called drives “A” and “B” on a computer running DOS or Windows) can be connected to or installed in a personal computer (PC). It is the part of a computer that reads and writes the disk that can be removed. A disk, often called a ""floppy disk"", is used to store files and carry them from one computer to another by using the floppy drive. The floppy drive reads the disk (or diskette) and the user is then able to open and change the files saved on the disk."
Nat King Cole
"Nathaniel Adams Coles, professionally known as Nat King Cole, (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965) was an American jazz musician, singer and songwriter. He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole’s recordings were sold while he was alive. He died of lung cancer in February, 1965, when he was forty-five years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America’s greatest performers of popular and jazz music."
Early years.
"When Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father’s church. His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years."
His interest in jazz.
"Cole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole’s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano."
Well-known popular singer.
"By the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records."
"The first song he recorded for Capitol was “Straighten Up and Fly Right.” He wrote the song. The words were based on his father’s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies."
"Nat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include “Sweet Lorraine,” “Nature Boy,” “Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer,” “When I Fall in Love,” and “Mona Lisa.” In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of “Mona Lisa.” That song made him famous as a singer."
"Nat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is ""Saint Louis Blues"". He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called ""The Nat King Cole Story""."
"In the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time."
He received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
His success as a black man.
"By 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada."
Cole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.
"Cole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems."
"Cole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support ""The Nat King Cole Show"" for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year."
His family.
"Nat King Cole was married two times. In 1936, he married a dancer, Nadine Robinson. Their marriage failed. In 1948, he married Maria Ellington. They had three children. They also adopted and raised two other children."

Linear-feedback shift register
"A linear-feedback shift register is a shift register which will produce a sequence of numbers. The next value of the sequence depends on the current value. Thie first value is usually called seed. Usually, the function XOR is used to link two consecutive values. Commonly, the function XOR is used on a bit-level. With n bits, it is possible to represent 2n numbers, so after 2n-1 values the sequence will repat. In computing, linear-feedback shift registers are commonly used to compute pseudorandom numbers."

"When his brother Oswald was killed in 642, the overlordship died with him. Oswald had been king of a combined Bernicia, Deira and Lindsey (kingdom). But Northumbria was divided back into its earlier weaker sub-kingdoms. Penda, now the most powerful king in England took Lindsey. Oswiu became King of Bernicia. Oswine claimed Deira, preventing Oswiu from keeping it with Bernicia. A year after it happened Oswiu recovered parts of his brother's body from the battlefield where he died. Oswiu had Oswald's arm enshrined in his royal centre at Bamburgh and his head was taken to Lindisfarne."
"Oswiu invaded Deira in 651 seeking to reunite Deira with Bernicia. Oswine was betrayed by one of his own noblemen and was murdered in 651 on Oswiu's orders. But the Deirans chose Athelwald, Oswiu's nephew, as their king. Athelwald then aligned himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda. Deira was under the protection of Mercia for the next three years. But Penda was determined to defeat Oswiu and take Bernicia as well. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. According to Bede, Penda attacked Oswiu several times. With a much smaller force Oswiu attacked Penda's army near the banks of the River Winwaed. Most of the commanders of the thirty legions were killed including King Anna of East Anglia and Penda. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia."
Easter controversy.
"When Oswiu and Eanflaed were married, he was raised in the Celtic church while she was raised in the Roman church. The main difference was how each calculated the date of Easter. Members of the Celtic church might be celebrating Easter while the Roman church was celebrating Lent. In 658 his son Alfrith, who now supported the Roman Church, replaced several of his Celtic church officials with those from the Roman church."
"To resolve the differences between the two religions in his kingdom, Oswiu called for a in 664. Called the Synod of Whitby it was to decide on when to celebrate Easter and what rules the monasteries in Northumbria would follow. Members of the church were summoned from all over the north. The Roman position was given by Wilfrid who would afterwards become Bishop of Northumbria. Bishop Colmán argued for the Ionan calculation of Easter given them by Columba, founder of their order. Oswiu made the decision in favor of the Roman practice, uniting Northumbria under one religion. It joined Northumbrian religious practices to those of the southern English."
"Bede, in his ""Ecclesiastical History"", Book IV, chapter 5 gives the date of Oswiu's death as 15 February, 670 and his age at 58. His wife Eanflaed retired to the monastery at Whitby. This is where their daughter, also named Enflaed, was brought up. In 680 Enflaed and her daughter became joint abbesses at Whitby. Enflaed died ."

Christian creeds.
"It is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the Apostles' Creed. The Apostles' Creed seems to have been formulated to resist Gnosticism; it emphasizes the birth, physical death, and bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It reads:"
"The Nicene Creed is clearly derived from the Apostles' Creed, and represents an elaboration of its basic themes. The most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning Christology and the Trinity."
"Christians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely, followed by the Apostles' Creed."
"Jewish Creed: the ""Shmah""."
"The Jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the Shmah or Shema Yisrael, a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism, the belief in one God. This creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day: ""Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One"", also translated as ""Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is unique [""or"" alone]."""
In Hebrew: שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד
"This is pronounced phonetically in Hebrew: ""Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad""."
Islamic creeds.
"The most basic attempt to put the religion of Islam in a brief statement of doctrine is the shahada, the proclamation that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet."
More detailed credal declarations of Islamic dogma constitute aqidah.
The six Sunni articles of belief are:
"Also from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith (i.e. Eemaan) consists of (both) speech and action and that it increases and decreases. This differs from the Murji’ah a sect who uphold the belief of “Irjaa’”-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases."
"And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah’s attributes."

His territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia."
"The original plan of the town called for ten blocks, which form the core of Culpeper's downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington. In 1795, the town received a post office under the name ""Culpeper Court House"" Most maps of the time, however, continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names was finally resolved when the Virginia Assembly formally renamed the town Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869–1870, chapter 118, page 154)."
"During the American Revolutionary War, the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro-independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper. They organized in what was then known as ""Clayton's Old Field,"" near today's Yowell Meadow Park."

In the heart of downtown, the childhood home of Confederate General A.P. Hill stands at the corner of Main and Davis streets. One block north on Main St. (present location of Piedmont Realty) was the frame house where ""The Gallant Major"" John Pelham died after being wounded at the Battle of Kelly's Ford."

However, the team only finished in the points twice during the season. In 2001, Herbert was replaced by Luciano Burti, who was replaced four races in the season by Pedro de la Rosa. Although the team got double the amount of points finishes in 2001, including a podium (top three) in Monaco, this did not help the fact that the team did not have the same success as Stewart GP got in 1999."
"In 2002 the team got worse, with three points finishes (but a podium in Italy), and a lot of financial (money) issues. Cutbacks were announced for the 2003 season, which included money savings, and a layoff (mass sackings of employees). In 2003, with a improved points system which allowed eight drivers to finish in the points, Jaguar Racing benefitted from this as they finished in the points eight times, with drivers Mark Webber, Antônio Pizzonia, and Justin Wilson replacing Pizzonia for the last five races. 2004 was to be the last season for Jaguar, keeping Webber, and hiring Christian Klien for the whole season. Five points finishes would follow, though financial difficulties would result in the team being bought out by Red Bull, then the team was renamed to Red Bull Racing."

"In 2011, CNN International announced that nasi goreng is the number two of their ""World's 50 Most Delicious Foods"" list."
Ingredients.
"There is no single recipe for nasi goreng, as there are various types. The basic ingredients generally include: cooked rice, ""kecap manis"" (sweet soy sauce), salt, garlic, chilli pepper, fried onions, carrot, egg and chicken. Slices of cucumber, tomato, and lettuce are included for garnishing. Eggs can be either mixed into fried rice in the beginning as scrambled eggs or served separately as fried eggs. In general, ""acar"" – pickle made from vinegar preserved cucumber, carrot, shallots, and small chilli pepper – and ""krupuk"" – deep fried prawn crackers – are provided as side dishs."
"The flavor of nasi goreng can vary depending on the region. There are some variations, such as ""nasi goreng Bali"" which is cooked in Bali; ""nasi goreng seafood"" which includes shrimp, fish and squid, or ""nasi goreng satay"" which includes ""satay"" (seasoned and grilled skewered meat chunks with peanut sauce). When cooking it, one may put anything that can harmonize with the taste."
"Even though any ingredient can be added in nasi goreng, what cannot be taken out is the ""kecap manis"". ""Kecap manis"" is very crucial in the dish which gives the flavor to the nasi goreng. It is what makes the taste of nasi goreng different from other Asian styles of fried rice. Other sauces such as ""ikan asin"" (salted dried fish) and ""saus tiram"" (oyster sauce) can be added as well. The spiciness of nasi goreng is decided by the amount of ""sambal"" (chilli sauce). The sambal can be added during the cooking process or added individually while eating, depending on the preference."

On 13 September, the Germans launched their attack. The Herman Göring battle groups attacked the northern part of the beach. The main attack was between the two Allied Corps. On 15 September 16th Panzer Division and 29th Panzergrenadier Division took up defensive positions. On 15 September, Kesselring said the attack by XIV Panzer Corps must be successful. If this failed, Tenth Army must pull back from the battle."
"On 14 September, the Allies advanced. By 16 September 5th, the Infantry Division had reached Sapri. The Germans decided to pull out of the battle. They withdrew on 18/19 September."

Triathlon
"A triathlon is a sport that consists of three different events one after another without resting in between. Usually, they are swimming, cycling, and running. Triathlon has been in the Olympic Games since 2000. One of the hardest and most famous triathlons is the Ironman Triathlon, which involves swimming two miles, biking a hundred miles, and then running a marathon."
Continuous function
"A mathematical function is called continuous if, roughly said, a ""small change"" in the input only causes a ""small change"" in the output. If this is not the case, the function is discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an ""uninterrupted line (or curve)"". They can be drawn ""without lifting the pen off of the page"". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy."
"Karl Weierstraß gave another definition of continuity: Imagine a function ""f"", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that formula_6, means that formula_7. We can put this another way, given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the ""absolute value"" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made increasingly small, if the point x is ""close enough"" to formula_1."
"There are also special forms of continuous, such as ""Lipschitz-continuous"". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y ∈ (a,b)."
"A basic way to know if a function is continuous is to use a pencil or your finger. Then, start at the left of the function. Then, move your finger along the path of the function. If you ever need to lift your finger or pencil to keep following the function, then you know it is not continuous. This is because, by lifting your finger, you have ""jumped"" from one section of the function to another. That means you made a very small movement but the function changed very much. This is what the first sentence of this article is talking about."

Lake Mackay
"Lake Mackay (Pintupi: ""Wilkinkarra"") is a large salt lake in central Australia. It stretches across the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory. All around it is desert. The Great Sandy Desert is to the northwest, the Tanami Desert is to the northeast, and the Gibson Desert is to the south. There are hundreds of salt lakes along this border area, and Lake Mackay is the largest. It has a surface area of , and is about long from east to west and north to south. It is the second-largest lake in Australia."
"The lake was named after the first European to visit it, Donald George Mackay. The lake is most often dry, because of quick evaporation. Salt and other minerals float on the surface."
"Lake Mackay is a central place in dreamtime stories for several Aboriginal groups, especially the Pintupi. The lake forms the centre of the Pintupi ancestral lands. Many sacred paths and tracks come together at the shores of the lake. According to mythology, the lake was formed after a fierce bushfire that ruined the land around it."
"Papunya, Northern Territory"

In the 2006 census, Papunya had a population of 299. The town is now on private Aboriginal land. People visiting or travelling through need a permit."
"During the late 1950s, a Lutheran mission was set up at Papunya. In the 1970s, many of the people living here moved back to their homelands as part of the outstation movement. The Pintupi moved back west, closer to their homeland around Lake Mackay. They set up the town of Kintore in 1981, about west of Papunya. During this time, local painters were slowly forming a new style of art. By the mid-1980s, it became internationally known as Papunya Tula."

"Kintore was founded in 1981. Many Pintupi people who lived in the community of Papunya (to the east) decided to move back to their own country. They had been forced to leave these lands decades before because of weapons testing at Woomera in South Australia. Kintore is a major centre for the Western Desert art movement, which began at Papunya during the 1970s. The paintings made here are visual descriptions of dreamtime stories. They have gained fame around the world. A number of members of the Aboriginal art school Papunya Tula live at Kintore."

Herald Sun
"The Herald Sun is a morning tabloid newspaper based in Melbourne, Australia. It is published by The Herald and Weekly Times, a part of News Limited, which is a part of News Corporation. It can be bought in Melbourne, Regional Victoria, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and border regions of South Australia and Southern New South Wales. The Herald Sun shares many articles with other News Corporation daily newspapers, especially those from Australia."
"The ""Herald Sun"" is the biggest selling daily newspaper in Australia. It sells about 515,000 copies each day and is read by 1,500,000 people."
Origins.
"The ""Herald Sun"" newspaper was formed in 1990 when the morning tabloid paper ""The Sun News-Pictorial"" joined with the afternoon broadsheet paper ""The Herald"". It was first published on 8 October 1990 as the ""Herald-Sun"". The hyphen in its title was dropped on May 1, 1993."
History.
The Herald.
"""The Herald"" was started on 3 January 1840 by George Cavanaugh as ""The Port Phillip Herald"". In 1855, it became ""The Melbourne Herald"", but a week later became ""The Herald"". From 1869, it was an evening newspaper. Colonel William Thomas Reay was sometime literary editor and later associate editor, before becoming managing editor in 1904."
The Sun News-Pictorial.
"""The Sun News-Pictorial"" began on 11 September 1922, and bought by The Herald and Weekly Times in 1925."
The merger.
"""The Herald"" once sold almost 600,000 copies, but by the time of its 150th anniversary in 1990 it had fallen below 200,00. This was caused by the impact of evening television news and more people using cars to get home from work.'This was much less than that of the morning ""Sun""."
"As a result, The Herald and Weekly Times decided to merge the two, and so after one hundred and fifty years, ten months and two days of publication, ""The Herald"" was published for the last time as a separate newspaper on 5 October 1990. The next day, ""The Sun News-Pictorial"" published its last edition. The Sunday editions of the two newspapers had already been merged. The resulting newspaper had both the size and style of ""The Sun News-Pictorial""."
"With sales still falling, the afternoon edition was cancelled, the last edition being published on December 21, 2001. The News Limited now produces ""mX"" a free afternoon paper that can be picked up from stands throughout the Melbourne CBD. It is not available outside that area."
"Recent editors include Peter Blunden, Simon Pristel, Phil Gardner and Bruce Guthrie."

Images of Jesus and events from the Life of Christ are the most common subjects, and scenes from the Old Testament play a part in the art of most Christian groups. Images of the Virgin Mary and saints are less common in Protestant art than in Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox art."
Right.
Ran out of jeans
"I understand,"
that's funny
"So, does it change?"
No.
"Your dress,"
no.
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,"
Uh-huh.
"but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in,"
but that's for my husband's job and not mine
"Oh, I see,"
I understand.
"I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him,"
"but So,"
"Oh. Well, that's interesting."
"Let's see, uh, what else about this, uh,"
"it, it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two, like, two or three levels."
Uh-huh.
"That there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"I would, if you, if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research"
"and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know."
Huh.
"That's not a, that's not a good solution either."
Not at all.
"I'm not real sure what the,"
What do you think about capital punishment?
"Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes."
Yeah.
Which crimes do you feel that?
"Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it."
Yeah.
"Because of,"
so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent
Right.
"selling, I think should also."
Exactly.
Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever.
Yeah
"I come from a state that has, well I originally come from the state that has, uh, the death penalty."
I come from Florida.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they're pretty liberal on it."
"They tend to, like, fry people left and right.  which,"
Yeah
"that's,"
go ahead.
Go ahead.
Texas is too.
"Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has had forty-six in like the past several years."
Yeah.
"So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess."
"They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville."
"My husband is a counselor,"
"and he works, mostly with adolescents."
"Oh, you know a lot about that."
"So yeah,"
I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.
Uh-huh.
"But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,"
and then they start a drug problem.
Yeah.
"It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
"I know,"
I'm glad of that.
"And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters on so far,"
"that's my conference call,"
I have one daughter still at home.
One's at U T
"and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night."
"Oh, well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that,"
"No,"
"no,"
"I don't care about that,"
she'll be on the phone all night.
"Yeah,"
"it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather."
Right.
Do you have children?
No
"not yet,"
"we're expecting a baby in July,"
"Oh, great,"
so we're starting.
Yes.
"And then,"
You save a lot.
Right.
"If, if, if, if,"
"and you need to be very careful,"
"if the loan is set up to have bi, they call it a yuppie loan, if it's set up for bimonthly payments."
Right.
"If you,"
because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan.
Right.
"I'm sorry, seven to nine years off the end of the loan."
Right.
"And there are, there is a local firm that'll actually,"
"if, if,"
"like in my situation, I don't have that, because the loan was not available."
"I can have,"
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee.
"So I can cut that much off the end of,"
but I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year.
Oh really.
Yeah.
"But, uh, those are all great."
Uh-huh.
"The, the interesting thing, we're getting ready to have a house built"
Uh-huh.
"it's not, a lot of the firms that offer,"
"mortgage loan firms, aren't offering, um, that loan."
Uh-huh.
"You can ask and you can wheel and deal,"
but it's not as open as it should be.
Yeah.
"but since it's just the two of us, it's"
"Yeah,"
yeah
Well that happens to us sometimes too.
Yeah.
"But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,"
but we eat in the kitchen
and their heads are always poking past the door.
"Uh-huh,"
to see what's happening.
Yeah.
"Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing"
and some people don't like to do this
"but I like to uh, cook with my kids."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help."
"And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,"
"I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it."
"Oh, I've seen those in the magazines."
"Yeah,"
they're so simple.
Uh-huh.
And the kids love to do that.
"Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them."
Yeah.
"And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that"
and it's just really hard
"and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that."
Yeah.
"So, that's, uh,"
"they like to eat it,"
"but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare."
"and, uh, acorn squash are good winter keepers."
Yeah.
"I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste"
Uh-huh.
"you know, we eat it, we,"
just too much.
"She, she starts her own plants."
She plants a lot of tomatoes
Uh-huh.
"I let her do all the planting and putting,"
"and I, I do a lot of the, uh, a lot of the, the the back work, and stuff."
"But she does, she helps me a lot, too."
Uh-huh.
She puts a lot of financial.
She plans it all out.
Beans like to be near certain types of plants.
"Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, uh, peas,"
I don't know.
"Something,"
"Oh, really"
"because of like the cross-pollination,"
"or,"
"No,"
"it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans."
"I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off,"
they just don't like each other.
Huh.
"I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books,"
"so. I wish I knew more to tell you why,"
"but,"
"Huh. My mom put, uh, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once,"
and the got cross pollinated by the bees
I guess you would consider that a home repair.
Huh-uh.
"Certainly, uh, uh,"
"and interesting enough, this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition."
"What is your most recent,"
"We just did that, too."
"You did that recently too, uh,?"
Yes.
Does it make a big difference?
"Oh, yes"
we have brick on the outside
"and, uh, the colors that were there changed the, and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house."
Huh-uh.
Completely.
That's neat isn't it.
Yeah.
That was really exciting.
It was fun.
"I was really, really tired of the color."
"That it's, it's helping."
"We're not quite through,"
"but it's, it really is looking good."
"Uh, we went through a process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had,"
"probably the most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do."
"Um, we didn't have very much money"
"and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process,"
"but we learned how to do, uh, retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual."
Huh-uh.
So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house.
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, we did that a different color also."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I tell you what,"
"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
I will admit the same thing.
"And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer"
"And I,"
"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program"
Yeah.
"and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing."
I tell you what.
"The uh, the war spot in"
"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
Uh-huh.
"Because I was watching C N N,"
"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
"and it was just,"
I was amazed.
Uh-huh.
"I, I didn't have that experience."
"I, I don't have cable"
Oh.
"so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I've got one question for you."
I you say you take the newspaper.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
"the I've got my beans, peas,"
Yeah.
"I've got some onions out,  tomatoes,"
Yeah.
I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year.
I never have much luck with tomatoes.
"I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, uh, bugs get on them so easily"
"and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,"
"so, the only thing that I use is soap."
"I water, you know, spray the plants, because they say, supposedly, that will keep the bugs off them."
"But, uh, I don't have luck with that tomato plant,"
so I hate to spray them with anything.
"Um, what do you do?"
Do you have any tips you could give me?
"Um, my favorite one is putting on the, um, tomato plant is to put, uh, dust,"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,"
That's true.
That's true.
My dad is a farmer
"so, I've heard him talk about that forever."
"I guess it works,"
"but, um, you have to really wash your vegetables after that"
so it won't make you sick.
Let's see what else do you do to your house?
"Well, I've done some rewiring on it."
Yeah.
"Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house."
"Oh, really."
"Do you plan on like adding any rooms or,"
you have enough space
not being able to put it off for fifteen years.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in"
"and they, they get off for good behavior"
"and, I don't know,"
"up in Minnesota where I am now, they don't have the death penalty."
"And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. Because they figure well, you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something."
"Uh, but then for,"
"if I, if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten."
"Oh, really?"
"Oh, sure, you know."
Goodness.
"I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh,"
"I don't know,"
I think that may solve a lot of that.
Yeah
"Maybe not solve it,"
"but, I don't know,"
"maybe ,"
"I, yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient."
Yeah.
"Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty."
Uh-huh.
What do you do Georgeanne?
I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas.
"Oh, okay."
Great.
What program you in?
They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.
They like to play.
Um.
Especially with the kids.
They love to play with kids.
"Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?"
"No,"
he's pretty much an inside dog.
Um.
He stays in.
"We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much"
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.
"Oh, really?"
He's really a wimp.
"And when it comes to being alone,"
"uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,"
but he does not like to be tied outside.
"He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark."
"Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?"
"No,"
"he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well"
"and, uh, he knows where our yard is"
"and we have a pretty small yard,"
but he seems to know the boundaries.
Um.
"And he usually is good about staying within them,"
"although our next door neighbors have a dog, too"
"and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog."
"Oh, yeah?"
And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
"but, he's pretty good."
He stays out of the street
Yeah.
"Right,"
"they're kind of the leaders right now, you know."
"I used to see all those commercials for Windows, you know,"
"and you're like, oh, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name."
"Really,"
"why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price."
"Yeah, you know."
They'd sell more if they were honest.
"Exactly,"
"almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both"
and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.
"Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base."
"Uh,"
"Yeah, yeah that's true, too."
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home."
"I, I do use a Mac at work"
"but, uh uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh,"
Apple's sort of making a
and they're ones were
"growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting,"
"like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back."
They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business."
"Yeah,"
"I have one,"
"this, this town was like less than ten thousand people"
and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas.
"And, you know, I didn't move out of there until I was, you know, twenty-seven"
"and that was just, you know,"
so I love the big city
"You know, I had lived in a rural area for, for so long"
"so I've enjoyed it,"
"but, uh, it can, it can get kind of tough."
Its like a rat race sometimes.
That's just something I'll never adapt to.
"I don't, I don't want to be a part of the rat race."
I want to be basically just kind of left alone.
Yeah
"If I want to sit around and mess with my garden, I'll mess with my garden,"
Yeah.
"if I want to work in the flower beds,"
Yeah.
It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.
"I, I,"
Very much.
yeah.
I really do enjoy that.
But I haven't planted anything yet
"or, you know, I usually have gotten flowers coming out the"
"but I, I haven't done that, yet."
I've had finals this week.
"So, uh,  you know, I'm just kind of trying to, trying to stick in with that,"
Huh-uh.
"but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe I can, I can get this yard in shape."
Do you do a lot of gardening?
"Uh, landscaping is more, than the gardening,"
Yeah.
"It, it just makes your skin more leathery."
and I think that is why.
"It, uh, it,"
Exactly.
yeah.
"So,"
"I think it burns off the,"
"I don't know the, the, the theory, the scientific principle."
"But it burns something off, the natural oils or something like that."
Uh-huh.
"Well, the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it."
They say it destroys a lot of that.
Yes.
And you lose a lot of that.
"So, uh,"
"Yes,"
"uh, that sounds like a good, that sounds like the right theory."
"Yeah,"
"but, uh, but we have really had nice,"
"the weather,"
I can't complain.
We have really had really good weather of late.
Good.
"And when it has rained, it it's been a good soaking rain"
"and, uh, it has just been a really nice Spring."
"Well, that is great."
"It has been, it has been very nice here too."
And I hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
and I want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain.
Oh.
"Oh, that is great."
How long will they be there?
Right.
"Well ,"
"You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise."
"My mother, oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, we we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels"
"and they're very high strung animals to begin with,"
"but, uh,"
Okay.
How do you get your news mostly?
"Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio."
"And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and just fall off on the articles that I like."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come."
Uh-huh
So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.
"It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines"
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news."
Um.
It's really weird.
"Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long."
"But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news"
"and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper"
Um.
Yeah.
Or so it seems.
"I may just be paranoid,"
but that state income tax is just eating me alive.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
they have a state income tax in Maryland.
"But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax,"
"but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and, school taxes and property taxes,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Property taxes and,"
"Oh my God,"
ate you alive.
"Yeah,"
"well, Colorado, you know they have the state income tax,"
"but then they also have property taxes,"
"and they also have sales taxes,"
and they just get you every direction they can.
Yeah.
"And I just don't know, sir,"
but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.
"Yeah,"
"it sure does. Um,"
"there's, uh, some good books that I've read, um, that you might be interested in. Uh"
Oh yeah?
Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V
"and he's got seminars you can go to,"
"and they try to hook you into his organization, which costs about four hundred bucks."
But he's got a couple of books out.
"One of them is called, uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK."
I've heard of the book.
Oh
and so then she crawls on the carpet
"and, oh, the smell I mean it's just really awful"
Uh-huh.
"and that's, that's one real drawback,"
but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
"Yes,"
you will.
You will.
"You know, we were trying to decide to, you know, about putting him to sleep."
"He was just, you know, he was getting so old and had a, other problems too."
"And, and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier. You know,"
"and, and again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways, you know,"
"and, and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know, as you would a child."
Uh-huh.
"And, and, you know, our son and, and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, you know."
Little thing.
"Be quiet,"
be quiet.
"And I can tell my husband, you know, deep down he, you know, he"
"Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today?"
"Hi,"
"fine,"
I'm Nancy.
How are you?
"Great, Nancy."
I'm in Plano also
"You're in Plano also, huh?"
"Yes,"
we're not too long distance today.
"Well, good to hear."
I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it."
"Uh, we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks."
"Oh, no."
"And one of the things that I, I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation  down there."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, because they were just,"
"it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because  everybody went to work, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"and then the houses were left unguarded, uh,"
"but yeah,"
"I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it,"
"that's a good way to, to work it, with a neighborhood  watch."
Yeah.
"Well, you know, uh, also I've heard that, uh, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home.  Like on the weekends."
"Oh, is that right?"
"A high percentage of, uh, free time,"
"I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent doing yard work outdoors."
Oh.
"So they wait while you're out, outdoors."
They know the house is unlocked
"and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know."
That's amazing.
They know exactly what they're going for.
Yeah.
"So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as  uh, you know, a new type of crime."
"Uh,"
"Yeah,"
it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter.
Yeah
"Really, you know."
"Unfortunately, yes."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah"
"I guess it's what sells newspapers, you know."
It's a very low way of living.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, so,"
"and, and, and as far as, uh, you know, myself having any particular personal, uh, knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, it, I'm not terribly involved in it."
Uh-huh
Just in a very cursory way.
Right.
I vote
"and I, you know, try to do whatever I can on the little local area,"
"but, I, I, it just is not one of the things that I have, uh, placed, uh, uh, a, a lot of my particular time and effort into,"
Yeah.
"so, I, I always feel very outside this kind of, uh, this kind of an issue."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
I am kind of the same way.
"I just kind of read the paper follow up on I mean, you know, just keep an eye on what's going on"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
right.
but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
"Yeah,"
"uh,"
"Uh, uh-huh."
"I'm not, I'm not in there,"
"I'm not one of those, uh, you know, volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever, uh, although I admire the people that do that"
and they certainly do get inside information
Uh-huh.
"and so my transportation costs have gone up by, uh, five times"
"Yeah,"
I understand that.
"We, we have a real similar situation."
"Ours, uh, have quintupled, at least."
So there is a real family budget.
"Yeah,"
"pretty much, um."
The problem is there never seems to be enough money.
"I have three children,"
"and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need,"
"and, uh, of course, nothing ever goes down,"
"I mean, uh, I remember,"
I have five children total.
I have three left in the house.
Yeah.
"And I can remember years ago, when school would start,"
"and I'd go buy all five kids, you know, shoes,"
"and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store without spending more than thirty-five dollars."
"Nowadays, thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes"
If you're lucky.
"yeah,"
"so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last, uh, I guess about the last ten years."
Exempt or nonexempt.
I'm exempt.
"Wow,"
must be nice.
"Part of the high price spread. Uh,"
"no,"
"well, we don't, we do,"
but we don't have a family budget.
We have the fixed things we have to pay.
Yeah.
Exactly.
"Well, we have a lot that needs be done."
"We have, uh, uh, carpeting,"
"and, and we did have a new, uh, floor put in our kitchen."
"And, um, I have my mother living with us"
and so she was in a room with a carpet
"and, of course, she's quite aged,"
"she's ninety-three now,"
so that meant she had problems now and then
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down.
So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
"and  so that was a really positive, uh, uh,"
Huh-uh.
it was fairly expensive though.
"I, I was impressed,"
"I think, that, uh,"
we had somebody do it
"and it was, it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet."
Huh-uh.
"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and, and fix the floor"
"so it's, uh,"
"I don't know,"
"what ever,"
but they have to put stuff on the floor
"and it's, uh, kind of a process."
"Well, it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with, uh, with, uh, uh, home repair."
Huh-uh.
We have.
It's been really fun.
"Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though."
I grew up in Illinois
Yeah.
"and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,"
"why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has uh, watering system."
Uh-huh.
"And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water."
Uh-huh.
"But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass"
Uh-huh.
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
"Right,"
yeah.
and and I just think it's ugly
"When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant."
"I think the Saint Augustine and, uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"yeah,"
those two.
Yeah.
"Some people have, I think it's fescue that stays green all winter,"
Yeah.
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.
They have to water an incredible amount.
"But, um, those those lawns look nice during the winter,"
"but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb."
"But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,"
"it's sort of like, well,"
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, you know,"
"you just switch that thing on,"
"and, uh,"
"Yeah,"
that's true.
Yeah.
"But, you know, people,"
"it's like your name must be on a list or something, because I know at my office, I get calls, I mean, I must get at least, I probably average at least a call a day,"
"and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance you know, to the small business man"
"Um, even in an office?"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and, uh, you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to people also,"
"as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York,"
"and, uh California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or stock investments  or whatever."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
right.
And now I'm getting the same calls at at the house.
"Uh-huh,"
I know.
"And they get your, and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet,"
"and, uh, credit card companies, they sell your name."
"Oh, yeah,"
"uh, well, you know, these people, they sell your names,"
I mean
I know.  Yes.
"you know, I,"
that's also an invasion of privacy.
"I think it the whole thing is, uh,"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I know my friend is, uh, really into guns"
"and, uh, uh, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, you know, that  come through town and everything"
Uh-huh.
"and, I mean, they just have, I mean they have anything you'd want,"
I mean
Uh-huh.
"you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's, I mean, there's nothing."
You can just go buy one and take it home
"and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at, you know, a video store."
"I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago"
"and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"You just go and, uh, buy the gun"
"and, uh,"
There's no restriction though.
You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?
No.
"Well, except for the, the pistols and"
I'm not sure how they do that.
"I know they,"
"Yeah,"
"I was just curious, you know, because, uh"
Uh-huh.
"I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop that you, that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple  of weeks"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and then they check you out,"
then they call you up
and you go pick it up.
"“Dala” means home in Dholuo, the language of the Luo who inhabit Kisumu and its environs. Dala Sevens is about returning rugby home and is hosted by Kisumu RFC. Kisumu Dala Sevens was first hosted in May 2003, with defunct Kenya army side Ulinzi winning that event. The Kenya Rugby Football Union Seven aside competition which was hosted by Kenya Rugby Football Union was awarded to Kisumu RFC and they renamed it ‘Dala’. At that inaugural event Saint Mary’s School Yala became the first school side to qualify for the Main Cup Competition with school-boy wonder-boy Teddy Omondi in imperious form."
"In 2004 Kakamega High School defied all the odds to defeat 1st division sides Nakuru RFC and Nondescripts RFC. The event was dropped from the National Sevens Circuit in 2007 due to dire financial straits on the part of hosts Kisumu RFC before making its return in 2009. 32 teams participate in Dala, making it the biggest event in Kenya, East Africa and probably Africa. Anyway, that was before, Kabeberi, Driftwood, Prinsloo, and Christie's followed suit and expanded their tournament's to 32 teams. The Dala Sevens is the primary fundraising event for Kisumu RFC. Kisumu Polytechnic is the venue of the sevens."

"Gedion Zelalem (born January 26, 1997) is a German-born American professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Major League Soccer club New York City FC."
"After playing for various youth teams in Germany and the United States, Zelalem initially played with Arsenal's youth squads after joining the team in early 2013, and made his senior squad debut for Arsenal in an FA Cup match in January 2014."
"Internationally, Zelalem made appearances for Germany's under-15 team, under-16 team and under-17 team during 2012 and 2013. He became a U.S. citizen on December 2, 2014, and FIFA subsequently approved his eligibility to play for the United States on May 13, 2015."
"Zelalem was born in Berlin, Germany, to Ethiopian parents. He started playing football at the age of five for German club BFC Germania 1888. After this, he changed to Bundesliga side Hertha BSC's academy."
"Zelalem emigrated to the United States with his father in 2006, following his mother's death in the previous year, and settled in Washington, D.C.. He played with several teams: first with MSC United, Bethesda Soccer Club and BNC Revolution, before joining the elite club team Olney Rangers and the varsity team at Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, Maryland."
"Arsenal scout Danny Karbassiyoon discovered Zelalem in the United States playing for Olney Rangers during a Dallas Cup match. After contacting his coaches, Zelalem was flown to London for summer training with the Arsenal youth academy; following the end of this camp, he was offered a permanent place in the Academy. Zelalem started out playing in Arsenal's under-16s squad, before graduating into the under-21s in April 2013. His début for the under-21 side came against Liverpool U21 that month, but was unable to prevent Arsenal slipping to a 3–2 defeat at Anfield; however, he drew praise for his performance. He made his second appearance for the side less than a week later in a 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers U21, once again drawing praise for his performance."
"In July 2013, Zelalem was included in Arsenal's 24-man squad for their Asia tour. Although regarded as a surprise inclusion, strong performances against an Indonesia Dream Team, the Vietnam national team and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus led to him being touted as a future star, and being compared favorably to Cesc Fàbregas."
"Following these strong performances, Zelalem stated that he hoped to make a few appearances during the 2013–14 season. He remained in the team for the Emirates Cup match against Galatasaray on August 4, but was unable to keep Arsenal from sliding to a 2–1 defeat. Zelalem was selected on the bench in Arsenal's second Premier League game of the season, a 3–1 victory over Fulham on August 24, but did not make an appearance. However, on September 10 Zelalem announced on Twitter that he had sustained an injury that would keep him out of action for up to two months. Although he announced his return to training in late October, Arsène Wenger confirmed that he would not be fit enough for the League Cup match against Chelsea on October 29, dismissing a previous rumor. He returned to action for Arsenal's youth side a week later in a UEFA Youth League fixture against Borussia Dortmund on November 6, playing the entire match in a 2–2 draw."
"On January 24, 2014, Zelalem made his debut with Arsenal's senior squad, coming on as a substitute for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 71st minute of their 4–0 home FA Cup victory against Coventry City. And later that year, on March 18, 2014, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal to last until 2017. Zelalem soon made his second appearance for Arsenal, coming on as a substitute in the beginning of the second half, in a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in UEFA Champions League on December 9, 2014."
"On August 24, 2015, Zelalem was loaned to Rangers until January. He made his debut in a 5–0 win over Airdrieonians in the Scottish League Cup, setting up goals for Martyn Waghorn and James Tavernier. He made his league debut in Rangers' Scottish Championship game against Queen of the South which Rangers won 5–1. In January 2016 his loan was extended through to the end of the season."
"He played in 21 Championship matches, helping Rangers clinch the second-tier title, and was an unused substitute as they beat Peterhead 4–0 to win the 2015–16 Scottish Challenge Cup. A week later, Rangers played old firm rivals Celtic in the Scottish Cup semifinal. Zelalem converted a penalty in the shootout to help his club progress to the final, and started in that match, which Rangers lost 3–2 to Hibernian."
"On January 24, 2017, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal and accepted a loan move to Dutch second-tier club VVV-Venlo, lasting until the end of the season. He made nine league appearances as VVV Venlo won the 2016-17 Eerste Divisie title."
"After no first team appearances at Arsenal upon returning in 2017, Zelalem joined MLS club Sporting Kansas City for free on March 10, 2019."
"After Zelalem's option was not picked up by Sporting Kansas City, he signed for fellow Major League Soccer side New York City FC on January 11, 2020."
"Zelalem began training with the United States under-15 side in 2012, but was unable to play in matches at that time due to being classified as a permanent resident, but not yet a U.S. citizen. In May 2014, it was reported that Zelalem's father, Zelalem Wolydes, held U.S. permanent residency and intended to apply for U.S. citizenship. If Wolydes gained U.S. citizenship before his son turned 18, then under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Gedion would also acquire U.S. citizenship and become eligible to represent the United States internationally. He would also be able to retain his German passport which allows him to live and work in the European Union without restrictions."

"SV Roßbach/Verscheid is a German association football club based in Roßbach/Wied, Rhineland-Palatinate. The club's greatest success has been to play in the Oberliga Südwest, later the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar, for seven seasons from 2007 to 2014."
"In 2001 ""Roßbach"" advanced to the Verbandsliga Rheinland (V) and in 2005–06 captured the title there, but was not immediately promoted to the fourth tier Oberliga Südwest as it had begun the season as ""SG Rossbach"", a ""Sportgemeinschaft"" (sports community) and not as a sports club, and so were ineligible as they did not meet German Football Association (Deutsche Fussball Bund or German Football Association) requirements as an organization. In the following season, the club's campaign ended with a second Verbandsliga championship and this time, after the earlier reorganization of the association as ""Sportverein Roßbach/Wied"" in anticipation of an advance, the side moved up to Oberliga play."
"In association with neighbouring clubs ""FC Waldbreitbach"" and ""SG Niederbreitbach"", ""SV"" helped form ""JSG Wiedtal"" in 2003 as a youth club."
"""Roßbach"" qualified for the 2006–07 German Cup, and hosted Bundesliga side ""Borussia Mönchengladbach"" in the first round, losing 1:4. They also qualified for the 2012–13 German Cup, where they hosted FSV Mainz 05."
After seven seasons at Oberliga level the club was relegated back to the Rheinlandliga in 2014 but instead withdrew to the tier nine Kreisliga B Nord Westerwald/Wied. A title at this level took the club up to the Kreisliga A in 2015 but it was promptly relegated again.
"""SV Roßbach/Verscheid"" currently play at the Sportplatz in der Au, which has a capacity of 2.000."
"The Sportplatz in der Au was built in 1987–88 with the help of the City of Roßbach at a cost of approximately 75,000 DM. The club hopes to move into a purpose built football stadium by the year 2010 however, as with all semi-professional teams, financing the move is proving a major stumbling block."

The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion.
"It was invented by the nineteenth-century mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who studied theoretical problems in kinematic mechanisms. One of the problems was the construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate straight-line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements to the steam engine."
"The straight-line linkage confines the point ""P"" – the midpoint on the link ""L"" – on a straight line at the two extremes and at the center of travel. (""L"", ""L"", ""L"", and ""L"" are as shown in the illustration.) Between those points, point ""P"" deviates slightly from a perfect straight line. The proportions between the links are"
"Point P is in the middle of ""L"". This relationship assures that the link ""L"" lies vertically when it is at one of the extremes of its travel."
The lengths are related mathematically as follows:
"It can be shown that if the base proportions described above are taken as lengths, then for all cases,"
"and this contributes to the perceived straight-line motion of point ""P""."
"The motion of the linkage can be constrained to an input angle that may be changed through velocities, forces, etc. The input angles can be either link ""L"" with the horizontal or link ""L"" with the horizontal. Regardless of the input angle, it is possible to compute the motion of two end-points for link ""L"" that we will name A and B, and the middle point P."
"while the motion of point B will be computed with the other angle,"
"And ultimately, we will write the output angle in terms of the input angle,"
"Consequently, we can write the motion of point P, using the two points defined above and the definition of the middle point."
"The limits to the input angles, in both cases, are:"

(Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.) The game was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an IBM 7090 mainframe there. The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an ""ultimate"" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it."
"The game consisted of a program called the ""umpire"" and a designated section of the computer's memory known as the ""arena"", into which two or more small programs, written by the players, were loaded. The programs were written in 7090 machine code, and could call a number of functions provided by the umpire in order to probe other locations within the arena, kill opposing programs, and claim vacant memory for copies of themselves."
"The game ended after a set amount of time, or when copies of only one program remained alive. The player who wrote the last surviving program was declared winner."
"Up to 20 memory locations within each program (fewer in later versions of the game) could be designated as ""protected"". If one of these protected locations was probed by another program, the umpire would immediately transfer control to the program that was probed. This program would then continue to execute until it, in turn, probed a protected location of some other program, and so forth."
"While the programs were responsible for copying and relocating themselves, they were forbidden from altering memory locations outside themselves without permission from the umpire. As the programs were executed directly by the computer, there was no physical mechanism in place to prevent cheating. Instead, the source code for the programs was made available for study after each game, allowing players to learn from each other and to verify that their opponents hadn't cheated."
"The smallest program that could reproduce, locate enemies and kill them consisted of about 30 instructions. McIlroy developed a 15-instruction program that could locate and kill enemies but not reproduce; while not very lethal, it was effectively unkillable, as it was shorter than the limit of 20 protected instructions. In later games the limit on protected instructions was lowered because of this."
"The ""ultimately lethal"" program developed by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy. Once it successfully located the start of an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location. If it succeeded in killing the enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters. If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance. Any new copies were initialized with a successful value. In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy."

"The Upper Darling Range Railway (also known as the Upper Darling Range Branch) was a branch railway from Midland Junction, Western Australia, that rose up the southern side of the Helena Valley and on to the Darling Scarp via the Kalamunda Zig Zag. At the time of construction it was the only section of railway in Western Australia to have had a zig zag formation."
"Completed in July 1891, the Upper Darling Range Railway line was built by the Canning Jarrah Timber Company to supply railway sleepers to Perth's growing railway system. It ran from Midland Junction railway station through to the Darling Ranges and up into Kalamunda. It was later extended to Canning Mills and in 1912 to Karragullen. From Pickering Brook, a line branched off to Bartons Mill."
"On 1 July 1903, the line was taken over by the Western Australian Government Railways and became known as the Upper Darling Range Branch. The last service ran on 22 July 1949. The line was formally closed by the Railways (Upper Darling Range) Discontinuance Act 1950; it was dismantled in 1952."

"Juana Manuel of Castile (1339 – 27 March 1381) was Queen consort of Castile from 1369 until 1379. She also was the heiress of Escalona, Villena, Peñafiel and Lara, as well as Lady of Biscay."
She was the daughter of the Infante Juan Manuel of Castile (1282–1348) and his second wife Blanca Núñez de Lara de La Cerda. Her mother Blanca (d. 1347) was a descendant of the Lords of Biscay and of Lara and of Alfonso X's eldest son (Fernando de la Cerda). She was the last legitimate member of the House of Ivrea.
"Her father had been for five years a serious enemy of King Alfonso XI, his former protégé, and the king wished to neutralize or absorb the might of the Peñafiel family. Although Juana was not the heiress (yet), already in her youth she had to go along with royal wishes. The king's very influential concubine, Leonor de Guzmán, wanted to obtain some high prestige and property to her eldest son and had her eyes on the young Juana. On 27 July 1350 her brother and guardian, Fernando Manuel of Peñafiel, had to marry his young sister to Henry (1333–79), eldest of the illegitimate sons of Alfonso XI of Castile. This brought Henry certain lands."
"However it was later that Juana's relatives' heirless deaths made Juana the great heiress she turned out to be, while her husband became threat to the royal power. In 1369, he became King Henry II of Castile, after he deposed and murdered his half-brother to take the throne."
They had the following children:
"In 1361 (at the death of her teenage niece Blanca, daughter of her brother Fernando Manuel who himself had died in c 1350 without other children) she inherited Villena, Escalona and Peñafiel. Because Juana was a maternal granddaughter of La Palomilla, from her another cousin, Isabel de Lara who was murdered in 1361 and her young daughter Florentina (d after 1365), she also inherited Lara and Biscay. In 1369, she became queen of Castile and León."
"When in 1381 she died and left her inheritance to her son, Biscay finally was united with Castile, and ultimately Spain. The Basque people remember her for that."
= = = Happy Sad (album) = = =
"Happy Sad is the third album by singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, released in 1969. It was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California and was produced by former Lovin' Spoonful members Zal Yanovsky and, coincidentally, his subsequent replacement Jerry Yester. It marked the beginning of Buckley's experimental period, as it incorporated elements of jazz that he had never used before. Many of the songs here represent a departure from the binary form that dominated much of his previous work. The sound of the album is characterized by David Friedman's vibraphone, an instrument which gives the album a more relaxed tone than Buckley's earlier work. The songs are much longer than on previous releases and this style continued through to later works. The vocals on the album are more drawn out than earlier performances and this represents the beginning of Buckley using his voice like an instrument. The lyrics on ""Happy Sad"" represent a change as Buckley stopped working with Larry Beckett, his lyricist on the two previous albums ""Tim Buckley"" and ""Goodbye and Hello"", and began writing the lyrics himself. Buckley's self-penned efforts stand in contrast to Beckett's occasionally political and literary-style work. Buckley would also go on to author all his own material on the following two albums."
"""Happy Sad"" shares much in common with his later albums, ""Lorca"" and ""Blue Afternoon"". Much of the material that would appear on those albums was written at the same time as the songs that appear on this album, representing the most productive and prolific period of Buckley's career. Buckley's musical tastes expanded during the period that the album was written and the first track, ""Strange Feelin"", was directly inspired by Miles Davis' ""All Blues"" from ""Kind of Blue"" and the melody of the song is directly taken from the song. ""Buzzin' Fly"" was written much earlier than the rest of the work and was originally performed with a group Buckley had during high school, the Harlequin 3, with bassist Jim Fielder and later lyricist, Larry Beckett."
"The third track, ""Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)"", is a song composed of various movements and this represents the second time Buckley wrote in this manner, his previous effort being the title track of ""Goodbye and Hello"". The segments of the song were written separately as ""Danang"" and ""Asbury Park"", as demonstrated on the later released demo sessions, """". The final version of the song is backed by an 'ocean' sound effect, however this was not originally intended to feature on the song. Buckley and the band were happy with the take of song but because of a recording problem the track had a slight electric buzzing in the background. The producer solved this by muffling the buzzing with the ocean overdub."
"""Dream Letter"" is as an ode and apology to his ex-wife, Mary Guibert, and his son Jeff Buckley. This is the second song Buckley wrote about the pair, the first being ""I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain"" on his previous LP, ""Goodbye and Hello"". In comparison to that song ""Dream Letter"" has a more apologetic tone, the lyrics reveal this with Buckley lamenting ""Does he ever ask about me?"" . It would be over five years later that Buckley would meet with his son again. The name of the song would later be used for a live album: posthumous release """". The concert features much of the same personnel from the ""Happy Sad""."
"""Gypsy Woman"" is a long track highlighting Buckley's vocal acrobatics and on the record has some qualities of a jam session. Buckley and his band were disappointed with its recording but the song would remain as part of Buckley's live repertoire for the following years. The closer of the album, ""Sing a Song For You"", is more similar to Buckley's work on ""Goodbye and Hello"" than to the songs on the rest of the album. It shares the verse/chorus style and folk leanings of ""Song to the Siren"", which though released on ""Starsailor"" was written around the same period."
"Released at the height of his popularity, ""Happy Sad"" was his highest charting album, reaching #81 in the US Pop albums chart, but Buckley's experimentation on this album would alienate some of the fanbase and his mainstream appeal he gained with ""Goodbye and Hello"". However, this was only the beginning of Buckley's experimentation with sound and genre, and subsequent releases would further reduce his mainstream popularity and see his sales take a downturn."

"The Tomb of the Triclinium () or the Funereal Bed ("""") is an Etruscan tomb in the Necropolis of Monterozzi near Tarquinia, Italy. It was discovered in 1830. Stefan Steingraber, Associate Professor at the Italian Research University 'Roma Tre', dates the tomb to approximately 470 BC and calls it one of the most famous of all Etruscan tombs. He considers the artistic quality of the tomb's frescoes to be superior to those of most other Etruscan tombs. The tomb is named after the triclinium, the formal dining room which appears in the frescoes of the tomb."
Since its discovery the tomb's frescoes have deteriorated and lost some of their color and detail. In 1949 they were moved to the Tarquinia National Museum to conserve them. Thanks to the watercolor copies made by Carlo Ruspi shortly after the discovery of the tomb it is still possible to see the frescoes in their former state.
"The tomb consists of a single room. The fresco on the back wall shows a banquet scene, borrowed from depictions of drinking scenes on Attic red-figure pottery from the early fifth century. The banqueteers recline on three couches called ""klinai"". On the floor under the ""klinai"" a cat prowls towards a rooster and a partridge. On the left wall three female dancers, one male dancer and a male musician with a barbiton appear. They are placed between small trees filled with birds. On the right wall a similar scene is shown. On the entry wall two youths jump down from their horses. They may be ""apobates"" or a reference to the Dioscuri as intermediaries between the earthly life and the afterlife."
The similarities between the frescoes in the Tomb of the Triclinium and Tomb 5513 (also in the Necropolis of Monterozzi) led Steingraber to conclude that they were the products of the same workshop. The strong influence of red-figure Attic vase painting has convinced some experts that the artist who decorated the tomb was a Greek metic.
= = = Martha Mears (author) = = =
Martha Mears was an eighteenth-century midwife and author.
"Mears was a midwife, mother, and author in London, England. Her work, ""Pupil of Nature"", was published in 1797. The full title is ""Pupil of Nature: Candid advice to the fair sex, on the subjects of pregnancy, childbirth, the diseases incident to both, the fatal effects of ignorance and quackery, and the most approved means of promoting health, strength and beauty of their offspring."" It consists of 10 essays about topics from the state of the womb before and after conception, to the effect of music on nerves. She depicted the pregnant woman as a cluster of symptoms to be managed, particularly with regard to her psychological state. Mears subscribed to the common notion that ""irritability"" of the pregnant woman’s uterus induced a heightened ""sensibility"". The organization and broad scope of the text mirrored this representation of the body as a bundle of potential pathologies. A contemporary review of her work describes its purpose being to teach women the important advantages of pursuing nature's plans in everything that relates to the pregnant state. Mears' studied the writings of Harvey, Leake, Smellie and Denman."

"Air Baron is an economic strategy game published by Avalon Hill in 1996. Despite its family-oriented marketing, ""Air Baron"" plays far more like a wargame than a typical family money-driven game like ""Monopoly"". ""Air Baron"" is for two to six players, adjusting the playable area and victory conditions accordingly."
"""Air Baron"" challenges players to build an airline empire in the United States by amassing a plurality of market share and liquid assets."
"Players seek to gain ""dominance"" or ""control"" of hubs in order to amass market share. Dominance of a hub is gained by controlling the majority of associated domestic spokes; it carries a moderate income potential and market share gain. Control of a hub is gained by controlling ""all"" of the associated domestic spokes; it doubles the income potential and market share gain of dominance."
Any uncontrolled domestic spoke may be purchased at face value. Takeovers of controlled spokes require a higher fee and an opposed dice roll versus the controlling player. Several factors contribute both positively and negatively to each player's dice total.
"If, at the end of his turn, a player has a combined total of market share and cash equal to or greater than the victory margin, he wins."
"At the start of each round, one color-coded chit per player is placed in a cup. The chits are drawn sequentially to determine the current order of play. While the order of play in an individual round is generally unimportant, the interval between turns for a single player is a significant consideration."
"Starting cash is determined by die roll. To offset the advantage of first play, each player receives cumulatively more money during the initial turn."
"Every purchased spoke, plus all hubs, have a unique chit placed in a cup. At the start of every turn, the player randomly draws two chits, paying the owner appropriately. Chits are replaced at the end of each round."
"Beyond the primary domestic spokes, players can also purchase foreign spokes and jumbo jets. Foreign spokes benefit opposed takeovers at the associated hubs. Jumbo jets provide similar bonuses on the domestic spoke where deployed, or they can be held in reserve for later use in an opposed takeover. Additionally, spokes with jumbos pay double the usual rate."
"Normally players are limited to one purchase or takeover attempt per turn. However, players can declare a state of ""Fare Wars"" that allow an indefinite number of domestic takeover attempts provided:"
"While in Fare Wars, players receive an additional takeover dice roll bonus. Profits, however, are not earned while in Fare Wars. Since the state can only be entered or exited at the beginning of a player's turn, the randomized play order has a major impact on the potential for income loss."
"Several optional rules, including strikes, crashes, government loans, and bidding, are provided as part of an ""advanced version"". These rules may be added to the basic game collectively or individually as desired."

Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, who said that new regulations were needed to cater for changes in the aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes in the last few years to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on twin deck aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization).

"Ernesto Carlos Tornquist (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) was an Argentinian entrepreneur and businessman, considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century. The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province."
"Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871."
"Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ""Ernesto Tornquist y Cia"". With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ""Refineria Argentina"", in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the ""Bieckert"" brewery, the ""Seeber"" margarine manufacturer and the ""Bianchetti"" scale manufacturer."
"On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ""Sansinena"" and its cold-storage plant ""La Negra"" in Riachuelo and set up the plant ""Cuartreros"" in Bahía Blanca."
"Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the ""Compañía Argentina de Pesca"", oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital."
"Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil."
"In 1903 he built the estancia, ""Sierra de la Ventana"", in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays."
He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of José Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910).
"In 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires."
He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

From through , Lanier played for the San Francisco Giants (1964–71) and New York Yankees (1972–73). He is the son of Max Lanier, a former MLB All-Star pitcher."
"In his rookie season Lanier posted a career-high .274 batting average for the San Francisco Giants and was selected for the 1964 ""Topps"" All-Star Rookie team."
"In 1968, Lanier led NL shortstops in putouts (282) and fielding average (.979). After that, he moved from second base to shortstop, and finally to third base. He also played in part of two seasons with the New York Yankees."
"In a 10-season career, Lanier was a .228 hitter with eight home runs and 273 RBI in 1196 games played. In each of the three seasons from 1967 to 1969 he ranked last among NL qualifiers in average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage."
"Following his playing career, Lanier managed in the minors and served as third base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1981–85, including the 1982 World Series and National League champion teams. He then went on to manage the Houston Astros from 1986–88 and had a 254-232 win-loss record. In 1986, he was named NL Manager of the Year by the BBWA and ""TSN"" for leading the Astros to their first Division Title since 1980 and the best record (96-66) in team history up to that point. A power struggle between Lanier and Astros' general manager Dick Wagner in 1987 eventually led to Wagner leaving the team."
"In 1988, the Astros lost a home game to the San Francisco Giants. As the team prepared to eat the post-game meal, take showers, and go home, they received word they were wanted back on the field. Lanier brought out the batting cage and ordered the team to take batting practice again. Lanier was fired at the end of the season."
"In recent years, Lanier has managed in the independent minor leagues. He managed for the Winnipeg Goldeyes in the Northern League for several years, then moved to the Can-Am League to manage the Sussex Skyhawks.

Her son, Matt, served in the U.S. Army and was killed on May 27, 2005, as a result of injuries received in combat over Buhriz, Iraq, where he was serving in his second tour of duty."
"Lourey was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1990, running against a long-time incumbent Republican, and became the first woman to represent her rural district. She was re-elected in 1992 and 1994. She ran for and was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1996, again defeating a veteran incumbent, later becoming chair of the Senate Health and Family Security Committee and earning a reputation as an expert on health care."
"Lourey did not run for re-election in 2006. Her son, Tony, held her former seat until 2018, after which he was appointed to Governor Tim Walz's cabinet."
"Lourey announced her candidacy for Governor in November 2005. She lost the DFL Party endorsement to Attorney General Mike Hatch, gaining the support of 31% of the delegates on the first ballot, with 38% voting for Hatch and 29% voting for Steve Kelley. She withdrew from the endorsement process after the third ballot after falling behind Kelley, with Hatch's vote total increasing. She subsequently ran an opposition campaign against Hatch in the September primary, losing with 24% of the popular vote."
"Lourey's gubernatorial campaign health care platform was the Health Care Security Plan, which included the details to put a universal health coverage system in place in Minnesota by 2010. That system would have been voluntary, not mandatory as was the Massachusetts health program that was enacted into law in Spring 2006. The platform also included other state-level health reform proposals, including the current Minnesota Medical Association's proposal."
"At the heart of the Lourey health care plan was an expanded and reformed ""MinnesotaCare"", a state program providing health insurance coverage for low-income Minnesotans that she, along with several others, had authored in the state legislature in 1993. Under her Health Care Security Plan, all Minnesotans would have been eligible to join the new MinnesotaCare by 2010. Employers could participate by offering their employer plan via the new BusinessCare program to be created as part of the revised MinnesotaCare. There were several cost containment measures in Lourey's Health Care Security Plan, including a requirement that any HMOs, private health insurers or Third Party Administrators receiving contracts to administer state-funded health plans spend no more than 5% on administrative expenses."

"Suleman had tapped into Sydney's Assyrian community, many of whom had remortgaged their homes."
"In April 2004, Suleman was jailed for 21 months, with a 12-month non-parole period, for four fraud offences."
"Two days shy of being released from a 21-month jail term in 2005 the corporate regulator struck again, laying 26 new charges."
Karl Suleman Enterprizes fleeced 2062 investors who committed $130.7 million between them – by inviting them to invest in a trolley collection business that promised investors returns of 100 per cent a year.
"But instead of their money going into that business, the money was used to fund Suleman's extravagant lifestyle."
"Suleman and his wife Vivienne bought properties, luxury cars, boats and planes, sponsored charity events and gave lavish gifts as well as dinners for former United States presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton."
Some of the money was used to service a $13 million loan taken out to finance a range of IT and mobile phone ventures under the Froggy Group banner.
"Documents filed with the court by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed that investors, mostly from Sydney's Assyrian community, were induced to put between $50,000 and $150,000 into the trolley business on the promise that they would receive fortnightly returns of between $4000 and $25,000."
"While investors received some fortnightly payments as promised, the money earned by the trolley collection business fell well short of being sufficient to sustain the promised payments."
"The company's liquidators said in their report that between July 2000 and November 2001 the business made a net profit of $275,096 but was paying out $2 million a week to investors seeking high returns."
"Suleman started the trolley business in 1993, providing trolley collections from supermarkets stretching from Cairns to Adelaide. Supermarkets paid Suleman an agreed fee out of which he paid subcontractors to do the work."
The District Court heard 15 people invested more than $3 million in Suleman's supermarket trolley collection business in 2000 and 2001.
"Thirteen of them lost a total of more than $800,000."
The founder of the Froggy Group – was sentenced to 7 and a half years jail after pleading guilty to 26 charges.
The judge found Suleman knew the income from his business was not enough to repay the investors.
"He said it was serious white collar crime, and that Suleman had breached the trust of naive investors so he could live a lifestyle far beyond his legitimate income."
"Two years after being released from jail on 20 June 2013, 52-year-old Suleman suffered a heart attack at his home in Horningsea Park Sydney."

"Lotika Sarkar (4 January 1923 – 23 February 2013) was a noted Indian feminist, social worker, educator and lawyer, who was a pioneer in the field of women's studies and women's rights in India. She was a founding member of Centre for Women's Development Studies (CWDS), Delhi, established in 1980, and also Indian Association for Women Studies, established in 1982. Starting in 1951, she taught law at Faculty of Law, University of Delhi till 1983, and also remained the head of the Law Faculty, thereafter she taught at Indian Law Institute. She was the first Indian woman to graduate from Cambridge University, and later in 1951 she also became the first woman to receive a PhD degree in law from the university."
"Born in 1923, she was raise in an aristocratic family in West Bengal, where her father Sir Dhiren Mitra was leading lawyer of India."
"Sarkar studied law at Newnham College, Cambridge and became the first Indian woman to study and also then graduate from the university. Later she wrote a PhD in Law, also at Cambridge University, awarded in 1951. Thereafter in 1960, she studied international law at the Harvard University, where she was one of four Indian students, returning to India in 1961."
"In 1953, when Sarkar started teaching at the Law Faculty, University of Delhi, she was the first female lecturer in the faculty. Law was still a new field for women, initially there were only 10 girls in the course, a number which grew to 80–100 by the 1960s . She taught here till 1983, teaching eminent jurist and lawyers, and finally became the Head of the Law Faculty, and also the university don."
"In 1971, she became a member of the Committee on the Status of Women in India (CSWI), where along with her colleague, Vina Mazumdar, who joined in 1973 as Member-Secretary, there went on to publish the seminal, ""Towards Equality: The Report of the Committee on the Status of Women in India"" (1974–75) In 1979, the Supreme Court of India reversed the judgment of Bombay High Court in the Mathura rape case, in which two policemen were sentenced for raping of sixteen-year-old girl within a police station. The acquittal, went largely unnoticed until September 1979, when professors Upendra Baxi, Raghunath Kelkar and Sarkar of Delhi University and Vasudha Dhagamwar of Pune, wrote an open letter to the Supreme Court, protesting the concept of consent in the judgment. ""Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."" Later in January 1980 she formed the first feminist group against rape, ""Forum Against Rape"", widespread protests followed and eventually Indian Penal Code was amended."
"In 1980, she became a founder member of Centre for Women's Development Studies (CWDS), Delhi, founded by Vina Mazumdar, and which went on to become an influential institution, impacting the course of women's studies in India.

"I am a defeated and ruined war captive, that's it! The former emperor [Taizong] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury at me. In the past I have heard that Han law stipulates that executions of men be carried out in the city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [the tomb of the previous Tang emperor Taizong] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire."
"Gaozong received Helu's plea and agreed to his request, despite a Tang law ordering the execution of captured rebel generals and kings. In accordance with Confucian rituals, he was sent to Taizong's tomb where Gaozong spared his life, and then to the capital's Ancestral Temple where the captive was presented again, mirroring ancient rituals celebrating victorious armies. Helu felt disgraced by Taizong and committed suicide a year later while still in captivity. He was buried in a mound decorated with a stele outside the emperor's park. The tomb served as a military trophy, visible to the emperor's visitors entering the park, symbolizing the loyalty of the qaghan to the emperor and the Tang military victories against the Western Turks."
"The conquest strengthened Tang rule over modern Xinjiang, administered by the Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously under the control of the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the Altai Mountain region under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman Bridle Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control."
"Su continued his career as military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized like many of the other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought in a wave of Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor."
"The sheer size of the newly conquered lands made it difficult to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued for the remainder of the Tang Dynasty."
"At its maximum extent, Tang expansion brought China into direct contact with the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Aksu in 717 and the Battle of Talas in 751. Though victorious in 717, the Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world."
"The Tang emperor Gaozong installed two puppet qaghans, the cousins Ashina Buzhen and Ashina Mishe, and controlled the region by proxy. Buzhen and Mishe were enemies of Helu who had aided Su Dingfang during his campaign against Helu and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Gaozong divided the ten tribes of the area among the two cousins. Buzhen governed half of the tribes located in the west, while Mishe governed the other half located in the east."
"The son of Buzhen, Khusrau, and the son of Mishe, Yuanqing, resided in Chang'an, the capital of Tang, while their fathers administered the former khaganate as qaghans. Empress Wu Zetian sent Yuanqing and Kusrau westward in 685 to succeed their fathers as proxy rulers."
"Neither of the qaghans were able to successfully exert control. Turkic tribes resisted Yuanqing's rule, defeating the qaghan and forcing Yuanqing to return to Chang'an. Kusrau was able to bring the western tribes temporarily under his rule, but was defeated in 690 during an invasion by the Second Turkic Khaganate, and he too was forced to escape the region with his loyalists. Later attempts to install puppet qaghans failed, and the title was reduced to a symbolic position in the Tang court."

"In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called ""The Road of the Warriors"" (lit. ""Road of Armies"") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes."
"To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made."
"The Kaurna Aboriginal people of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the sky world. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a ""yura""; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means ""monster water""."
Aboriginal groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon.
"Further south, the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie."
The Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the sky world. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.
"In the Kimberley area, Aborigines called the Milky Way ""Iowara"" and see in it the presence of a giant emu elongated."
= = = Dynkin system = = =
"A Dynkin system, named after Eugene Dynkin, is a collection of subsets of another universal set formula_1 satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of σ-algebra. Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability."
"A major application of λ-systems is the π-λ theorem, see below."
"Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let formula_2 be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e., formula_2 is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
"Equivalently, formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check.
"An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a σ-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions."
"Given any collection formula_16 of subsets of formula_1, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted formula_18 which is minimal with respect to containing formula_19. That is, if formula_20 is any Dynkin system containing formula_19, then formula_22. formula_18 is called the Dynkin system generated by formula_16. Note formula_25. For another example, let formula_26 and formula_27; then formula_28."
"If formula_29 is a π-system and formula_2 is a Dynkin system with formula_31, then formula_32. In other words, the σ-algebra generated by formula_29 is contained in formula_2."
One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure):
"Let (Ω, ""B"", ""λ"") be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[(""a"",""b"")] = ""b"" − ""a"", and let ""D"" be the family of sets ""S"" such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let ""I"" = { (""a"",""b""),[""a"",""b""),(""a"",""b""],[""a"",""b""] : 0 < ""a"" ≤ ""b"" < 1 }, and observe that ""I"" is closed under finite intersections, that ""I"" ⊂ ""D"", and that ""B"" is the σ-algebra generated by ""I"". It may be shown that ""D"" satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's π-λ Theorem it follows that ""D"" in fact includes all of ""B"", which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on ""B""."

Anita Carol Hill (born 1951) is a LGBT American minister in the Lutheran Church. She is one of the first ordained lesbian women in the church and became a pastor before the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) changed its policy on LGBT ministers.
"Hill was born in 1951 and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a young adult, she lived in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and became involved in the United Methodist Church. Hill attended Mississippi State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in science. Hill went on to gain a master's degree in religious studies and a master of divinity degree from United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and studied at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota."
"In the 1980s, Hill started out as a lay minister in the Saint Paul-Reformation Lutheran Church. By the 1990s, her congregation wanted her to be ordained despite rules against lesbian pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) at the time. The church's head pastor, Paul Tidemann, created the goal for his church that it would have a non-celibate, openly gay minister by 1993. Hill was an open lesbian in a committed relationship. She was ordained on April 28, 2001, within the Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries but was later censured for her ordainment as an LGBT person. On September 18, 2010, she was formally inducted into the ELCA Clergy Roster. She left working at the church in 2012 and went on to fight a state constitutional amendment in her state which banned gay marriage."
In 2012 Hill joined ReconcilingWorks as regional director for the St. Paul area and later became its deputy director.
"A distinctive feature of many Australasian trams was the ""drop-centre"", a lowered central section between bogies (wheel-sets), to make passenger access easier by reducing the number of steps required to get inside of the vehicle."
"Californian combination cars had an enclosed centre section, with open-sided sections at each end. Hong Kong or toast rack (toastrack) cars were open, with the roof supported by a row of stanchions on each side. Most electric trams were single-deck, but Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and initially Dunedin had some open-top double-deck trams. These were popular with courting couples! The Wellington Fiducia trams had access at each end only, with no separate middle section or centre doors."
"The Engineers of the Auckland Electric Tramway Company, BET Company designed their own tramcars, earlier models were built by Brush Engineering in Loughborough, construction post the Great War was exclusively by Auckland Coach Builders and increasingly the Tramway's own workshops at Royal Oak on Manukau Road. Rear entrance Dinghy ""A type"" four wheelers, and toast rack trams were trialled in the early years and a small number of C type double deckers used until the 1920s. The ""Combo"" or B type design pretty much laid the basic design of Auckland tram down from 1902. Entrances at either end, platform steps within the bodyline of the tramcar. The in-house design progression moved to the addition of windscreens, a separate Motorman's compartment from the M type in 1908 and a seat design and layout for 52 seated passengers that remained standard until closure in 1956. Dalliance with riveted steel construction with the Art Deco ""Semi-steel"" N type in the 1920s which included butterfly [double set] destinations set in a V shape which could be read even when trams were parked bumper to bumper, double set saloon doorways a return to traditional wooden construction with the 1929/30 Big Cars with minor improvements to seating design and finally the 1930s Streamliner design, which had curving pillar frames, 7'6"" over the chassis and 8' at the window sill level and reducing again to the roofline. The design change of the bodies was cosmetically pleasing, but still seated only 52 passengers on wooden seats. Six of the streamliners used EMB trucks imported from the UK, primarily where they were used under Double Deckers. The remainder used Brush Improved Trucks, a design little changed for 30 years which were the mainstay of the Auckland fleet."

Initially, the band performed Irish folk and Celtic rock, and released one Celtic rock-oriented album. In 2008, the band changed the name to Alfapop and turned towards power pop sound, releasing their second album in 2010."
"The band was formed in 2000 by a group of Irish music enthusiasts. At first mostly playing Irish folk and songs by The Pogues and Young Dubliners, they gained audience's attention. Having changed a number of members the band got a stable lineup featuring Jovana Vujnović (vocals), Jovan Dragumilo (guitar and vocals), Miroslav Kočić (violin), Damir Žigić (drums) and Ranko Radovanov (bass guitar)."
"The band started recording their debut self-titled album in the autumn of 2005, and it was released in 2006 through One Records. The album featured songs both in English and Serbian language, with elements of punk rock and both Irish and Serbian folk music. Three promotional videos were recorded, for the tracks ""Brodovi"", ""Danny Boy"" and ""River""."
"In 2008, the band, now consisting of Vujnović, Dragumilo and Radovanov only, changed the name to Alfapop and started playing power pop, continuing, however, to perform songs they recorded as Tir na n'Og. In 2010, the band released the album ""Alfapop"" through Bulgarian record label AMAdea Records. The album featured nine songs in Serbian language, and the electronic music song ""Fantasy"", recorded by Vujnović, as the bonus track. Promotional videos were recorded for the songs ""Sati"" (""Hours"") and ""Hoću još"" (""I Want More""). The song ""Kao prvi put"" (""Like the First Time"") is a duet recorded with Charlie B singer Lazar Drecun."
"Soon after ""Alfapop"" release, Dragumilo stated that the band is planning to record a live album."

Sarm East Studios is a recording studio that was located on Osborn Street at the southern end of Brick Lane in east London.
The studio was established by Jill Sinclair and her brother John Sinclair with the help of engineers Mike Stone and Gary Lyons in 1973. It was previously called The City of London Recording Studios.
"The studio played host to artists such as Queen, Madonna, the Clash, Depeche Mode, Rush, Yes, ABC, INXS, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal and the Hoosiers."
"SARM East was later owned by SPZ Group, a holding company belonging to Jill Sinclair and her husband, producer Trevor Horn. It was closed down in the late 1990s, but Sarm Music Village belonging to SPZ group continues its legacy."
The studio had an early Solid State Logic (SSL) 4000E mixing console and was one of the first studios in London to install one. The SSL replaced an earlier Trident console with Allison automation.

The dam was completed in 2008 and will support a 153 MW hydroelectric power station that is expected to be fully operational in 2015. Currently, Unit 1 at 23 MW was commissioned in May 2014. The dam was originally intended to withhold the upper reservoir of a 400 MW pumped-storage power station until a design change in 2004. The dam is also intended for flood control and water supply. It is the largest dam by structural volume in Japan and withholds the country's largest reservoir by volume as well."
"In December 1957, Electric Power Development Company (J-Power) selected the Ibi River for study at the 23rd Electric Power Development Coordinating Meeting. By May 1976, the Ministry of Construction released their bulletin ""Policy on Tokuyama Dam Construction Project"". In December 1982, the project was incorporated into the Electric Power Development Basic Plan. It was approved by the government in 1998. The original project was a pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme which consisted of the Tokuyama Dam as the upper reservoir, the Sugihara Dam as the lower and the 400 MW Sugihara Power Plant."
"Construction on the dam started in May 2000 but by May 2004 J-Power and Chubu Electric announced they had changed the design of the project due to the concerns and protests of locals and groups. Instead of the pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, only the Tokuyama Dam would be constructed with a 153 MW conventional power station. Subsequently, the Sugihara Dam and Sugihara Power Plant were scrapped from the project. During construction, the long Tokunoyama"

"The Meridian Highway Bridge is a bridge that formerly carried U.S. Route 81 across the Missouri River between Nebraska and South Dakota. The Meridian Highway Bridge connects Yankton, South Dakota with rural Cedar County, Nebraska. The Meridian Bridge is a double deck bridge, with the top level having carried traffic into South Dakota from Nebraska, and the lower level having carried traffic into Nebraska from South Dakota."
"The bridge crosses the Missouri River, connecting Yankton, South Dakota to the north with Cedar County, Nebraska to the south. Prior to the construction of the bridge, traffic moved between these two points via a ferry service, started in 1870, and a seasonal pontoon bridge, first installed in 1890. The pontoon bridge was disassembled and rebuilt twice a year, once to float on open water, and once to be placed on solid ice. After a 1915 initiative to build a permanent bridge faltered with the U.S. entrance into World War I, a new effort was started by the Yankton Chamber of Commerce 1919. Though fundraising problems caused a temporary halt in 1922, the new bridge, featuring a movable span to allow for river navigation, was completed during the summer of 1924."
"The dedication ceremony was held on October 11, 1924 and the bridge opened as a toll bridge. It was the last link of the Meridian Highway, which became U.S. Route 81, to be completed. It was designed for use by trains on the lower level of the bridge and vehicular traffic on the upper level; a lift mechanism allowed river traffic to pass below. However, trains never used the lower level. In 1953, all tolls were lifted and the two levels were converted to one-way traffic, northbound on the top, southbound on the bottom."
"In the 1980s, the lift mechanism and counterweights were removed, and the decorative iron railings on the upper level were replaced by Jersey barricades."
The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
"On May 9, 2008, a 10-ton gross weight limit was placed on the bridge after an inspection found corrosion on the gusset plates. It was replaced by the Discovery Bridge upon its opening on October 11, 2008, exactly 84 years after the dedication of the Meridian Highway Bridge."
"The bridge was used as location for filming a scene of the 2016 film ""Until Forever""."
"With completion of the Discovery Bridge, the Meridian Bridge has been converted into a pedestrian/bike trail. The bridge reopened in November 2011 to non-motorized traffic only. A two block-long pedestrian plaza has been added."

"The chaplain is Father William Lister. The average congregation is about 150. The church ministers to the homeless in Florence. It is also used for classical music concerts and opera, with a resident opera company."
"St Mark's was founded by the Reverend Charles Tooth as a centre of worship for Anglo-Catholic members of the Anglican Church in Florence. He started a house church at 1 Via dei Serragli in 1877 to teach Anglo-Catholic principles and celebrate the Holy Eucharist daily during the week. In 1880, Tooth purchased a 15th-century palazzo to meet the new congregation's needs. John Roddam Spencer Stanhope designed and created the wall and ceiling decorations at his own expense. The first Holy Eucharist was celebrated there on 1 May 1881, although chaplain and church were not licensed for service by the bishop until 1884. The premises were extended by the purchase of 16 Via Maggio in 1906."
"The church was damaged by the 1966 Flood of the Arno River, resulting in the loss of George Frederick Bodley's 19th-century stencil work on the lower walls, although some survived behind a display cabinet."
"St. Mark's was the second Anglican church to be built in Florence. The British community in Florence has a long history and the chaplaincy began in the late 1820s. The first church, Holy Trinity, opened in the 1840s. Rebuilt in the 1890s, Trinity Church on the Via Lamarmara, is today a Waldensian Church."
"The white marble statue in the niche over the main door is ""Apotheosis of Saint Mark"" (2007–8) by Jason Arkles. This is the first work by an American sculptor to have a permanent public location in Florence."
"The building was altered by Tooth, who turned the ground floor into a church with nave, aisles, transept and chancel, about long and seating 400. The interior is decorated in the Pre-Raphaelite style and the upper reaches of the church have floral motifs with, as described by art historian Berenice Schreiner, ""a wonderful sense of naturalism""."

"The Imperial Monumental Halls and Tower was a proposed Gothic complex designed for a site in London adjacent to Westminster Abbey. The plans, exhibited at the Royal Academy in March 1904, included a tower that would have dominated the Clock Tower and Victoria Tower of the nearby Houses of Parliament. It was never built."
"The design by John Pollard Seddon – then diocesan architect for London – and Edward Beckitt Lamb (son of Edward Buckton Lamb) was based on earlier schemes that each had proposed separately, and was one of many extensions proposed for Westminster Abbey in late 19th and early 20th centuries by architects such as George Gilbert Scott, George John Shaw Lefevre, James Fergusson, and Henry Travis. In particular, the clergy at Westminster Abbey were concerned that the church was becoming crowded with monuments, and more space was needed. Some of the proposed designs were considered by a Royal Commission in 1891. The issue was given added impetus after the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902 by a desire for Westminster Abbey to become a fitting Imperial monument, to compete with the baroque St Paul's Cathedral where Queen Victoria had commemorated her Diamond Jubilee in 1897."
"The architects aspired to create a grand and expensive monument to ""form a worthy centre to the metropolis of the Empire 'upon which the sun never sets' "" ."
"The complex was planned to be joined to the Great Cloister of Westminster Abbey, leading to a reception hall beneath the tower, with the main body of the building - the Great Monumental Hall - stretching along Great College Street, incorporating smaller side halls. The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, wide and deep."
"The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells. It was intended to hold monuments and imperial trophies in galleries on the lower floors, with archives on the upper floors."
"It would have been the tallest building in the UK, significantly higher than the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey itself, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament close by."
"The scheme of work would have included the completion of the tower over the crossing at Westminster Abbey. ""The Builder"" magazine criticised the scheme as exhibiting a degree of megalomania ."

"Gilbert Jesse Brown (born February 22, 1971) is a former American football player. A nose tackle who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (1993–99, 2001–03), Brown played 125 Packers games (103 starts) recording 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. Nicknamed ""The Gravedigger,"" in honor of his celebratory dance following a thunderous tackle, Brown played in 15 Packers playoff games. He was a major contributor on strong defenses during the mid-1990s. His best season was 1996, when Green Bay won Super Bowl XXXI. He was also part of the Kansas team that won the 1992 Aloha Bowl, and was selected for the All-Academic Big Eight team in 1991."
"Gilbert grew up in Detroit, Michigan with parents Leroy and Ann Brown, older brother Wes, and younger siblings, Sheri, Tommy and Anna (all of whom went to college and became athletes). Like Leroy, Gilbert was athletic and fast. Even his brothers could not run home before Gilbert if he was craving a biscuit."
"During his career at Mackenzie High School, he recorded 189 tackles and 19 sacks. His senior year culminated in all-state honors. Brown also lettered in track, competing in the shot put. He graduated from high school in 1989."
"Back in high school, Gilbert never looked at big-time football factories such as Michigan. He wanted to get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, ""The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other."""
"With the Jayhawks, Brown helped build a winning program along with fellow defensive lineman and future NFL first round pick Dana Stubblefield (Kansas went to the Aloha Bowl in '92). But Brown went through more difficult times during his college years: a friend Brown had just met on campus died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis, and Brown's father died of congestive heart failure during Brown's senior year."
"He started all but 2 games in four seasons at the University of Kansas (1989–92), and was tied for sixth in school history in tackles by a defensive lineman with 168, fifth in career tackles for loss with 30, and had 7½ career sacks. He finished second on the team in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles recovered in 1991 while helping the Jayhawks hold opponents to an average of 150.9 yards per game on the ground, which was the best run defense at Kansas since 1968 at the time. A year earlier, as a sophomore, was named as the Jayhawks’ ‘Co-Defensive Most Valuable Player’ and earned second team All-Big Eight Conference recognition. Brown started nine games at nose guard as a freshman...An All-Academic Big Eight selection in 1991."
"He came up with the ""Gravedigger"" move at Kansas—after a big defensive hit, he would dig an imaginary grave, which became his trademark and nickname."
He majored in human development.
"Brown was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first training camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, picked him up on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament. Again in 1995, he played, but an elbow injury cut that season short. In 1996, he started all 16 games next to Santana Dotson, Sean Jones and Reggie White, a defensive unit that allowed a league record low 19 touchdowns. Brown had a career-high 51 tackles, and his first complete 16 game season."
"Brown became a fan favorite, partly because he was easy to spot, and partly because of his eccentric gravedigger dance. During the 1996 season, it became known that Brown would regularly order the ""Gilbertburger"" — a Double Whopper with extra everything, cut in half with extra cheese, no pickles — always obtained from the Oneida Street Burger King in Green Bay. Burger King even made it available for a short time as a promotion in Wisconsin Burger King restaurants."
"Brown was a highly sought after free agent after the 1996 season, but he elected to take a pay cut to stay with the Packers. On February 18, 1997, he signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract, which was 10 times his 1996 salary, but was about $1 million less than the offer he received from Jacksonville. He said that he would rather stay with the team and fans that he knew and loved."
"Many people thought that he started getting bigger around that time, and thought that he was as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. ""That was outrageous, I never got that big,"" said Brown. ""The biggest I ever got up to was maybe 350, something like that."" But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994."
"After playing all 16 games during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he spent the 2000 season out of football after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, ""If I didn’t think I could do this anymore, I wouldn't be here""."
"Brown had two good years after his return to football. However, he ruptured a biceps during the 2003 pre-season, but played on without having surgery. He recorded 14 tackles, one fumble recovery (the first of his career) and one pass defensed. In a victory over Chicago (Dec. 7), Brown posted a season-high four stops, along with a pass breakup."
"On March 2, 2004, the Packers released Brown. He had played 125 Packers games (103 starts) with 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. He also played in 15 Packers playoff games. In franchise history, only Brett Favre (22), Mason Crosby (18) and Aaron Rodgers (16) have more."
"Gilbert was featured in the ""Sports Illustrated"" special, ""Where Are They Now?"", featuring former professional athletes and what they are up to. Brown is currently a co-owner of the Milwaukee Mile, a racetrack that is often used for NASCAR races and at one time was the Packers' part-time home field. Gilbert even claims that he will occasionally fit his massive frame inside a race car and take a few laps."
"Gilbert, with the strong influence of his mother and family, felt that he wanted to give something back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish.

"Kisumu Rugby Football Club is a Kenyan rugby union club based in Kisumu. Also known as Lakeside RFC, for the 2015-16 season the club competes in the Nationwide League."
"Kisumu was founded in 1982, by David Mshila, Dennis Awori, Job Owino, Jack Ogal, Jim Owino, and Jos Odaga. They were originally based at the Kisumu Railway Club and the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu. Kisumu Boys High School also served as a training venue for years. Kisumu Technical High School (later called Kisumu Polytechnic - Makasembo) (1997) was used as a venue for games because of the good grass facility. In 1983 Kisumu combined with Kakamega, Kitale and Eldoret to form KITUSUMU: an acronym for Kitale and Kisumu.J.B Nyamwange, Jack and Walter Omaido came in from Kitale. Reg ’Pape” Sembi of Kakamega, a Canadian member of the Peace Corps Johnson Travis and Paul Scott of Eldoret. Records indicate that Barclays bank RFC travelled to Kakamega in 1985 playing Kisumu in the Enterprise Cup match. Barclays won the game 47-4. Kisumu and Kitusumu played mainly as a Western Kenya touring side but folded up in 1988."
"It is host to the Dala Sevens tournaments in the Kenya Rugby Football Union Calendar, one part of the Kenya National Sevens Circuit, today Safaricom Sevens series."
"Kisumu RFC was revived in late 1990 by rugby enthusiasts led by Mike Omondi, Bella Maguys, Gordon Raila, Peter Openda, Jim Owino, Dennis Otti, Joseph Owino, Eric Ogot, Sammy Ogot, Susan Nyaribo, Bob Bengo, Paul Okong’o, Nasser Midamba, Trevor Mugwanga, John Mark Magana, Oyunga Pala, Felix Okech and Issa Mohamed Issa amongst others. After the initial positive response to training, Jimmy Owino was appointed club coach. His initial task was to build a team with more commitment and solidarity, and to weed out the complacent ‘feel good attitude’ that had led to the dissipation of the original Kisumu RFC."
"Jimmy’s approach bore rapid results, but the next major obstacle became finance. At a team, ""Kamukunji"" it was unanimously agreed that Charles Lutta Kasamani be appointed Club patron, should he agree. He agreed. He donated playing kit, rugby balls and a first aid box. Some of the Kisumu-based personalities who raised funds tirelessly at the ""infamous"" Club Night at the Kisumu Hotel(Hotel Royale) pool side included Nilmar Darbar, Widar Krogsund, Ogweno Omwaga, Franz Bonn, Noel Okoth, Mike Humphreys, Morris Odhiambo, Jacko Omino, Peter Odaga, Paul Okullu, Peter Openda, Jos Odaga Charles Okuthe and many more whose names we cannot include here. An interim office of Charles Okuthe (Chairman) and Bella Maguys (Secretary) organized the first ever rugby tournament in Kisumu which was ‘not too good not too bad ‘in October 1991."
"The same office later organized Kisumu RFC elections which saw a new office of Peter Openda (Chairman) and Paul Okullu (Hon- Secretary) take over, with most of the interim office bearers not seeking re-election."
"From 1991 to 1996, Kisumu steadily concentrated on building a strong foundation by taking part in tournaments such as the Great Rift Valley 10-aside in Nakuru and Mombasa’s Driftwood Sevens. This was by choice because of a small player base and financial limitations. At the same time, the Club hosted the Kisumu Ten-aside event held between 1991 and 1994. With a rich hinterland of players from Maseno School, St. Mary's School Yala, Nyang'ori High School, Moi University and Maseno University there was light at the end of the tunnel. Mombasa businessman Edwin Yinda donated playing kit to the team after the Driftwood finals contested between Mean Machine RFC and Kisumu."
"Kisumu RFC first came to the fore when they reached the Driftwood 7s in Mombasa in 1994 losing in sudden death to Mean Machine RFC. Come 1997, Kisumu again reached the Finals of the Driftwood 7s in 1997 losing to the United States International University Africa."
"It is a Sunday in June 1997 and the George Mwangi Kabeberi Memorial 7s is on at the Nairobi Railway Club. Kenya is playing, using the one-day event as preparation for the Tusker Safari 7s in a couple of week’s time. The squad is composed of Sammy Khakame, Paul Murunga, Tolbert Onyango, Ken Thimba, Gordon Anampiu, Felix 'Toti' Ochieng', Manuel Okoth, Steve Gichuki & Co. Kisumu RFC are also present and the players on show are Andrew Okwaro, Fred Jura, Frank Ndong' Steve Oloo, Issa Matan Issa, Moses Kola, Tony Lamba, Job Odonde and Dan Alego, Gordon Raila, Felix Oketch, Bob Bengo. Two weeks before at the driftwood sevens in Mombasa the lakeside outfit finished runners -up losing 19-7 to USIU-Africa."
"Kisumu had moved away from mere participation to competition and the rugby fraternity had taken notice. Expectations from both the playing unit and fanatics were high. Mean Machine RFC arrived and in the side was Eric 'Shaggy' Mwangi, Biko Ambesta, Ted Okinda, Ken Aswani, Kanyi Gitonga, Eric Musuva, Oyunga Pala, Kevin Matabutu, Sundiya Halwenge and Paul Okong'o."
"And the event kicked off and the usual winners and losers and it looked like a ""kawa"" event, till Kenya met Kisumu and there was fireworks. Kenya despite her constellation of international players with exposure in Selkirkshire, Dubai, Spain and Singapore struggled to beat Kisumu, but that was just round one. To the semis of the Main Cup and Kisumu again met Kenya while Mean Machine RFC played Nakuru RFC. Nakuru with Ben 'Benways' Otieno, Caleb Langat and the hard hitting and sometimes illegal play were too strong for Machine and that was the end for Machine."
"To the second semi and Kisumu versus Kenya and this was a nip and tuck battle. The crowd at the Railway Club was at full cry behind Kisumu. Tony Lamba after many years in the Ninja's outfit found a new life, and with a new team was in imperious form setting up, Jura, Okwaro, Kola and Co. However Kenya composed themselves and closed the match off to set up a final versus rift Valley side Nakuru. It was not Kenya's day as New winger Caleb Langat scored try after try, taking Kenya's winger's apart. Winners Nakuru RFC"
"By Monday of the new week, Call ups to Kenya, Andrew Okwaro and Fred Jura."
"A tour to Uganda in October saw them leave an indelible mark with their trademark hard running, tackling and skills level in a country which was just beginning to pick the game after a lull of over 20 years. The visitor's led 13-7 at halftime before the hosts recovered to win 47-13 in the second-half. This was a 'test' versus Uganda. Putting it mildly, 1997 marked the turning point for Kisumu Rugby. They did not look back and Kisumu became a fertile rugby nursery nurturing young players just out of school into mature club and national team material."
"Kisumu joined the Second division ESS in 1998 after winning the Bowl league in 1997. The ESS would prove tricky for Kisumu. The challenge came from two quarters, one depth in terms of players and two finances to honor 11 away games with most teams based in Nairobi. The league would be honored on and off between 1998 and 2002."
"Away from that the Management Board of Kisumu actively engaged the Union in trying to secure a future. In behind the scenes talks the Kisumu management Board asked the Union for one leg of the National Sevens Circuit. At talks in Moshi, Tanzania in December 2002 a hush-hush deal was done with the Hon-Secretary of the Union Richard Omwela who was scheduled to contest for the Chairmanship in a number of months."
"With Mount Kilimanjaro providing a spectacular backdrop, to the conversation he proposed a deal. In exchange for support from the Lakeside team at the election he agreed to give Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit. Present at the talks were Omwela, Aggrey Chabeda, John Akelola, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o. Kisumu also actively engaged Max Muniafu who was then Director for Development at the Union and argued for the same. Prior to Moshi talks were held with Max, David Akelola, Phillip Ocholla, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o at the Junction Inn restaurant in Kisumu to push for the same."
Surely enough one of the first acts by Omwela & Chabeda on their election as Chair and Secretary of the Kenya Rugby Football Union was to award Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit in early 2003 by 'Executive order'.

"So we could get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On one side of the central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young painters organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other."
"In the Room 41 we were grouped together – Le Fauconnier, Léger, Delaunay, Metzinger and myself, joined, at the insistence of Guillaume Apollinaire, who was following this organisation with the greatest interest, by Marie Laurencin"
"Le Fauconnier showed his great ""Abondance"". Léger his nudes in a landscape in which volumes were treated following the method of differently shaded areas [zones dégradées] used in architecture or in mechanical models. Delaunay ""Le Tour Eiffel"" and ""La Ville"". Metzinger [Landscape, Nude, Woman's Head and Still Life], Marie Laurencin some canvasses with people in them. Myself – two landscapes and two canvasses with people: ""La Femme au phlox"" and ""Homme nu sortant du bain""."
"That, very precisely, was how Room 41 in the 1911 Indépendants was made up. In the neighbouring room were to be found, if my memory is right, Lhote, Segonzac, Moreau. [...]"
"During the few days it took for the hanging commission to do its work, there was nothing that could have enabled us to foresee the effect our pictures were about to produce on the public at large. The painters and critics who walked around the canvasses were clearly very interested, whether they were for or against. But no-one could have thought there was material there for a scandal. And we the first, who certainly never would have wanted it."
"So we were greatly surprised when, at the preview, the explosion took place. (Albert Gleizes)"
"""The great complaint that was made against us was of being unreadable; people claimed they could 'see' nothing in our pictures"". Gleizes continues:"
"Everyone was crushed into our room, people were shouting or laughing, expressing indignation, protesting, getting up to all sorts of antics, they were pushing each other out of the way to get in, those who approved and defended our position and those who condemned it argued with each other... Room 41 was always full."
"In ""Intransigeant"" Guillaume Apollinaire emphasized the importance of what the Cubists were doing and defended them with passion. Louis Vauxcelles in ""Gil Blas"" attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in ""Comoedia, Excelsior, Action"", and ""L'Oeuvre"" were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in ""Paris-Journal"", the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism."
"It was from that preview in 1911 that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. Prior to the Salon des Indépendants of 1911 no one had ever been called a Cubist, not even Braque or Picasso."
"What, by contrast, can be established is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined as it was to the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the ""Indépendants"", during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born in the same way as the word 'Impressionism' in 1872."
"Overnight, Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger and Delaunay had become famous. Virtually unknown the previous evening, their names and profiles were spread not only throughout Paris but throughout France and other countries as well. Gleizes writes:"
"Painting which, until then, had been the concern of only a small handful of amateurs, passed into the public domain and everyone wanted to be informed, to be let into the secret of those paintings which, it seemed, represented nothing, and whose meaning had to be deciphered like a puzzle."
"The International Exhibition of Modern Art of 1913, known today as the Armory Show, was a landmark event in the history of art. This monumental series of exhibitions showcased the works of the most radical European artists of their time alongside those of progressive American contemporaries. This massive exhibition was presented in varying forms at three venues—New York (69th Regiment Armory, February 17 – March 15), Chicago (Art Institute of Chicago, March 24 – April 16), and Boston (Copley Society, April 23 – May 14). The exhibition introduced the visual language of European modernism to a wide spectrum of the American public, changing the aesthetic outlook for American artists, collectors, critics, galleries and museums."
"In 1913, Gleizes, along with Archipenko, Picabia, Picasso, the Duchamp brothers and others, introduced Cubism to an American audience at the Armory Show in three major cities, New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to ""La Femme aux Phlox"" Gleizes exhibited his 1912 painting ""Man on a balcony"" (no. 196 of the catalogue)."
"Gleizes entries—both of particular importance, had already produced a considerable effect in Paris—practically eclipsed six paintings and a drawing by Picasso, and three paintings by Braque exhibited at the Armory Show."

"Before construction, the people who want to Cross (call for the Tanjung Agas and Malacca) had crossed the Muar river using the ferry facility called ""Penambang"" which began operating around 1890 since Muar was officially opened by the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar."
"Due to the rapid development time, felt unable to cope ""Penambang"" vehicles wishing to cross the Muar River. Travel by ferry is quite time consuming and even dangerous especially during flood season. Therefore, the proposal was made to build a bridge that will connect to Tanjung Agas Muar Town and Malacca."
"Originally, the government planned to build a bridge across Sungai Batu Pahat alone. But after receiving pressure from Muar residents, the government added a proposal to build a bridge to Muar and Batu Pahat. Proposal to build two bridges that have been included in the Second Malaya Plan (1961–1966) by the Malayan Public Works Department (JKR) and it was announced by the Minister of Public Works, Tun VT Sambanthan."
The Government then open invitation to tender in 1960 and received 25 tenders from 10 firms who are interested in the two of them are from the French company based here. The government had to wait almost 4 years to get financing to build the bridge.
"Finally, in July 1964 the government announced that two local companies Wing Co. Ltd. and Development Services Ltd has won the tender of RM5.2 million for the two bridges Muar and Batu Pahat."
"Initially, the government estimated allocation of RM8 million for the construction of both the bridge and the government finally succeeded in obtaining financing proceeds of RM9 million loan from Chase Manhattan Bank."
The government has allocated RM3.25 million for construction work. The work was initiated at the end of construction in 1965 and was completed in early 1967. They are built just 1.5 kilometres from the Tangga Batu Penambang Ferry Terminal.
"The bridge over 1,264 feet (385 meters) is constructed with an area of 24 feet (7 meters) of the vehicle lanes, 8-foot (2-meter) for bike paths / bike, and 5 feet of sidewalks. It can accommodate a load of 500 tons for each 100 feet (30 meters)."
"To complete this bridge, 4 pontoons used to carry concrete mixers, cement, sand and cranes weighing up to 120 with 50 ton lift in which a total of 2 piers built specifically to fit the mould of concrete beams."
"The bridge was built on 48 piles of special steel imported from Germany and reinforced concrete piles 82. It is estimated that more than 9,000 cubic meters of concrete and 2100 tons of steel and a workforce of 130 people was used during the construction of the bridge."
"With the construction of this bridge, road users from Johor Bahru to Melaka when it has saved about 64 miles by road from Segamat–Tangkak–Jasin."
"To handle the influx of traffic due to the construction of the bridge. Four roundabouts was built at a cost of RM1 million in every locations including Jalan Yahya roundabout, Bentayan roundabout, Sulaiman roundabout and Khalidi roundabout."
"The Muar bridge was officially opened by the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Sir Ismail Al-Khalidi ibni Almarhum Sultan Sir Ibrahim Al-Masyhur on Saturday, 16 April 1967 at 10.30 am and was named officially as the Sultan Ismail Bridge. The inauguration was witnessed by thousands of people who first opened and crossed the Muar River to use the bridge. Following the opening of the bridge, the ""Penambang"" ferry service was terminated effective midnight Friday, 15 April 1967."
"The Sultan Ismail Bridge is the second toll bridge in Malaysia after Sultan Yahya Petra Bridge in Kelantan (opened in 1967). The RM80,000 toll plaza was built in Tanjung Agas for toll collection to cover the cost of the building of the bridge."
"Initially, the government announced that tolls are charged RM0.25 for motorbikes, RM0.75 to RM1.75 for cars and heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses."
"After opening, the price raised to RM0.50 toll for motorbikes, RM1.50 for cars and taxis and RM3.50 for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses. This has invited objections from residents, particularly taxi and bus operators where at first they boycotted the use of the bridge."
"After numerous objections made mainly from traders and industrial sectors, starting 1 July 1971, the second Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak has announced a reduction to RM0.50 toll for cars and RM1.00 for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses, while for motorcyclists it is free."
"Tun Abdul Razak then visit to Muar in May 1975, he announced that the toll charged for Sultan Ismail Bridge Muar would be abolished."
"Between the 1990s and the 2000s, traffic congestion occurred at the Sultan Ismail Bridge since the official opening of the North–South Expressway Southern Route between Ayer Keroh and Pagoh and the opening of the Tangkak and Pagoh Interchange on 1 April 1989. To this end, in 1998, the federal government announced that the new second bridge would be built at Parit Bunga to ease congestion on the existing bridge. The second bridge was constructed between March 2001 and June 2003 and was officially opened to traffic in 2004 alongside the opening of the Muar Bypass."
"On 25 November 2012, in conjunction with the birthday of the sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Ismail ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj (birth date: 22 November 2012) and the Declaration of Bandar Maharani Muar as a Royal Town of Johor, for the first time in history, after 45 years of opening to traffic, Sultan Ismail Bridge was closed for about 12 hours, from 3:00 pm to 5:00 am."

"The Prometheus is traveling back to Earth with a Hyperspace engine from an Al'kesh. Every couple of hours, the Prometheus has to jump out of hyperspace to cool down the Al'kesh hyperspace engine. The Prometheus comes near a nebula that Samantha Carter thinks doesn't conform to nebulae she has previously studied. When they jump out of hyperspace, the Prometheus is attacked by an unknown vessel. They can't jump into hyperspace because the engines need to cool down. The Prometheus is chased into a gas cloud by the alien ship. Samantha Carter is knocked out when she tries to convert power from auxiliary to the hyperspace engine to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud. When she wakes up, all the crew members other than her have disappeared. She alone must get herself and them to safety. She has visions of a little girl running around the ship, playing with bubbles and of her friends, who vocalize her worries and theories about her predicament. Teal'c at one point grabs Carter by the arm and warns her that if she falls asleep she will die."
"The hallucination of Daniel Jackson frankly confesses that he is unreal but he is present because there is something she has overlooked. The hallucination of Teal'c warns her that this whole scenario could be a result of the hostile alien species mind-probing, with a view to her inadvertently surrendering information about the Prometheus' engine technology. Daniel then reappears and tells her that the 'nebula' may be a living being which is why she and the alien ship are stuck inside."
"The hallucinations of Jacob Carter and of Jack O'Neill serve as a means by which Carter confronts her personal life and her relationships (in particular when talking to 'Jack', her feelings for him). 'Jack' tells her he will always be there for her, no matter what."
After an encounter with the small girl who is playing with bubbles Carter hits on a solution. She engages the hyperspace engines with only a fraction of the usual amount of power. This has the effect of rendering the ship partially intangible.
"She contacts the alien ship and offers them the solution to escaping the nebula in exchange for the return of the crew and safe passage. After a confused crew are beamed back in to the Prometheus, Carter creates a hyperspace bubble large enough to encompass both the Prometheus and the alien ship and they both exit the nebula safely. The aliens keep their end of the bargain and jet away. Carter relieves herself of duty and is escorted to the infirmary for massive concussion."

It was also known as the Smurfit–Stone Building and the Stone Container Building and was formerly called the Associates Center. Construction began in 1983 and was completed in 1984. The building, noted for its unusually slanted facade, was designed by Sheldon Schlegman of A. Epstein and Sons. The building has 39 floors of tenant space and the two spires at the top cover the main roof and HVAC equipment."
"Although the building looks as though it is split down the middle, the two sides are only slightly disjointed until nearing the top, where there is a gap between them. At times, its slanted roof—which has been likened to a skyscraper slashed with a knife—displays local sports slogans on its face, such as ""GO BEARS"" and ""GO SOX"". It also displayed ""VOTE 2008"" during the 2008 election day rally at Grant Park."
"At the time of its construction the Crain Communications Building was considered to be a smart building, with sophisticated environmental and security controls. Three years after its completion, the building played a role in the Touchstone Pictures film ""Adventures in Babysitting"". The building is also modeled in EA's ""SimCity 4"", as well as being destroyed in the film """" and in the videogame """"."
"The building name was changed to the Crain Communications Building in March 2012, after Crain Communications moved its headquarters there."

The Brandywine Valley Railroad is a class III railroad operating in Pennsylvania.
"It was established in 1981 by the Lukens Steel Company to operate trackage at Coatesville, Pennsylvania and the neighboring town of Modena. It was acquired, with the rest of the Lukens properties, by Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1998."
"The Brandywine Valley's main line was originally built by the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, largely following the Brandywine Creek, to connect Reading with Wilmington, Delaware. By the time of the Brandywine Valley's formation, the line had been abandoned north of Valley Station, just north of Coatesville. BVRY took over the line from this point, the site of an interchange with Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, south to Modena, below which the ex-W&N was owned by PennDOT and operated by a number of shortlines over the years."
"Under Bethlehem operation, BVRY took over operation of the Delaware Valley Railroad, then operating the remainder of the ex-Wilmington and Northern, in early 1999. This gave the railroad interchange access not only to Conrail at Coatesville (subsequently replaced by the Norfolk Southern Railway), but to CSX Transportation at the southern end of the line at Elsmere, Delaware. It also thus began to operate a connecting branch of the former Pennsylvania Railroad from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, on the W&N, to Nottingham."
"After the acquisition of Bethlehem Steel's assets by International Steel Group in 2003, Brandywine Valley began to scale back its operations. The ex-PRR line, also known as the Octoraro line, was taken over in that year by the Morristown and Erie Railroad. In 2005, the ex-W&N line south of Modena was turned over to the East Penn Railroad, reducing the Brandywine Valley to its original extent."
"With the merger of ISG in 2005, the railroad and steel plant were taken over by Mittal Steel Company, which became ArcelorMittal in 2006."
"= = = Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland = = ="
"Victor Frederick William Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland, (18 June 1897 – 30 July 1990), known as Victor Cavendish-Bentinck until 1980, was a British diplomat, businessman, and peer. He served as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee during the Second World War and was British Ambassador to Poland between 1945 and 1947."
"Cavendish-Bentinck was born in Marylebone, London on 18 June 1897. He was the second son of Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, whose father, George Cavendish-Bentinck, was a grandson of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. Although formally Victor Cavendish-Bentinck he was known informally as Bill. Like other members of his family he informally dispensed with the name ""Cavendish"", being known simply as Bill Bentinck. He was educated at Wellington College."
"Queen Elizabeth II is also descended from the 3rd Duke of Portland through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. The Queen and the 9th Duke of Portland were third cousins, once removed."
"Cavendish-Bentinck did not pursue a university education, instead entering the diplomatic service in 1915 at the age of 18 before taking leave to fight with the Grenadier Guards in the First World War, returning to the Foreign Office in 1919. In 1922, he took charge of administrative arrangements for the Lausanne Conference. He served in the British Embassy in Paris and also in the League of Nations Department in the Foreign Office. Other postings included Athens in 1932 and Santiago in 1933. The high point of his diplomatic career came in 1939 when he was appointed chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. He managed to develop the body as a highly effective instrument of government and, as a result, became counsellor to the Services Liaison Department of the Foreign Office in 1942."
"However, he cast doubt on reports that were received regarding the Nazi genocide of the Jews. In late August 1943 the Polish Embassy in London informed the British government of the deportation and annihilation of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Lublin and Bialystok provinces. The chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, deplored Polish and Jewish information about atrocities. He wrote this information as an attempt to ‘stoke us up’ He added: ‘I feel certain that we are making a mistake in giving credence to this gas chamber story.’ This error of judgement makes his subsequent appointment as ambassador to Poland the more surprising."
"In 1945, Cavendish-Bentinck was given his final diplomatic posting on his appointment as Ambassador to Poland. When visiting the formerly German City of Stettin (Szczecin) in 1946 he was invited to talk to German civilians suffering from months of internment so their possessions and property could be taken over by Polish resettlers from territories lost to the USSR. Cavendish-Bentinck refused to do so, ignoring certain inhuman circumstances under which mainly old people, women and children had to suffer, by noting to his Polish hosts, he was ""convinced that they will complain as usual""."
"He held the position for two years before the Foreign Office applied to appoint him Ambassador to Brazil. He never took up the latter post, being obliged to resign from the Foreign Office, without a pension, as a result of the publicity surrounding his divorce. Bentinck's aristocratic background attracted press attention; Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, apparently sympathetic, remarked at that the time ""I could have saved him if his name had been Smith."""
"After his withdrawal from the diplomatic service, Cavendish-Bentinck embarked on a business career, becoming Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Industrial Interests in Germany. From this position, he was able to advance the interests of British companies such as Unilever. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group."
"In 1980 he succeeded his elder brother Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck as the 9th Duke of Portland. Upon his own death in 1990, the dukedom and the Marquessate of Titchfield became extinct because his only son had predeceased him and there were no other surviving male heirs of the 1st Duke. However, the earldom of Portland had been created in an earlier generation than the dukedom and there were surviving descendants in the male line to inherit it. That title was therefore inherited by his kinsman, Henry Noel Bentinck, who became 11th Earl of Portland, together with its subsidiary titles of Viscount Woodstock and Baron Cirencester. He was interred at the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland in the churchyard of St Winifred's Church at Holbeck."
"Bentick married Clothilde Bruce Quigley (died 1984), an American, on 16 February 1924. She was the daughter of James Bruce Quigley. They had two children together:"
Soon after World War II began Bentinck received a telephone call at his office from his Hungarian maid to tell him that his wife had left him and taken their children with her. They were finally divorced in 1948.
"Portland married secondly, Kathleen Elsie Barry (died 2004) on 27 July 1948. She was the daughter of Arthur Barry. This marriage produced one child:"

"Eleanor Rigby is a 2004 novel by Douglas Coupland, about a lonely woman at ages 36 and 42. The novel is written as a first-person narrative by the main character, Liz Dunn."
"The novel centres on changes to Liz's life when someone from her past unexpectedly re-enters her life. It is written in a light, often comic, tone, but resonates on many deeper issues, including loneliness, family, religious visions and multiple sclerosis."
"Two distinct plot movements are separated by a break in the narrative flow. The first part of the novel involves two retellings: the story of Liz Dunn’s trip to Europe and her pregnancy, and the story of the re-emergence into her life of her child, Jeremy, who is dying of multiple sclerosis."
"As a teenager, Liz goes on a trip to Europe, her one big expressive moment. On this trip, while drunk, she loses her virginity in Italy to a man she cannot remember. From this experience, she becomes pregnant with Jeremy, who is put up for adoption, and goes in and out of foster families for much of his young life."
"Jeremy arrives back into Liz’s life when she is at a low point of loneliness. His illness is terminal, and because of drug abuse, he has only a short time to live. Jeremy’s introduction into Liz’s life rattles the lonely world she has constructed, opening up her and her world."
"The first part of the novel, narrated by Liz, jumps between these two moments, constantly reminding the reader that these are moments in the past. There is a symbolic page break between the first section, which takes place in the past, and the second section, which takes place in the novel’s present."
"In the present, Jeremy has died. Liz finds a meteorite that she takes to be a very precious object. She sleeps with it under her pillow to keep it close. She eventually, through a list of circumstances, decides to travel to Europe to find Jeremy’s father, a trip which again leads her to a world of excitement, police and army incidents, and a reunion with Jeremy’s father."
"Liz Dunn is the protagonist of this novel. She is an overweight, lonely woman, who lives a removed solitary existence. Her apartment, for instance, can only accommodate one person."
"Coupland has spoken extensively about the character of Liz Dunn, claiming that she was his most realistic character."
"Liz’s son Jeremy, who was sent out for adoption, has a terminal case of multiple sclerosis. He has traveled through the foster-care system of British Columbia, residing with many families who abused him. He eventually reconnects with Liz after finding her and registers her as his next of kin for emergencies. When he is hospitalized, Liz reconnects with her son."
"Jeremy is cheerful in the face of his condition, happy with the life that he has left to lead. He eventually becomes a successful mattress salesman in the time leading up to his death. He experiences visions of a post-apocalyptic future, which enthralls Liz. He envisions a future where crops have gone foul and farmers ask a divine voice for guidance."
The inspiration for Eleanor Rigby was loneliness. Coupland suffered through a period in his early twenties he describes as being caused by loneliness.
"The novel is named after The Beatles' song of the same name. The song reference was inspired from a moment in Coupland's past. Coupland heard the song ""on a friend's mother's record player. And the story threw me: 'Oh my God, what happened to her?' The lyrics didn't tell you much but in my head I always saw her as an only child of very old parents who didn't have a clue and she was left in a rectory and died without leaving any mark anywhere ... The book's not like that, of course, but it's the mood and the way Liz describes herself."" The song itself features in the narrative as it is Liz Dunn's email address."

"A rubber chicken is a prop used in comedy. The phrase is also used as a description for food served at speeches, conventions, and other large meetings, and as a metaphor for speechmaking."
A rubber chicken is an imitation plucked fowl made in a latex injection mold.
"The origin of the rubber chicken is obscure, but is possibly based on the use of pig bladders, which were inflated, attached to a stick and used as props or mock-weapons by jesters in the days before the development of plastic and latex. Chicken corpses were readily available; therefore jesters could employ them as variations of slapsticks."
"One account attributes the first use of a prop chicken to John Holmberg, the Swedish black-faced clown of the early 1900s. Holmberg would perform with his pockets full of fake food to mock the gluttony reportedly prevalent among the upper classes at the time."
A claim that the symbol originated during the French Revolution with soldiers hanging a chicken from their muskets for luck is printed on the tag of rubber chickens manufactured by Archie McPhee.
"The term ""rubber chicken"" is used disparagingly to describe the food served at political or corporate events, weddings, and other gatherings where there are a large number of guests who require serving in a short timeframe. Often, pre-cooked chicken is held at serving temperature for some time and then dressed with a sauce as it is served. Consequently, the meat may be tough or “rubbery.” Someone who ""travels the rubber chicken circuit"" is said to do so by attending or making speeches at many such gatherings, often as part of political campaigning."

The story centres on a magician, Father Alfonso, his daughter, Elsee and an Ayurveda Vaidyar Kumaran and his two twin sons and how their life changes after the land is decolonised. The novel won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and the N. V. Prize. It was adapted into a film by noted director Lenin Rajendran in 1992."
"The story begins in 1950s, when the French, the colonial rulers were packing off from Mahé, a coastal town in North Malabar, after 230 years, leaving behind remnants of a cultural history. Those, who considered themselves as belonging to Francophone culture, jumped onto the first available vessel to France. And many of the older generation, orphaned by the departure of the French, struggle to eke out a living even as they remember their days of plenty under their foreign masters. Caught up in their suffering, Kumaran Vaidyar does everything he can to keep the people of his beloved Mayyazhi from starving, but entrusts his own children to the care of his wife, who is no more. Meanwhile, Father Alphonse waves his magic wand and changes pebbles into candy and waits for his good-looking son to return. Through all this, untroubled by the woes of the elders, Shivan, Shashi and Elsie spend an idyllic childhood in sunny, sleepy Mayyazhi. Until the day of reckoning catches up with them and they pay the price of growing up."

"Vokrug sveta (, literally: ""Around the World"") is a Russian geographic magazine. It is the longest running magazine in the Russian language. The first issue was printed in Saint Petersburg, in December 1861, almost thirty years before the establishment of the ""National Geographic Magazine"". Thus, it is one of the oldest popular science magazines in the world. Release of ""Vokrug sveta"" was suspended twice: from 1918 to 1927, during the Russian Revolution, and from 1941 to 1945, during World War II. Nevertheless, the magazine always resumed and continues to be published to this day."
"The magazine was conceived by a Warsaw-born entrepreneur, Boleslaw Wolf, who defined ""Vokrug Sveta"" as a lavishly illustrated yearly publication, dedicated to ""physical geography, natural sciences, the most recent discoveries, inventions and observations"". Its roster of authors included: Alfred Brehm, Camille Flammarion, Nikolai Przhevalsky and Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai."
"The Wolf edition was discontinued after 1868 for unclear reasons, but the project of a popular geographical journal was revived in 1885 by Ivan Sytin, a printer who directed his periodicals toward a wider audience. Sytin's ""Vokrug sveta"" was issued monthly and featured original translations of popular adventure fiction from such authors as Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle."
"The Russian Revolution brought this period of the magazine's history to an abrupt termination. Like many other periodicals of Imperial Russia, ""Vokrug sveta"" suspended publication for ten years. It was back in print under the auspices of the Young Communist League, specifically targeted toward the youth audience. Contributing editors included some of the finest Soviet science fiction authors, including Alexander Belayev, Vladimir Obruchev and Ivan Yefremov. In 1938, the magazine's headquarters relocated, from Leningrad to Moscow and its publication was altogether suspended during World War II."
"For Soviet readers, ""Vokrug sveta"" represented a rare source of authentic, fully illustrated information about foreign cultural attractions. This is despite the insistence of Soviet officials that the magazine should cover domestic tourist attractions, rather than those situated outside the USSR. In the 1960s and 1970s, the magazine continued to grow in popularity and increased the circulation to 2,300,000 copies by 1971. A television subsidiary was also popular, particularly in the early 1990s. As of 2007, ""Vokrug sveta"" ranks third among Russia's popular monthlies, with a circulation hovering around 250,000.

Previous programs shown in the same time slot were ""The Money Wheel"" with Ted David and Martha MacCallum (who later joined Fox News Channel) and ""Market Watch"". The program last aired August 8, 2007."
"On February 3, 2006, Ted David, who had co-anchored ""Morning Call"" with Liz Claman since 2003, left the program while being promoted to senior anchor at CNBC Business Radio. From 2006-02-06 to 2007-07-17, Claman was joined in the 10-11am hour by Mark Haines (who reported from the New York Stock Exchange), and in the 11am-noon hour by various anchors, including Dylan Ratigan (see anchor roster below)."
"On July 20, 2007, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded ""Squawk on the Street"", due in part to Claman's departure from the network (which she joined Fox News Channel's sister network financial unit three months later). Dylan Ratigan and Trish Regan served as interim anchors for the program, which was completely revamped on 2007-07-23. In addition to the aforementioned 2007-07-23 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to ""Squawk Box""."
"On August 8, 2007, the show was renamed—and replaced—by ""The Call"". The name change to ""The Call"" with Dylan Ratigan (who left the show in late 2008 and was replaced by Larry Kudlow), Melissa Francis, and Trish Regan on that date was due in part to avoid confusion with the early-morning Bloomberg Television program of the same name."
"The following segments below were carried over to ""The Call"" as of 2007-08-08:"
"The following segments below moved to the second hour of ""Squawk on the Street"" as of 2007-07-23:"
"Occasionally, ""Morning Call"" was broadcast live on location, such as the NYMEX. One of these examples came on May 31, 2007, when this program was named ""Morning Call"", Liz Claman anchored the entire 2-hour program from the NYMEX (along with Haines at the NYSE for the first hour and Ratigan at CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ for the second hour). She was joined on location at the NYMEX by Sharon Epperson on the day the weekly crude oil, gasoline, distillate, and natural gas inventories report were released by the EIA."
"The Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL, engl.: ""German Train Drivers' Union"") is a German trade union that represents workers in train companies. It has a membership of 34,000."
"In August 2007 the GDL planned to strike after talks failed with Deutsche Bahn, the main German railway operator, over a range of demands from the union. A key disagreement was GDL's wish to represent its members in collective bargaining processes, independently of other unions representing staff in that job category."
"On 8 August 2007, the labour court in Nuremberg declared that a strike of affected long-distance and goods services would be illegal if carried out before 30 September, claiming it would affect the national economy too severely."
"On 2 November 2007, the labour court in Chemnitz overturned a previous judgement limiting strike action to short-haul routes. After the decision the GDL declared a three-day strike. It was the first national rail strike since 1992 and of unprecedented duration. The strike ended as the union had planned, at 2:00 a.m. CET on the morning of Saturday, November 17, 2007, but without a new contract."
"On 19 November 2007 the labour court in Nuremberg admonished Deutsche Bahn for its practice of contacting multiple labour courts around the country to try and obtain an injunction against strike action, which it regarded as misuse of the legal system."
"In 2014 the GDL started a series of strikes of the German railway system as a result of Deutsche Bahn declining its demands for a shorter working week (reduced from 39 hours to 37 hours), for a 5% pay increase and for the right to independently represent 17,000 railway workers not working as engine drivers in collective bargaining processes. Deutsche Bahn maintained that it would only enter collective bargaining with a single trade union per job grouping, as was the case until June 2014 when GDL had an agreement with the much larger EVG union."
"The strikes continued in 2015 with a three-day railway strike starting on 21 April 2015, the GDL's seventh strike in 10 months. This was followed by a strike from 4–10 May, the longest strike in Deutsche Bahn's history. A further strike started on 19 May 2015 and finished on 21 May as the GDL and Deutsche Bahn agreed to allow arbitration to resolve the conflict."

"Daishōhō Masami (7 May 1967 – 4 December 1999) was a sumo wrestler from Hokkaidō, Japan. His highest rank was ""komusubi."""
"Born in Sapporo, he took up skiing as a young boy, as he came from an area famous for its ski slopes. He also played basketball at school. However his father was an amateur sumo enthusiast and encouraged his son to try the sport. In his third year of junior high he took part in the National Junior High School Sumo Championships, held in Tokyo, and was put up in Tatsunami stable during the championships. Daishoho was an amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, and after graduation he returned to Tatsunami stable. He entered professional sumo in January 1990 at the ""makushita"" level, and quickly reached the top ""makuuchi"" division in July 1991. His best performance in a tournament was in September 1992 when he was runner-up to Takahanada with 11 wins. He reached his highest rank of ""komusubi"" in January 1993, but after that he was plagued by a number of injuries to his knees, back and triceps. He fell back to the ""jūryō"" division after pulling out of the January 1997 tournament on the 4th day."
"In 1999 Daishoho was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He wanted to receive treatment whilst still remaining active on the ""dohyo"", but in June he was persuaded by his doctors to enter hospital full-time and so retired from sumo. Since it was clear that he would be unlikely to live long enough to have a formal retirement ceremony (""danpatsu-shiki"") at the Ryogoku Kokugikan, which normally takes place up to a year after retiring, in October 1999 his fellow wrestler and graduate of Nihon University Mainoumi organised a private function for him which was attended by around 400 people including wrestlers such as Konishiki and Musashimaru and his former stablemaster Haguroyama, although senior members of the Sumo Association and his former coach at Nihon University Hidetoshi Tanaka did not attend as it was an unsanctioned event. Daishoho's weight had dropped from 150 kg to below 90 kg. He died on December 4, 1999 at the age of 32 due to pancreatic cancer."
"Daishoho liked pushing techniques, particularly ""tsuppari"", a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. However, he was also good at fighting on the ""mawashi"" or belt, where he preferred a ""migi-yotsu"" grip, a left hand outside and right hand inside position. His most commonly used ""kimarite"" were ""yorikiri"" (force out), ""oshidashi"" (push out) and ""uwatenage"" (overarm throw)."

= = = International Workers' Olympiads = = =
"International Workers' Olympiads were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by Socialist Workers' Sport International (SASI). It was an organisation supported by social democratic parties and International Federation of Trade Unions. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the Olympic Games. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe. Nowadays the CSIT World Sports Games are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The ""World Sports Games"" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the CSIT. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation) is an international Multi-Sports Organization."
"The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, Henri de Baillet-Latour and Avery Brundage, were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace."
"The Lucerne Sport International (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The IOC had banned the losing side of the World War I from the 1920 Summer Olympics (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the ""enemy"" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the German town of Schreiberhau, which today is a part of Poland. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in Frankfurt am Main."
"National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement. The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games. The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families."
"International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. 1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad in Vienna was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, both in number of participants as well as spectators. Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad. The last Workers' Olympiad at Antwerp in 1937 was a joint event with the Red Sport International organized Spartakiads."

The vessel is also equipped with one bow thruster and one stern thruster. The ship has a maximum speed of . The ship has four holds, 17 hatches and is equipped with a discharge boom that can swing 105 degrees to either side of the ship and discharges 3,810 tonnes per hour."
"The ship was constructed by Collingwood Shipyards at their yard in Collingwood, Ontario with the yard number 189. ""Algorail"" was launched on 13 December 1967, christened on 1 April 1968 and completed that month. The second freighter of the name was registered at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario for Algoma Central. A self-unloading bulk carrier, she is one of the last lake freighters built in the traditional two-superstructure style, with the bridge at the bow. The ship sails on the North American Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway delivering coal/coke, aggregates, slag, iron ore/oxides, salt, fertilizers, grain products, gypsum, quartzite, or sand."
"On 6 October 1972, ""Algorail"" allided with the pier at Holland, Michigan loaded with a cargo of salt. The pier tore a hole in her bow, which caused the vessel to sink. The ship was refloated, repaired and put back into service. On 20 April 1999, ""Algorail"" ran aground at Green Bay, Wisconsin in the Fox River. The ship was undamaged, but attempts by two tugboats to free the ship damaged the docks at Green Bay. On 25 June 2013 she ran aground with a shipment of salt in the Saginaw River. Zilwaukee Dock Manager Jim Cnudde cited ""Algorail""s running aground as an indication that greater efforts should be made to keep the river dredged. The ship was freed after unloading some of her cargo into a barge."
Hovey was one of a group of Boston businessmen who had provided most of the funding for the American Anti-Slavery Society in the years prior to the American Civil War.
"During and after the war the Hovey fund helped to sustain the Anti-Slavery Society as fund-raising became more difficult and the cost of publishing abolitionist newspapers increased sharply. After slavery in the U.S. was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the fund's continued support assisted the Anti-Slavery Society's campaign for the political rights of the newly freed slaves, playing a crucial role in the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendments, which secured citizenship and voting rights for African Americans."
"A controversy over the fund developed after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified. Hovey's will stipulated that if slavery was abolished before the fund's money was exhausted, the remainder was to be channeled to other specified reform movements, including the women's rights movement. Despite the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, Phillips declared that slavery would not truly be abolished until African Americans secured the right to vote, and he continued to channel much of the fund's money to that cause."
"Leaders of the women's movement were furious at being denied money that rightfully belonged to them, especially when they desperately needed it to finance what they had hoped would be a pivotal campaign in Kansas by the American Equal Rights Association to achieve suffrage for all state citizens regardless of race or sex."

In reality, however, women are still not occupying ""higher economic, professional, political, social, and religious positions"". In relation to the political arena, UN Women reported that a 2012 study made by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being ""103rd out of 189 countries in terms of representation of women in Parliament"". Uruguay low ranking is partly due to its low political participation of women: only 16% of members of Parliament are women as of 2014."
"One prominent Uruguayan woman is Paulina Luisi. Luisi was a leader of the feminist movement in the country of Uruguay. In 1909, she became the first woman in the country to obtain a medical degree and was highly respected. She represented Uruguay in international women's conferences and traveled throughout Europe. She voiced her opinion on women's rights, and in 1919, Paulina started the force for women's rights in Uruguay. By 1922, the Pan-American Conference of Women named Paulina Luisi an honorary vice president of the meeting and she continued to be an activist until Uruguay gave women the right to vote."

"Ziamet was a form of land tenure in Ottoman Empire, consisting in grant of lands or revenues by the Ottoman Sultan to an individual in compensation for his services, especially military services. The ziamet system was introduced by Osman I who granted land tenure to his troops. Later this system was expanded by Murad I for his Sipahi."
"The Saljuq state, prior to the rise of the Ottoman State in the 14th century, utilized ziamets in an effort to implement provincial governors, who were also made subordinate chiefs in the military regime. In this pre-Ottoman period, timars were used with other tactics, such as building caravansaries, in an effort to sedentarize nomadic groups. The Ottoman state later took on this ""timar system"" after conquering Anatolia, and it represented just one of several institutions apparent in the Ottoman Empire derived from the Saljuq state."
"The Ottoman Empire came into disarray due to problems asserting ""central government control"" during the 16th and 17th centuries. They needed a way to reassert their military might. Ziamets of Ottoman cavalry were enlarged and turned over to a smaller number of owners, with a longer tenure. Thus, authority in provincial areas turned to police authority as local administrations dissolved, and ziamets were converted into tax-farms or iqta. This conversion of ziamets into tax-farms proved to be the first step to growing provincial control in the Ottoman Empire, as economic decline in the empire gave these stronger provincial governors the chance to assert power.[3]"
"The ziamet-holder acted as an agent of the central Ottoman government in supervising the possession, transfer, and rental of lands within his territory and collecting tax revenue, in return for military service. A timar was not necessarily made up of contiguous property, but could consist of property scattered among different villages."

= = = Shriek: An Afterword = = =
"Shriek: An Afterword is a fantasy novel by American writer Jeff VanderMeer. Published in 2006, ""Shriek"" is set in the fictional city of Ambergris, a recurring setting in VanderMeer's work. The novel was written over a period of eight years, owing in part to what the author said, ""[some scenes that are] very personal."""
"Ambergris, named for ""the most secret and valued part of the whale"", is a fantastical urban milieu, explicitly modern and apparently pre-industrial (despite the presence of guns, bombs, and motor vehicles). Ambergris is characterized by grocery stores, post offices, cafés, and vendors (The ""Borges Bookstore"" bears note). The city was built over the land (and quiet protests) of the fungally-adept ""graycaps"", humanoids of uncertain disposition. The inhabitants of Ambergris enjoy a fascination with squid, and celebrate an anarchic annual Festival of the Freshwater Squid."
"""Shriek: An Afterword"" deals principally with two eponymous siblings, Janice and Duncan Shriek. Janice, an ex-society figure and art critic, narrates with great and sometimes dark flamboyance. Duncan, a historian of note, entertains twin obsessions: rival historian Mary Sabon and the mysterious graycaps. The Shrieks figure rather prominently in VanderMeer's collection of Ambergris novellas and short stories ""City of Saints and Madmen"": Duncan narrates the novella ""The Early History of Ambergris"", while Janice's art criticism figures into the World Fantasy Award-winning novella ""The Transformation of Martin Lake""."
"Reviewer of ""The Believer"" noted ""It's not clear what obsesses Jeff VanderMeer more, mushrooms or books. Both appear on almost every page of his new novel Shriek: An Afterword, in which disgraced historian Duncan Shriek seeks to uncover the mystery of a race of mushroom people with mysterious fungal plans, who lurk below the surface of the moss-covered city of Ambergris. VanderMeer's previous novels are part of a fantasy subgenre, often categorized as the New Weird. While Shriek certainly contains fantasy elements, it doesn’t fit into any strictly delineated genre. There are more ideas here than flights of fancy; VanderMeer owes more to Borges than Tolkien."""

Stokes still holds UCLA school records for receiving touchdowns in a season (17 in 1993), receiving touchdowns in a career (28), receiving yards in a game (263 vs. USC in 1992) and receptions in a game (14 vs. Wisconsin, 1994 Rose Bowl), among others."
"On October 9, 2009, Stokes was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame."
"Stokes was selected with the first round (tenth overall pick) of the 1995 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, and he played for the 49ers from to . The 49ers traded up 20 spots to the No. 10 pick in the first round of the draft to select Stokes. After a slow start to his rookie season, the former Bruin ultimately netted 38 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was tossed by Jerry Rice."
"During the 1996 season, Stokes suffered a broken hand and missed most of the season, leading to the emergence of the 49ers' third round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, wide receiver Terrell Owens."
"In 1997, with Rice sidelined with a torn ACL, Stokes and Owens formed a formidable duo for quarterback Steve Young, with Stokes hauling in 58 passes for 733 yards and four touchdowns. Once Rice returned, Stokes' production did not falter as he would achieve career highs in receptions (63), yards (770) and touchdowns (eight). Stokes was also the recipient of Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski spitting in his face during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in December 1997."
"Along with the rest of the team, Stokes' production dropped in 1999 as a result of Young's career-ending concussion in a Monday night game in Arizona. Football Outsiders called Stokes ""the league's least valuable receiver"" in 1999."
"The 49ers released him in 2003 and he was initially signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars before going to New England. Stokes was rarely used in the Patriots offense, only contributing 15 catches for 154 yards during the 2003 campaign. New England released him and activated fullback Larry Centers near the end of the season. However, he was re-signed by the Patriots prior to the AFC Championship Game."
"He worked as a radio host for the ESPN radio affiliate based out of Modesto, California. Currently, he works as an analyst for Fox Sports on UCLA's football games and for high school football on the internet in Southern California."

"Lambie was known for his eccentricity, cigar smoking and fondness for pigeons. An occasion when he instructed for a concussed player to be told he was Pelé and sent back onto the pitch is one of the most famous quotes in British football."
"Born in Whitburn, Lambie played for his hometown junior team Whitburn before signing for Falkirk in 1958, where he turned professional and switched position from inside forward to full back. In August 1969 he joined St Johnstone, where he played in the October 1969 Scottish League Cup Final (1–0 loss to Celtic) and took part in the Perth-based club's first European campaign (reaching the third round of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup)."
"After retiring as a player in 1974, Lambie joined the St Johnstone coaching staff, and later moved to Hibernian. He became assistant manager at Hamilton Academical to his former Hibs colleague Bertie Auld, and succeeded him as manager in 1984. He led the ""Accies"" to the First Division title in 1985–86 and won away at Rangers in the next season's Scottish Cup."
"In 1988, Lambie was appointed manager for the first time at Partick Thistle, but a year later returned to Hamilton, before going back to Partick in 1990. He led the ""Jags"" to promotion to the top flight in 1992 and left in 1995 for his former club Falkirk, but quit his post in March 1996. ""The Herald"" wrote in 2002 that ""It is odd how, despite Lambie playing over 200 games for Falkirk, and scoring a decent haul of goals as a defender, he is only remembered for his disastrous managerial reign""."
"Lambie returned for a third spell at Partick in 1999, with the club now in the third tier, and got them into the Scottish Premier League in 2002 via back-to-back promotions. Also in 2002, he guided the club to the Cup semi-finals, where they lost 3–0 to Rangers at Hampden Park. The final stages of the season were chronicled in the BBC Scotland fly on the wall documentary ""Grasping the Thistle"", known for Lambie's use of profanity."
"In January 2003, Lambie announced that he would retire at the end of the season as he did not agree with new regulations in football; he had attempted to sign Nathan Lowndes and Steven Ferguson on loan from English clubs but was barred by FIFA as they had both recently played in Scotland for other teams. On 17 May 2003 he made his farewell in his last game at Firhill Stadium, a 1–0 loss to Dundee United, having already guaranteed survival in the SPL on a considerably lower budget than their competitors. He became a member of the club's board and had a brief fourth spell as manager from December 2004."
"Lambie is remembered for his reaction when Partick player Colin McGlashan suffered a concussion; he ordered his assistant Gerry Collins to ""Tell him he's Pelé and get him back on"". A book of football quotes titled ""Tell Him He's Pelé"" was released in 2010. He is also remembered for taming Chic Charnley, a player sent off 17 times in his career, whom he signed once for Hamilton and three times for Partick."
Lambie was known for his love of pigeon racing and cigars. He spoke of the importance of his Christian faith in his life. He was a member and activist for the Scottish National Party but said that he was not a suitable candidate to seek elected office.
He was awarded the position of Honorary Vice President of Partick Thistle F.C. in August 2006. He was inducted into the Halls of Fame at both Falkirk and Partick Thistle.
"Lambie had three daughters with his wife Mamie, from whom he was separated at the time of his death at the age of 77 on 10 April 2018."
= = = Psyclon Nine = = =
"Psyclon Nine is an American band formed in 2000 in San Francisco, CA, known for their unique blend of electronic, industrial metal and black metal. Originally, Psyclon Nine's music was aggrotech. However, the band has since evolved a more industrial/black metal sound."
"Psyclon Nine's main music contributor is lead vocalist, lyricist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Nero Bellum, who is the only remaining original member. In 2009, Psyclon Nine's fourth album We the Fallen was the band's first and only album to chart on the Billboard Charts."
"Psyclon Nine began in 1999 when roommates, Marshall Goppert and Josef Heresy created an industrial metal music project called ""Defkon Sodomy"", influenced by bands like KMFDM and Ministry. The band only performed under that name twice before changing it to Psyclon Nine. The name was a malapropism of Zyklon B, the trade name of hydrogen cyanide used in the gas chambers during the Holocaust. The “Nine” was used because of the number's significance in Aleister Crowley’s numerological writings. Around this time, Marshall and Josef took on their stage names as Josef Heresy, and Nero Bellum. Nero's name was taken from the Roman Emperor Nero Caesar, and Bellum is Latin for war."
"Bellum met with European NoiTekk record label executive Marco Gruhn at a San Francisco Grendel show, and persuaded him to sign Psyclon Nine. The band's first album Divine Infekt was recorded shortly thereafter, produced and engineered by Da5id Din of Informatik. The title track was remixed by Tactical Sekt and the album was released on September 15th, 2003."
"Psyclon Nine toured lightly on the west coast in the United States and in Europe. They supported acts such as Dismantled, Nocturne, and Martin Atkins."
"Bellum later said in an interview for Vampirefreaks about the Divine Infect remix, ""Tactical Sekt's remix left a bad taste in my mouth"", and attributed that to Anthony Mathers of Tactical Sekt in which his philosophical beliefs made him not want to collaborate with anyone outside of Psyclon Nine again."
"In 2004, Psyclon Nine signed with the American industrial record label Metropolis and returned to Da5id Din's studio for mixing. INRI was released on April 26, 2005 on both Metropolis and NoiTekk Records. The album featured thirteen tracks of dark, aggressive electro focused on religious themes. The album also featured a cover of the Ministry song “You Know What You Are.”"
"In 2005, Nero Bellum met Rotny Ford of the industrial metal band Nocturne on the social networking site LiveJournal. The two discussed musical ideas which led to the band using guitars and drums in their live performances. Ford joined the band on keyboard and guitar."
"Psyclon Nine made several major live appearances following the album's release, including several dates opening for Mindless Self Indulgence. The tour gained the band a fan base. Psyclon Nine returned to Europe for another tour that included a spot on the world's largest Gothic festival, Wave-Gotik-Treffen. It was around this time when drummer Abby Nex, who was also from Nocturne, joined the band as a live drummer."
"At the end of 2005, the band had dropped from their European label NoiTekk and Eric Gottesman quit the band. Gottesman was replaced by members of the industrial rock band Columbine: keyboardist VII and bassist Daniel Columbine."
"With the release of Crwn Thy Frnicatr in 2006, Psyclon Nine began to stray from their early aggrotech sound into a darker black metal / industrial metal approach."
"In late 2006, the band was featured on the cover of the German Gothic magazine Orkus."
"Psyclon Nine went on their first headlining US tour, which eventually led to creative differences between the band and Columbine bassist Daniel. Daniel decided to leave the band at the end of the tour. Abbey Nex replaced him on bass, and Mushroomhead drummer Daniel Fox was used as a live fill-in drummer."
"In early 2007, the band opened for Mushroomhead's 'Savor Sorrow' North American tour which gained the band huge attention among the underground extreme metal / industrial dance scene."
"In May 2007, Psyclon Nine did a European tour that included a spot again at Wave Gotik Treffen. After the European tour, Rotny Ford decided to leave the band for personal reasons."
"In October, the band opened for Mushroomhead again on their second North American tour with Josef on guitar and keys, Abbey on bass, VII on synth, and Daniel on drums."
"In early 2008, the band released its first music video of the fan favorite track 'Parasitic' directed by Mushroomhead's Richard Thomas."
"After the tour with Mushroomhead, Josef Heresy decided to leave the band to go back to college, and VII left to return to his band Columbine. Daniel Fox continued with Mushroomhead. At this time, Nero Bellum decided to move to Los Angeles, CA to begin writing a new album."
"Nero Bellum appeared on the internet channel NoisescapeTV in 2008 and said that he was in the studio working on an album entitled We the Fallen, and has decided to stray away from the harsh EBM music style and incorporate a more black metal meets dark ambient sound."

"Dinaw Mengestu (born 30 June 1978) is an Ethiopian-American novelist and writer. In addition to three novels, he has written for ""Rolling Stone"" on the war in Darfur, and for ""Jane Magazine"" on the conflict in northern Uganda. His writing has also appeared in ""Harper's"", ""The Wall Street Journal"", and numerous other publications. He is the Program Director of Written Arts at Bard College. In 2007 the National Book Foundation named him a ""5 under 35"" honoree. Since his first book was published in 2007, he has received numerous literary awards, and was selected as a MacArthur Fellow in 2012."
"Dinaw Mengestu was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 1978, during a period of political repression that became known as the Red Terror, his father, who was an executive with Ethiopian Airlines, applied for political asylum while on a business trip in Italy; Mengestu's mother was pregnant with him at the time. Two years later, when Mengestu was a toddler, he, his mother and his sister were reunited with his father in the United States. The family settled in Peoria, Illinois, where Mengestu's father at first worked as a factory laborer, before rising to a management position. Later the family moved to the Chicago area, where Mengestu graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois."
"Mengestu received his B.A. in English from Georgetown University, and his MFA in writing from Columbia University in 2005."
"Mengestu's début novel, ""The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears"", was published in the United States in March 2007 by Penguin Riverhead. It was published in the United Kingdom as ""Children of the Revolution"", issued in May 2007 by Jonathan Cape. It tells the story of Sepha Stephanos, who fled the warfare of the Ethiopian Revolution 17 years before and immigrated to the United States. He owns and runs a failing grocery store in Logan Circle, then a poor African-American section of Washington, D.C. that is becoming gentrified. He and two fellow African immigrants, all of them single, deal with feelings of isolation and nostalgia for home. Stephanos becomes involved with a white woman and her daughter, who move into a renovated house in the neighborhood."
"Mengestu's second novel, ""How to Read the Air"", was published in October 2010. Part of the novel was excerpted in the July 12, 2010, issue of ""The New Yorker"", after Mengestu was selected as one of their ""20 under 40"" writers of 2010. This novel was also the winner of the 2011 Ernest J. Gaines Award for Literary Excellence. This literary award was established in 2007 by the Baton Rouge Area Foundation."
Mengestu's first two novels have been translated into more than a dozen languages.

= = = Sphinx (search engine) = = =
Sphinx is a fulltext F/OSS search engine that provides text search functionality to client applications.
"Sphinx can be used either as a stand-alone server or as a storage engine (""SphinxSE"") for the MySQL family of databases."
"When run as a standalone server Sphinx operates similar to a DBMS and can communicate with MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL through their native protocols or with any ODBC-compliant DBMS via ODBC."
"MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is distributed with SphinxSE."
"If Sphinx is run as a stand-alone server, it is possible to use SphinxAPI to connect an application to it. Official implementations of the API are available for PHP, Java, Perl, Ruby and Python languages. Unofficial implementations for other languages, as well as various third party plugins and modules are also available. Other data sources can be indexed via pipe in a custom XML format."
"The Sphinx search daemon supports the MySQL binary network protocol and can be accessed with the regular MySQL API and/or clients. Sphinx supports a subset of SQL known as SphinxQL. It supports standard querying of all index types with SELECT, modifying RealTime indexes with INSERT, REPLACE, and DELETE, and more."
"Sphinx can also provide a special storage engine for MariaDB and MySQL databases. This allows those MySQL, MariaDB to communicate with Sphinx's codice_1 to run queries and obtain results. Sphinx indices are treated like regular SQL tables."
"Sphinx is configured to examine a data set via its Indexer. The Indexer process creates a full-text index (a special data structure that enables quick keyword searches) from the given data/text. Full-text fields are the resulting content that is indexed by Sphinx; they can be (quickly) searched for keywords. Fields are named, and you can limit your searches to a single field (e.g. search through ""title"" only) or a subset of fields (e.g. to ""title"" and ""abstract"" only). Sphinx's index format generally supports up to 256 fields. Note that the original data is not stored in the Sphinx index, but are discarded during the Indexing process; Sphinx assumes that you store those contents elsewhere."
Attributes are additional values associated with each document that can be used to perform additional filtering and sorting during search. Attributes are named. Attribute names are case insensitive. Attributes are not full-text indexed; they are stored in the index as is. Currently supported attribute types are:
(since 1.10-beta);
(since 2.1.1-beta);
"Sphinx, like classic SQL databases, works with a so-called fixed schema, that is, a set of predefined attribute columns. These work well when most of the data stored actually has values: mapping sparse data to static columns can be cumbersome. Assume for example that you’re running a price comparison or an auction site with many different products categories. Some of the attributes like the price or the vendor are identical across all goods. But from there, for laptops, you also need to store the weight, screen size, HDD type, RAM size, etc. And, say, for shovels, you probably want to store the color, the handle length, and so on. So it’s manageable across a single category, but all the distinct fields that you need for all the goods across all the categories are legion. The JSON field can be used to overcome this. Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys which may or may not be present in all documents. When you try to filter on one of these keys, Sphinx will ignore documents that don’t have the key in the JSON attribute and will work only with those documents that have it."

"Muslim Educational Trust (also called MET) is an educational organization offering information, advice and publications about education and the educational needs of children to parents in particular. It is based in London."
"Starting in the 1970s, the Trust has been involved in a movement by British Muslims to include Muslim values in the educational system. A controversial aspect of this was the withdrawal of Muslim children, especially Muslim girls from integrated schools as secular single-sex schooling died out in England. Less controversial were efforts to encourage religious education in Britain to expand beyond the teaching of Islam. The Trust also began supporting efforts to open private Islamic schools in 1974, and by 1992, 23 Islamic schools were open, all supported by the Trust. Important leaders in this movement were Ibrahim Hewitt Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), Afzal Rahman, and Gulam Sarwar. In 1991, Sarwar wrote a book, ""British Muslims and Schools"", which focuses on why such schools should exist and why they should receive public funding like other British schools."
"Human Rights Activist Nuzhat Abbas has criticized MET for supplying literature on sexual education that echos the anti-LGBT views of clerics like Sheikh Sarkawy, formerly of London Central Mosque. Some of this criticism stems from the Trust's publishing of an anti-LGBT views in a book introducing the teachings of the Qur'an by Ibrahim Hewitt entitled, ""What Doe Islam Say?""."

"Kaldor's facts are six statements about economic growth, proposed by Nicholas Kaldor in his article of 1957. He described these as ""a stylised view of the facts"", which coined the term ""stylized fact."""
Nicholas Kaldor summarized the statistical properties of long-term economic growth in an influential 1957 paper. He pointed out the 6 following 'remarkable historical constancies revealed by recent empirical investigations':
"Kaldor did not claim that any of these quantities would be constant at ""all"" times; on the contrary, growth rates and income shares fluctuate strongly over the business cycle. Instead, his claim was that these quantities tend to be constant when averaging the data over long periods of time. His broad generalizations, which were initially derived from U.S. and U.K. data, but were later found to be true for many other countries as well, came to be known as 'stylized facts'."

Dardilly is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in eastern France.
"Its inhabitants are called ""Dardillois"""
"An undulating town to in the western lyonnais, Dardilly is crossed to the east by the A6 autoroute and the RN6 and to the west by the RN7. Marked by a pleasanter, greener and more rural lifestyle, Dardilly's center is only 20 minutes by car from the Lyons peninsula. (By TCL bus: lines 3, 89, and by train, from the Saint-Paul suburb, - Lozanne)."
"Dardilly, with its , includes three valleys oriented north south: the valley of ruisseau de la Beffe to the west, the valley of the ruisseau des Planches and the valley of the ruisseau de Serres to the east. Its altitude varies between 260 and 390 metres, allowing exceptional views over the , the Monts du Lyonnais and even on clear days the Alps, from Vercors to Mont Blanc."
"The Town also possesses 1.73 km of leafy forests of ones and of farmland. Many paths for walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers criss-cross these spaces:"
Bordering communes include:
"The name Dardilly may originate from the Gallo-Roman name Dardiliacus, if the town was founded in that period, but there is no historic proof for this hypothesis, although the remains of an aqueduct built by Claudius to bring the waters of the Brévenne River (a tributary of the Azergues, itself a tributary of the Saône) to Lyon have been found nearby. More likely, the name Dardilly originated at the time of its first surviving mention, in the 10th century cartulary of Ainay Abbey, which possessed several lands here."
"In the Middle Ages, the village, constructed on a mound, was made up of a church dedicated to Saint Pancras, an adjacent cemetery and about twenty houses. In 1210, at the time of the feudal wars, the Count of Beaujeu tried to seize the city of Lyon and its then archbishop, Renaud II de Forez, fortified Dardilly as part of his defence of Lyon by building a wall and ditch around the existing settlement."
"In the time of Jean-Marie Vianney - the late 18th and early to middle 19th centuries - Dardilly was an agricultural and wine-growing town, with some beautiful houses built by wealthy people from Lyons who spent the summer months here. The population was about 1500 inhabitants. At the end of the 19th century the vines were ravaged by phylloxera and many of the town's inhabitants left for Lyons to find work, bringing the population down to 982 in 1911. The vine-growers that remained went over to growing fruit."
In 1986 Pope John-Paul II visited Dardilly to see Vianney's birthplace on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth.
"The active population of Dardilly is 3546. Out of the employed residents of the commune, 25.6% work in Dardilly, 17.4% work in another TECHLID (Technopole économique de l'Ouest Lyonnais - Technopolis of West Lyonnais) commune, 52.3% work in another (non-TECHLID) commune within the département and 4.7% work outside the département."
Dardilly has several social action groups :
"The town had 1,700 buildings in 1982, compared to 2 821 buildings in 2005. Even though the town's buildings have remained very residential, with a majority being individually owned houses, many of its buildings are social housing."
"The 2 churches, Saint Jean-Marie Vianney et Saint Claude, make up the Catholic parish of Dardilly."
